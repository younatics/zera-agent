"Two men escaped certain death this morning after crashing into the barrier on a bridge, leaving them teetering 50ft above a busy motorway. It is believed the driver skidded on a wet section of the M25 ,at J5, near Sevenoaks, before his vehicle became wedged on the barrier. Half of the Renault remained on the motorway, while the other half dangled over the M26 below. Two men were lucky to survive today after crashing into a barrier on a motorway over bridge on the M25, leaving the car teetering 50ft over the M26 below . The car smashed through the barrier, but one of the railings wedged under the rare axle and above the front wheel, which stopped it from falling onto the M26 . Police said the men suffered only 'cuts and bruises' in the accident which caused parts of the motorway, and parts of the M26 east-bound, to be closed. The crash caused large tailbacks as officers at the Highway Agency removed the car and carried out emergency repairs on the barrier. The Kent Road Policing unit later used the accident as an example of what can happen in wet conditions. In this Highway Agency still, the car can be seen straddling the barrier as rescuers, left, go to their aid . Highway Agency staff cleared the car from the scene and emergency repairs were made to the barrier . They tweeted: 'Crash from M25 Jct 5 earlier this morning. Car nearly fell down onto M26 below. 'Two occupants received cuts and bruises only. Please remember this as the danger of driving on a wet road.'","The driver skidded in wet conditions and crashed into a barrier on the M25 .

"Moors Murderer Ian Brady has written a letter from his hospital bed describing how he believes he will die soon - but wishes he had killed himself years ago. The notorious 77-year-old wrote the 750 word letter  from his bed at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside. Known as the Moors murderer, Brady tortured and killed five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley, . Ian Brady (pictured left) tortured and killed five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) during the 1960s. He has written a letter complaining of his ill health and says he wishes he had killed himself years ago . Along with Hindley – who died in prison aged 60 in 2002 – Brady murdered Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965. Victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. In his most recent letter, Brady still expresses no remorse for his sickening killings. Instead he complains he is 'still bedridden and worsening' after breaking his hip and arm in fall a year ago. He wrote: 'This cell block is described as a ""discharge ward""; I've been sitting here 30 years... and there's no turnaround of inmates unless in a coffin. 'So it's more accurately a blocked sewer-pipe!' The notorious killer wrote the 750 word letter from his bed at Ashworth psychiatric hospital in Merseyside . Brady also suggests he wishes he had taken his own life years ago. He writes: 'Had I divined the future of spending half a century in prison and the final fifteen years being force-fed by nasal tube in an unmonitored zoological cesspit of regression, I would've exited decades ago.' The letter to Channel 5 News correspondent Julian Druker was written before Christmas. Terry Kilbride, whose 12 year-old brother John was snatched and murdered by Brady in November 1963, has slammed Brady's correspondence as 'crafty'.

Two of the victims were discovered in graves on the Moor, with a third grave discovered there in 1987, over 20 years after their 1966 trial . Mr Kilbride from Ashton-under-Lyne, said: 'This letter coming through  about him not being so well and ""I'm dying, I'm on my deathbed"" and all this, it's just another ploy to get people to think ""do we feel sorry for him?"". 'Like hell they do.' Forensic psychologist Dr Chris Cowley, who has met Brady numerous times, believes the killer may be feeling ignored by the public. Dr Cowley said: 'Brady's a very egocentric person. 'He likes being in the limelight. I think probably at this point in time he's a little bit frightened that people aren't remembering him and people have maybe forgotten about him.' Taxpayers have forked out more than £14 million on Brady since he was convicted nearly 50 years ago. The Moors murderer has racked up the costs of his keep by staging a 15-year hunger strike and a series of failed legal challenges - for which he has relied on legal aid. Relatives of the five children murdered by Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s have said the money would be better spent tracing the remains of victim Keith Bennett, the location of which Brady refuses to reveal.

"The 29-year-old terminal cancer sufferer who plans to take her life on November 1 has ticked visiting the Grand Canyon off her bucket list. Newlywed Brittany Maynard, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor less than a year ago, said in a video announcing her decision last month that she hoped to see the Grand Canyon before she died. On Friday, she revealed on her website that she had managed to travel from her home in Oregon to Arizona with her husband, mother and stepfather 'thanks to the kindness of Americans around the country who came forward to make my ""bucket list"" dream come true'. Scroll down for video . Dream trip: Brittany Maynard, a 29-year-old cancer sufferer who will end her life on November 1, is pictured with her husband Dan at the Grand Canyon - a trip she had hoped to take before her death . Happy memories: Maynard, second right, and her husband were joined by her mother and stepfather . 'The Canyon was breathtakingly beautiful, and I was able to enjoy my time with the two things I love most: my family and nature,' she wrote. Images taken at the Canyon show her kissing her husband, Dan, and embracing her mother and stepfather, grins across their faces. But just a day after the experience, she suffered her 'worst seizure thus far', which left her temporarily paralyzed and tired for the rest of the day. 'The seizure was a harsh reminder that my symptoms continue to worsen as the tumor runs its course,' she wrote. Final days together: Maynard, who is an only child, is pictured with her mother, Deborah Ziegler, on the trip . Campaign: Maynard is pictured in a still from a video she released last month explaining why she wanted to take her life and calling for more states to implement a 'Death with Dignity Act', like Oregon . She finished the post by saying she found meaning in her battle for other states to implement right-to-die laws, as Oregon and four other state already have. 'My dream is that every terminally ill American has access to the choice to die on their own terms with dignity,' she wrote. 'Please take an active role to make this a reality.' Maynard gained nationwide attention after she shared a heart-wrenching video that explained  why she was choosing to end her life at age 29 - while campaigning to expand right-to-die laws. Debilitating: A scan shows the Glioblastoma multiforme that would claim her life slowly within 14 months . She explained that, after suffering intense headaches, she was diagnosed with a brain tumor in January and was initially given 10 years to live, which she said was devastating. But in a scan a few months later, doctors told her the cancer had progressed to Glioblastoma multiforme - an aggressive tumor. Sufferers have a life expectancy of around 14 months. Brittany Maynard launched an online video campaign for Compassion & Choices, an end-of-life non-profit organization, to promote death-with-dignity laws, which currently exist in only five states. Washington, Oregon, Montana, Vermont and New Mexico  allow people to die on their own terms, but Maynard says it is not enough. ‘Right now it's a choice that's only available to some Americans, which is really unethical,’ she said. Working through her foundation, The Brittany Fund, Maynard wants other states, like California, New Jersey and Colorado, to consider passing laws that would allow people to make the ultimate choice - life or death. Since Oregon lawmakers passed the Death with Dignity Act in 1997, more than 1,170 people have obtained prescriptions under the law, and fewer than half of them used them to end their lives. When she learned that she would die painfully and slowly, she decided to move from her home in California to Oregon, which has a 'Death with Dignity Act'. She qualified for the medication, which she already has. She plans to take it on November 1 because she wants to celebrate her husband's birthday, which falls on October 30, for the last time. She hopes to be surrounded by her husband, mother, stepfather and best friend. After releasing her video, critics lambasted her as selfish, but in an interview with CBS she said she was suffered immense pain - and wished she didn't have to be making the decision. Maynard said her biggest regret is that she will never get to have a family. 'I'd say most of my sadness centers around how much I wanted a family,' Maynard told CBS This Morning. 'And it feels like for me, that was always, like, how you created a legacy was, like, through your children. And sort of inadvertently -- through sharing my story, I've realized there's a bit of the legacy I'm creating this way and I'm not ashamed of that. I'm not ashamed to attach my name to what I think is a right that should belong to all terminally ill Americans.' Time cut short: She is pictured with her husband, Dan. He said he is devastated he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, but understands she wants quality of life over quantity . The couple on their wedding day a year ago. Dan spoke of how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married . 'I don't want to die,' Maynard explained. 'If anyone wants to hand me, like, a magical cure and save my life so that I can have children with my husband, you know, I will take them up on it.' She also has made a deal with her mother, Debbie, that if she travels to Machu Pichu in Peru after her passing, Brittany’s spirit will meet her up there among the breathtaking Inca ruins. In the same interview, Debbie, who raised Maynard on her own, talks about the discussion she had about her daughter when she learned of her decision. 'Early on, I told her, ""It would be my honor to take care of you, whichever way; if you need to be fed or diapered, it would be my honor,""' she said. 'And that was important for me, for her to know.' Maynard's husband, Dan Diaz, also spoke about how sad he is that he will not get to spend the rest of his life with the woman he married little over a year ago. 'That was the original plan, right?' he said. 'But the reality that, I guess, that feeds into the argument of quality of life versus just quantity.'

"There was late drama at the Riverside Stadium as Rudy Gestede struck deep in injury-time to extend Blackburn Rovers' unbeaten run at Middlesbrough. Patrick Bamford looked to have won it for Boro with seven minutes remaining when he finally found a way to beat Rovers' brilliant goalkeeper Simon Eastwood. But then Gestede was on hand to power in a controversial equaliser when Dimi Konstantopoulos was left floored on the ground when he went up for a cross in to his area. Rudy Gestede holds his arms aloft and celebrates his 95th-minute equaliser for Blackburn Rovers . Patrick Bamford (second left) scores for Middlesbrough with a strike from just inside the area . Referee Mark Clattenburg was booed off at the final whistle by the home fans and Middlesbrough manager Aitor Karanka was sent to the stands after his complaints. But Blackburn returned to Lancashire with a point to prevent Middlesbrough from climbing into the top two. Middlesbrough, who slipped down to fourth before kick-off because of Ipswich's win at Charlton, knew that they would have to stop one of the Championship's other form teams if they were to stand any chance of climbing in to the top two. Rovers, unbeaten in their previous eight matches, had to make two changes to the side which defeated Leeds. The most notable was Eastwood's first start in goal since January because Jason Steele, on loan from Middlesbrough, was ineligible to face his parent club. Daniel Ayala sports a red bandage after a clash of heads during the draw at the Riverside . Former Middlesbrough favourite Juninho was presented to the crowd before the match at the Riverside . And he was soon called into action when he had to race out of his area to head clear a dangerous long ball. While the danger soon disappeared that time, he had to make a strong save to his right shortly after when Grant Leadbitter drove powerfully at goal following a probing Lee Tomlin run. After consecutive draws, Middlesbrough were looking to return to winning ways and started brightly. They were unfortunate not to have a half-time lead and Jelle Vossen thought he had delivered exactly that. When Bamford's curling effort from 20 yards was spilled by Eastwood in the six-yard box, Vossen pounced to lift the rebound up over the keeper but as the ball headed for the line it was hooked clear by Shane Duffy. Winger Albert Adomah then shot narrowly wide of the upright. Blackburn struggled to get out of their own half and Middlesbrough passed the ball around the green shirts confidently, with Karanka's men regularly creating chances but failing to convert so the visitors remained in contention for something. Gestede (third right) had a header earlier in the match saved . Such was Middlesbrough's dominance in the first half, it was hard to believe that Blackburn were still level after the home side had mustered up an impressive 12 shots in the opening period alone. Rovers boss Gary Bowyer needed to find a way of getting his forwards more involved after the restart, with neither Jordan Rhodes nor Rudy Gestede touching the ball anywhere near as much he would have liked. But the second half continued in the same way, with Blackburn happy to allow Middlesbrough to have possession and look for a counter-attack - and the ploy almost worked. Seconds after Eastwood had denied Bamford at one end, Blackburn broke down the other end and Dimi Konstantopoulos was forced to make his first real save when he dived to his left to parry Markus Olsson's well-driven effort. Premier League official Mark Clattenburg refereed the game at the Riverside Stadium . The best save of the lot, though, belonged to Eastwood. The Riverside was left stunned when he somehow scurried across his line, dived left to turn behind a free header from Vossen which was destined for the net following a lovely George Friend delivery. There was also a save to deny Emilio Nsue's back post volley and then from Tomlin but, finally, Middlesbrough got the break they needed. A failure to deal with a corner saw a half clearance drop invitingly for Bamford to power towards goal. It was helped on its way by a deflection, and Eastwood was finally beaten. Blackburn, however, battled back and Gestede - sporting a nasty bump on his head after an earlier clash - hit the equaliser when Konstantopoulos did not deal with the ball in to his box late on.","On-loan Chelsea midfielder Patrick Bamford scored for Middlesbrough .

"A German academic has unearthed evidence showing former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once discussed a coup with disgruntled Nazis to overthrow the West German government in the 1970s. Kissinger and Richard Nixon were aggrieved at the left-leaning government of the day's burgeoning friendship with the hardline East German government. Kissinger became the contact man for a secret spy network made up of old Nazis and elite aristocrats aimed at torpedoing the plans formulated by Chancellor Willy Brandt. Secret: Henry Kissinger in the 1970s in his White House office in Washington. He gave advice to a secret network made up of old Nazis and elite aristocrats . By the end of 1970, Kissinger was offering the spies advice on how to deal with Brandt's Social Democratic government. The group he became embroiled with . was called 'The Little Service' and was formed by the conservative . Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was allied with Bavaria's . Christian Social Union. One agent who visited Kissinger quoted . him saying, 'It might be possible to overthrow the current government, . but it remains to be seen whether this would involve risks which could . put a Christian Democratic Union (CDU)/ Christian Social Union (CSU) government in great difficulty. Whether Kissinger, the architect of . the disastrous secret bombing of Cambodia in the Vietnam War which paved . the way for the Khmer Rouge regime and its hideous genocide programme, . approved of the plan to usurp the elected government of the day is . unclear. Revealed: Kissinger even discussed the possibility of a coup to overthrow the government of Chancellor Willy Brandt . The group he became embroiled with was called 'The Little Service' and was formed by the conservative CDU party. Brandt pursued a policy of engagement . with the German Democratic Republic, convinced it was better to build . bridges with the dictatorship to defuse Cold War tensions rather than . always being at loggerheads. For the all-white, all male conservatives . of the CDU, this was too much. They wanted West Germany to face off . against the Soviet-backed regime in the belief that isolation would make . it crumble. It was out of this belief that its private spy . organisation, made up of many former Gestapo and SS men as well as . titled barons and counts, was formed. Political scientist Stefanie Waske . spent seven years researching letters from politicians from the . Christian Democratic Union and its Bavarian sister party the Christian . Social Union, and her results are to be published next year; potentially . embarrassing timing for Chancellor Angela Merkel who in November 2013 . will seek re-election as CDU chancellor for the third time. Waske approached Kissinger for . comment but he refused, as did many of the noblemen who worked for the . The Little Service which came into being in 1969 after the party lost . its first general election since the postwar republic was formed in . 1949. Details of her research are published in the current edition of . the German intellectual weekly Die Zeit. The catalyst for the spy group was . Brandt's decision to recognise post-WW2 borders dividing Germany and a . pledge Brandt gave that his state would not use violence against the . Communist one in the east. Conservative MP Karl Theodor Freiherr . zu Guttenberg, who was the grandfather of the disgraced former defence . minister who had to resign last year after it was discovered he cheated . on his doctorate, held a meeting in the autumn of 1969 with former . chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger and leading CDU and CSU politicians, the . CSU being the Bavarian wing of the party. 'They decided to form an information service for the opposition,' said Waske. 'It was a secret spy service.' Beliefs: The Berlin wall. The catalyst was Brandt's decision to recognise post-WW2 borders dividing Germany and a pledge Brandt gave that his state would not use violence against the Communist one in the east . The former head of the BND, Germany's . domestic intelligence agency, was tapped and he offered up a ready-made . web of informants across the globe in countries as far apart as the US, . France and Saudi Arabia. Hans Christoph von Stauffenberg, the . cousin of the man who tried and failed to kill Hitler in the July 1944 . bomb plot, was chosen to head the network. Casimir Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein, . who would later only narrowly miss imprisonment for the CDU's party . donation scandal of a decade ago, was recruited to raise the hundreds of . thousands of D-marks necessary to fund the network. He collected from conservatives in . industry, many of whom had previously supported Hitler, and who now . viewed with suspicion the apparent coziness developing between Brandt . and the Communists. The first act was to open a secret . 'back channel' to Kissinger who was keen to know what the Soviets were . up to at all times, including their puppets in East Berlin. The treasurer of the group was Alfred Seidl, a former Nazi who acted as the chief defence lawyer for Hitler deputy Rudolf Hess. 'In 1971 Brandt was talking about the . administration of Berlin with Leonid Brezhnev in Yalta and . Stauffenberg’s informants were delivering secret information to the . conservatives who were discussing it with Kissinger,' said Waske. The intelligence gleaned came from . eavesdropping, intercepted mail, informers and telephone taps. The . Little Service ran for a decade, lavishly funded and with probably more . success than the state intelligence agencies which were riddled with . East German moles. It was Helmut Kohl, who came to power . in 1982, who disbanded the network. It was Kohl who promoted Angela . Merkel - who grew up in East Germany - to become the party leader: now . she will have serious political bullets to dodge about her party's murky . past before polling day next year.

"Collusion between the Government and the multinational firms behind genetically modified food is revealed in official documents. Emails between civil servants and the GM industry shows how the two worked together on a media strategy to win over consumers sceptical about so-called Frankenstein Food. One official even asked lobbyists for ‘eye-catching themes’ for ministers. Write caption here . The contacts were part of a wider strategy designed to relax European regulations on growing the controversial crops and spend millions of taxpayers’ money on GM research in British fields. At one stage the pro-GM partnership between the industry and Whitehall involved creating a blacklist of journalists who had written negative stories about the technology. Details of the emails have been made public after Freedom of Information requests by lobby group GeneWatch, which said the public would be shocked at the level of collaboration. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has pushed for faster approval of new crops and lobbying for public support. Significantly, he decided to lobby the EU to allow biotech crops to be planted in Britain even if they are banned elsewhere. And Science Minister David Willetts has implemented a pro-GM ‘Agri-tech’ strategy, which involves spending public money on developing new crops. Such support from two key government figures represents a coup for the GM industry and follows a meeting with ministers and researchers in 2012 which came up with a series of ‘to do’ lists. The email . exchanges show the Agriculture and Biotechnology Council (ABC) – . financed by GM firms such as Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer CropScience – . has been at the heart of developing government policy. Often . these exchanges coincided with major announcements by ministers which . shifted Government policy to support GM, despite clear opposition among . consumers. Civil servants hosted a meeting with industry leaders in June 2013 to decide how to present the Government’s Agri-tech strategy. Officials at the Business, Innovations and Skills (BIS) department emailed the ABC asking for advice on how to promote the policy. One BIS official asked for ‘any ideas you may have that will showcase Agri-tech – as you are aware it will need to be eye-catching but reflect the main themes of the strategy’. BIS created a list of journalists and influential people who should be targeted with information about the new strategy and asked the ABC if it wanted to add any names or flag up ‘potential pitfalls’. The ABC responded by adding some names, but it also highlighted a number of people on the list who had been critical of GM. The ABC official wrote that he or she had ‘highlighted in red the journalists who have been negative towards biotech in the past... just so you are aware’. The names have been obscured, so it is impossible to know who was on the blacklist created by the ABC. GeneWatch director Dr Helen Wallace said: ‘These documents expose government collusion with the GM industry to agree PR messages and blacklist critical journalists.’ A government spokesman said the ABC and the GM industry were among a wide range of groups it consults. It confirmed that a list of journalists who had written negatively about GM was created, but said they had not been excluded when details of the Agri-tech strategy were launched and there was no ‘blacklist’.","Contacts were part of strategy to relax regulations on controversial crops .

"When the leader of a Cuban spy ring serving life in a California federal prison was released by the US and met by his emotional wife at Havana airport there was one major question - how was she heavily pregnant? Speculation about the baby's paternity was rife - some people even questioned whether Gerardo Hernandez had been allowed a secret conjugal meeting with his wife Adriana Perez - even she was banned from visits because she worked for the Cuban Intelligence Directorate . But it has now been revealed that Perez in fact became pregnant through artificial insemination. The deal was brokered by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt, in exchange for better conditions for Alan Gross, the U.S. contractor imprisoned in Cuba, who released last week. Gerardo Hernandez, the leader of a Cuban spy ring who was serving life in a California federal prison,  rubs his wife's bump at the weekend (both pictured) in Havana. It has now been revealed that Perez in fact became pregnant through artificial insemination . Adriana Perez, left, wipes away tears at her husband Gerardo Hernandez, right, member of 'The Cuban Five,' during a concert of singer Silvio Rodriguez in Havana, Cuba . Alan Gross greets Patrick Leahy, (D-VT) at an airport near Havana, Cuba. The insemination deal was brokered by Leahy in exchange for better conditions for Gross, the U.S. contractor imprisoned in Cuba . Today it was revealed that in February 2014, Leahy traveled to Cuba to help improve relations. Hernandez's wife found out and asked to meet with Leahy - she asked for a chance to have a  child with her prisoner husband who had been in prison since 2001. 'The expectation was that this man would die in prison. This was her only chance of having a child,' Tim Rieser, an aide to Leahy told CNN. 'She was probably 42 or 43 and she had no expectation her husband was ever getting out prison - he was serving two consecutive life sentences - and she was desperate to have a child, knowing she was almost out of time,' Tim Rieser, an aide to Leahy told NBC. When Gerardo Hernandez was met by his wife last week at Havana's Jose Marti International Airport onlookers were puzzled about why she was heavily pregnant . Cuba paid for Hernandez's sperm to be collected and then flown to Cuba for the procedure- it worked the second time . From left to right: Fernando Gonzalez, Rene Gonzalez, Ramon Labaoino, Antonio Guerrero and Gerardo Hernandez, the Cuban agents of the group of 'The Five', and Gerardo's wife Adriana Perez . Conjugal meetings were not on the cards, but Leahy worked with the State Department and the Bureau of Prisons to facilitate artificial insemination in return for better conditions for Alan Gross. 'They understood that the Senator's purpose was purely humanitarian,' Rieser said of administration officials who helped to NBC. Cuba paid for Hernandez's sperm to be collected and flown out of the country to Cuba. All of this happened as both countries refused to admit that they were even holding negotiations, . The first attempt failed, but Perez became pregnant on the second try - the girl is due to arrive nexr month and they will name her Gema. But even after Perez showed up at the airport, heavily pregnant, Hernandez was coy. CNN reports he told a government-run television channel: 'Everyone's asking, and we have had a lot of fun with the comments and speculations. 'The reality is it had to be kept quiet. We can't give a lot of details, because we don't want to hurt people who meant well.' 'To me, it's incredible,' said Maggie Khuly, (left) sister of Armando Alejandre Jr who died in 1996 shootdown .'I no longer know what to think of my government. People in Cuban jails are not allowed visits, are in horrible conditions, and here we are going way overboard so that this guy has a child? It doesn't make any sense' 'One of the first things accomplished by this process was this,' Hernandez said, gesturing to his Perez's stomach. 'I had to do it by 'remote control,' but everything turned out well.' Hernandez,  was one of the 'Five Heroes,' as they are known in Cuba - they are fixtures in state media and their faces grace billboards across the island. Schoolchildren are taught their names and take part in public acts demanding their release. However the five are reviled as spies by many exiles in South Florida. Hernandez, had been serving two life sentences plus 15 years on a murder conspiracy conviction stemming from the Cuban air force's 1996 shoot-down of two planes flown by Brothers to the Rescue, an exile organization that sought to aid migrants at sea and also dropped propaganda leaflets. Hernandez was convicted of providing Cuban authorities with information about the flight, which he has always denied, maintaining it was public knowledge. The sister of one of the four men killed in the shootdown blasted the news to NBC. 'To me, it's incredible,' said Maggie Khuly, sister of Armando Alejandre Jr. 'I no longer know what to think of my government. People in Cuban jails are not allowed visits, are in horrible conditions, and here we are going way overboard so that this guy has a child? It doesn't make any sense.' The news of Hernandez's release had already caused fury. Marlene Alejandre Triana, whose father Armando Alejandre Jr. was killed, said: 'My three daughters will never meet my father,' said Triana, whose father came to the U.S. as a child and volunteered for the Marines when he turned 18. 'For the only person that we had responsible for what happened to be let go, it's a slap in the face to my dad,' she said during a news conference in Coral Gables. In 2001 a US court ruled prisoners can send their semen to artificially inseminate their wives. In 1999, William Reno Gerber sued the California Department of Corrections - he claimed claimed his civil rights were violated when prison officials refused to let him send a semen specimen to a Chicago medical center to artificially inseminate his wife. But, Gerber, 41, who is serving a prison sentence of 111 years, was eventually allowed to send the sample to his 46-year-old wife.","Hernandez's sperm was collected in US and flown to Cuba - Cubans paid .

"Google engineering director and futurist Ray Kurzweil believes we are close to realizing everlasting life and is dead-set on getting us there. The inventor and noted author believes the key to such a scientific breakthrough is a system of 'bridges' that enable the body to move from strength to strength over time. The youthful 65-year-old currently takes 150 supplements a day, which he argues if the first bridge. The idea is to build enough bridges to ensure the body holds out long enough for life-lengthening technology to come into its own. He has likened the biology of the body to computer software and believes we are all 'out of date'. Key to the fountain of youth:  Ray Kurzweil, futurist and Google engineering director, says the biology of the body is much like computer software and that we are in need of of an upgrade. The hope is to go along enough 'bridges', or stages, to reach the point where life-lengthening technology is at its greatest . Bridge number one: Staying as healthy as possible. Ray Kurzweil currently takes 150 supplements a day to keep his body at its peak . In an interview with Canadian magazine Maclean's, Kurzweil says he hopes the supplements will keep him healthy enough to reach the 'nanotech revolution'. 'I can never say, “I’ve done it, I’ve lived forever,” because it’s never forever,' he said. 'We’re really talking about being on a path that will get us to the next point. 'Bridge one: Stay as healthy as possible with diet and exercise and current medicine. 'The goal is to get to bridge two. 'Bridge two (is) the biotechnology revolution, where we can reprogram biology away from disease. 'And that is not the end-all either. 'Bridge three is to go beyond biology, to the nanotechnology revolution. 'At that point we can have little robots, sometimes called nanobots, that augment your immune system. 'We can create an immune system that recognizes all disease, and if a new disease emerged, it could be reprogrammed to deal with new pathogens.' Such robots, according to Kurzweil, will help fight diseases, improve health and allow people to remain active for longer. Genius: Ray Kurzweil is considered a revolutionary in his field and is currently working on Artificial Intelligence . 'Biology is a software process,' Kurzweil told Maclean's. 'Our bodies are made up of trillions of cells, each governed by this process. 'You and I are walking around with outdated software running in our bodies, which evolved in a very different era. 'We each have a fat insulin receptor gene that says, “Hold on to every calorie”. 'That was a very good idea 10,000 years ago, when you worked all day to get a few calories; there were no refrigerators, so you stored them in your fat cells. 'I would like to tell my fat insulin receptor gene, “You don’t need to do that anymore,”.' Kurzweil referenced a lab mice experiment at the Joslin Diabetes Center, which managed to turn off the mice's fat insulin receptor gene. The mice continued to eat, remained slim, did not get diabetes or heart disease and lived 20 per cent longer. Google is hoping to help expand the human lifespan with its new company Calico, which aims to make improvements in human health and well-being. Kurzweil has previously predicted that by the late 2020s humans will be able to eat as much junk food as they want because everyone will have a nanobot injected into their bodies that will provide all the necessary nutrients while simultaneously eliminating fat. Kurzweil is current work towards building smarter computers is being seen as the first step towards developing such technology. His goal is to improve the natural language processing skills in computers that will allow robots to read, consume and understand human communication. Kurzweil believes creating intelligent robots is key to human evolution. Leading the way: Google is hoping to help expand the human lifespan with its new company Calico, which aims to make improvements in human health and well-being.","Futurist Ray Kurzweil explains the biology of the body is like computer software that needs upgrading .

"A NYU student has miraculously survived falling ten stories and being trapped between two New York buildings for over 24 hours. Asher Vongtau, 19, is in a serious condition in hospital after emergency workers freed him from a tight space between a parking garage and the NYU dorm building at 80 Lafayette St, Chinatown, in lower Manhattan. It is not known how he came to fall, however fire officials said the only way into the crawl space was from above. Rescuers believe the narrow walls of the air shaft where Vongtau fell broke the fall. Vongtau, originally from Pittsburgh, was wedged in a space that was just a foot and a half wide. Amazingly, he was conscious and talking when paramedics got to him, according to New York Daily News. Investigators will now look into reports as to whether a false fire alarm was linked to the fall, with the student last seen 'frantically running to the roof' during an evacuation.

Friends report that he had been missing since Saturday. Michael Yablon, 19, said he last saw Vongtau at 7am that day. 'I was one of the last ones to see him,' Yablon told New York Daily News. 'He left my room at 7am Saturday. 'I texted him later that day but he never responded.' Serious: Asher Vongtau is currently seeking treatment in Bellevue Hospital following his dramatic ordeal . Scene: The NYU dorm building at 80 Lafayette St, Chinatown . This picture of Asher Vongtau, from Facebook, is believed to have been taken inside the NYU dorms . A public safety officer discovered Vongtau after he was reported missing by other students. CBS New York said a campus officer found his cellphone on the building's roof. He was last seen frantically running up a stairwell after a false fire alarm had been triggered. 'I saw him frantically running up the stairs while people were exiting . the building because the fire alarm had been pulled,' said fellow student Colin Chenel. There were other reports that people heard screaming coming from the lower levels of the dorm. It took rescue workers 1 1/2 hours to remove him. They had to break through a nearby wall. A breathing apparatus was lowered down to Vongtau while the rescue effort got underway. Vongtau is now seeking treatment at Bellevue Hospital. The extent of his injuries have not yet been released . An investigation will be opened to determine how he fell. Students reported that a fire alarm went off on Saturday morning, speculating Vongtau may have gone to the roof to escape.","Asher Vongtau, 19, from Pittsburg, was last seen inside the NYU dorms in Chinatown on Saturday morning .

"The rise of do-it-yourself porn is devastating the mainstream industry as increasing numbers of 'amateurs' use the internet to upload homemade sex videos. Traditional porn stars are being replaced by everyday people who upload porn to sites like Reddit or build up a fan following through live web cam sites such as Chaturbate. The growth is concerning the mainstream porn industry, which has seen a huge decline in profits. Sites such as Chaturbate (pictured) allow 'amateurs' to post explicit images and videos . In the past porn stars such as Linda Lovelace were as famous as actors and musicians but there are few household names now. Instead, DIY porn is increasingly popular and people can upload pictures or video of themselves on a whim - and with a good chance of anonymity if they want it. Performances are also almost totally unregulated, especially if the performance if live. In 1998, a study by Forrester Research . on the porn industry - including paraphernalia, internet, cable . television and magazines - estimated it was worth up to $10billion. This year, the worldwide industry is . estimated to be worth up to $5billion - however, it is difficult to know . how accurate these figures are. The mainstream industry has been hit not only through piracy and free content, but people choosing to pay to watch live sex acts over the internet. The porn industry once had household names such as Linda Lovelace, star of Deep Throat (right), who was so famous a movie (left) has been made about her life . Increasing numbers of 'regular' people are treating web cam porn - or 'camming' - as their main job and . believe it brings less stigma than being unemployed. 'Joshua' told Kernel Mag that his job allows him to earn money while he stays at home caring for his six-year-old daughter while his wife works. He admits he does worry that being paid to perform sex acts and strip over a web camera will impact on his wife and daughter. But he added: 'But there’s such a stigma around the long-term unemployed now that I’m not sure it could be much worse.' Sites like Chaturbate emulate traditional strip clubs where viewers 'tip' the performers. As in strip clubs, people can pay for private performances. It is also possible to interact with the performers through the web cam. Users of Reddit say they not only post pictures for money or notoriety but to give themselves a confidence boost . Webcams have allowed people to become porn stars in their own home . 'Joshua' said he can receive tips of up to $100 a time. But the real change in pornography is the number of people who are doing it for no payment at all. So-called tube sites - that imitate YouTube and allow anyone to upload content - have doubled in a year to 1,000. She told Kernal Mag the positive reaction was 'totally overwhelming' and that she would post further pictures if she needed a confidence boost. Users can rate the content and the more positive the reaction, the more prominent it is displayed on the site. She said: 'I’d like to do it again. People on reddit said I have to show more flesh to make my posts successful, though. I’ll probably do it when I need a pick-me-up.' Mainstream porn companies are worried about the rise of amateur porn. USA Today reported that DVD orders from distributers have shrunk this year to about 1,500 from 5,00 to 6,000 in 2005. Steven Hirsch, who founded porn company Vivid Entertainment, told the newspaper: 'We're dealing with a perfect storm: decliing DVD sales, rampant piracy, free content and a weak economy.' Piracy, as in the film and music industries, is causing huge problems for mainstream porn companies. Kathee Brewer, an editor at AVN, which covers the porn industry, told USA Today:'The tubes are making money off the studio's investment of time and money, while the studios are forced to spend ever larger chunks tof change to police the tubes and send endless takedown notices.'","Sites Chaturbate and Reddit allow normal people to upload sex videos .

"iPhone trolls are using AirDrop to send images of a Space Sloth to strangers  around the world . A photograph of a sloth in a spacesuit is being sent to unsuspecting iPhone users by pranksters who are exploiting a security loophole in Apple's AirDrop service. Owners of Apple's iPhone who have upgraded to its latest iOS 8 software have reported receiving the photograph, known as 'Astronaut Slot or 'Space Sloth'. A photographer and writer based in San Francisco is thought to have been the first to have used this to send unsolicited pictures of the Astronaut sloth to commuters while travelling to work by train. Josh Lowensohn said he began trolling strangers on the train with the image, which was created by artist Pedro Dionisio, to highlight the dangers of allowing an iPhone to receive files from anyone in the surrounding area. The practice takes advantage of a security feature in Apple's AirDrop service, which allows users to share files wirelessly over WiFi and Bluetooth networks. After upgrading the operating software, iPhones and iPads can be set to receive files from 'everyone' in the surrounding area. It is thought to work within a range of around 30 feet. But now it appears his prank has been adopted by others and is spreading around the world, with victims reporting being sent the image by AirDrop in London and New York. Mr Lowensohn, who began trolling commuters in San Fransisco a year ago, insists he is not responsible for the appearance of the AstroSloth on iPhones in other cities as he has been 'landlocked' in California. When contacted about the image appearing on phones in London, from iPhone users called AirSloth', he described the spread as both 'wonderful and terrible'. The Space Sloth began appearing on the internet in February 2012 after an artist called Pedro Dionisio posted the image on the website deviantArt and Tumblr. Within just a few months the image had been shared millions of times and had its own spoof twitter account and Facebook fan pages. It gained notoriety as people began using the image to play pranks on friends and colleagues by using it to replace pictures in frames on their desks or setting it as their desktop picture. The picture was created by superimposing a sloth's head over the face of an astronaut. While many nicknamed the sloth Neil Armsloth, the spacesuit actually belongs to one of the crew who took part in the mission to the International Space Station STS-121 in 2003. It is believed the photograph originally used to create the image was a portrait of US astronaut Mike Fossum. He said: 'I certainly didn't invent the concept of sending strangers unsolicited files using AirDrop, but I'd like to think that I'm doing it in a way that's more fun than malicious. 'You could send much worse things, which I'm not so sure was well known by most people. 'When I first started exploring this, artist Pedro Dionísio's sloth in a spacesuit seemed like a perfect fit: it was playful and disarming. 'You could easily argue that this is not a nice thing to do to people, but I'd like to think that by leaving the feature set to ""everyone,"" you're secretly hoping to see a sloth.' While the picture of the sloth in the space suit is harmless - it originally started being shared over the internet in 2012 after artist Pedro Dionísio uploaded it to his deviantArt account - it highlights an important security loophole in the iPhone. By allowing iPhone users to send unsolicited files to anyone with this setting turned on, it could allow hackers to install virus software that could allow them to eavesdrop or even take over devices. In September Apple also extended its AirDrop service to include MacBooks and iMacs, meaning the number of devices that could be vulnerable are even greater. For many the Astronaut Sloth may be simply an amusing way of trolling strangers to see their reaction upon receiving the photo. It is a new twist on a prank that began in 2012 when people began replacing desktop images and screen savers of friends and colleagues with the picture. Technology writer Harry McCracken is among those to have been targeted by the AirSloth prank, sent from an AirDrop user who apparently shares his name with notorious American murder and gangster Whitey Bulger . The Space Sloth has developed its own dedicated online followers with fan pages and its own twitter feed . The image quickly became a meme of its own as people replaced the heads of humans from other historic images and pictures. The image even began appearing on T-Shirts, coffee mugs and bags. Among those to have received the sloth picture over AirDrop is Harry McCracken, former editor in chief of PC World magazine and technology editor of New York based magazine Fast Company. Other victims have reported being sent the space sloth in Kensington, London, an AirDrop user identifying themselves only as Sloth's 'iPhone'. For Mr Lowensohn, the thrill of watching the reactions of his fellow commuters while keeping a straight face, saw him troll stranger after stranger. Writing on the website The Verge, he said: 'I've done it perhaps a hundred times, and the thrill has not waned one little bit. 'I've seen reactions that range from amused to confused, but never has anyone been visibly angered. 'The beauty of the technology is that your targets can be far away by the time you've done the deed.' Apple's AirDrop allows iPhone users to send pictures and files to other Apple devices over WiFi and Bluetooth networks but those who leave the service set to receive from 'Everyone' (right) are vulnerable to hackers .","iPhone owners report receiving sloth pictures from mystery AirDrop users .

"Britain's biggest jail, with space for 2,000 inmates, has been given the go-ahead today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling confirmed plans to build the £250million ‘super-prison’ in Wrexham, North Wales with work on the project is due to start next year and the jail opening in 2017. But a further four prisons are to due close under the plans to build two new 'super jails in England and Wales. An artist's impression of the 2,000-capacity 'super-prison' in Wrexham, Wales, that will be announced today . Work on the project is due to start next year and the jail is set to open in 2017 . One new prison will be built on the 108-acre site of a Firestone rubber factory, which is owned by the Welsh Assembly. In June, when plans for the prison were first mooted, Mr Grayling said it would help ensure more inmates were locked up at lower cost to the taxpayer. He said: ‘My priority is to provide enough prison places for those sent there by the courts – and to do so in a way that gives taxpayers the best possible value for money. ‘This will be the first prison in North Wales and a massive boost to the Welsh economy. ‘It will provide around 1,000 much-needed jobs, great opportunities for local businesses and millions of pounds worth of construction opportunities. ‘It will also allow offenders from the region to be held closer to their homes, which we know helps prevent reoffending. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the prison will save the taxpayer money . Mr Grayling said the project would also be a boost to the Welsh economy . ‘Across the country I am reducing the cost of prison by replacing old, inefficient buildings with newer accommodation that is cheaper to run. ‘This new prison allows us to continue this work while providing a significant and rapid investment in the Welsh economy.’ The average price of a single prison place for one year is  £40,000 but in new jails the cost can be less than half that figure. Officials estimate the new jail will eventually save taxpayers £20million a year. Britain’s biggest prison by number of inmates is Oakwood in the West Midlands which holds 1,605. Next in size are Liverpool and Birmingham jails which each hold around 1,450. Wandsworth prison in South London has 1,300 places. However the new prison will be dwarfed by Europe’s largest, Fleury-Merogis Prison on the outskirts of Paris, which can hold 3,800 prisoners. Meanwhile Blundeston in Suffolk, Dorchester, in West Dorset, Northallerton in North Yorkshire and Reading prisons will close, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. As well as being cheaper, new prisons can provide more opportunities for rehabilitating offenders with purpose-built workshops and training centres. Prison reform groups have criticised the new prison, warning it could be a ‘warehouse’ which would put the public at risk.","The prison is due to open in Wrexham, North Wales, in 2017 .

"The word soccer is actually a British term that comes from Association Football, US historians have found. They were investigating the history of the word, and the cultural difference behind it. In fact, the use of the term goes back 200 years, they said. The word 'soccer' comes from the use of the term 'association football' in Britain and goes back 200 years, they said. According to the Oxford English dictionary the first recorded use of the word 'football' in English was in 1486. The contemporary history of the world's favourite game spans more than 100 years. It all began in 1863 in England, when rugby football and association football branched off on their different courses and the Football Association in England was formed - becoming the sport's first governing body. Both codes stemmed from a common root and both have a long and intricately branched ancestral tree. 'Americans have long referred to Association football as 'soccer', to the point where many people believe it is fact a word invented in America,' wrote University of Michigan professor Stefan Szymanski. 'Many seek to associate American use of the word with alleged American imperialism and cultural hegemony.' The researchers found the word soccer in fact originated in Britain at the end of the nineteenth century, and was commonly used there. 'It appears that as the popularity of soccer has grown in the US, the word has been used less and less. The paper analysed usage of the two words from 1900, and found British people only stopped using about 30 years ago. Americans invented their own variant of the game that they simply called 'football' in the early 1900s. When England won the World Cup in 1966 the use of the term soccer was just beginning to decline in the UK . 'Association football' became 'soccer' in America, and what was called 'gridiron' in Britain became simply 'football' in America. 'Since 1980 the usage of the word 'soccer' has declined in British publications, and where it is used, it usually refers to an American context,' the researchers say. 'This decline seems to be a reaction against the increased usage in the US which seems to be associated with the highpoint of the NASL around 1980.' However, the researchers admit the problem of two names may need to be addressed. 'With soccer growing in popularity in the US and the rest of the world stridently insisting the word soccer is not football, it would appear that some kind of resolution will eventually be required.'","British term that comes from Association Football .

"Conspiracy theorists started forming their theories about the Boston marathon bombings just hours after the attack, as they claimed the explosions were set up by American government forces. In the first press conference following the fatal explosions that left three dead and 176 injured, a conservative blogger asked whether it was a 'false flag staged attack'. False flag attacks are instances where governments are thought to have arranged a violent incident- theoretically like Monday's bombing- in order to scare its citizens into handing over controls to the federal authorities. Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line . WATCH THE VIDEO HERE . Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick flatly denied the claim, though that has not stopped conspiracy theorists from finding supposed proof that they believe backs up an alternate version of events. Dan Bidondi of right-wing site InfoWars posited the loaded question, implying that the bombing was designed to increase federal authority. 'Why were the loud speakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bombs went off? Is this another false flag staged attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security while sticking their hands down our pants on the streets?' Mr Bidondi said. Though Democratic governor Patrick flatly denied the implication and moved on to the next question, that didn't stop conservative bloggers from running with the theory. The second of two explosions rocked the last 1050 yards of the Boston Marathon course, sending shrapnel into the crowd, severing limbs, and ending lives . Conspiracy theorists: Dan Bidondi (left) asked Governor Deval Patrick about the possibility of a false flag attack while fellow InfoWars writer Alex Jones (right) continued to push the theory throughout the day . Wheels turning: InfoWars founder Alex Jones pushed the 'false flag' theory . The sole alleged piece of evidence supporting the false flag theory is that several witnesses said that there was a recording over the loudspeaker just moments before the explosions that asked spectators to ‘keep calm’ and other reports that bomb sniffing dogs were used at the start of the race for a supposed training exercise. Neither detail has been confirmed by investigators. Alex Jones, the controversial radio show host and 9/11 Truther who runs InfoWars and gained a national audience after having an on-air meltdown during an interview with Piers Morgan, followed Bidondi's lead and took to Twitter. 'Our hearts go out to those that are hurt or killed #Boston marathon - but this thing stinks to high heaven #falseflag,' he wrote. False flag attacks derive from nautical military strikes, where the crew on a ship would change the national flag to that of a friendly nation in order to approach its target and then attack. Prior claims: Other conspiracy theorists believed that the Sandy Hook shooting was designed by the government in order to help them pass stricter gun control laws . Now instead of limiting its use to naval warfare, conspiracy theorists apply it to any situation where a terrible act could be used by the perpetrators to influence a change in policy based off public outcry following the tragedy. Prior to yesterday's Boston bombing, the most recent example was the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Gun rights advocates posited that the attack that left 20 children and six educators dead was planned by Obama administration officials in order to shore up support for stricter gun regulation. The conspiracy theorists have been able to disseminate their version of events largely because the federal authorities are still trying to compile theirs. Different kind of flags: The term 'false flag' comes from nautical warfare, where an attacker would use the flag of a friendly nation to trick the target into allowing them to approach . No formal suspects have been identified, though the revelation that one of the bombs was located inside a pressure cooker- which is a preferred weapon of al-Qaeda terrorists and listed as the 'most effective' weapon of jihad, according to in an English language terror magazine- hinting that the perpetrator may be foreign. So far no terror groups have claimed responsibility. The Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood denied any connection to the attack, instead suggesting that it was an anti-Islam conspiracy at work. Boston police are working with the FBI and are calling for the public’s help in searching for the suspect, asking for any pictures or video taken near the finish line at around the time of the explosion to be sent in for analysis.","Conspiracy theorists believe bombings were set up by the government to scare people into allowing stricter security protocols .

"A young couple in Pakistan were tied up and had their throats slit with scythes by the bride's father after they married for love. The 17-year-old girl and 31-year-old man married without the consent of their families in eastern Pakistan's Punjabi village of Satrah, police said. The girl's mother and father lured the couple home with the promise that their marriage would receive a family blessing. Brutal: The 17-year-old girl and 31-year-old man married without the consent of their families in eastern Pakistan's Punjabi village of Satrah, police said. They were lured to a home and then killed by the girl's mother . 'When the couple reached there, they tied them with ropes,' he said. 'He (the girl's father) cut their throats.' Police arrested the family, who said they had been embarrassed by the marriage of their daughter, named Muafia Hussein, to a man from a less important tribe. Cultural traditions in many areas of Pakistan mean that killing a woman whose behaviour is seen as immodest is widely accepted. Immodest behaviour that sparked recent killings included singing, looking out of the window or talking to a man who is not a relative. For a woman to marry a man of her own choice is considered an unacceptable insult by many families. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said 869 so-called 'honour killings' were reported in the media last year - several a day. But the true figure is probably much higher since many cases are never reported. The weak Pakistani government, battling with a troubled economy and a Taliban insurgency, does not collect centralized statistics and has no strategy to combat the killings. Pakistani law means that even if a woman's killer is convicted, her family are able to forgive the killer. Many families simply nominate a member to do the killing, then formally forgive the killer. That's what happened earlier this week, a lawyer said, when a tribal council in central Pakistan's Muzaffargarh district sentenced another young couple to death for marrying for love. Remote: The pair where killed in a rural area near Gujranwala in eastern Pakstan . The couple's lawyer, Zia Kiyyani, said the two had appealed for police protection after their marriage on June 21, but had not received any. The 19-year-old girl's family came to take her from her husband's family, swearing on the Koran that they would not harm her and would hold a proper wedding ceremony, he said. 'During this the girl shouted, cried and mourned for her life and her husband's life because she knew that they will kill both of them,' he said. The girl, named Mehreen Bibi, was shot by a member of her family when she returned home, police said. Her husband went into hiding and her father registered the murder complaint so he could forgive the killer, Kiyyani said. 'That will end the case,' he said.","The 17-year-old girl married the 31-year-old man in the village of Satrah .

"Turkish Muslims have declared victory after toy makers Lego agreed to withdraw a Star Wars product which allegedly depicted a mosque. Critics claimed that the Jabba's Palace model, part of Lego's Star Wars range, was offensive to Muslims as it resembled the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul - one of the world's most renowned mosques. The Lego set is based on the home of . Jabba the Hutt, a central character in the Star Wars series, who lives . in a domed palace, with a separated watchtower. Toy: The Jabba's Palace Lego set will cease to be produced from 2014 after the Turkish Cultural Community of Austria group described it as offensive to the Muslim community . Criticism: The group criticised Lego's design saying it resembles the Hagia Sophia mosque in Istanbul, one of the world's most recognisable mosques . As well as bearing a likeness to the Hagia . Sophia mosque, the Turkish group also claimed the toy was designed based on the Jami al-Kabir mosque in Beirut with the watchtower resembling a minaret. The set of blocks featured Jabba the . Hutt, a slug-like shisha-smoking alien from the Star Wars films, and an . oriental domed building housing rockets and machine guns. The character of Jabba, which features in the toy aimed at children . aged from nine to 14, keeps Princess . Leia in chains for use as his personal slave in the Star Wars films. A statement posted on the . organisation's website referred to Jabba the Hutt as a 'terrorist' and . said that he 'likes to smoke hookah and have his victims killed'. It added: 'It . is clear that the ugly figure of Jabba and the whole scene smacks of . racial prejudice and vulgar insinuations against Asians and Orientals as . people with deceitful and criminal personalities.' The statement said that the figures in the set are made to resemble 'terrorists, criminals and murderers'. Comparisons: A post appeared on the group's website pointing out features of the Lego set and comparing them to the Istanbul mosque . The case came to light when a Turkish man . expressed his dissatisfaction with the toy after it was purchased for . his son by a family member. Lego initially refused to remove the Jabba's Palace toy from the shelves claiming it was an entirely fictional creation. Lego's Katharina Sasse said:'We . regret that the product has caused the members of the Turkish cultural . community to come to a wrong interpretation, but point out that when . designing the product only the fictional content of the Star Wars saga . were referred to.' But following a meeting between . Turkish community leaders and Lego executives it was agreed that . production of the toy would end from 2014 onwards. Birol Killic, the . president of the TCA, said in a statement: 'We are very grateful and . congratulate Lego on the decision to take Jabba’s Palace out of . production.' Lego was not available for comment yesterday. There was no explanation why the game was not scheduled for immediate withdrawal. Jabba's Palace as depicted in the 1983 Star Wars film Return of the Jedi . The Hagia Sophia was first built around 360AD in the Byzantium capital Constantinople, later Istanbul. It served as an Eastern Orthodox Cathedral and was the world's largest for nearly a thousand years, until Seville Cathedral was completed in 1520.In 1453, Constantinople was conquered by the Ottoman Turks under Sultan Mehmed II, who ordered the building converted into a mosque.Christian symbols such as the bells and altar were removed and many of the mosaics were plastered over. Islamic features, such as the four minarets, were added while it was in the possession of the Ottomans.It remained a mosque until 1931 when it was closed to the public for four years. It re-opened in 1935 as a museum by the Republic of Turkey.It is famous for its massive dome and is considered the crowning achievement of Byzantine architecture. Some experts say it 'changed the history of architecture'.","Jabba's Palace will cease production in 2014 but not removed immediately .

Beautifully isolated: There is no way the researchers at the station, pictured, can be rescued until winter ends . Nice view: At least the trapped scientists have a good vantage point to watch the patterns of the Aurora . 'No one here on station is responsible for the technical issues we are having and we are all working extremely hard. 'Another fairly cool, but problematic at the time, event occurred around the time of us losing power – the coldest temperature ever recorded at Halley Bay. 'Throwing a cup of boiling water into the air resulted in small explosion as the water instantly turned into a cloud of ice crystals. 'This obviously didn’t help us on station at the time but it was nice to see a record set! A British Antarctic Survey spokesman told MailOnline the temperature inside the building had dropped almost to freezing. He added: 'We can't get anyone in to help them because it's the winter.' But he insisted there was no threat to their safety, saying: 'They have a building which is usually used as overspill accommodation for the summer months. 'It's been shut down since the summer, so we're bringing that back into service and slowly warming it up. 'There's also a garage which is heated that they can sleep in. It's not ideal, but it's safe. 'Some people have been saying they're going to freeze to death. That's not going to happen.' Isolated: The location of the research station in Halley Bay, which has been used by scientists since the 1950s . The state-of-the-art research station opened two years ago on a 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf in Halley Bay, Antarctica, where researchers have been based since the 1950s. Run by the Cambridge-based Survey, it consists of eight 'modules' on hydraulic legs which can lift above huge layers of snow and ice which accumulate in the winter. The design was an attempt to prevent the fate of previous research bases which were buried under ice and snow during serious weather. Although the station is completely inaccessible to the outside world, there is an on-site doctor. A BAS statement said: 'British Antarctic Survey (BAS) is dealing with a serious operational incident at its Halley Research Station. 'Our urgent priority is to ensure the continued safety and wellbeing of the wintering team. Inhospitable: The base opened in 2012 after four years' work and is on the 150m-thick Brunt Ice Shelf . State of the art: The research station in calmer weather. It currently has just 13 scientists living in it . 'Power and some heating are back online, and some other essential services have been restored, but the staff are having to live and work in extremely difficult conditions. 'It is now clear that because of the nature of the incident, and the prolonged loss of power, the station cannot now return to normal operation in the short or medium term. 'Everyone at Halley and Cambridge is doing everything that can be done to ensure that the incident remains under control. 'All science, apart from meteorological observations essential for weather forecasting, has been stopped.'","13 staff were staking out depths of polar winter at Halley Research Station .

"Apple is set to unveil new iPads and Mac computers on Thursday at its California headquarters. The gadgets could go on sale on 24 October - with Mac software, called Yosemite, available as a free download even earlier. With just four days until the event, the rumour mill has been working overtime, with the latest leaks suggesting that the new iPad will come in gold, as other rumours have suggested, and include a Touch ID sensor. Scroll down for video . Apple is set to unveil new iPads and Mac computers later this week. On Saturday, Taiwanese blog Apple.club.tw leaked photos that it claims show the new iPad's motherboard and TouchID sensor (pictured) On Saturday, Taiwanese blog Apple.club.tw leaked photos that it claims reveal the new iPad's motherboard and gold-coloured Touch ID sensor. The images suggest the new iPad, expected to be called the iPad Air 2, will have Apple's Touch ID and a gold colour option. They also allegedly show a logic board with new A8X chip, a front assembly panel, a cable for the Touch ID home button and a cable for the volume buttons.

The leaked interior images (pictured) of the latest iPad suggests that it has an A8X chip on the tablet is a faster upgrade to the A8 chip on iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus . Apple may also be using 2GB of RAM instead of the 1GB on the iPad Air, according to Apple.club.tw.  Pictured is what is claimed to be the glass front panel of the new IPad Air . Apple may also give the new iPad 2GB of RAM instead of the 1GB on the current iPad Air, according to Apple.club.tw. The leaks follow last week's rumours which also suggested Apple was putting the finishing touches to a new gold version of its iPad Air. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air recently surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button. According to Tinhte.vn  the device comes in at just 7 millimeters thick, the same thickness as the iPhone 6. The images allegedly show a logic board with new A8X chip (pictured), a front assembly panel, a cable for the Touch ID home button and a cable for the volume buttons . Apple's invite for the event tells journalists 'It's been way too long' - even though their last event was last month . Apple is preparing to launch a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite, and news iPads this month. 'A new line of iMacs with ultra high-resolution Retina Displays is in late testing stages within Apple, according to our sources who have used the future desktop computer,' said 9to5 Mac. 'While the machine will sport a thin profile similar to that of the current design, which was introduced in 2012, it will be packed with new internals such as faster processors and improved Wi-Fi antennas,' it says. The firm will also launch a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The Yosemite software will allow users to make and receive calls and notifications from their Mac - even if their iPhone is in another room. The software has also been overhauled with a new 'flat' look, and can search the web without having to open a browser. In addition to a redesigned speaker grille, the unit also sports a small hole where the mute/orientation lock switch appears on existing iPad units. The move is thought to be designed to boost sales of its full-size tablets, which are in decline. Until now, iPads have only been available in a monochromatic colour scheme, but a golden makeover would make the tablets more similar to the Californian company’s new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, which come in three colours. New versions of the 9.7-inch tablet could include a golden metal rear cover as well as the silver and grey currently offered for the iPad Air, ‘people familiar with the matter’ told Bloomberg. The new iPads are also predicted to sport a thinner, more rounded design, similar to the iPhone 6. Hidden code in the latest iOS 8.1 beta software hints that the iPads will feature a Touch ID fingerprint sensor and Apple Pay functionality. The code states that users can 'pay with iPad using Touch ID. With Apple Pay, you no longer need to type card numbers and shipping information.' However, it is not clear whether the new iPad will come with NFC functionality, which is used for contactless payments, as it relies on a Wi-Fi or mobile connection. Apple Pay has only been announced in the US, so if the iPads do get the feature, it may be limited to only American buyers. Apple is also rumoured to be launching a larger iPad with a 12.9-inch screen next year, which if true, could offer 76 per cent more screen area than the current 9.7 inch models. An apparent mockup of a slightly redesigned, next-generation iPad Air has surfaced from Vietnam showing a more trim profile, recessed volume buttons, and the addition of a Touch ID sensor to the home button . The iPads have a new sleek design and are thinner. The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen . The latest swathe of Apple tablets could come with a split screen function, which would allow users of an iPad to open two apps side-by-side on one screen. Sales of iPads have slumped for two quarters, after climbing from $5 billion (£3 billion) when they were launched in 2010, to $30 billion (£19 billion)  in 2012 and $32 billion in 2013 (£20 billion). The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini, and it appears that consumers have instead been drawn to smartphones with larger screens, including recently, Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus, which has a 5.5 inch screen. Apple is not new to the strategy of launching colourful products to boost its sales. The new iPads are expected to have a rounded design similar to the recently released iPhone 6 . The new iPads are also expected to include Touch ID sensors. The firm hasn't unveiled an updated iPad since last October when it launched the iPad Air and Mini . In 1999 it rolled out different coloured iMacs which were successful, but sales of its iPhone 5C – a ‘budget’ version of the iPhone 5S – have not sold as well as the company hoped. The company is expected to unveil the new iPads at the same time as a range of iMacs with Ultra HD 'Retina' display screens in a bid to reinvigorate desktop computer sales. The new line of iMacs is rumoured to have ultra high-resolution Retina Displays, a thin profile and faster processors as well as improved Wi-Fi antennas. The firm is expected to reveal them alongside a new version of its Mac software called Yosemite. The iPad launch event is likely to be in stark contrast to the star-studded launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, which saw U2 playing before the firm controversially gave away the band's new album.

"A tribe of indigenous people are under threat from an epidemic sweeping through the forests of Paraguay. Members of the Ayoreo-Totobiegosode group have been struck down with a mysterious tuberculosis-like respiratory illness that is slowly killing them. The people have been forced out of isolation due to deforestation for decades, and once they come into contact with society, they do not have the immunisation to tackle disease. The Ayoreo-Totobiegosode tribe in Paraguay is being struck down with a mysterious tuberculosis-like respiratory illness. Member Chiri Etacore is shown healthy in 2000, pictured left, and seriously ill in 2011, pictured right. Etacore was the most recent death from the illness and he died in October 2013 . Despite its similarities to TB, many tribe members suffering from the mysterious disease have tested negative for tuberculosis, and doctors have been left baffled. Survival International, a human righta organisation that campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal and 'uncontacted' people, is warning the tribe may be wiped out unless the illness is identified and treated. ‘The deadly epidemic threatens to wipe out Paraguay's recently contacted Ayoreo tribe, and sets a deadly precedent for their relatives still hiding in the forests, who are the last uncontacted Indians outside the Amazon,’ said the organisation. The Totobiegosode is an indigenous . sub-group of the Ayoreo people living along the Gran Chaco which . stretches from Argentina into Paraguay. Some members are also found in . Bolivia. Since the 1940s, numerous attempts have been made to contact the tribe and many members have been forced from their homes since the late 1960s due to local farmers reclaiming the land, and deforestation. Parojnai Picanerai is pictured on the day he was contacted in 1998, left, and ill in 2007, right. He died in 2011 . Nguiejna Etacoro was contacted in 2004, pictured left, and has been suffering from the illness since 2007, right. Despite its similarities to TB, many tribe members studied have tested negative for the illness and doctors are baffled by what it is, and how to treat it. As a result of their isolation, they are not immunised against disease . Since the 1940s, local governments . and groups have made numerous attempts to contact the tribe, and during . the 1970s and 80s many tribe members have been forced from their river and forest . villages towards the towns. More . recently, during the 1990s and again in 2004, tribe members were placed . in settlements so the land they were living on could be reclaimed. The . most recent Ayoreo victim killed by the respiratory disease, called . Chiri Etacore, was forced out of the forest in 1986 and died in October . last year. The Totobiegosode is an indigenous sub-group of the Ayoreo people living along the Gran Chaco, pictured. As many as three hundred Totobiegosode are said to have chosen to live in isolation. The name translates as 'people from the place of the wild pigs' The Totobiegosode is an indigenous sub-group of the Ayoreo people living along the Gran Chaco which stretches from Argentina into Paraguay. Some members are also found in Bolivia. As many as three hundred Totobiegosode are said to have chosen to live in isolation and as a result they’re considered the most isolated of all Ayoreo. The name translates as ‘people from the place of the wild pigs’. The tribe live in small villages along rivers, and grow a number of crops such as squashes, beans and melons. They also hunt and gather. Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but may still be under threat from the epidemic as it spreads through the land. Ibore Picanerai, pictured, was healthy when she was forced out of the forest in 1998, left, and contracted the illness in 2003, right. She died in 2009 . They are believed to the only ‘uncontacted’ indigenous people living south of the Amazon basin. Since the 1940s, local governments and groups have made numerous attempts to contact the tribe, and during the 1970s and 80s many were forced from their river and forest villages towards the towns. More recently, during the 1990s and again in 2004, tribe members were placed in settlements so the land they were living on could be reclaimed. Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but are under threat from deforestation. In 2010, an expedition in search of new species of plants and insects, organised by the Natural History Museum in London, was suspended when concerns were raised that Ayoreo people might be encountered and disturbed. Almost all the Ayoreo members who have been forced from their lands have suffered from the rare disease in one form or another. Some groups still live uncontacted, or in voluntary isolation, but may still be under threat from the epidemic as it spreads through the land. ‘When uncontacted people are forced into contact with outside society disease swiftly follows. 'Here is proof that forced contact is nothing more than a death sentence for tribal peoples. 'Paraguay must act now to protect the lives of the last uncontacted Indians outside Amazonia,’ said Survival's director Stephen Corry.","Totobiegosode is the most isolated sub-group of Ayoreo tribe in Paraguay .

"Video footage of an abducted girl dragged screaming and crying into a forced wedding has shamed Kazakhstan. The disturbing clip, filmed on a mobile phone and titled Stealing The Bride, shows the moment the teenage girl arrives at the home of her future husband in Kazakhstan's central Akmola region. As wedding guests celebrate to traditional Kazakh music, the youngster sits in the back of a car crying and pleading to be taken home. Scroll down for video . Snatched: A young woman is dragged screaming and crying to the home of her future husband . Forced wedding: The clip was filmed in Kazakhstan's Akmola region, where such abductions are a custom . In most countries, bride kidnapping is considered a sex crime. Local women's rights activist Anfisa Zuyeva, 30, called the practice 'barbaric'. 'No wonder people think we're backward,' she said. The video shows the screaming girl dragged from the car and along a special bridal carpet towards her suitor's house as guests in smart wedding dress throw confetti over her. She makes one final effort at resistance at the door to the home, pushing back on the doorframe, before a crowd of men and women finally hustle her inside. Smile for the camera: A relative of the groom can be seen shamelessly recording the moment for posterity . Barbaric: The bride-to-be makes one last attempt at resistance before she is bundled through the door . Shockingly, such bride kidnapping, where a young woman is taken by force to the home of a man who wants to marry her, is said to be on the rise in Kazakhstan. The groom-to-be hires relatives and friends who use deception or force to get the girl into their car. This can include offering to give her a lift, or dragging her off the street and tying her up in a sack. Once inside the car she is driven to the man’s home where one of his female relatives prepares a special neckerchief called an Oramal which the girl must accept to show her consent to marriage. Often it takes days of being locked up before the girl accepts and even then there are complicated politics to be dealt with when her family found out where she is. The practice is an ancient custom in the region and there are various formalities to go through. In some circumstances the abduction can even be consensual. Where it isn't, perpetrators are rarely dealt with by the legal system. This latest video has been rounded on by critics who say the practice must stop. Ms Zuyeva, who has campaigned against the tradition, said: 'This is a barbaric and evil practice that forces young girls into loveless marriages with men they hardly know. 'Often the families of the victims agree because the groom pays them a lot of money. 'But it is an outdated and horrific tradition which has no place in modern Kazakhstan. MPs have now called for it to be made illegal, pointing out over 60 per cent of adults and 74 per cent of teenagers had either been victims of kidnappings or knew people who were.","Bride kidnapping is an ancient custom in Kazakhstan, and is on the rise .

"A toddler was catapulted into the air and caught by her father in a scene described as a 'miracle' after being hit by a van driver on a hit-and-run rampage yesterday. Two-year-old Amelia-May Lewis, who was being pushed in a pram by her mother, Annie, 22, suffered injuries to her face, which left her covered in blood. The driver mowed down pedestrians - including parents and young children - during a three-mile trail of mayhem during the school run. Scroll down for video . Adam Lewis 23 (top) who witnessed his partner Annie Lewis 22 (right) & daughter Amelia-May Lewis 2 (centre) being knocked over. He caught his daughter after she was catapulted in mid-air . Mother-of-three Karina Menzies, pictured, died in the terrible incident . A mother of three was killed and eleven others injured, two of whom were in intensive care last night. In ‘absolutely chaotic’ scenes, the driver is said to have even reversed over some victims after hitting them. The dead woman – named locally as Karina Menzies, 32, was among at least seven children and four adults hit by the van. She died after being knocked down outside a fire station. The survivors’ injuries included a broken leg and cuts and bruises. Witnesses said the man hit pedestrians in the Ely and Leckwith areas of Cardiff at 3.30pm, when parents were picking children up from school. Pedestrians tried to stop the Transit van but it mounted the pavement and sped off before the driver was eventually seized by police officers. The local accident and emergency hospital unit was so overwhelmed it had to shut to any patients other than those injured by the van driver. The commotion started after the white van tried to escape from the scene of a crash outside an Asda supermarket in Leckwith, witnesses said. The vehicle sped off, driving at people walking home after school, careering wildly down suburban roads and on to pavements. Among those knocked down were student Mrs Lewis, her husband Adam and daughter Amelia-May. Mrs . Lewis, who suffered a broken leg, was taken to hospital in one of the . fleet of at least seven ambulances at one of the scenes in Ely. A white van, believed to be driven by a man who was involved in a series of hit and runs around Cardiff, is inspected by police . The main accident and emergency hospital in Cardiff was closed last night to anyone apart from casualties being brought in after the spate of crashes. Witness Anne Rahman, 62, told The Sun: 'The dad caught her, it was a miracle. He was shaking'. Adam’s grandmother, Maureen Lewis, 80, said: ‘It was total mayhem out there. ‘The driver of the white van was driving fast and furious at anyone in his path. Adam, Annie and Amelia were hit.’ She added: ‘Thank God they are alive. It is terrifying that so many people have been knocked down.’ Shopkeeper . Phil Jones said: ‘People were rushing out of houses trying to help the . injured people and covering them with blankets until the ambulances . arrived. Pictured here is a map of Cardiff showing the areas where victims were injured . Pictured here is the A&E dept at the University hospital in Cardiff that has been closed except for people involved in the incident . The scene in the Ely area of Cardiff where a 31 year old man has been arrested after a hit and run incident that has left at least 11 people injured . ‘The baby was covered in blood – people were just lying on the pavements. ‘He drove straight across four lanes of the road and smashed into a man and woman with their baby in a pushchair. ‘He just smashed into them before screaming round on the road and heading away. ‘In about 100 yards, he veered off the road and hit another two boys and a mother and a boy on a bike.’ The main accident and emergency hospital in Cardiff was closed to anyone apart from casualties being brought in after the spate of crashes . Lynda Paterson, 34, said the scene outside her house was ‘chaotic’. She added: ‘I was going to pick my children up from school and I could see there were police and someone was lying on the floor, on the pavement. ‘I could see police running back and forth along the road and I now know there was a child who had been hit.’ Natalie Howell, 28, added: ‘I was on my way home from school when I saw the van. People tried blocking off the van to stop it driving off but he went up on the pavement and sped off.’ Gail Harford, 40, said: ‘The driver was not just running over people but reversing over them too. It’s too horrendous for words.’ Ely sub-postmaster Shady Taha, 29, had just served two girls and a young woman moments before one of the incidents outside a row of shops. Forensics officers gathering evidence at the fire station on Grand Avenue in Ely was sealed off as police investigations continued . He said the two girls - aged about 10, and a woman in her mid-20s - had been browsing the birthday cards in the store before purchasing a jar of coffee and leaving. He said: 'All of a sudden I heard a bang. I looked out and across the road one girl was on the floor and the other girl was screaming. 'I heard a van speed off but I did not see it.' Other eyewitnesses said pedestrians were deliberately targeted by someone driving a white van. 'We had a customer in our shop who . said the van mounted the kerb like the driver wanted to run down young . kids with their parents,' a shop worker in Grand Avenue, who did . not want to be named, said. A spokesman for South Wales Police confirmed the force had arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of murder. He said: ‘This is a tragic incident that has affected a large number of people, and we thank the people of Cardiff for their help and support. ‘Incidents like this are extremely rare here, as they are across South Wales, and we want to reassure the public that a significant number of officers are working on the investigation, including a number of specialist resources. ‘Whether the actions were deliberate or reckless is a matter for the inquiry and the person will obviously be spoken to.’ Dr Grahame Shortland, medical director at the University . Hospital of Wales, said those being treated mostly had fractures and head injuries. A spokesman for the hospital said two of the adults were in intensive care last night and their condition was stable but critical.

"These chilling images of a young Jewish girl at Auschwitz are among thousands that have haunted a Nazi photographer all his life. Wilhelm Brasse was forced to take photographs of frightened children and victims of gruesome medical experiments moments from their death at the extermination camp where some 1.5million people, mostly Jewish died in the Holocaust. Mr Brasse, who died this week aged 94, has had relive those horrors from inside Auschwitz but is considered a hero after he risked his life to preserve the harrowing photographs, which later helped convict the very Nazi monsters who commissioned the photographs. Frightened victims: Wilhelm Brasse took some 40,000-50,000 photographs inside Aushwitz for the Nazis including these shots of Czeslawa Kwoka after she was beaten by a guard . Haunting: The identity photographs of an Auschwitz inmate that Brasse took as part of the Nazi German effort to document their activities at the camp . Harsh truth: Polish inmate Brasse was among many put to work capturing such images . Distressing: Brasse was given the job of taking pictures for the Nazis because he had been a professional photographer before the war . After the war, Mr Brasse tried to return to photography but it was too traumatic. He said: ‘When I started taking pictures again, I saw the dead. I would be standing taking a photograph of a young girl for her portrait but behind her I would see them like ghosts standing there. 'I saw all those big eyes, terrified, staring at me. I could not go on.’ He never again picked up a camera. Instead, he set up a business making sausage casings and lived a modestly prosperous life. Before the war, Mr Brasse trained as a portrait photographer in a studio owned by his aunt in the Polish town of Katowice. He had an eye for the telling image and an ability to put his subjects at ease. But his peaceful, prosperous existence was shattered with the Nazi invasion of Poland in September 1939. He was the son of a German father and Polish mother. Too traumatic: Mr Brasse never picked up a camera again after the war because when he picked up a camera he 'saw the dead' He said: ‘When the Germans came, they wanted me to join them and say I was loyal to the Reich, but I refused. I felt Polish and I was Polish. It was my mother who instilled this in us.’ Considering the Nazis’ capacity for brutality, it was an extraordinarily brave thing for 22-year-old Mr Brasse to do. After several Gestapo interrogations he tried to flee to Hungary but was caught at the border. He was imprisoned for four months and then offered another chance to declare his loyalty to Hitler. He said: ‘They wanted me to join the German army and promised everything would be OK for me if I did.’ But again he refused and on August 31, 1940 he was placed on a train for the newly opened concentration camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau. In February 1941, he was summoned to the camp commander’s office, the notoriously brutal Rudolf Höss, who would later be hanged for his crimes. Mr Brasse was certain that this was the end but when he arrived he discovered that the SS was looking for photographers. There followed what must have been a bizarre and terrifying experience. The assembled men were tested on their photographic skills. Each must have known failure would mean a return to hard labour and death. He said: ‘We were five people. They went through everything with us - the laboratory skills and the technical ability with a camera. I had the skills as well as being able to speak German, so I was chosen.’ The Nazis wanted documentation of their prisoners. The Reich was obsessed with bureaucratic records and setup ‘Erkennungsdienst,’ the photographic identification unit. Based in the camp, it included cameramen, darkroom technicians and designers. Auschwitz bound: Mr Brasse became the Nazi's photographer after being sent to the camp as a prisoner. He managed to hide thousands of negatives which were later used as evidence against the Nazis who commissioned them . Extermination: Some 1.5million people, mostly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz during WWII . He said: ‘The conditions for me were so much better then. The food and warmth were heavenly.’ Soon began a daily parade of the doomed in this makeshift photographic studio. Each day he took so many pictures that another team of prisoners was assembled to develop the pictures. The photographer estimates that he personally must have taken between 40,000 and 50,000 portraits. One day, a prisoner was sent to him because one of the camp doctors, the infamous Nazi Dr Josef Mengele, wanted a photograph of the man’s unusual tattoo. He said: ‘It was quite beautiful. It was a tattoo of Adam and Eve standing before the Tree in the Garden of Eden, and it had obviously been done by a skilled artist.’ About an hour after taking the . photograph, he learned that the man had been killed. He was called by . another prisoner to come to one of the camp crematoria where he saw the . dead man had been skinned. Family moment: Brasse took this photo of Austrian resistance fighter Rudolf Friemel with his wife and son . Jailer: SS officer Maximilian Grabner was also captured on film by prisoner Brasse in the photography department at Auschwitz . Mr . Brasse said: ‘The skin with the tattoo was stretched on a table waiting . to be framed for this doctor. It was a horrible, horrible sight.’ ‘Mengele liked my photographs and said he wanted me to photograph some of those he was experimenting on. ‘The first group were Jewish girls. They were ordered to strip naked. They were aged 15 to 17 years and were looked after by these two Polish nurses. 'They were very shy and frightened because there were men watching them. I tried my best to calm them.’ Mr Brasse and another inmate managed to bury thousands of negatives in the camp's grounds which were later recovered.","Photographer Wilhelm Brasse died this week aged 94 .

"Patients who have agreed to be organ donors could be given priority if they ever need a transplant themselves under controversial NHS proposals. Experts say those prepared to give up their own organs should be moved up transplant waiting lists. The plans are part of a raft of initiatives to encourage more people to join the organ donation register in the hope of saving hundreds of lives a year through transplants. Patients who are registered as organ donors may receive priority on transplant waiting lists under the plans being considered by the NHS in an effort to boost donation levels . But critics warned yesterday that they could unfairly discriminate against patients with strong religious or ethical views who do not want to sign up to the list. Professor Bobbie Farsides, an expert in medical ethics at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, said someone’s chances of getting an organ should be solely based on their need. ‘It’s a big step… to transform the way we allocate organs for donation when we’ve traditionally looked at people’s clinical needs, and that alone,’ she said. ‘Certain religious groups – the orthodox Jewish – have very entrenched views that make them very resistant to organ donation.’ She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I’m prepared to stick quite rigidly to the view that anyone who desperately needs an organ should climb the list.’ The NHS is also considering banning grieving families from overriding patients’ wishes to give up their organs after they have died. More than 19million people are on the UK donor register but 1,000 people a year still die waiting for a transplant . At present relatives are allowed to stop medical staff removing their loved ones’ organs after death even if they had been signed up to the register for years. The NHS Blood and Transplant Authority is hoping to ‘revolutionise’ the public’s attitude to organ donation in the hope of saving many more lives through successful transplants. There are 10,000 patients needing new organs – most commonly liver, kidneys and hearts – and three die every day waiting. Last week, the Welsh Assembly passed a Bill where consent for organ donation will be presumed unless a patient had opted-out before death . But although the number of Britons signing up to donate their organs has increased, most die in old age when their body parts are no longer healthy enough to be given to anyone else. Each year organs from only 5,000 people who have died are deemed healthy enough to be transplanted. There are 19.5million people on the register but the NHS wants to increase this to 25million. Under plans that are going out for consultation, the NHS wants to introduce a system similar to that in place in Israel and Singapore whereby patients who had previously signed up to the register would be given priority on transplant waiting lists. But this would not mean patients could boost their chances by quickly signing-up as soon as they found out they needed a new liver or kidney, for example. They would need to have agreed to become donors before they became ill.  Professor Hazel Biggs, an expert in healthcare law and ethics at the University of Southampton, said: ‘If we incentivise people to go on the donor register list we’ll get more donors and therefore more transplants. ‘You have to take into account fairness and equity. Is it fair to accept an organ, if you need one, when you haven’t been prepared to give an organ?’ Sally Johnson, director of organ donation and transplantation at the transplant authority, said: ‘We urgently need a radical change in donor and family consent. ‘That means we need to have a serious debate in our society about our attitudes – is it fair to take if you won’t give?’ In 2015, Wales will become the first country in the UK to introduce a system of presumed consent whereby patients’ organs are automatically taken after death unless they had specifically requested otherwise. There are currently no plans to bring in a similar scheme in England, although the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, is strongly in favour.","NHS Blood and Transplant looking at ways to increase donations .

"The judge in the controversial Ethan Couch case hasn’t always been so lenient and last year sentenced a 14-year-old African American boy to 10 years in prison after he punched someone and they died. Judge Jean Boyd is facing calls to be removed from her position after she handed out the remarkably lenient sentence - 10 years probation - to 16-year-old Couch who killed four people and injured seven while on a drunken joyride. The case has attracted nationwide attention after a psychologist claimed that Couch suffered from ‘affluenza’, a condition in which his wealth and privilege kept him from understanding the consequences of his actions. No jail: Judge Jean Boyd is facing calls to be removed from her position after she handed out a remarkably lenient sentence of 10 years probation to Ethan Couch who killed four people while on a drunken joyride . Last year Judge Boyd sentenced a 14-year old boy to prison for killing one person with a powerful punch. The teenage suspect’s name was never made public since he was prosecuted as a juvenile. 'Just after 10 p.m. on October 6, the teen was riding in a Cadillac with two friends when he suddenly jumped out of the vehicle in the 1700 block of Vaughn Avenue and punched [Mark] Gregory, who was 5-foot-1 and weighed 106 pounds,' said the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office in a statement. 'Gregory’s head struck the pavement and he died two days later.' The 14-year-old boy admitted to the crime and never expressed remorse for the murder, according to prosecutors. Gregory’s mother, Anita Lauterbach, said she remembers Judge Boyd pushing for rehabilitation, much like in the Couch case. No jail: Ethan Couch pictured here in December, avoided prison for killing four and injuring two more after his attorney argued that he was mollycoddled by his parents so much that he didn't understand the difference between right and wrong . 'She wanted to send him to one of these special places in Arizona, but no one would take him,' Lauterbach told WFAA. 'We were horrified. We just couldn't believe it. The district attorney and I were just sitting on pins and needles. But, when nobody would take him, [it was] a sigh of relief.' Lauterbach said she's still disgusted at her experience with the judge. 'She's too easy on them,' Lauterbach said. 'I don't think she needs to be sitting on that bench.' Boyd is expected to retire next year, but a petition has been launched at change.org demanding that Texas Governor Rick Perry remove her from the bench immediately. Instead of prison, Couch is set to spend time at the swanky Newport Academy male residential rehabilitation center in California with his parents footing the bill . 'This sentence is a slap in the face [of] the families of those who were killed. He's sent to California to a spa-type center while the families of the victims get to go to a cemetery,' wrote a supporter of the petition, Stephen Pyka of Texas. 'This is another disgusting display of the wealthy trying to change the rules when they break them. This judge should be removed for aiding a murderer,' noted another supporter, Nina Eagle of Appomattox, Va. The relatives of one of the seven friends who were piled into Couch’s pickup truck have spoken out about the ‘living hell’ they have been in since the accident six months ago. Sergio Molina was in the back of a pickup truck being driven erratically by Couch when he slammed into four people on the side of a road. Those four people - a young woman whose car had broken down, a Good Samaritan trying to help, and a mother and daughter who also got out to see what they could do - were all killed. Forever changed: Sergio Molina, now 16, was in a coma following the June accident but now has been transferred home and has been awarded a $2 million settlement by a court in Texas . Heartbreaking: Sergio now must be cared for by his mother Maria Lemus (left) and older brother Alex (right) around the clock and they have already accrued $1million in medical bills . Expensive: Alex Lemus (left) had to quit his job to help care for his brother and the family has already accrued more than a million dollars in medical bills since the accident in June 2013 . Sergio, who is now 16, is still alive but . has a completely different existence than he did before the accident as . he is paralyzed, ‘minimally conscious’ and needs constant medical . attention. Speaking to CNN, Sergio’s older brother Alex Lemus said that doctors warned them of getting their hopes too high. ‘That’s all we can hope for, is how he is now for the rest of his life,’ Lemus said. He attended Couch’s trial in place of his brother, who can barely move without assistance. When the judge handed down a sentence of 10 years’ probation and no jail time for the crash, Lemus said that he had trouble processing his anger. He said he was ‘disappointed, so outrageously angry that I couldn’t say anything’. His mother, Maria Lemus, still breaks down in tears when thinking about all of Sergio’s dreams that seem so far out of reach in light of the accident. Drunk: Couch's blood alcohol reading was .24 and he also had a Valium in his system when he killed four people and injured several more on June 15 . ‘He was the best son, he was the kind of boy who had a lot of dreams,’ Lemus said. ‘He was his first dream was to be a soccer player. He was sweet.’ Sergio’s family estimates that they have accrued more than $1million in medical bills over the past six months, and they are now suing Couch’s family and his father’s business - the car that the boys were in was owned by the company - for up to $20million. Before: Sergio had dreams of playing professional soccer before the accident . ‘That kid killed four people and crippled my little brother and doesn’t even have to serve one year? If he were poor like us, he would’ve gotten 10 years, I bet,’ Alex Lemus told The Dallas Morning News. They are not the first victims relatives to speak out in light of the controversial ruling, as Eric Boyles, who lost his wife Hollie and 21-year-old daughter Shelby in the accident said he is dissatisfied with the easy sentence, and thinks Couch should have been tried as an adult. Since he was tried as a juvenile, Couch faced a maximum of 20 years in prison but would have been eligible for parole after two years. 'You look at 180 years of future life taken from the four individuals...Even a two year deal, a two year sentence before he's eligible for parole, didn't seem exactly fair under those circumstances,' Boyle said. Additionally upsetting to Boyle is the fact that Couch will receive his counseling at a 'country club'-style treatment center- with a pricetag of $450,000 per year and features equine therapy and organic menu options- in ritzy Newport Beach, California. The fatal accident occurred around 11:45pm on June 15, Couch and a group his friends who were all drunk, got into a red Ford F350 pick-up and were speeding 70 mph in a 40 mph zone when the truck left the road. As it careered out of control, it clipped a broken down SUV, throwing the owner and four good Samaritans, who were trying to help, 60 yards in the air. Youth pastor Brian Jennings, mother and daughter Hollie and Shelby Boyles and 24-year-old Breanna Mitchell were all killed on impact. It was revealed soon after that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium when he started the chain reaction of crashes. The impact flung the four people 50 to 60 yards, authorities reported. Speaking out: Eric Boyles, the father and husband of two women killed in a June drunk driving accident, isn't pleased that the teen driver got off with just a 10 year probation sentence . Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash . A psychologist called by the defense, Dr Gary Miller, blamed the teen's behavior on his parents, claiming they gave him whatever he wanted including 'freedoms no young person should have'. Dr Miller called Couch a product of 'affluenza,' where his family felt their wealth bought privilege and there was no rational link between behavior and consequences. He added that the boy had an 'intellectual age' of 18 but an 'emotional age' of 12. 'The teen never learned to say that you’re sorry if you hurt someone,' Dr Miller said, according to the Star Telegram. 'If you hurt someone, you sent him money.' State District Judge Jean Boyd appeared to agree with the defense. She told the teen that he is responsible for what happened, but she said she didn't believe he would receive the therapy he needed in jail. If he violates the terms of his probation, he could be sent to prison for 10 years. Defense attorneys asked that he be sent to a private rehabilitation home near Newport Beach, California, which costs an enormous $450,000 a year. His father said he'd foot the bill. Scene: 911 callers described cars everywhere and kids' lying in ditches' after the June 15 smash . Injured: Sergio Molina (left) and Soliman Mohmand (right) were two of  was seriously injured. They were both riding in Couch's truck when the cash occured . Prosecutors said the juvenile justice system also offered counseling. Breanna's mother, Marla Mitchell, said she was 'mad' about the sentence and embraced the families of the other victims outside of the courtroom. 'He'll be feeling the hand of God, definitely,' she told WFAA.com. 'He may think he got away with something, but he hasn't gotten away with anything.'","Judge Jean Boyd is facing an avalanche of criticism after sentencing Ethan Couch to 10 years probation for killing four people in a car crash .

"A drug, which could help problem drinkers reduce the amount of alcohol they consume, will become available to patients in the UK today. If dependent drinkers take the drug, nalmefene, while undergoing counselling they can cut their consumption levels by 61 per cent, the manufacturers have claimed. The pill, also known as Selincro, has been licensed for use by health officials and will be available for doctors to prescribe to their patients from today. A new drug, which could help alcoholics reduce the amount of booze they consume, will become available to patients in the UK today . The drug, which is to be taken once a day, has been licensed for ‘the reduction of alcohol consumption in adult patients with alcohol dependence without physical withdrawal symptoms and who do not require immediate detoxification’. While current drugs help patients to become entirely teetotal, nalmefene helps patients with drinking problems to cut back on the amount they drink. It works by modulating the reward mechanism in the brain which means that cravings are reduced and less satisfaction is gained from drinking. During a clinical trial into the drug it was shown to help patients cut the amount of alcohol they consumed from 12.75 units a day, to five units a day - a 61 per cent reduction. And patients who underwent counselling as well as taking the drug reduced their ‘heavy drinking days’ from 23 days a month to nine days a month, after undergoing the treatment for six months, researchers said. ‘The people who we saw in the study were not stereotypical alcoholics, most of them had families and jobs,’ said drug investigator Dr David Collier, of Barts and The London School of Medicine. If dependent drinkers take the drug, nalmefene, while undergoing counselling they can cut their consumption levels by 61 per cent . ‘For the majority, only they and those closest to them would have known that they had a problem with drinking. ‘The results of the studies suggest that nalmefene, in combination with counselling, is a potentially helpful new option for the many people like them in the UK who need some assistance in cutting down their drinking.’ The NHS cost for nalmefene is £42.42 for a supply of 14 tablets. During 2009 and 2010, one million hospital admissions were due to an alcohol-related conditions or injuries. However, recent figures show the number of people being admitted to hospital with liver problems as a result of alcoholism is rising dramatically. There were 14,886 admissions in hospitals in England between 2009 and 10, 15,858 in bertween 2010 and 11, and 16,865 between 2011 and 12. Health experts recommend that men have no more than three to four units and women two to three units a day. A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager, a small glass of wine or a single measure of spirits.","Nalmefene will be available to UK patients from today .

'No hurdle too big': Tom Yendell, who was born without arms caused by Thalidomide, a morning sickness drug with devastating side-effects, has become a world-renowned artist, painting with his mouth and feet . The artist and father-of-two, from Alton, Hampshire said: ‘Art is something I have always had a flare for. ‘Even when I was as young as four I’d be scribbling and painting away. ‘If you don’t have the use of your hands, your feet and mouth are naturally the next best things.’ From his purpose-built studio he creates works, hundreds of which have appeared on cards, wrapping papers and walls through the Mouth and Foot Painting Association.

Body art: The artists uses teeth, tongue, lips, head and feet to create more than 500 artworks he has created in his purpose-built studio in his garage . Mr Yendell, who has been a professional artist for 30 years, said: ‘You can use a combination of body parts - teeth, tongue, lips, the whole of your head and your feet - to perform different strokes. ‘I occasionally get cramp or muscle ache after a long period painting because you tense up when working on very intricate sections. ‘I’m not the most prolific of artists, preferring to spend a few solid days working on a piece than rush it.’ All-purpose art: Mr Yendell has been a professional artist for 30 years, producing artworks including this one, and hundreds have appeared on cards and wrapping paper through the Mouth and Foot Painting Association . Artist from a young age: Mr Yendell, pictured left with his mother sitting on a tricycle he could steer with his feet, and right as a young boy, said from four-years-old he used to paint and scribble away . Mr Yendell, pictured with his wife Lucy and a sample of his artwork, says sometimes he gets cramps or muscle ache when painting for long periods of time . The artist is one of just 466 babies out of 2,000 to survive the effects of Thalidomide and has released a book detailing his incredible life. He said: ‘Thalidomide was just one of those things that happen in life. You can’t do anything about it so it is better to get on with life and try and be a positive person. ‘I don’t see myself as somebody with a disability. Being born without arms has never been a problem for me, I just learn to adapt. ‘I don’t let anything stop me. Someone once described me by saying I wouldn’t play cricket for England, but I would probably play football for Spurs. That’s always been my attitude - just because one door is closed another will be open. Artistic destiny: Mr Yendell said once he found art, it was his 'calling' and has never let having no arms hold him back saying 'I just learn to adapt' to create his art including this pictured work . ‘I come from a very strong family. I was the youngest of five kids and having older siblings made life very normal - they treated me just the same as anyone else and didn’t go easy on me. ‘Once I found art at secondary school I knew it was my calling.’ Thalidomide, pictured, was prescribed for morning sickness but by the time it was pulled off the market 10,000 babies were born with a range of disabilities . The Thalidomide Trust says there are 458 . people currently in Britain affected by the drug, but that for every . Thalidomide baby that lived there were 10 that died. Thalidomide was originally prescribed as a 'wonder drug' for morning sickness, headaches, coughs, insomnia and colds. Thalidomide babies often suffered missing or deformed limbs and extreme shortening of arms and legs, but the drug also caused malformations of the eyes and ears, genitals, heart, kidneys and digestive system. By the time the drug was pulled from the market, more than 10,000 babies worldwide had been born with a range of disabilities caused by the drug. The German company, the Grunenthal Group, which invented the drug has issued its first apology in 50 years to thousands of people born with disabilities in early September. The Grunenthal Group said in a statement it 'regrets' the consequences of the drug used to combat morning sickness which led to the birth of children without limbs during the 1950s and 1960s. But British charity Thalidomide Agency UK, which represents victims of the drug in the UK, has rejected the apology as insufficient and demanded compensation. Freddie Astbury, the charity's head consultant, said Grunenthal needed to 'put their money where their mouth is' rather than simply express regret. VIDEO: Incredible!

"Possible danger: Chemical phthalates is used to soften plastics and can be found in children's toys . Chemicals found in every home may cause breast cancer, asthma, infertility and birth defects, global health chiefs said yesterday. They warn the gender-bending compounds – used in toys, PVC flooring, car dashboards and credit cards – have ‘serious implications’ for health. In a landmark report, the World Health Organisation suggested a ban might be needed to protect future generations. It says it is ‘reasonable to suspect’ chemical substances called phthalates of harming female fertility and linked them with rising rates of childhood illnesses including leukaemia. Also under suspicion is bisphenol A, . which is found in a host of daily items including tin cans and . sunglasses. The man-made compounds are thought to interfere with the . natural hormones that are key to our growth, development and overall . health. The WHO said there . was ‘very strong evidence’ in animals they can interfere with thyroid . hormones – something that can cause brain damage, stunted intelligence, . attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism. For prostate cancer ‘significant evidence’ exists of a link with agricultural pesticides. And . there was some evidence linking exposure in pregnancy to weight gain in . infants and children and potential links to breast cancer. In . the same report ten years ago, the UN agency said there was only ‘weak . evidence ’ that gender-bending chemicals were harming human health. Declaring the chemicals a global . threat, the new report’s authors said humans and animals were exposed to . hundreds of compounds, many of which have yet to be identified or . properly studied. Some are inhaled in dust, others make their way into . our bodies from food or simply licking our fingers. The . WHO stops short of saying the chemicals actually caused the illnesses . but did say that in some cases, the evidence was very strong. The report – State of the Science of . Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals – is the most comprehensive of its kind . because rather than focusing on one chemical or one illness, it . evaluates all the evidence. It . says: ‘The diverse systems affected by endocrine-disrupting chemicals . likely include all hormonal systems and range from those controlling . development and function of reproductive organs to the tissues and . organs regulating metabolism and satiety. ‘Effects . on these systems can lead to obesity, infertility or reduced fertility, . learning and memory difficulties, adult-onset diabetes or . cardiovascular disease, as well as a variety of other diseases.’ Report: The compounds, also found in PVC floors, can have 'serious implications' the World Health Organisation warned . Daily risks: The dangerous chemical is found in many objects we touch with out bare hand every day, such as credit cards and car dashboards . Worryingly, it warns the chemicals assessed so far by scientists may only be the ‘tip of the iceberg’ – and there could be many other potentially harmful compounds out there. It cautions that the key role of . hormones in the development of tissues and organs means that unborn . babies and young children may be particularly vulnerable. The . report – written over two years by international experts who collated . and weighted scientific studies on the topic – also states the rise in . some conditions is too rapid to be blamed on genes alone. ‘The prevalence of paediatric asthma . has more than doubled over the past 20 years and is now the leading . cause of child hospitalisations and school absenteeism,’ it said. ‘Certain birth defects, such as those of the male reproductive organs . are on the rise. The incidence of paediatric leukaemia and brain cancer . have risen, as has the incidence of testicular cancer. These are stark . health statistics.’ The WHO . says wildlife is also at risk and calls for much more research into the . chemicals and their effects – and says that there may be a case for . banning or restricting them. Dr Maria Neira, the WHO’s director for public health and environment, said: ‘The latest science shows that communities around the globe are being exposed to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and their associated risks. We all have a responsibility to protect future generations.’ Elizabeth Salter Green, of the campaign group CHEM Trust, said the EU was trying to tighten up the regulation of gender-bending chemicals but the UK was in favour of the least stringent measures. She added: ‘This report bears testimony to the on-going failure of regulatory agencies to reduce  exposure to hormone disrupting chemicals, which are implicated in the increased rates of hormone-related cancers and other diseases. ‘Thankfully, the EU is now trying to come to agreement on how to identify such hormone disrupting chemicals, so that they can be effectively regulated, but unfortunately the UK is trying to thwart this process in a bid to limit the number of chemicals that will fall under the regulatory axe.’ The Chemical Industries Association said it was important to note that naturally-occurring substances in beer, chocolate and coffee can have more powerful effects on the body’s hormones than man-made chemicals.","Phthalates is used to soften plastic and improve consistency of cosmetics .

"This is the 10,000-room hotel that has never had a guest. Situated on the island of Rügen in Germany, the Prora beach resort was built by Adolf Hitler between 1936 and 1939 as a striking show of Third Reich architecture. Yet the project was halted, with eight separate buildings having been erected, when the Nazi leader decided to focus on building more planes and war infrastructure. Scroll down for video . The monumental seaside resort of Prora in Rügen was built by the Nazis between 1936 and 1939 . Hitler pulled the plug when the job was half done as he decided it was more important to pump resources into the war effort . Prora was constructed on the Baltic island of Ruegen by the stormtroopers of the Nazi 'Strength Through Joy' leisure organisation over a six-year period and occupies nearly three miles of beachfront. It was meant to provide holiday entertainment for 20,000 of Hitler's hordes at any one time. But not a single Nazi ever got to stay there. The 'Colossus of Prora' was thought to have been Hitler's Nazi equivalent to Butlins, who began developing their holiday camps in 1936 throughout the UK. It was to be Hitler's reward to the workers who had toiled long hours for the Third Reich - a bucket-and-spade resort and fun for all the family. It was occupied after 1945 by the Red Army and became a top-secret Soviet base. After the war, the Soviets considered blowing it up, but discovered they didn't have enough dynamite for the job. Instead they turned it into a massive tank-and-artillery base for the People's Army of East Germany and it vanished from all maps. It is hoped a number of rooms will be sold to the elderly, while there are plans to build a smaller hotel on site . The hotel resort was meant to show off the class of Third Reich architecture - sadly it's been left to ruin . Prora was supposed to be the frontrunner of the Nazi's 'Strength Through Joy' leisure programme . A museum at the site chronicles the history of Prora which, aside from the building of the Atlantic Wall of coastal fortifications stretching from Norway to the border of Spain - intended to thwart any Allied landings in occupied Europe - was Hitler's biggest building project. The Nazis viewed leisure as just one more aspect of human activity to be governed by the party. The resort was meant to show off all the attributes Nazi leader Hitler wanted the people of Germany to demonstrate . Prora was destined to be the forerunner of a string of such giant camps whose plans were mothballed due to the war he unleashed on the world. The site is currently being sold off and renovated, in the hopes it will one day again be home to tens of thousands of people. Some of the buildings will be marketed as homes for the elderly, others luxury apartments, and still others as a 300 room hotel. From buildings built by the Nazis to ornate theatres, burnt out hotels and eerie sanatoriums, these are the abandoned buildings that still litter the powerhouse of Europe. Photographer Daniel Barter, 30, from London travelled to the German capital Berlin and the surrounding countryside to capture buildings in need of work on film. Far from being resplendent in vintage glory, the deserted music venues and crumbling hospitals are a shadow of their former selves.

"A Dallas police officer involved in the shooting of a mentally ill man, that was caught on camera, has been fired. Surveillance video shows Cardan Spencer was 20 feet away from paranoid schizophrenic Bobby Bennet when he shot him in the stomach. The police officer and his partner had maintained their story: that they were forced to shoot after the man threatened their safety by lunging at the pair with a knife. Officer Spencer has now been fired pending a criminal investigation after a neighbor released surveillance video capturing the incident that showed nothing documented in the police report actually happened. Scroll Down for Video . Caught on camera: Surveillance footage from a neighbor's security camera show two officers approaching Bobby Bennett, left . Injured: Bennett is pictured falling to the ground after being shot by an officer who claimed he lunged at him . Mr Bennett never raised his arms nor moved forward to approach the officers, yet just 20 seconds after the officers arrived he was shot in the abdomen four times. Bennett was charged with aggravated . assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Police Chief David . Brown announced that the charges would be dropped. Mr Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, said in an interview  that her 52-year-old son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and that he was off his medication at the time of the shooting. Ms Jackson said she was arguing with . Bennett when she called the police. She was told that officers who have . been trained in dealing with the mentally ill would arrive to assist . her. The officers arrived outside her . southeast Dallas home at about noon to find Mr Bennett sitting on a . chair in the street holding a knife. At this point, accounts of the . incident differ. Health problems: Bobby Gerald Bennett suffers from schizophrenia and is bipolar . Officer Spencer wrote in a police report that Mr Bennett refused to drop the knife and moved towards him and another officer 'in a threatening manner'. He said that was when he fired at Mr Bennett four times from about 20ft away, wounding him. The police had no idea that they were being filmed by a neighbors surveillance camera and the footage tells a different story. Although the police report says Mr . Bennett 'lunged' at the officers with a knife, in the video he stands up . from the chair but then doesn't appear to move at all until the gun is . fired and he falls to the ground. The . surveillance video doesn't include audio, and Officer Spencer wrote in . his report that Mr Bennett yelled at them, 'You all are gonna need more . officers than this!' But it doesn't show that the incident . 'escalated, which led an officer to fire his weapon upon the . individual', as police spokesman Warren Mitchell said in a statement a . few hours after the shooting. Officer Spencer's partner, Chris Watson, wrote in his police report that 'Bennet Stood Up and held the knife in his right hand . After being given verbal commands Watson wrote , 'Bennet took several steps towards us with the knife in a raised and aggressive manner.' It was a blatant lie. Police Chief David Brown has promised that Officer Spencer will be subjected to a 'thorough criminal investigation'. At a press conference Chief Brown all but apologized for his officers behavior. 'Officers are not above the law. We, as a police department, are not going to look the other way,' he said.George Milner, an attorney representing Bennett's family, spoke to reporters Thursday saying, 'What happened 10 days ago should have never have happened in the first place, and I want to make sure it never happens again.' Milner says Bennett was shot in 'cold blood,' according to the station. 'I don't see how he could not be charged with a crime, Milner reportedly said of Spencer. Ron Pinkston, the police union president, said a shooting investigation normally takes several months, but in Spencer's case was done in nine days 'because of the media and political pressure associated with it.' 'Spencer has a right to due process in a fair and impartial investigation,' Pinkston said. 'Because he's a police officer that right was taken away.' Jackson's attorney, George Milner, said Brown had no choice but to fire Spencer in light of the video. He also questioned whether there was a 'deficiency in training' that prompted the shooting and said there may have been negligence on the part of the Police Department. Officer Christopher Watson, who was with Spencer, is the subject of an internal police investigation, Brown said. Watson's explanation of the encounter with Bennett changed after he watched the video, Brown said. Brown added that the shooting has prompted him to consider equipping all officers with body cameras. Ms Jackson said she and her son had . been arguing about whether he could take an ink drawing of a rose he had . done for his late grandmother. The drawing is framed on the wall of her . home. The argument soon escalated to the point where Ms Jackson felt she needed police assistance. 'I'm devastated that I felt the need to call 911,' she said. Ms Jackson said her son struggled . with mental illness and often left her home to sleep on the streets, but . said he is an avid artist and reader and isn't violent. According to state criminal records, he was convicted of larceny, . vehicle theft and forgery in the 1980s but has no recent arrests. 'I was expecting help from someone that's a lot more knowledgeable than me,' she said. Mr . Mitchell, the police spokesman, declined to say whether the two . officers sent to Ms Jackson's home had any specific mental health . training. Ms Jackson, who . was inside her home when she heard four gunshots, said it was a . 'miracle' that her neighbor's camera recorded the incident. Otherwise, . 'I wouldn't have had a leg to stand on,' she said. Maurice Bunch installed the surveillance camera two years ago after a trailer was stolen from his driveway. Regrets: Bennett's mother, Joyce Jackson, says she wishes she hadn't called for help when her son become agitated after trying to take this picture from her home . 'The videotape just cries out for an independent investigation,' Bill Wirskye, a former high-ranking Dallas County prosecutor, told Dallas News. 'Maybe there’s something that’s not in the video that would justify the officer’s actions, but at least based on the videotape and the documentation that I’ve seen, it’s not a justified shooting.' Bennett remains hospitalized in stable condition. He initially was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on a public servant, but Brown announced last week that the charge would be dropped. Investigators interviewed Bennett in his hospital room last week and he told them he was suicidal at the time and wanted to be shot.","Cardan Spencer claimed that he fired at the man because of threatening behavior .

"A vast city built by the ancient Mayan civilisation and discovered nearly a century ago in modern day Guatemala is finally starting to yield its secrets - including a hint that apocalyptic predictions around the 'end' of the Mayan Calendar may be wrong. Excavating for the first time in the . sprawling complex of Xultzn in Guatemala's Peten region, archaeologists . have uncovered a structure that contains what appears to be a work space . for the town's scribe. Its walls are adorned with unique paintings - one depicting a line-up of men in black uniforms, and  hundreds of scrawled numbers - many calculations relating to the Mayan calendar, and stretching up to 7,000 years into the future. Scroll down for video: . The painted figure of a man - possibly a scribe - is illuminated in the doorway of the Mayan dwelling, which holds symbols never seen before . Angelyn Bass cleans and stabilizes the surface of a wall of a Maya house that dates to the 9th century A.D. A mysterious figure is shown painted on the wall in the foreground . Four long numbers on the north wall of the ruined house relate to the Maya calendar and computations about the moon, sun and possibly Venus and Mars; the dates may stretch some 7,000 years into the future. These are the first calculations Maya archaeologists have found that seem to tabulate all of these cycles in this way . Mayan temples in Guatemala: Researchers have found walls adorned with unique paintings - one depicting a line-up of men in black uniforms, and  hundreds of scrawled numbers - many calculations relating to the Mayan calendar . Never-before-seen artwork - the first to be found on walls of a Maya house - adorn the dwelling in the ruined city of Xultún . The Mayan sites in Guatemala have been investigated by scientists since the Seventies . The excavations, which were funded by National Geographic, have already revealed details about the Mayan calendar and the lives of the inhabitants which were previously unknown. One wall of the structure, thought to be a house, is covered with tiny, millimetre-thick, red and black glyphs unlike any seen before at other Mayan sites. Some appear to represent the various calendrical cycles charted by the Mayans - the 260-day ceremonial calendar, the 365-day solar calendar, the 584-day cycle of the planet Venus and the 780-day cycle of Mars. Four long numbers on the north wall of the ruined house relate to the Maya calendar and computations about the moon, sun and possibly Venus and Mars; the dates may stretch some 7,000 years into the future. ‘Why would they go into those numbers if the world is going . to come to an end this year?’ observed Anthony Aveni of Colgate University in . Hamilton, N.Y., an expert on Mayan astronomy. ‘You could say a number that big . at least suggests that time marches on.’ These are the first calculations Maya archaeologists have found that seem to tabulate all of these cycles in this way. Although they all involve common multiples of key calendrical and astronomical cycles, the exact significance of these particular spans of time is not known. Archaeologist William Saturno, of Boston University in the United States who led the exploration and excavation, said: ‘For the first time we get to see what may be actual records kept by a scribe, whose job was to be official record keeper. ‘It's like an episode of TV's 'Big Bang Theory,' a geek math problem and they're painting it on the wall. They seem to be using it like a blackboard.’The scientists say that despite popular belief, there is no sign that the Mayan calendar - or the world - was to end in the year 2012, just one of its calendar cycles. Anthony Aveni, professor of astronomy and anthropology at Colgate University, said: ‘It's like the odometer of a car, with the Maya calendar rolling over from the 120,000s to 130,000.‘The car gets a step closer to the junkyard as the numbers turn over; the Maya just start over.’ Archaeologist William Saturno of Boston University carefully uncovers art and writings left by the Maya some 1,200 years ago . Incriptions on Mayan tablets found in temples such as Tortuguero refer to 'the end' - and many internet conspiracy theories have predicted our world will be swallowed by a black hole, hit by an asteroid or devoured by ancient gods. But many ethnic Mayans dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea. Rather than the end of time itself, the inscriptions refer to the start of a new era. The 'apocalypse' refers to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C. The paintings represent the first Maya art to be found on the walls of a house. The walls reveal the oldest known astronomical tables from . the Maya. Scientists already knew they must have been keeping such records at . that time, but until now the oldest known examples dated from about 600 years . later. Astronomical records were key to the Mayan calendar, which . has gotten some attention recently because of doomsday warnings that it . predicts the end of the world this December. Experts say it makes no such . prediction. The new finding provides a bit of backup: The calculations include . a time span longer than 6,000 years that could extend well beyond 2012. Aveni, along with William Saturno of Boston University and . others, report the discovery in Friday's issue of the journal Science. The room, a bit bigger than 6-feet square, is part of a . large complex of Mayan ruins in the rain forest at Xultun in northeastern . Guatemala. The walls also contain portraits of a seated king and some other . figures, but it's clear those have no connection to the astronomical writings, . the scientists said. One wall contains a calendar based on phases of the moon, . covering about 13 years. The researchers said they think it might have been . used to keep track of which deity was overseeing the moon at particular times. Aveni said it would allow scribes to predict the appearance . of a full moon years in advance, for example. Such record-keeping was key to . Mayan astrology and rituals, and maybe would be used to advise the king on when . to go to war or how good this year's crops would be, he said. ‘`What you have here is astronomy driven by religion,’ he . said. On an adjacent wall are numbers indicating four time spans . from roughly 935 to 6,700 years. It's not clear what they represent, but maybe . the scribes were doing calculations that combined observations from important . astronomical events like the movements of Mars, Venus and the moon, the . researchers said. Why bother to do that? Maybe the scribes were ‘geeks ... who . just got carried away with doing these kinds of computations and calculations, . and probably did them far beyond the needs of ordinary society,’ Aveni . suggested. Experts unconnected with the discovery said it was a significant . advance. ‘It's really a wonderful surprise,’ said Simon Martin, . co-curator of an exhibit about the Mayan calendar at the University of . Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. While the results of the scribes' work were known from carvings . on monuments, ‘we've never really been able to identify a working space, or how . they actually went about things,’ Martin said. The new work gives insight into that, he said, and the fact . the room had a stone roof rather than thatching supports previous indications . that the scribes enjoyed a high social standing. ‘It's a very important discovery. We're only getting a . glimpse of it’ in the published paper, said John B. Carlson, director of the . Center for Archaeoastronomy in College Park, Md. ‘This is an intriguing start for this discovery.’ Xultzn, a 12 square mile site where tens of thousands once lived, was first discovered about 100 years ago by Guatemalan workers and roughly mapped in the 1920s by Sylvanus Morley, who named the site ‘Xultzn’ - ‘end stone.’ Scientists from Harvard University mapped more of the site in the 1970s. The house discovered by Prof Saturno's team was numbered 54 of 56 structures counted and mapped at that time. Thousands at Xultzn remain uncounted. The team's excavations reveal that monumental construction at Xultzn began in the first centuries B.C. The site thrived until the end of the Classic Maya period; the site's last carved monument dates to around 890 A.D. Prof Saturno saidd: ‘It's weird that the Xultzn finds exist at all. Such writings and artwork on walls don't preserve well in the Maya lowlands, especially in a house buried only a meter below the surface.’ Prof Aveni added: ‘The most exciting point is that we now see that the Maya were making such computations hundreds of years - and in places other than books - before they recorded them in the Codices.’ The findings were reported in National Geographic magazine and in the journal Science.","Wall covered in calculations relating to Mayan calendar .

"There's long been speculation regarding her paternal origin. But a new report by In Touch claims that Khloe Kardashian's real father is none other than Lionel Richie. A source told the publication that the reality star's mother Kris Jenner had an affair in the 'wild 1980s' with the Dancing On The Ceiling sensation and Khloe is the love child of their 'sexual affair'. Scroll down for video . Parentage speculations: New report claims that Khloe Kardashian's real father is none other than Lionel Richie . The insider claimed that Kris, now 58, enjoyed a fling with Lionel, 65, while still married to Robert Kardashian. 'They had a sexual affair - he bragged about it,' the source, who claims to be friends with Lionel, stated, 'He said he was on the outs with his wife at the time.' Adding: 'Everyone was sleeping around with everyone else back then, and Kris was hot in those days.' Wild Eighties: A source claims the reality star's mother Kris Jenner had an affair in the 'wild 1980s' with the Dancing On The Ceiling sensation and Khloe is the love child of their 'sexual affair' Posing up with 'daddy'? Kim, Kourtney, and Khloe pictured with Lionel in 2008 . The insider also gushed that Lionel's biological daughter (Nicole is adopted) 16-year-old Sofia 'looks like she could be Khloe's little sister.' While Jacky Jasper, founder of blog Diary Of A Hollywood Street King, told In Touch: 'Kris had an affair with Lionel - and I believe he is Khloe's dad.' And as far as the 'wild 1980s' goes, one of the momager's friends hairstylist Daniel DiCriscio told the publication: 'She was a big flirt and played around. I've seen Kris do things that would blow people away.' Sisters? Khloe, 30, and Lionel's biological daughter Sofia, 16, are the spitting image of one another . Out and about: Lionel pictured leaving e. Baldi Italian restaurant in Beverly Hills on Wednesday . Breaking bread: The singer enjoyed lunch with a blonde female friend . DiCriscio was also quick to note that Lionel was 'a huge player' at the time. Khloe told Gossip Cop after the report was published: 'I’ve had so many dads my head is spinning lol.' MailOnline has contacted the reps for Kris Jenner, Lionel Richie, and Khloe Kardashian for comment. Khloe, 30, was born in 1984, which was apparently the height of the 'swinging' 1980s in Hollywood. Trendy: He sported a checkered blue and white button-up with dark trousers and accessorized with silver cuff bracelets and hip shades . Gift of gab: Lionel appeared very focused upon the conversation . Meanwhile: Lionel's adopted daughter Nicole Richie was pictured in a royal blue ensemble in New York City on Wednesday . Kris has previously admitted to having an affair during her marriage to first husband Robert Kardashian in her tell-all book Kris Jenner and All Things Kardashian. 'Robert had been the only man in my life since I was 18,' she revealed in her book. Adding about the affair: 'I don’t know why I was having a mid-life crisis at 30, but I was. His name was Ryan, and he was a producer. We had wild sex everywhere, all the time.' Robert is said to have filed for divorce after catching Kris out at a restaurant with her lover. Pals: Khloe is friends with Sofia's adopted older sister Nicole Richie, pictured in 2011 at a Lakers game . In 2012 O.J. Simpson's manager spoke out to claim the jailed American Football star could be Khloe's father. However Pardo's allegations owe more to a hunch than any inside knowledge. 'Whenever I bring it up, he giggles,' he told In Touch at the time. While Kris and her then-husband Robert Kardashian were close to the Simpsons, this is the first time OJ had been named as a potential father to Khloe. Adamant: Khloe has previously insisted that only Robert and her Bruce Jenner are her father . Happier time: Robert passed in 2003 . Another claim of paternity: In 2012 OJ Simpson's manager spoke out to claim the jailed American Football star could be Khloe's father . Robert, however, and his family were close to Simpson after he served as a member of OJ's 'Dream Team' as his attorney in the famous 1995 murder trial. While Kris Jenner has openly admitted cheating on her former husband, she has always strongly denied any suggestion that Robert was not her daughter's father. 'I have never heard such crap in my life,' she told GMA in 2012. 'I was there, right. I gave birth, I know who the dad was. Everything’s good. We’re all good. It’s the family joke because Khloe was blonde and not dark-haired.' And while Khloe has slammed previous allegations regarding her parentage, she has herself questioned if she was adopted on the family's reality TV show. Viewers of Keeping Up With The Kardashians did see her question who her parents were in an episode in 2009. The reality star wanted to prove she was not adopted and tested the maternity of her mother Kris Jenner. Daddy's girl: Khloe pictured with her stepfather Bruce Jenner at a basketball game in 2013 .

"A worker at a halal abattoir has been sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep. The men could face prosecution for the ‘horrifying yet routine abuse’ captured by animal rights campaigners using hidden cameras. Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are seen ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice. The RSPCA slammed the 'absolutely shocking' footage amid renewed calls to ban halal slaughter, which is opposed by the British Veterinary Association and 100,000 people in an online petition. Sickening: A worker at a halal abattoir has been sacked and three others suspended after being filmed breaking strict rules on slaughtering sheep . Horrifying: The men could face prosecution for the 'routine abuse' captured by animal rights campaigners using secret cameras . Sheep at Bowood Lamb were filmed being kicked, lifted and hurled, with one worker recorded standing on a conscious sheep’s neck. Staff are also alleged to have erupted in laughter over a sheep bleeding to death with spectacles drawn around her eyes in green paint. Slaughtermen were allegedly filmed ‘taunting and frightening’ animals by waving knives, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. And instead of praying as the sheep were killed, the Muslim workers chatted as a radio ‘blared out Christmas songs’ and colleagues sang along. The footage has been released by Animal Aid campaigners and handed to the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to investigate. Slaughtermen at the Bowood Lamb abattoir in Thirsk, North Yorkshire, are allegedly seen ‘hacking and sawing’ at animals’ throats in apparent contravention of Islamic practice . Instead of praying as the sheep were killed, the Muslim workers chatted as a radio ‘blared out Christmas songs’ Secretly-placed hidden cameras were used to record practices during slaughter over a period of three days in December. Kate Fowler, head of campaigns at Animal Aid, said: ‘The vicious attacks on defenceless, frightened animals at Bowood are inexcusable. ‘All four conveyor operators we filmed over three days abused animals to varying degrees, while the slaughterers looked on unmoved.’ She added: ‘This is the 10th slaughterhouse in which we have filmed undercover, and it is the ninth to be caught breaking animal welfare laws. ‘None of the abuses we uncovered would have come to light without our cameras being in place, even though there is a Government-appointed vet at each slaughterhouse.’ The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers. Slaughtermen were filmed ‘taunting and frightening’ animals by waving knives, smacking them on the head and shouting at them. Under the halal code, animals are supposed to be killed quickly, with a single sweep of a surgically-sharp knife. They should not see the knife before they are slaughtered, or witness the death of other animals. The video footage appears to show that these rules were routinely flouted at Bowood, where more than 4,000 sheep were filmed being killed. The full dossier by the campaigners said: . Under UK law, slaughtered animals that have not been stunned must remain in position for at least 20 seconds after their throats are cut, to ensure loss of consciousness. But 86 per cent of the sheep at Bowood were moved before that amount of time had elapsed, some in as little as one second, claimed Animal Aid. It said many of the practices ‘defied expectations of what Muslims believe halal slaughter should be.’ In one horror killing, it appears that the men erupted in laughter as a sheep bled to death with green spectacles painted around its eyes . Slaughtermen wearing the traditional Muslim kufi skullcap and muttering the words 'Allahu Akbar' (God is great) were allegedly seen breaking rules in the way sheep were put down. Campaigners said they recognised the risks of stirring up anti-Muslim feeling but ‘witholding release of the footage would be a betrayal of our key mission to expose and combat animal cruelty'. A petition calling for non-stun slaughter to be banned has reached more than 105,000 signatures. Set up by organisations including the British Veterinary Association and RSPCA to improve animal welfare, it will now have to be debated by the Commons Backbench Business Committee after crossing the 100,000 threshold. Last year Prime Minister David Cameron has explicitly ruled out banning non-stun slaughter in a speech to the Israeli parliament. Kosher food also requires animals to be conscious when they are killed, although Animal Aid said no kosher meat was prepared in the Bowood Lamb slaughterhouse. Mr Cameron said last year: 'When people challenged Kosher Shechita I have defended it. I fought as a backbench Member of Parliament against the last attempt to do something to change this, and there is no way I’m allowing that to change now I’m Prime Minister – on my watch Shechita is safe in the United Kingdom.' The Muslim Council of Britain said the video was 'abhorrent' and against everything in Islam. 'Animal cruelty is wrong and criminal wherever it may occur,' a spokesman said. That it is being carried out in halal slaughter makes it even more incredulous. 'The findings certainly are abhorrent in Islamic practice, and the abattoir must be subject to the full force of the law. 'There are urgent questions this case raises: since each abattoir is under veterinarian supervision, how were these practices overlooked? We call on the Food Standards Agency to look into this abuse and the flagrant disregard of the very principles of humane slaughter as a matter of urgency.' An RSPCA spokesman said the footage from Bowood Lamb appeared to be 'absolutely shocking'. 'The public has a right to expect that all farmed animals have as painless and humane an end to their lives as possible,' she added. 'The RSPCA firmly believes CCTV in slaughterhouses can be a valuable tool to help improve animal welfare. The law requires abattoirs to stun animals before slaughter to prevent unnecessary suffering, but there are exemptions for Jewish and Muslim producers . Campaigners did not want to stir-up anti-Muslim feeling but felt withholding the footage would be a 'betrayal' 'Our concern [about non-stun slaughter] has nothing to do with the expression of religious belief but with the practice of killing by throat cutting without pre-stunning. 'We believe that meat produced from animals stunned or not stunned before slaughter should be clearly labelled to allow consumer choice.' The British Veterinary Association said the film was 'truly shocking' and blamed the government for not introducing EU regulations already used in Wales and Scotland. 'The government has delayed the introduction of the EU regulation Welfare of Animals at the Time of Killing (WATOK) which would require slaughterhouses to appoint an animal welfare officer,' a spokesman said. 'These abuses could have been prevented if a welfare officer had been present protecting the welfare of livestock. 'The BVA has long believed that slaughter without pre-stunning unnecessarily compromise animal welfare at the time of death. It affects millions of animals every year and action is long overdue.' The FSA, which regulates abattoirs, confirmed four slaughtermen have had their licences suspended and an investigation launched. A spokesman said: ‘The Food Standards Agency takes animal welfare at abattoirs very seriously which is why we immediately suspended the licences of the slaughtermen involved. ‘There is no excuse for treating animals in the way shown on the video and we are therefore investigating the footage with a view to prosecution. We are also continuing to investigate all the circumstances around the incident to ensure proper safeguards are introduced to stop this happening in the future.’ The halal market could be worth as much as £2billion a year, with more than 100 million animals killed using the method annually. A statement issued by Bowood Lamb's solicitors said: 'Bowood Lamb makes animal welfare its highest priority. We set very high standards for the way in which animals that pass through our premises are treated. 'It is highly regrettable that one of our slaughtermen fell below those standards. As soon as we were aware of this failing we dismissed this staff member for gross misconduct. 'Currently three other members of staff have had their licences suspended because Animal Aid claims that they have committed technical infringements of the regulations relating to religious slaughter. 'We will await the outcome of any investigation relating to their suspension.' The statement said the real problem was Defra rules relating to animal conveyer belts and attacked Animal Aid for 'breaking into our plant' - a claim the campaigners firmly deny. 'Bowood Lamb is surprised that Animal Aid targeted our premises, given the stated aim of their campaign is to encourage CCTV in abattoirs,' the statement said. 'Bowood Lamb has had CCTV in our premises for over four years. 'We cannot condone Animal Aid breaking into our plant and undermining the strict hygiene controls we have in place.'","Slaughtermen caught on camera 'hacking and sawing' at animals' throats .

"Another day, another debut at the Nou Camp, this time for midfielder Sergi Samper. But what's the story on Barcelona's latest youth-team star made good? He's only 19 but Barcelona have already tied him down until 2017. That tells you how highly they rate him. He's been at the club since he was six and, judging from Wednesday night's first senior game, he is going to be around for a long time - and not be snatched by Arsene Wenger! Well that is the concern that has made the club make sure his contract is in order. Coach Luis Enrique has shown even more willingness to blood youngsters than Pep Guardiola did and he is a big Samper fan so there is no chance of a move to Arsenal, or Tottenham for that matter – Andre Villas Boas was keen when he was still at White Hart Lane. Sergi Samper impressed for Barcelona in the Champions League on Wednesday evening . What sort of player is he? On Wednesday he played in Sergio Busquets holding midfield position. His strength is in keeping possession but not at the expense of moving the ball forward purposefully. His touch and weight of pass – honed during those 13 years at the club - are what really make him stand out. He also sniffs out danger, anticipating the runs and passes of the opposition, proving you don't have to be physically imposing to play the position as long as you are clever. Sergi Samper has been compared to Sergio Busquets and will challenge him for a first-team place . Is he in the team for good now? No. He will lead the Barca B team in Spain's second division this season and only make a handful of appearances in the first team. But next season – and remembering that Barcelona cannot make signings for one year – he will step up to the seniors and compete with Busquets for that central midfield berth. Sergi Samper has impressed for Barcleona's B team in recent seasons . Sergi Samper has impressed with his reading of the game and his passing ability . But his debut went well? He brought the house down with one steal, pirouette and pass all in one movement. He admitted post match: 'When I saw I was starting I got nervous but I soon calmed down and Xavi and Luis Enrique told me just to play as always have done in the youth teams.' Starting out at Barcelona at six – that really must be a record? As has been pointed out it takes the term 'one-club man' to new levels. Barcelona usually scour Catalonia and the rest of Spain for the best young talent but Samper has been one of theirs from the beginning. He's a symbol of what's healthy about their youth system. They'll be keen for people to remember that as they take their appeal over that transfer ban for breaking UEFA rules on signing Under-18s to the Court of Arbitration. Seems like a transfer ban wouldn't actually hurt them a great deal if this is what they have coming through? That's what some of their supporters are saying: More Sampers and less 17m euro Alex Songs.","Samper impressed during Barcelona's 1-0 win over Apol Nicosia .

"Plans for TV debates ahead of next year’s General Election are in chaos, with growing doubts over whether they will take place. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has been offered a slot in one of the debates under plans unveiled by broadcasters yesterday. One debate would be be a straight fight between Tory David Cameron and Labour's Ed Miliband, a second debate will also feature Lib Dem Nick Clegg, but in the third Mr Farage will also join the line-up. But the plans were immediately plunged into chaos amid threats of legal action, with the Lib Dems opposing any attempt to exclude Mr Clegg, Ukip suggesting Mr Farage should be included in more than one and the Greens and Respect demanding a place. Scroll down for video . Ukip leader Nigel Farage, pictured in Westminster, has been offered a coveted slot in a TV debate alongside Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg . David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband have been urged to sign up to the debates but there remain doubts about the details . More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time political leaders had gone head-to-head in Britain. The debates form a traditional part of US Presidential elections, but critics said they risked sucking the life out of the wider campaign. The decision to offer Mr Farage a place in one of the debates is likely to prove controversial, but the broadcasters said they are 'responding to the changes in the political landscape'. Ukip won its first elected MP - Douglas Carswell - in last week's Clacton by-election and aims to secure a second seat in Rochester and Strood. One opinion poll yesterday put Ukip on 25 per cent, just behind Labour and the Tories tied on 31 per cent. In theory, this level of support could give Ukip 128 MPs. Under the plans, Channel 4 and Sky News will host a debate between Mr Miliband and Mr Cameron, hosted by former Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman. This is likely to appeal to the Conservatives, who want to present the next election as a straight choice over who should be the next Prime Minister. Polls suggest fewer than one in five voters think Mr Miliband should be PM. Mr Cameron said: 'I will have a look at this proposal. I think there are some questions over it. 'Why have all the debates inside the election campaign, rather than spreading them out over a longer period? And also, why include some parties and not other parties?' Mr Cameron suggested that he would only be willing to take part in a debate against Mr Farage if other minor parties are included, such as the Greens. 'I'm in favour of TV debates, but you've got to make sure you come up with a proposal that everyone can agree to, and I can't see how you can have one party in that has an MP in Parliament, and not another party. 'I'm sure clever people can get together and sort these issues out, but they do need to take these sorts of points into account.' The PM also repeated his suggestion that any debate should begin before the official election period, to avoid overshadowing the rest of the campaign. Mr Farage welcomed the offer, but suggested that he should be included in more than one debate . The BBC is planning to host a debate, chaired by David Dimbleby, between Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg – a repeat of the three-way format seen in 2010. ITV will host a four-way debate, including Mr Farage for the first time. It would hosted by ITV presenter Julie Etchingham. John Ryley, head of Sky News, said: 'There are only 24 weeks to go before the start of the General Election Campaign. 'Sky, Channel Four, the BBC and ITV have put together a clear compelling proposal; three debates during the election campaign. It's now critical that the political parties engage and start negotiating for the debates seriously.' The 2010 general election saw Britain's first live TV debates between the main party leaders, with Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown going head-to-head with Tory leader Mr Cameron and the Lib Dems' Mr Clegg. More than 20million people watched the TV debates in 2010, the first time party leaders had gone head-to-head in a general election campaign . As the least known leader at the three, Mr Clegg was seen as the big winner of the first of the three debates, with his poll ratings rocketing to record levels. Senior figures in the Conservative party fear allowing Ukip to take part could see Mr Farage benefit in the same way, depriving them of an overall majority in what is certain to be another close election. Mr Clegg has previously accused the Tories of refusing to sign up to the debates because of concern about giving Ukip a publicity boost. The Lib Dems welcomed moves to ensure the debates happened again, but opposed any attempt to exclude Mr Clegg. A spokesman said: 'The Liberal Democrats, like the Labour Party, have publicly said that we would be prepared to sign up to the same 3-3-3 system we had in 2010. 'We do not accept the proposal that the Liberal Democrats, as a party of government, should be prevented from defending our record in one of the TV debates. 'That is the case we will make strongly in the negotiations that will now take place and we urge the other parties to join us around the negotiating table without excuse or delay.' A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'We note the request and will respond accordingly.' Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP . Mr Miliband welcomed the proposals as a 'positive step forward' . He added: 'I hope David Cameron is not going to put up false obstacles to these TV debates happening. 'He should be saying they will happen, they must happen during the campaign. For my part, I'm going to make sure they do.' He added: 'I think they are a good basis for moving forward. I think the most important thing is to give the public what they are entitled to, which is these TV debates. 'They happened at the last general election, we must make sure they happen in this general election too.' Both the Green party and Respect - which like Ukip have each an one MP - demanded to be included alongside Mr Farage. Mr Cameron questioned how it would be possible to include one party with a single MP – Ukip – but exclude the Greens and Respect, who also each have one member of the Commons. ‘I will have a look at this proposal. I think there are some questions over it,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘Why have all the debates inside the election campaign, rather than spreading them out over a longer period? And also, why include some parties and not other parties?’ Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood added: ‘The people of Wales deserve nothing less than to hear what all parties have to offer them and we will be taking immediate steps to ensure that this happens.’ Only Mr Miliband welcomed the proposals as a ‘positive step forward’. ‘I hope David Cameron is not going to put up false obstacles to these TV debates happening,’ he said. Katie Ghose, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for democratic reform, criticised broadcasters for seeking to exclude smaller parties. She said: ‘The format suggested by the broadcasters doesn’t really reflect the fact that we are now firmly in a multi-party era.’ Respect MP George Galloway threatened legal action to be included in the debates, along with Green party MP Caroline Lucas . Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said: 'With these proposals the broadcasters are demonstrating just how out of touch they are with the public mood, and how ridiculously they cling to the idea that the future of politics looks like the past. 'It is clear from votes and polls that the public are fed up with the three business-as-usual parties and are looking around for alternatives. 'That is also demonstrated by the soaring membership of the Green parties of England and Wales and Scotland, now exceeding 27,000. 'Those members, the fast-growing numbers of likely Green voters (matching Lib Dems numbers), and the majority who back Green policies like bringing the railways back into public hands and the living wage for all workers would be seriously short-changed by debates from which we were excluded.' Respect MP George Galloway later wrote on Twitter: 'I am ready to join Caroline Lucas MP in a legal challenge against our exclusion from the leaders debates in the forthcoming general election.'","TV firms unveil details of three debates ahead of general election in May .

"Jose Mourinho's former assistant at Real Madrid Aitor Karanka has lavished praise on the Chelsea manager, explaining how the Portuguese boss ended Barcelona's La Liga dominance and the 'love' which the squad at the Bernabeu held for him. Middlesbrough boss Karanka also believes Mourinho's successor, Carlo Ancelotti, is held in the same high esteem by his 'far superior' side as the Portuguese was during his time there. Karanka is extremely positive in his views on his former boss, and puts a lot of his own success down to his mentor's teaching and principles. Jose Mourinho has been hailed as the 'best coach in the world' by former assistant Aitor Karanka . Karanka (right) and Mourinho, during Real Madrid training in 2010, won La Liga in 2011-12 . Mourinho is carried off the pitch by his players in April 2011, who Karanka believes 'loved' him . In a wide-ranging interview with newspaper ABC, published by AS, Karanka said: 'He (Mourinho) is the best coach in the world. He has shown it. And tactically he is a hundred steps ahead of the others. 'He came (to Madrid) after stopping Barcelona before, with Inter (Milan). Barca had won six titles and Jose stopped them. If not for him, they would have repeated another six titles.' During their time at Madrid together, Mourinho and Karanka won La Liga once and the Copa del Rey, in the process ending Barca's dominance of the Spanish title. And the 41-year-old has been impressed with the man who replaced Mourinho, Ancelotti. Carlo Ancelotti, pictured in May, is also 'loved' by his players like Mourinho, says Karanka . Ancelotti led Real to their 10th European Cup - La Decima - and Serigo Ramos kisses the trophy in May . The Italian won the Champions League in his first season at the Bernabeu, finally achieving La Decima - Real's 10th European Cup victory. Such a victory has, in Karanka's opinion, elevated Ancelotti to the same place in the hearts of Real players and fans as Mourinho. Speaking about Ancelotti, Karanka added: 'They play very well. They are far superior to the rest (of the teams in Europe). Madrid finally won the Decima (their 10th European Cup) and removed the anxiety that they felt for many years. 'Ancelotti is a good manager of the group. Also, I look at him and I learn. The players love him, like they love Mourinho. It was said that he didn't talk to the squad but that was a lie. Iker (Casillas) has said that Jose cared for him every day.' After leaving Madrid in 2013, Karanka took on his first managerial job on Teesside and has achieved some success so far. Karanka has praised Mourinho and believes he has learned a lot of important traits from the Portuguese . Boro currently sit joint-second in the Championship, despite operating on a low budget, and Karanka has adapted to the job extremely quickly. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, he attributes a lot of that to Mourinho's guidance, as well as the three players he has been able to loan from Chelsea - defender Kenneth Omeruo, midfielder Patrick Bamford and goalkeeper Jamal Blackman. 'From Mourinho I learned that what is fundamental is that the players feel happy. He supported me a lot to come here (to Middlesbrough). He told me that it was a good place to grow and to fulfil myself. 'Chelsea have loaned us three footballers. After each match we speak and exchange messages. He gives me advice - the best that he has given me, since I worked with him during those three wonderful years at Real Madrid, is that the team is above individuals.' Middlesbrough sit joint-second in the Championship and Karanka has done an excellent job so far .","Jose Mourinho is 'best coach in the world' says ex-assistant Aitor Karanka .

"The husband of a woman killed in a tragic car crash in Indonesia says he sees the killer as his son. Jake Drage, 23, from Geraldton, Western Australia, has been in custody since the June 30 crash, which claimed the life of West Java woman Kokom who was riding pillion on her teenage daughter's motorcycle. A West Java court will decide on Thursday  whether Drage, 23, from Western Australia, will spend up to six years in jail for the June crash. Jake Drage, 23, has been in custody since the June 30 crash, which claimed the life of a West Java woman . A West Java court will decide on Thursday whether Jake Drage, 23, will spend up to six years in jail for the June crash that claimed the life of a local mother, Kokom . The verdict was due last week but at the last minute, the chief judge was called away. Drage's team saw the delay as a good sign, and hopes the court will release him on Thursday. Kokom's husband, Iim, has attended each of Drage's six court appearances, in disbelief at how it ever came to this. Mr Iim never wanted the ex-personal trainer charged, and doesn't blame him for the collision that threw his wife off the back of a motorbike controlled by their teenage daughter, Mela. 'I care about him so much ... he's like our son,' he said . 'It's too sad what's happening with him. Many times, I can't help myself and I cry on seeing him.' Prosecutors in the case have argued Drage was overtaking a small truck at such a speed it made the crash unavoidable. They have argued for 18 months jail. Drage had been in Sumatra before his Indonesian adventure took him to the surfing town of Cimaja, West Java. On his second day there, he says, he rescued a woman from Jakarta who was in trouble in the surf. He was on his way to see her again, on his third day in town, when Mela's bike appeared in his path. Their handlebars clipped, flinging Kokom on to the road. Drage's trial heard how on seeing the blood on the asphalt, he screamed 'Oh my God'. Kokom was rushed to hospital where she was pronounced dead. Mr Iim said he doesn't blame Drage for the collision that threw his wife off the back of a motorbike . Prosecutors in the case have argued Drage was overtaking a small truck at such a speed it made the crash unavoidable . Mr Iim says the fact the Drage didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything . For Mr Iim, the fact this young Aussie didn't try to dodge responsibility counts for everything. 'He didn't run away, they've helped us with many things, that's enough for us,' he said. Mr Iim's relative Andika Hidayat was called to help Drage after the crash because no one else could speak English, including the police. On meeting the distraught Australian, he says he 'just knew' he was a good person. Until Drage's Western Australia-based mother Tiena arrived with a lawyer, Mr Andika ensured Drage was coping in police custody, sending food and company. Tiena Drage has also been sheltered by the community throughout the four-month ordeal. She first reached out to Mr Iim's family to pay for the funeral, but their friendship has grown since. At the most recent court date, they sat as one group, chatting and joking to lighten the mood. Mr Andika says for him, it makes sense for the families to unite. Sixteen-year-old Mela is missing a mother, and Ms Drage is missing her child. 'It's like all the children have a new mum because she's like mum to them,' he said. 'But three and a half months Jake's been in jail now. In my opinion, he shouldn't be.'","Jake Drage, from Geraldton, Western Australia, has been in custody since the June 30 crash which claimed the life of West Java woman Kokom .

"Barack Obama looks set to make history next week as the president with the worst successive results in midterm congressional elections in more than 60 years. Obama's Democratic Party lost 63 House seats in 2010 and is expected to lose a further five to 12 when votes come in next week, although some speculators suggest the result could be even worse. He stands to lose a combined total of somewhere between 68 to 75 House seats - the worst total of any two-term president since Harry Truman shed 55 House seats in 1946 and a further 28 in 1950 - a total of 83. Call me a taxi: Obama looks set to suffer the worst successive midterm defeats of any US President in 60 years . The only glimmer of hope for Obama is that if he exceeds expectations he has a chance of beating the  record of Republican Dwight Eisenhower, who lost a combined 66 House seats in 1954 and 1958. By contrast George W Bush lost a combined 22 seats (30 in 2002 but up eight in 2006), Bill Clinton lost a combined 49 (54 in 1994 but up five in 1998) while Ronald Reagan lost a combined 31 (26 in 1982 and five in 1986). And it doesn't get much better for Obama in the Senate where he expected to lose between five and ten seats next week, taking his combined losses to somewhere between 11 and 16 seats. That would compare to a total of five seats for George W Bush, eight for Bill Clinton and seven for Ronald Reagan. Eisenhower lost a total of 13 Senate seats in his two midterms and Truman a whopping 17. Dwight Eisenhower, left,  lost a combined 66 House seats in 1954 and 1958, while Harry Truman, right, shed 55 House seats in 1946 and a further 28 in 1950 - a total of 83 . For the Republicans the big question next week is whether they can gain enough House seats to rival their post-World War II high water mark of 246. The current breakdown is 233-199 in favor of the Republicans, with three vacancies. Republicans have their eyes on states where Obama cruised to double-digit victories, with the Democrats fighting to cling on to the once friendly terrain of New York, California, Obama's native state of Hawaii, and his adopted state of Illinois. 'We're in trench warfare. I'm not going to sugarcoat it,' said New York Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Bogeyman: Obama's slumping approval ratings have been a drag on Democrats, and he has kept a relatively low profile during the campaign period . Obama, whose slumping approval has been a drag on Democrats in the fiercely-fought congressional elections, has limited his campaign appearances mostly to races for governors in states where he remains popular. In Maine he is keeping his distance so as not to get drawn in to the current controversy over the state's Ebola quarantine policies and the nurse who has defied them. Hot issue: The treatment of Ebola nurse Kaci Hickox is threatening to unseat the Democrats in Maine . His appearance there on Thursday landed him at the epicenter of a debate between the federal government and several states over how health care workers returning from Ebola-stricken nations should be monitored. The White House has pushed back against overly restrictive measures, including proposals for travel bans or isolation measures adopted by some states. Obama, who has been praising health care workers who have volunteered to fight Ebola in West Africa, had no plans to visit with Kaci Hickox, the nurse who worked with Ebola victims in Sierra Leone and is now challenging Maine's requirement that she isolate herself for 21 days. Hickox returned to the U.S. last week but has shown no symptoms of the disease. She has been under what the state has called a voluntary quarantine in remote northern Maine, but on Thursday she went on a bike ride with her boyfriend. The elections feature races for governor in 36 states, although those contests have been overshadowed by competitive congressional races. The fight for control of the Senate is the biggest prize in the midterm elections, with Democrats struggling to fend off a Republican takeover. The Republicans need to pick up six seats to take control of the Senate, and they are widely expected to expand their majority in the House of Representatives. That would give them control of Congress for the two years Obama has left in office.","Obama's Democrats lost  63 seats in 2010, expected to lose  five-12 next week .

"She is the fierce MI6 boss known only by the codename M. But now the true identity of James Bond’s mentor has finally been revealed – after a bit of sleuthing of which 007 himself would have been proud. An eagle-eyed fan managed to freeze-frame a single camera shot in Skyfall lasting just a split-second and discovered that M’s real name is Olivia Mansfield. Eagle-eyed: The true identity of James Bond's mentor has emerged.  M’s real name is Olivia Mansfield. She is currently played by Judi Dench, right, with Daniel Craig, left, playing Bond . During the scene, Bond, played by Daniel Craig, is handed a box containing a Royal Doulton bulldog draped in a British flag, which is usually kept on M’s desk. Zooming in on the box’s inscription, the words ‘From the Estate of Olivia Mansfield Bequeathed to James Bond’ are visible. Since the revelation by blogger Phil Noble Jr, internet forums have been filled with  speculation about the significance of the name. One theory is that it is a tribute to Mansfield Smith-Cumming, the first head of MI6 who started the tradition of the organisation’s director signing letters with a single letter – in his case C. Revelation: When James Bond is given M's china bulldog after her death in Skyfall, M's real name is shown on the box .

Meg Simmons, archive director for Bond production company Eon, said: ‘We’ve searched around and as far as we can see this is the first and only time anyone’s ever revealed M’s real name. ‘It may not have been spoken, but if you were watching on a big enough screen it could have been visible, so we’d argue it’s now canon.’ Since Dame Judi Dench became the . franchise’s first female spymaster in 1995, producers have dropped a . series of hints about the character’s name.

"Imran Khan's new wife is in emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician, a friend said today. Former BBC weather girl Reham Khan married the 62-year-old last month in a secret ceremony that has provoked hostile reaction in Pakistan, online and from his own family. Some social media users have accused Mrs Khan of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop. A producer at Dawn TV, a Pakistan-based private news channel where Mrs Khan works, today told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'. The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed. 'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. Scroll down for video . Pakistan cricketer-turned politician Imran Khan speaks out against his critics in a press conference at his home in Islamabad (left) after secretly marrying former BBC weather girl Reham Khan (right) 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants:' Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride after reaction to the marriage was negative in Pakistan and on social media . He confirmed last night that he had wed 41-year-old divorced mother-of-three days after his family said he had denied it. His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. But speaking from his home in Islamabad today, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.' He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision. The 62-year-old, who divorced heiress Jemima Goldsmith in 2004, said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small. 'I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.' Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend. Mr Khan insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision about marriage . Ms Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport last night before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.' Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback. Denial: Imran Khan's sister Aleema said the family had a showdown with the politician and he denied the secret marriage . 'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her. 'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'. She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.' Khan's new wife lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme South Today. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. It is believed family members and those in his political party tried talking him out of the marriage. Online abusers also set up Facebook hate pages attacking the TV news anchor. News of the  union sparked outrage in Pakistan and trolls have now accused Ms Khan of being a lesbian for stroking a woman's back, and attempted to shame her for going to parties. Users have criticised her for wearing short skirts, lambasted her for dancing with unknown men in public, and branded her daughter a 'pornstar' while claiming to be in possession of topless pictures. One image even claims to show Ms Khan in a sex shop in the UK wearing a pink nightdress, with a collar around her neck and a whip slung over her shoulder. Imran Khan arrives at Heathrow Airport last week when, at the time, he said rumours he had married were 'greatly exaggerated' Backlash: Hate groups have already sprung up on Facebook where users have been sharing photos of her dancing and going out with friends while making abusive comments . Among the images posted by online abusers was this photograph, which they claim shows Ms Khan in a sex shop, wearing a night dress, suspenders, a collar and with a whip over her shoulder . Mr Khan's sister Aleema earlier branded the reports of marriage lies, saying they had been concocted by Mr Khan's political enemies to damage his reputation. Online trolls have attacked Ms Khan for her appearance, dancing with unknown men, and attending parties . She told MailOnline: 'This is the only way the opposition know how to attack him. These are the tactics they would stoop to. It's out of control. I guess that is politics. 'I spoke to my brother a few days ago and he said it isn't true. 'We, the family, just asked him outright, have you married her? And he said no. I don't know if they are in a relationship, here [in Pakistan] you are either getting married or you are not. 'We'd be extremely happy if he marries a good person and settles down, of course we would. But it is not just his consideration, it's a consideration for the country, it's like a national-level decision. 'There are people in Pakistan who love him so much that everyone wants to participate in his private life, they feel he is their leader and should be part of his decision. 'Everybody [we, the family] are taken aback at how much other people want to participate in this decision.' Asked if her brother is in a secret relationship with the TV broadcaster, she said: 'It's a confusing signal to everyone who follows him [but] we asked him if he was married and he said no. I don't know if he is in a relationship. We just asked him if he was married.' Reaction to the rumoured marriage had been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country. Khan (left) divorced heiress Jemima Goldsmith (right) in 2004, after nine years of marriage . The 41-year-old lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on BBC regional news programme South Today . Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.' Imran married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995. She had converted to Islam prior to their wedding and had learned Urdu and started to wear traditional Pakistani clothes.","Pakistan cricketer-turned-politician secretly married Reham Khan, 41 .

"Jake Beattie, eight, died after being hit by a 4WD on Monday at The Ponds in Sydney's north west . An eight-year-old boy, who was riding his bike to the park alongside his best friend, has died after being hit by a four-wheel drive. Jake Beattie was wearing a helmet and riding on the road at The Ponds in Sydney's north west on Monday afternoon when he rode through a give-way sign, according to Nine News. Levi Masi watched on helplessly as the car struck down his best friend at 5:45pm. Paramedics were immediately called to the scene where they desperately worked on Jake through the pouring rain. Neighbours who were arriving home from work at the time told Fairfax Media that the driver of the four-wheel drive, a 32-year-old woman, was seen crying and distraught.

"It is not unusual for people to have rituals when flying on a plane, like wearing a St Christopher chain or keeping their eyes closed until they take off. But one passenger took his beliefs a step further by covering himself in a plastic bag for the whole of his journey because his religion forbids him to fly over cemeteries. This was the bizarre sight that greeted plane passengers when an Orthodox Jewish man covered himself under a plastic sheet. It was believed the man is a Kohein, a religious descendant of the priests of ancient Israel, who are banned from flying over cemeteries. Sight to see: This photo of a man who appears to be an Orthodox Jew shows him seated aboard a plane while wrapped in a plastic bag, drawing controversy and question on what for . Kohanim (plural of Kohein) are the male-line descendants of the priests of ancient Israel. Descendants are shunned from flying over cemeteries and being in contact with the dead. Contact with the dead is believed to inflict him with impurity. Why a plastic bag? Some consider that the bag provides a potential barrier from the impurities/dead . How can they breathe? Pre-punched holes invalidate the barrier . If the kohein is putting on the bag and it accidentally rips some leniency to breathe is provided . Contact with the dead would consequently inflict him with impurity. Problems: . Flights have been delayed or turned around because of the ensuing safety hazards . The passengers would not be able to reach an oxygen mask or quickly escape the plane in the event of an emergency . Many wrap themselves in plastic bags as a compromise measure. The startling photograph, which has now gone viral after being posted on Reddit, shows fellow passengers straining over their seats to get a look. Beneath his plastic wrapping, the man is dressed entirely in black, and appears to be wearing a Jewish skullcap or 'kippah'. As a controversial solution - not entirely allowed by those in the Jewish Orthodox - the plastic bag creates a kind of barrier between the Kohein and the surrounding tumah, or impurity. Rabbi Jeffrey W. Goldwasser, of  Temple Beit HaYam in Israel, explained: 'In orthodox and Conservative communities, Kohanim are expected to abstain from coming in contact with the dead, which includes a prohibition on visiting cemeteries except for the funerals of close relatives.' Even if they can be secured by a seat belt, the passengers wouldn't be able to reach an oxygen mask or quickly escape the plane in the event of an emergency. There is also the question of how they can breathe. Pre-punched holes in the plastic are said to invalidate the barrier, according to Jewish newspaper YatedNe'eman. Way around it? Israel's Ben Gurion airport is surrounded by small regional cemeteries, dotted in red, creating long concern for Orthodox Jews trying to fly into the airport . 'Only if when the kohein is putting on this bag it accidentally rips can there be some leniency,' the article claims. 'Kohanim have a duty to protect their taharah, purity,' according to the article. 'They have been bestowed with extra kedushah which makes them worth of being meshorsei Hashem. At times, there may be extra demands made upon them in order to maintain that standard of kedushah and taharah.' Some flights go to great lengths to take specific paths to avoid cemeteries. And passengers can also be made aware in advance if a body will be aboard the plane in cargo. The photograph, which was posted on the Reddit yesterday, had a caption which read: 'An Orthodox Jew in an airplane with women - so he covers himself with a plastic bag...' A strict code of conduct prevents Orthodox Jewish men and women from mixing in public, with Israeli airline El Al seeing an increase in the number of religious men demanding to be reseated away from women in recent years. An El Al Airline plane. The Orthodox Jewish passenger who wore a plastic bag is thought to have travelled from Tel Aviv, Israel with the airline . While ultra-Orthodox Jews do follow to strict guidelines which include gender segregation in public, it is claimed this photograph does not show that. One user of the Reddit site wrote: 'This has nothing to do with women. He is a cohen, descendant from the high holy priests of the temple and they are not allowed to walk into or fly over a cemetery, which would render them impure.' It is not known when the photograph was taken, or what airline the man was travelling on, but it is more than likely it was an El Al aircraft flying out of Tel Aviv, which is surrounded by a number of cemetries, according to internet users. In 2001, El Al Airlines decided not to allow ultra-Orthodox Jews cover themselves in plastic because 'flight safety considerations do not allow for passengers to board while covered in sealed plastic bags.' A year later it was reported that flight crew got into an argument with a passenger who attempted to fly wrapped in plastic. The confrontation eventually led the pilot to turn the plane around. One woman even sued the airline after staff moved her to the back of a plane when an ultra-Orthodox man refused to sit next to her.","An Orthodox Jewish plane passenger was seen wrapped in a plastic bag during a flight .

"Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has remarried in secret to a former BBC weather girl, according to reports in Pakistan. The 62-year-old is believed to have tied the knot at the weekend with Pakistani news anchor Reham Khan, 41, who is a divorced mother-of-three. She lived in Britain for part of her previous marriage, when she was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme ‘South Today’. Rumours have been circulating for several months that the pair are an item, and there have been reports in recent days that they are now married. Scroll down for video . Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, pictured right, is believed to have married former BBC weather girl Reham Khan, pictured left . Ms Khan  was a weather girl and presenter on the BBC regional news programme ‘South Today’ (pictured) Imran Khan’s ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’ The couple are yet to make an official announcement – which will apparently be forthcoming in the new year - but sources close to them have confirmed they are married. Another well-known news anchor in Pakistan, Farhat Javed Rabani, Tweeted on December 27: ‘Ahmmm... an anchor has married a politician today... ‪#WeddingBells’ A family friend said that relatives including his sisters were against the marriage and were surprised he went ahead. Imran Khan, pictured left, has been single since he divorced Jemima Goldsmith, pictured right, 10 years ago . It is believed family members and those in his political party tried talking him out of the marriage. Leading political commentator Dr Shahid Masood, who is a close friend of Imran Khan, said on television that Imran neither confirmed nor denied the news. He added that members of Imran’s political party, Tehreek-e-Insaf, confirmed that Reham wants to get actively get involved with his politics and sees herself a future first lady. Dr Masood has urged Imran to issue an official statement. Reaction to the rumoured marriage has been very negative in Pakistan and there has been a backlash on social media. Photos of Reham in revealing clothes and a video of her doing a tango while working for the BBC are prompting insulting comments in the conservative Islamic country. Rival political parties are jumping on the negative reaction and believe it will harm his credibility to marry a divorcee with an apparently chequered past. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Last of Lord Lucan's fast-living set is dead aged 77 . The last person to see Lord Lucan alive has died . Scarcely a week after the Earl of Lucan’s 80th birthday, the last person to see the fugitive peer alive has died. William Shand Kydd, who was married to Lady Lucan’s sister Christina, passed away peacefully at home two days after Christmas, aged 77. ‘It’s the end of an era,’ says a friend of the family. ‘Bill was an amazing man.’ Wallpaper heir Bill was the last survivor of ‘Lucky’ Lucan’s gambling chums, the tycoon Sir James Goldsmith, zookeeper John Aspinall and Mark Birley, founder of Annabel’s nightclub. Bill raced power boats with Lucan before turning to horse-racing and becoming a successful amateur jockey, riding 117 winners over jumps and also taking part in the Grand National. He became a tetraplegic after breaking his neck in a riding accident in 1995 and went on to raise thousands of pounds for spinal research. However, it was the father of two’s unwitting role in Lucan’s disappearance in 1974 that created all the headlines. On the night that nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death in the Earl’s family home in London’s Belgravia, the peer tried to contact Bill. Lucan wrote him two letters, outlining details of his bank account and estate, and explaining that he had been involved in the ‘most ghastly circumstances’. In the letters, which Bill read out at the official inquest into Rivett’s death, Lucan begged Bill to look after his heir George, then seven, and his daughters Frances, ten, and Camilla, four, over whom Lucan had fought a bitter custody battle after he split up with his wife, Veronica. The earl was named by the inquest’s jury as Rivett’s murderer and his children continued to live with Lady Lucan in the years immediately afterwards. However, in 1982, custody of all three was transferred to Bill and Christina, who lived at Horton Hall in Bedfordshire. Gambling pals: Shand Kydd, pictured with his wife, was the last person to see Lord Lucan alive . Lady Lucan did not contest this and George and his sisters have not had contact with their mother since. Bill was related to Princess Diana through his late half-brother, Peter Shand Kydd, who was her stepfather. ‘He will be deeply missed,’ says his friend. Bill had been separated from Christina for seven years before his accident and lived with his lover, interior designer Sally Ramsay Patrick, at Horton Hall. But Christina showed unswerving loyalty and moved back in after his fall and set about restoring her husband to health. Sally proved an equally determined nurse and the two women — reputed to have met for the first time when they stood either side of the trolley that took Bill to intensive care — agreed to separate visiting hours. Branson gets grandchildren for Christmas . Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson has become a grandfather. His daughter Holly has given birth to twins, whom she and her husband, Virgin investment manager Freddie Andrewes, have named Etta and Artie. ‘Despite being delivered early, all three of us are fit and well,’ says Holly, 32. ‘They are absolutely perfect (but who wouldn’t say that about their kids!). What’s more, the little ones also arrived on mine and Freddie’s third wedding anniversary — could there be a better way to mark the occasion?’ Holly pictured with her husband Freddie Andrewes and their twins Etta and Artie . Prince George is particularly taken with his police car soft toy . George, caught by the fuzz . Prince George appears to be taking a keen interest in royal protection, if his Christmas presents are anything to go by. The 17-month-old future king is said to be particularly delighted with his gift from his aunt Pippa Middleton — a police car. The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister bought the soft toy for £9 from Chelsea Toys in London. ‘She was looking for a small gift because she’d already bought him a massive thing,’ owner Alka Poole tells me. ‘She just needed something to give him to play with.’ Happily, George was more impressed with Pippa’s gift than the cuddly toy bilby he was given in Australia in April, which he threw away within seconds. Why Clegg is no. 2 at home, too . Given that their sons are named Antonio, Alberto and Miguel, there was never much doubt as to who wore the trousers in Nick Clegg’s household. But now the Deputy Prime Minister has admitted that his wife Miriam is a fiery character. Asked if he or the 46-year-old lawyer is the most even-tempered, Clegg, 47, replies: ‘I think, er, I don’t know if I can say it, but Miriam is truly Spanish.’ The couple met when they were students in Bruges. ‘It was total thunderbolt stuff,’ he says in a joint interview with his wife. Of their 14-year marriage, Miriam says: ‘I think the secret is laughing a lot and having big arguments. If you can get over it before you go to bed, that’s fine.’ Sir Donald Sinden’s family have expressed their gratitude after one of the theatrical treasures stolen from his house was returned to them. The people who found the 5ft long sword made by the Royal Shakespeare Company contacted his son Marc Sinden after reading in this column about the burglary of the late actor’s Kent home. ‘It was tossed into a ditch on Romney Marsh,’ Marc tells me. ‘A big thank you to the Daily Mail for making the people who found it aware of quite what it meant to us.’ Director Tim Burton’s split from Helena Bonham Carter after 13 years together does not seem to be helping his career.

Big Eyes recouped only £135,682 from 155 screens over the weekend to limp into the charts in 13th place. In Burton’s native America, it took a relatively small £2.95 million in its first four days. It’s poetic justice for Helena, whom Burton failed to cast in Big Eyes, even though she had starred in six of his previous films. Despite confirmation of Joan Collins’s damehood, which I disclosed more than three weeks ago, the 81-year-old actress is not letting the grass grow under her feet. The former Dynasty star has parted company with her agent of more than 20 years, Peter Charlesworth, and signed up with Jonathan Shalit’s ROAR Global. Given that Shalit’s clients include The X Factor judges Mel B and Tulisa Contostavlos, how long before Joanie appears on a show such as Britain’s Got Talent?","Imran Khan is believed to have married news anchor Reham Khan, 41 .

"Most people could forgive Guo Shijun if he gave up on his dream of a university education: because of his full time commitments to caring for his paralysed father and sick mother, he is spread incredibly thin. Most people would forgive him, but it is possible Shijun wouldn't forgive himself, as instead of giving up his studies, he persuaded university officials to let his father to stay in his dorm for the full term, after he was paralysed in a building accident. Shijun still managed to get a place at a top university, and, impressed with his dedication in the face of insurmountable odds, they let him bring his father to university with him to lighten his load. Chinese student Guo Shijun (right) prepares a meal for his father in his dorm while his father (left), who is paralysed from the waist down, rests in the specially installed bed . Guo Shijun takes a picture with his father. For most of his life he has been a young carer, and his workload only doubled when his father became disabled . Shijun, now 20, came from a poor family and had a tough childhood, as his mother was left mentally disabled when he was younger following a battle with meningitis. She was cared for during his formative years by him and his father, and despite this responsibility, he still managed to get top grades at school. His already tough workload got worse when his father was injured after falling 15 meters off of a bridge he was working on in the city of Liuan in the Anhui province in the centre of China, becoming paralysed from the waist down. Shijun's grandparents took over care . duties for his mother, but they couldn't look after his father as well, . so he rented a small room near his university dormitory and moved his . father in, so that he didn't have to keep rushing to check up on him . between lessons and during lunch. Despite insurmountable odds, Guo Shijun has managed to earn top marks at university, and a scholarship for his good grades . Guo Shijun installed his father in his dorm room so that he wouldn't have to go far to check on him between lectures . To keep up his studies he paid for university by borrowing money from friends and relatives until he finished. These costs, amount to £2000 a year for tuition alone, not accounting for food, bills and the cost of care for his parents. However, despite the huge handicap to his studies, he managed to earn a scholarship to help him on his way. Talking about his experiences, Shijun said: 'I can't say life is easy but the only way out of the problem is through . hard work so I'm not complaining. 'I think once I graduate things will . get much better.'","Father is paralysed, mother is mentally disabled from battle with meningitis .

"Technology may be getting smarter, but humans are getting dumber, scientists have warned. Evidence suggests that the IQs of people in the UK, Denmark and Australia have declined in the last decade. Opinion is divided as to whether the trend is long-term, but some researchers believe that humans have already reached intellectual peak. Dumb and dumber? Evidence suggests the IQs of people in the UK, Denmark and Australia have declined in the last decade. A study by the University of Hartford claims the larger the global population becomes, the less intelligent we will be, dropping by around eight IQ points by the year 2110 - and other estimates are even more pessimistic . An IQ test used to determine whether Danish men are fit to serve in the military has revealed scores have fallen by 1.5 points since 1998. And standard tests issued in the UK and Australia echo the results, according to journalist Bob Holmes, writing in New Scientist. The most pessimistic explanation as to why humans seem to be becoming less intelligent is that we have effectively reached our intellectual peak. Between the 1930s and 1980s, the average IQ score in the US rose by three points and in post-war Japan and Denmark, test scores  also increased significantly - a trend known as the ‘Flynn effect’. This increase in intelligence was due to improved nutrition and living conditions - as well as better education - says James Flynn of the University of Otago, after whom the effect is named. An image of the future? Some experts believe we are starting to see the end of the Flynn effect in developed countries – and that IQ scores are leveling out and even declining. Pessimistic scientists think  that our descendants may struggle to understand subjects we can grasp (illustrated with a stock image) Westerns have lost 14 IQ points on average since the Victorian age, according to a study published by the University of Amsterdam last year. Jan te Nijenhuis thinks this could be because intelligent women tend to have less children than women who are not as clever, The Huffington Post reported. The perceived link between IQ and fertility is a very contentious one. Dr Nijenhuis studied the results of 14 intelligence studies conducted between 1884 and 2004 to come to his conclusion. Each study measured peoples' reaction times - how long they took to press a button after being prompted. It is claimed that reaction time mirrors mental processing speed - so it reflects intelligence. They found that visual reaction times averaged 194 milliseconds in the late 19th Century, but in 2004, they had increased to 275 milliseconds. This would suggest that people have become less intelligent, they said. Now some experts believe we are starting to see the end of the Flynn effect in developed countries – and that IQ scores are not just levelling out, but declining. Scientists including Dr Flynn think better education can reverse the trend and point out  the perceived decline could just be a blip. However, other scientists are not so optimistic. Some believe the Flynn effect has masked a decline in the genetic basis for intelligence, so that while more people have been reaching their full potential, that potential itself has been declining. Some have even contentiously said this could be because educated people are deciding to have fewer children, so that subsequent generations are largely made up of less intelligent people. Richard Lynn, a psychologist at the University of Ulster, calculated the decline in humans’ genetic potential. He used data on average IQs around the world in 1950 and 2000 to discover that our collective intelligence has dropped by one IQ point. Dr Lynn predicts that if this trend continues, we could lose another 1.3 IQ points by 2050. Michael Woodley, of the Free University of . Brussels, Belgium, claims people’s reactions are slower than in . Victorian times, and has linked it to a decline in our genetic . potential. Must try harder: Psychologist Richard Lynn calculated the decline in humans’ genetic potential. He used data on average IQ test scores (illustrated) from around the world in 1950 and 2000 to discover that our collective intelligence has dropped by one IQ point. It has previously been claimed that quick-witted people have fast reactions and Dr Woodley’s study showed people’s reaction times have slowed over the century – the equivalent to one IQ point per decade. Jan te Nijenhuis, a psychology professor at the University of Amsterdam, says Westerners have lost an average of 14 IQ points since the Victoria Era. He believes this is due to more intelligent women have fewer children than those who are less clever,The Huffington Post reported. Dr Woodley and others think humans will gradually become less and less intelligent. But Dr Flynn says if the decline in IQ scores is the end of the Flynn effect, scores should stabilise. He thinks that even if humans do become more stupid, better healthcare and technology will mean that all people will have fewer children and the ‘problem’ will regulate itself. Tests carried out in 1980 and in 2008 showed that the average 14-year-old was two IQ points cleverer in 1980, according to a study published in 2009. Scientists found that performance dropped the most dramatically in teenagers in the upper half of the intelligence scale, The Telegraph reported. Brighter teens who took part in the study in 2008 were on average six IQ points less intelligent than their counterparts tested 28 years earlier. Professor Fynn said the results could be the result of less intelligent youth culture. He used data gathered in IQ tests on UK children and found that children aged between five and 10 saw their IQs increase by half a point per year over three decades.'Other studies have shown how pervasive teenage youth culture is, and what we see is parents' influence on IQ slowly diminishing with age,' he said. '...What we know is that youth culture is now more visually orientated around computer games than they are in terms of reading and holding conversations.'","IQs have largely increased since the 1930s thanks to better living conditions and education - a trend known as the Flynn effect .

"Qatar has issued a decree advising tourists that leggings are not considered pants and are not modest enough to wear in public. Leggings have been singled out in pamphlets distributed by the Gulf state as inappropriate attire for tourists in the notoriously strict Islamic country. The Reflect Your Respect campaign, launched by the Qatar Islamic Cultural Center, has listed some advice and tips for tourists on how to dress modestly in preparation for the 2022 Football World Cup it is hosting. LEGGINGS ARE NOT PANTS: The Gulf state has issued its stance on leggings as part of its modesty drive . The pamphlets ask visitors to help preserve Qatar's culture and values. They state: 'If you are in Qatar, you are one of us. Please dress modestly in public places.' It then adds: 'Leggings are not pants.' The campaign uses social media to help get its message across, including the use of its own Twitter account. There are a range of other recommendations included in the campaign that visitors need to be wary of if planning to travel to Qatar. Public displays of intimacy and affection are strongly discouraged in Qatar . Anyone who says indecent phrases or is involved in an obscene act in public could face up to six months in prison . Women should dress modestly and men should not be shirtless in public . Public displays of affection and intimacy are strongly discouraged . Ask permission before taking a photo of someone you don't know personally . The campaign has received a mixed reaction online. One person responded: 'If this campaign ran in the UK it would be blasted for being ""racist"". Why is it suddenly acceptable elsewhere, regardless of religious or cultural beliefs? Basic human rights should be accepted globally, not just where some see fit.'

"From Amy Childs to Lauren Goodger, the stars of The Only Way Is Essex are no strangers to cosmetic surgery. So when Abigail Clarke, 23, from Chigwell, Essex, joined the reality TV show two years ago, she followed suit because she felt under pressure to look perfect. She decided to have lip filler injected to enhance her pout but lived to regret it as she ended up with painful, swollen lips. Scroll down for video . Abigail, right, pictured with former TOWIE star Lauren Goodger, left, in 2013 said she felt under pressure to have surgery to look as glamorous as the other celebrities . Lauren, pictured after her lip filler injections, was left with a trout pout after she reacted badly to the treatment . 'When everyone looks amazing, you can think maybe I could do this, especially as some of the girls had work done. I asked them for advice,' she said of her decision to have the treatment after joining the cast of TOWIE. 'I wasn't really thinking about the needles, just about the results.' But the procedure didn't give her the look she'd hoped for. Her lips became swollen and painful as she had a bad reaction to the filler. She explains: 'The filler reacted in my lips and I got a wedge of it that was pushing out on either side. I thought if my lips crack, that will be it, my face will be ruined for life.' The swelling did subside but the lumps of filler remained making her lips look and feel uneven. 'I regret how my lips are now, I can hide the lumps of filler with make up but it feels disgusting,' she told TV presenter Katie Piper on Channel 4's Bodyshockers. Abi's natural look in 2013, left, and in 2014, right, after the filler which made her lips lumpy and painful . Abi with TOWIE co-star Jasmin Walia, left, in 2013 before she had the lip filler injected . The make-up artist agreed to appear on the Channel 4 show in the hope she would make other people think twice about having surgery to change their looks. She said: 'Now my lips are bruised and painful, I didn't realise how fake the filler would make me look. I have ruined my looks for nothing. I didn't really need them done.' Explaining more about her motivation to have the injections, Abi said she thought having a fuller pout would boost her self-esteem. 'I thought my lips were going to make me happy and the one thing that would give me that confidence - but it made me more upset,' she said. 'I have realised that confidence doesn't need to come from my lips, it needs to come from me. 'I need to have the confidence to be myself and to not want to look like all the other celebrities.' Abi's parents reveal on the documentary how they also wish their daughter hadn't 'ruined her face'. The reality TV star, pictured after the lip filler treatment when she used make-up to hide the lumps, said she wishes she had never had the procedure . Abi with Bodyshockers presenter Katie Piper after having a painful reversal treatment to make her lips look more natural again . Her father said: 'Her lips were fine as they were, no parent wants their child to be adjusting things. 'Her lips don't look natural now, they look painful.' Her mother agreed. She told Abi: 'It looks like a blow up dolly. It breaks my heart you had to do that as naturally you had lovely lips.' In a bid to get back to her natural look, Abi arranged to have filler removal treatment while being followed by the Bodyshocker cameras. This involves having more injections in her lips to inject a chemical to break down the filler. Despite the area being numbed first, Abi squeals in pain as the needle is inserted in her upper lip. Dr Esho of Le Beau Ideal who carried out the reversal surgery on Abi said: 'Abi came to see me after a lip augmentation with dermal fillers had unfortunately gone terribly wrong. Dermal fillers carry real risk of cyst formation, infection, allergy and scarring and it's important to be aware of these as part of doing your research when seeking these procedures. 'Over several weeks I saw Abi in stages we worked to drain and remove deep cysts, free scar tissue and dissolve filler which had been misplaced. 'It was a painful process for her but she was been brave throughout, recovered well and is now looking better than ever. 'Cases like Abi's I see more and more, and it's important for patients to seek out the right qualified professional to undergo these procedures and not base their choice on cost. Finding a skilled professional you can trust Is priceless. They will always guide and help you and be there to help'you if things don't go as planned.' Abi admitted the painful reversal treatments were worth it to rid her lips of the lumpy filler once and for all. She said: 'I'm really happy, I feel so normal now but my lips will never be the same or as tight and nice as they once were.' Abi said she's learnt her lesson and doesn't intend to have any more cosmetic surgery for the foreseeable future. 'I'm embracing the natural look now,' she said. AMY CHILDS . Amy, 24, admitted last year that she became 'addicted' to plastic surgery after having her first boob job when she was 18. After that she had another breast enhancement as well as Botox and multiple lip filler procedures. She has since had the lip filler reversal treatment that Abi endured saying she regretted having so many procedures so young. Amy Childs, left, said she was addicted to surgery. Lauren Goodger, right, has also been under the knife . LAUREN GOODGER . Lauren, 28, went under the knife to have a nose job in 2011. She also had a boob job which increased her breast size to 34E to D. Since first appearing on TOWIE, her cheeks and lips have become noticeably fuller prompting speculation that she has had numerous filler treatments. CHLOE SIMS . Chloe, 32, has made no secret of her numerous cosmetic procedures. She's had Botox and fillers, teeth veneers, two boob jobs and a bottom lift. In total she's spent more than £32,000 on treatments but she admitted in 2013 that she went too far and hated being nicknamed 'Plastic Chloe'.

"Aston Villa captain Stiliyan Petrov's cancer was caused by radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster more than 25 years ago, according to his national team's doctor. The 32-year-old was diagnosed with acute leukaemia last month. Dr Mihail Iliev, who has treated Petrov for 14 years in his capacity as Bulgarian national team medic, is blaming a toxic radiation cloud the star was exposed to when he was just six years old. Stiliyan Petrov, accompanied by his wife and son, thanks the crowd support during the Aston Villa Chelsea game on March 31 . On April 26, 1986 a power surge in reactor number four caused an explosion at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station in Ukraine, sending a huge plume of radioactive material into the sky. At the time Stiliyan Petrov was growing up in Montana, Bulgaria, 650 miles away from Chernobyl. But the cloud of contaminated matter is believed to have passed over the city in the weeks following the disaster. Dr Iliev, 61, claimed radiation levels in the north of Bulgaria were 1,000 to 1,300 times normal levels in late April, early May 1986. He said a number of youngsters at the time, or born in the aftermath of the disaster, developed cancer - because Bulgaria's communist regime failed to tell people about the threat. Dr. Iliev told The Sun 'It was in the late spring, the population was eating fresh radioactive vegetables and other foods. Many people who were kids back then suffered cancer because of this. Chernobyl: Greenpeace believes the disaster will eventually cause 200,000 cancer cases . Dr Mihail Iliev, doctor to the Bulgarian football team, blames Chernobyl radiation for Stiliyan Petrov's cancer diagnosis . 'We called them The Chernobyl Kids. Most were born in the same region as Stiliyan.' Radiation from Chernobyl is known to . have caused widespread birth defects across the former Soviet Union, but . its effect on the inhabitants of neighboring countries is hard to . measure . Levels of contamination were detected across much of Europe in the aftermath of the disaster and experts say the toxic cloud spread out and west across the continent with closest neighbours Belarus, Russia, Sweden, Finland, Austria, Norway and Bulgaria worst effected. At 1.23am (2123 GMT), on April 26, 1986, an explosion at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant spewed a cloud of radioactive fallout over much of Europe, Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia. The explosion released about 400 times more radiation than the U.S. atomic bomb dropped over Hiroshima. Hundreds of thousands were sickened and once-pristine forests and farmland still remain contaminated now. Dr Iliev is even more convinced Petrov's cancer is related, because there is no history of cancer in his family. Dr. Iliev added, 'There are no other cases of such illness in this family, that is why I . think Stiliyan is a victim of the old communist regime’s lack of . information when the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl exploded, and the . radioactive cloud came to our country.' The UN's World Health . Organization says that among the 600,000 people most heavily exposed to . the radiation, 4,000 more cancer deaths than average are expected to be . eventually found. Greenpeace estimates 200,000 people will eventually contract cancer as a result of Chernobyl.","Petrov grew up 650 miles from doomed power station .

"Members of a German motorcycle gang have arrived in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane to fight against Islamic State militants who have been attacking the city for the past four weeks. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their riders posing in the city - some of them carrying weapons. The news comes just after three members of a notorious motorcycle gang from the Netherlands were told they had not committed any crime by travelling to Kobane to join the fight against ISIS. Leaders of the Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club, which has strong Kurdish links, have posted images of their riders posing in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane. They are there fighting ISIS terrorists . Images of the Median Empire Motorcycle Club emerged on the group's Facebook page, and showed the heavily tattooed riders with rifles slung over the shoulders. In a shot of the Germans huddled together, the gang's logo - a sinister looking white face on a black background - could clearly be seen on their leather vests. The image was captioned: 'Our boys were in Kobane today and told me today they were shot at but nothing happened. They are okay.' Four days earlier, the same Facebook user wrote: 'While others blabber and blabber, our boys are at the front fighting.' The gang's official Facebook page says the riders have travelled to the Middle East to distribute aid, and several images show them handing out food to Yazidis in what looks like a refugee camp. Defence: A biker from the No Surrender gang in the Netherlands, identified only as Ron (right) poses alongside a Kurdish soldier in Syria after going to fight against ISIS . Elsewhere of their Facebook page, the Median Empire Motorcycle Club praise the notorious Netherlands based No Surrender gang, three members of which have also travelled to fight in Kobane, according to its leader Klaas Otto. Last week a Dutch prosecutor told the members that they will not be prosecuted for going to fight abroad, because such actions are only illegal if you are fighting troops from the Netherlands. Public prosecutor spokesman Wim de Bruin said: 'Joining a foreign armed force was previously punishable, now it's no longer forbidden. You just can't join a fight against the Netherlands.' While several countries including Britain have taken steps to stop their citizens joining ISIS, joining the Kurds is generally permissible because they are not considered a terrorist organisation. However, anyone going to fight ISIS would be banned from joining the Kurdistan Workers' Party, who run several of the brigades fighting ISIS, because they are considered to be terrorists. Blast: A US-led airstrike on a Syrian gas facility in Kobane killed at least eight people this afternoon. It had been held by militants from the Islamic State terror group, who expert Justin Bronk believes has made fatal errors in its attempt to capture the city . Fire: Flames rise over an ISIS-held building inside Kobane following American and Arab airstrike this evening . Dutch citizens fighting on the Kurdish side would of course be liable to prosecution if they committed crimes such as torture or rape, De Bruin said. 'But this is also happening a long way away and so it'll be very difficult to prove,' he added. Video footage apparently from a Kurdish broadcaster shows an armed European man with Kurdish fighters saying in Dutch: 'The Kurds have been under pressure for a long time.' There are estimated to be around 70,000 Kurds living in the Netherlands, most of whom are political refugees who fled from Turkey and the Middle East looking for work. An ISIS propaganda video released last week featured a German militant who threatened any Western soldier who travels to fight in Syria. Identified as Abu Dauoud al-Almani steps in front of the camera and speaks in German, subtitled in English. An ISIS propaganda video released last week featured German militant Abu Dauoud al-Almani who threatened the life of any Western soldier who travels to fight against the Islamic State in Syria . Syrian Kurdish refugees in Turkey watch as American and Arab warplanes carry out airstrikes on their hometown Kobane this evening . Al-Amani claimed the video is being shot in the Syrian town of Dabiq and urges Western nations to send their armies to fight ISIS because 'We have been waiting for you for over 1,400 years.' He also urges his fellow Muslims in Germany, Austria and Switzerland to join ISIS. Al-Almani is far from the first German citizen to embrace radical Islam. Former rapper Denis Cuspert spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name Deso Dogg before embracing radical Islam and travelling join ISIS in Syria. It is understood Cusbert now calls himself Abu Talha al-Almani and leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'. It is not known whether Abu Dauoud al-Almani is a member of Cuspert's militant unit. Islamic State militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government. The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court. One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. Horror: The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court . News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground. The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants. The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.","Members of Cologne-based Median Empire Motorcycle Club are in Kobane .

"Lib Dem MP David Ward has been summoned to meet party enforcers next week to explain the comments about the Holocaust he posted on his website . A Liberal Democrat MP facing disciplinary action after accusing 'the Jews' of atrocities against Palestinians has issued a public apology for causing 'unintended offence.' David Ward's comments - posted on his website ahead of tomorrow's Holocaust Memorial Day - were condemned by party chiefs and sparked a furious backlash. He initially strongly defended the article and hit out at criticisms by the party - which summoned him to the Whip's Office for a meeting on Monday morning. But in a new post this afternoon he said he 'never for a moment intended to criticise or offend the Jewish people as a whole, either as a race or as a people of faith, and apologise sincerely for the unintended offence which my words caused.' 'I recognise of course the deep sensitivities of these issues at all times, and particularly on occasions of commemoration such as this weekend,' he added. Mr Ward said that in raising the treatment of the Palestinians he had simply been 'trying to make clear that everybody needs to learn the lessons of the Holocaust.' 'I will continue to make criticisms of actions in Palestine in the strongest possible terms for as long as Israel continues to oppress the Palestinian people,' he added. The Bradford East MP composed his original posting after signing a Holocaust memorial book in the city, describing Auschwitz as 'the Nazi concentration and extermination camp which is the site of the largest mass murder in history.' This week Prime Minister David Cameron signed a book of remembrance to mark Holocaust Memorial Day in Downing Street . But in the addition which caused the . uproar, he added: 'Having visited Auschwitz twice - once with my family . and once with local schools - I am saddened that the Jews, who suffered . unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a . few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on . Palestinians in the new State of Israel and continue to do so on a . daily basis in the West Bank and Gaza.' A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: . ‘This is a matter we take extremely seriously. The Liberal Democrats . deeply regret and condemn the statement issued by David Ward and his use . of language which is unacceptable.’ Holocaust Memorial Day marks the 68th . anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, . where more than one million people, mostly Jews, were killed – many . shot, starved or victims of the gas chambers. Homosexuals, political . dissidents and the handicapped were also victims. Horror: Holocaust Memorial Day marks the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than one million people, mostly Jews, were killed . The MP, who said he had attended a . Holocaust memorial event in Bradford yesterday which was ‘extremely . moving’ said he hoped the chief whip would respect his views. In an interview yesterday he said: . ‘What better day to raise the issue of learning from one of the worst . examples of inhumanity.’ He told The Commentator website: ‘It appears . that the suffering by the Jews has not transformed their views on how . others should be treated.’ On his website, Mr Ward said he had . ‘signed a Book of Commitment in the House of Commons, in doing so . pledging his commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day’ and describes . Auschwitz as ‘the Nazi concentration and extermination camp which is the . site of the largest mass murder in history.’ Karen Pollock, chief executive of the . Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ‘I am deeply saddened that at this . sombre time, when we remember those who were murdered by the Nazis, Mr . Ward has deliberately abused the memory of the Holocaust causing deep . pain and offence - these comments are sickening and unacceptable and . have no place in British politics.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is understood to be furious with Mr Ward and condemned his remarks . Jon Benjamin, chief executive of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘We are outraged and shocked at these offensive comments about Jewish victims of the Holocaust and the suggestion that Jews should have learned a lesson from the experience. ‘For an MP to have made such comments on the eve of Holocaust Memorial Day is even more distasteful, and we welcome the fact that the Liberal Democrats have sought to disassociate the party from David Ward's comments.’ Tory MP Robert Halfon said his comments were ‘a tragic trivialisation of real evil.’ He said ‘It should be remembered that Israel withdrew from Gaza completely and yet has faced a barrage of 7000+ missiles from Hamas and been the victim of hundreds of terrorist suicide bombers and been attacked by all its neighbours in 1948, 1967 and 1973.’ Mr Ward has previously described Israel as an ‘apartheid regime’.  Liberal Democrat Baroness Jenny Tonge has twice been fired from the frontbench for her anti-Israel comments. In 2004, she claimed she might become a suicide bomber if she lived in the West Bank or Gaza, and was sacked as the party’s spokesman on children’s issues. She was sacked as health spokesman in 2010 for accusing Israeli soldiers of harvesting body parts in Haiti while doing humanitarian work after the earthquake, and this year said ‘Israel is not going to be there forever.’","Bradford East MP condemned for linking Israeli treatment of Palestine with WWII 'death camps'

"A group of intelligence officials were overheard yesterday discussing how the National Security Agency worker who leaked sensitive documents to a reporter last week should be 'disappeared.' Foreign policy analyst and editor at large of The Atlantic, Steve Clemons, tweeted about the 'disturbing' conversation after listening in to four men who were sitting near him as he waited for a flight at Washington's Dulles airport. 'In Dulles UAL lounge listening to 4 US intel officials saying loudly leaker & reporter on #NSA stuff should be disappeared recorded a bit,' he tweeted at 8:42 a.m. on Saturday. According to Clemons, the men had been attending an event hosted by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. Disturbing: Steve Clemons, pictured left, tweeted the conversation after overhearing the officials saying the NSA leaker and Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald, pictured right, should be 'disappeared' on Saturday . One of the officials was wearing 'a white knit national counter-terrorism center shirt,' Clemons told the Huffington Post. He added that it was clear from their conversation they were among the intelligence community. Clemons said the conversation initially centered around the event the men had just attended but soon turned to the NSA leaks, which were first reported by Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald. The term 'disappeared' refers to a secret murder or assassination carried out by dictatorship governments. Clemons described the discussion on Twitter as 'bravado' and said he believed the disappearing comment was 'half joke half serious.' 'They were loud. Almost bragging. Lacked circumspection about comments & jokes,' he wrote about the conversation in the busy airport lounge. Defensive: Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper said in a statement Saturday that disclosures on intelligence gathering practices were 'reckless' Clemons said he didn't know the . identities of the officials or which agency they worked for. He wrote on . twitter that he recorded part of the conversation and took a number of . poor quality photos, which he said he would post online. 'Was a shock to me and wasn't prepared,' he tweeted. The dinner was in honor of former NSA director Michael Hayden and chaired by former Ambassador John Negroponte. The news comes after Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper . responded on Saturday to the defended the classified government . surveillance programs that were leaked during the week, insisting the . measures kept Americans safe and were 'authorized by Congress'. Hoping . to 'dispel some of the myths' after leaked documents published by The . Guardian and The Washington Post shed light on two top-secret government . surveillance programs, Clapper said in a statement the . purpose of the programs is 'to obtain foreign intelligence information, . including information necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks . against the United States and its allies'. The classified document, published by The Guardian, detailed how a division of Verizon was ordered to give cell phone records to the NSA. The Guardian and The Washington Post . also reported that another program, called 'PRISM', was used by U.S. intelligence agencies to gain access to the files maintained by top . Internet companies like Google, Microsoft and Facebook. In statements, . those companies denied providing the government with special access to . their files. Informant: The Director of National Intelligence James R Clapper, left, released a statement on PRISM, which is reported to have been used to gather information from the data centers of Internet companies like Facebook, one of which is pictured left . 'Necessary': The top intelligence official, James R Clapper, said the NSA's intelligence measures, carried out at sites like this one in Maryland, were 'used to keep Americans safe' Both the phone-records program and . PRISM were approved by a judge, but PRISM allowed government agencies to . gain access to various Internet conversations, including email. In his statement, Clapper said PRISM, which was authorized in the Patriot Act, has been in place since 2008. The Associated Press . reported on Saturday that earlier this week the NSA filed a criminal . report with the Justice Department in relation to the leaks. Clapper called the disclosures 'reckless'. 'In . a rush to publish, media outlets have not given the full . context–including the extent to which these programs are overseen by all . three branches of government–to these effective tools,' he said. 'In . particular, the surveillance activities published in The Guardian and . The Washington Post are lawful and conducted under authorities widely . known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress.' Clapper's statement came as a new Guardian report revealed more information on the NSA's tool for recording and analyzing intelligence. Documents . obtained by the Guardian reveal the government uses a data mining tool, . called Boundless Informant, to map information the agency collects. The . Guardian reported the agency collected 'almost 3 billion pieces of . intelligence from US computer networks over a 30-day period ending in . March 2013'. National security: Top intelligence official James R Clapper said secret programs revealed in recent news reports are 'necessary to thwart terrorist and cyber attacks against the United States and its allies' 'The . tool allows users to select a country on a map and view the metadata . volume and select details about the collections against that country,' according to an NSA fact sheet about the program obtained by The . Guardian. In . his statement, Clapper said the agency is limited in discussing their . intelligence gathering practices by the NSA's need to protect their . methods and sources. 'Disclosing information about the . specific methods the government uses to collect communications can . obviously give our enemies a ""playbook"" of how to avoid detection,' Clapper said. Clapper added the recent disclosures . have caused 'significant misimpressions', adding he could not correct . all 'inaccuracies' without revealing even more classified information. In order to 'dispel some of the myths', the NSA also released a three-page fact sheet on intelligence collection as outlined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The . fact sheet noted the government 'does not unilaterally obtain . information from the servers of U.S. electronic communication service . providers' but only through court approval with provider's knowledge. Congress . also authorized the use of PRISM, which the fact sheet called an . 'internal government computer system' and 'not an undisclosed collection . or data mining program'. The . fact sheet also tried to dispel many Americans' concerns, noting the . government cannot target anyone's computer or phone records without 'an . appropriate, and documented, foreign intelligence purpose for the . acquisition (such as for the prevention of terrorism, hostile cyber . activities, or nuclear proliferation) and the foreign target is reasonably believed to be outside the United States. The fact sheet detailed how their intelligence gathering was approved or overseen by the three branches of government. 'Finally, the notion that Section 702 activities are not subject to internal and external oversight is similarly incorrect. Collection of intelligence information under Section 702 is subject to an extensive oversight regime, incorporating reviews by the Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches,' the fact sheet said. In the fact sheet, Clapper also highlighted how intelligence gathered using these programs has provided 'insight into terrorist networks and plans'. 'For example, the intelligence community acquired information on a terrorist organization's strategic planning efforts,' he said in the fact sheet. 'Communications collected under Section 702 have yielded intelligence regarding proliferation networks and have directly and significantly contributed to successful operations to impede the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and related technologies.' President Barack Obama also noted the importance of the intelligence programs in an event in California Friday. 'I came in with a healthy skepticism about these programs,' he said according to multiple reports. 'My team evaluated them. We scrubbed them thoroughly–we actually expanded some of the oversight, increased some of the safeguards. But my assessment and my team's assessment was that they help us prevent terrorist attacks. You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience. We're going have to make some choices as a society.'","Editor-at-large of The Atlantic Steve Clemons tweeted the 'disturbing' discussion after overhearing it at Washington's Dulles airport on Saturday .

"A crew of New York City strippers scammed wealthy men out of at least $200,000 by spiking their drinks and then dragging them to strip clubs to rack up enormous charges on their credit cards, authorities said on Wednesday. A banker, a lawyer. a doctor and a real estate attorney were among the four unidentified victims plied with ecstasy, cocaine and prescription drugs and then taken to Scores in Manhattan and the RoadhHouse NYC Gentleman’s Club in Queens. Once there the women would whisk the intoxicated men away for private dances and then take away their credit cards while they were too wasted to stop it. Drug Enforcement Administration and New York Police Department investigators arrested four women, Samantha Barbash, Roselyn Keo, Karina Pacsucci and Marsi Rosen earlier this week on charges including grand larceny, assault and forgery. Busted: Samantha Barbash, is escorted by law enforcement officers following her arrest in New York. Barbash is allegedly part of a crew of New York City strippers who scammed wealthy men by drugging them and running up extravagant bills at topless clubs while they were in a daze . Charged: Karina Pascucci arrives in court on Tuesday night after being charged in connection with a scam involving exotic dancers in New York City . Carmine Vitolo, a manager at the Roadhouse was also charged with conspiracy, grand larceny and tampering with physical evidence. One of the women was expected to appear in state court in Manhattan on Wednesday following appearances on Tuesday by the other three women. According to court papers, the strippers would prowl bars in Manhattan and Long Island for their victims over a four month period beginning in September 2013. The roundup followed an undercover investigation that found that the women joined in a scheme to rip off the men by drugging them with Molly, a powerful powder form of ecstasy after arranging to meet them on 'dates'. According to court papers, Samantha Barbash was the ring-leader along with Roselyn Keo. Barbash’s attorney, Stephen Murphy, said Wednesday that his client denies the charges. Drug allegations: Samantha Barbash led the extortion ring and threatened to blackmail some of her clients with photographs of them in compromising sexual positions from the night before . Ruthless: Samantha Barbash is allegedly the leader of a gang of strippers who have stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy male clients in New York City . Destination: This is Scores gentlemen's club in Manhattan - one of the destination for the women after they allegedly drugged their victims . Lead: Barbash (pictured left and right) and Keo headed up the credit scam according to court papers . Once they had given their victims the drugs the women then took the men to the clubs and brought the inebriated men to private rooms for dances and then stole their cards and racked up huge charges. The strippers falsely authorized tens of thousands of dollars to the victims' cards by forging their signatures and making them believe they were being charged for a lower amount. 'These individuals targeted and isolated victims in order to illegally obtain access to their credit cards and thousands of dollars of credit,' said Police Commissioner Bill Bratton. 'Thanks to the hard work of the investigators and prosecutors in this case, these individuals will no longer be in a position to profit from this type of fraudulent activity.' The clubs paid the women for the visits, but the establishments were not facing criminal charges, authorities said according to The New York Post. The men reported waking up in their cars or in hotel rooms with little or no memory of the encounters. Those who tried to dispute the strip club bills received texts from the strippers threatening to go public with their transgressions, authorities said. 'The defendants were banking on the victims being too afraid to contact the police,' said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan to The New York Daily News. 'They made a serious miscalculation.' Also charged: Marsi Rosen is also charged with being part of a crime ring of strippers who have allegedly stolen at least $200,000 from wealthy New York City men . Club: Karina Pascucci has been charged with assault and theft along with her three other stripper accomplices revealed court documents from Manhattan on Tuesday . Exotic: This is the RoadHouse Gentlemen's Club in Queens - another favorite destination of the strippers . Indeed, in some cases the strippers took photos and videoed the men in compromising sexual positions with women and men and threatened to blackmail them. Dr. Zyad Younan is allegedly one of the four men scammed out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by a gang of New York strippers . Last month, Scores sued a cardiologist, saying he owed the club $135,303 for unpaid services. According to the lawsuit, the doctor disputed the charges by saying 'he was drugged by plaintiff's employees and thus did not authorize the charges'— a claim the club says is contradicted by security video showing him freely showing up there on four separate occasions. A source identified this man as Zyad Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. According to The New York Daily News, Younan, denied he willingly authorized the $135,303 of charges. 'Today’s . indictment exposes a pattern of fraud that contributed to erroneous . media reports,' said Michael Weinstein, attorney of one of the alleged . victims. 'We were always confident that law enforcement’s . efforts would expose that my client was preyed upon by this ring and not . responsible for charges to his credit card.' The three other unidentified victims were all allegedly conned for a total of $55,000. Special . Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan said the scam 'involved not only . the theft of $200,000, but compromised the health, safety and security . of victims by covertly giving them harmful substances.' There was no immediate response to phone messages left Wednesday at Scores and the RoadHouse.","Samantha Barbash, 40, Roselyn Keo, 29, Marsi Rosen, 28, and Karina Pascucci, 26 have been charged with scamming wealthy New York men .

The father-of-three's comments will feature in a Channel 5 documentary to be shown this week. Ukip MEP Steven Woolfe is furious about the revelation. He told the Daily Express: 'This is further proof of the national scandal of the abuse of our benefits system caused by our open-door migration policy with the EU.

"A hazardous drug that eliminates free will and can wipe the memory of its victims is currently being dealt on the streets of Colombia. The drug is called scopolamine, but is colloquially known as ‘The Devil’s Breath,' and is derived from a particular type of tree common to South America. Stories surrounding the drug are the stuff of urban legends, with some telling horror stories of how people were raped, forced to empty their bank accounts, and even coerced into giving up an organ. Scroll down for video . Danger: 'The Devil's Breath' is such a powerful drug that it can remove the capacity for free will . Deadly drug: Scopolamine is made from the Borrachero tree, which blooms with deceptively beautiful white and yellow flowers . VICE’s Ryan Duffy travelled to the country to find out more about the powerful drug. In two segments, he revealed the shocking culture of another Colombian drug world, interviewing those who deal the drug and those who have fallen victim to it. Demencia Black, a drug dealer in the capital of Bogota, said the drug is frightening for the simplicity in which it can be administered. He told Vice that Scopolamine can be blown in the face of a passer-by on the street, and within minutes, that person is under the drug’s effect - scopolamine is odourless and tasteless. ‘You can guide them wherever you want,’ he explained. ‘It’s like they’re a child.’ Black said that one gram of Scopolamine is similar to a gram of cocaine, but later called it ‘worse than anthrax.’ In high doses, it is lethal. It only takes a moment: One drug dealer in Bogota explained how victims are drugged within minutes of exposure . Victims: One Colombian woman said that under the influence of scopolamine,  she led a man to her house and helped him ransack it . The drug, he said, turns people into complete zombies and blocks memories from forming. So even after the drug wears off, victims have no recollection as to what happened. One victim told Vice that a man approached her on the street asking her for directions. Since it was close by, she helped take the man to his destination, and they drank juice together. 'You can guide them wherever you want. It’s like they’re a child.' She took the man to her house and helped him gather all of her belongings, including her boyfriend’s cameras and savings. ‘It is painful to have lost money,’ the woman said,’ but I was actually quite lucky.’ According to the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, the drug - also known as hyoscine - causes the same level of memory loss as diazepam. In ancient times, the drug was given to the mistresses of dead Colombian leaders – they were told to enter their master’s grave, where they were buried alive. Devil's Breath: The drug is odourless and tasteless and can simply be blown in the face of someone on the street; their free will vanishes after being exposed to it . Dangerous: Vice's Ryan Duffy traveled to the capital of Bogota to find out more about the drug . In modern times, the CIA used the drug as part of Cold War interrogations, with the hope of using it like a truth serum. However, because of the drug’s chemical makeup, it also induces powerful hallucinations. The tree common around Colombia, and is called the ‘borrachero’ tree – loosely translated as the 'get-you-drunk' tree. It is said that Colombian mothers warn their children not to fall asleep under the tree, though the leafy green canopies and large yellow and white flowers seem appealing. Experts are baffled as to why Colombia is riddled with scopolamine-related crimes, but wager much of it has to do with the country’s torn drug-culture past, and on-going civil war.

"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella apologized on Thursday night and said he was wrong for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well. Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made earlier on Thursday at an event for women in computing. He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility. Scroll down for video . Foot in mouth disease: Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sparked a controversy by advising women against asking for raises . But his comments caused an uproar online, and Microsoft posted a memo from him on its website. In it, Nadella said he answered the question 'completely wrong' and that he thinks 'men and women should get equal pay for equal work. And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice. If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.' His interviewer at the event, Maria Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College and a Microsoft director, had told him she disagreed, which drew cheers from the audience. She suggested women do their homework on salary information and first practice asking with people they trust. Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian. Courting controversy: Nadella, left, made the gaffe while being interviewed by Microsoft board member Maria Klawe, right, at  the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing . Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding. Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the Redmond, Washington-based company released earlier this month. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female. That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies this year. 'Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap,' Nadella wrote in his memo to employees. The gaffe came towards the end of a Q & A session conducted by Maria Klawe, a member of Microsoft's board of directors, who asked Nadella for an advice for women who are not comfortable asking for a raise. 'It's not really about asking for a raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will give you the right raise,' he responded, reportedly sending murmurs of indignation through a crowd of 500 women sitting in the audience. 'That might be one of the initial 'super powers' that, quite frankly, women [who] don't ask for a raise have,' he continued. 'It's good karma. It will come back.' Klawe disagreed with Nadella's career advice, urging women to be tough negotiators when it comes to asking for compensation. To emphasize her point, Klawe, a well-regarded computer scientist, told the audience how she settled for a salary $50,000 lower than she had deemed appropriate when she was offered the position of dean of engineering at Princeton University, Bloomberg reported. Satya Nadella did not have to wait long for a reaction to his words of wisdom as Twitter lit up with highly critical posts. Backtrack: Nadella quickly took to Twitter to apologize for his 'tone-deaf' remarks . 'That @satyanadella thought that was reasonable advice says volumes about how little @Microsoft understands and wants to solve the problem,' wrote Sarah Milstein, CEO of Lean Startups Productions. Alahha Woods tweeted at Nadella: 'This can't be positively spun.' The recently appointed CEO of Microsoft quickly went into damage control mode Thursday afternoon, tweeting to his followers: 'was inarticulate re how women should ask for raise. Our industry must close gender pay gap so a raise is not needed because of a bias.' He then followed up by releasing the text of a company-wide email addressing his gaffe, in which he readily admitted that he answered Maria Klawe's question about raises 'completely wrong.' Contrite: Nadella later sent a company-wide email admitting that he answered the question about raises 'completely wrong' 'Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap. 'I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work. And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice. 'If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.' Nadella's controversial and arguably tone-deaf remarks come a week after Microsoft released figures showing that the company's staff was about 29 per cent female, and that 17 per cent of employees occupying position of leadership within the company were women.","Satya Nadella made the gaffe at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing .

Grandfather: Malcolm Shabazz's mother, Qubilah (pictured left in 1963) was the second daughter of the Black Muslim activist Malcolm X (center) with oldest daughter Attilah (right) Heritage: Malcolm Shabazz was born in 1984 and never met his activist grandfather, who was assassinated in 1965 in New York (pictured the Nation of Islam leader in New York in June 1963) The man is believed to have died early on Thursday after sustaining serious injuries from an assault, with The Amsterdam News reporting he was either thrown from a building or was shot in the course of a robbery. The location of the rumored attack has not yet been confirmed, as some websites have claimed he died in Tijuana and other news outlets have listed the place of death as Mexico City. Shabazz was reportedly in Mexico to meet with labor movement organizers, Talking Points Memo said. Juan Ruiz, part of the California-based labor group Rumec, told the website that Shabazz was in Mexico City to meet with one of Rumec's leaders, Miguel Suarez. Suarez had been deported from the United States last month. 'He’s a supporter of our organization. He went to Mexico to meet with Miguel,' Mr Ruiz told TPM. 'He was murdered. He was in Mexico City and I believe they attempted to rob him and he didn't allow it, so they beat him to death and he died on his way to the hospital. This is all I can confirm, everything else is under investigation for the meantime,' he added. Imam Dawud Walid, an acquaintance of Shabazz and executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Michigan, told NBC Newns, 'I do know that Malcolm was involved in . human rights and that he had a relationship with a gentleman named . Suarez in Mexico.' The U.S. State Department confirmed on Friday that a U.S. citizen had been killed in Mexico City but said it was not releasing the individual's name at the family's request. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City is closed on Friday as Mexico celebrates Mother's Day. Troubled: At the age of 12, Malcolm Shabazz admitted to setting fire to his grandmother's apartment in Yonkers, New York in June 1997. He was sentenced to 18 months in a juvenile detention for manslaughter and arson . Disturbed: Malcolm Shabazz, pictured at age 14 in court in 1999, spent much of his childhood living with relatives as his mother Qubilah struggled with drug and alcohol issues . Mother: Malcolm Shabazz's mother Qubilah Shabazz (pictured right in 1995 with her mother Betty) had a relationship with an Algerian man in Paris in the eighties. She gave birth to Malcolm in 1984 . The Amsterdam News first reported the man's death and later stated that the U.S. Embassy had confirmed the death. A family friend of the Shabazz family, Terrie M. Williams, . wrote in a Facebook posting, 'I'm confirming, per US Embassy, on behalf . of the family, the tragic death of Malcolm Shabazz, grandson of Malcolm . X. Statement from family to come.' Malcolm Shabazz had tried to turn his life around. He was an aspiring author and was attending John Jay College in New York . Malcolm Shabazz was born in 1984 and never met his activist grandfather, who was assassinated in 1965 in New York. Malcom Shabazz's father was an Algerian man, his mother had a relationship with when she studied in Paris. His mother struggled with alcohol and drug addiction so during his childhood Malcolm Shabazz lived with various relatives. Tragedy struck with the youth set fire to his grandmother's apartment in Yonkers, New York in 1997. The woman, Betty Shabazz, sustained burns over 80 per cent of her body and died . Malcom Shabazz, then aged 12, was sentenced to 18 months in juvenile detention for pleading guilty to manslaughter and arson. At a court hearing in the case, experts described Shabazz as psychotic and schizophrenic. After his release, he returned to jail in 2002 for a robbery charge and was arrested again in 2006. He claimed earlier in 2013 that he was being harassed by the FBI, in an impassioned blog posting. Shabazz described himself as the 'first . male heir of the greatest revolutionary leader of the 20th century,' on . his Twitter profile. On his Twitter profile he lists Washington D.C. as his hometown but was said to be attending John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York before his death. He suggested on his blog that he was an aspiring writer and was in the process of working on the manuscripts for two books. 'Malcolm is a humble, passionate and forceful speaker who’s emerging as a voice for our generation as a writer,' his biography states. He is survived by his mother and two daughters.","Malcolm Shabazz, 28, was the son of Malcolm X's second daughter, Qubilah Shabazz .

"An electromagnetic pulse that could have knocked electrical equipment over continent-scale regions barely missed Earth two weeks ago, it has been revealed. Electromagnetic pulses, also known as EMPs, are massive . surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare or from a high . altitude nuclear explosion. ‘The world escaped an EMP catastrophe,’ Henry Cooper, who . now heads High Frontier, a group pushing for missile defence, told Washington Secrets. Electromagnetic pulses, also known as EMPs, are massive surges of energy that can come from a severe solar flare, such as this one pictured on May 12, or from a high altitude nuclear explosion . On September 1, 1859, astronomer, Richard Carrington observed a sudden flash over a large area of sunspots on the sun. Within 60 seconds the flash had already started to disappear, but early the next morning, there were reports that the northern lights were so bright that people could read the newspaper as if it were daylight. At the same time strange things began happening worldwide telegraph systems. Telegraph operators were being shocked unconscious and the flying sparks were setting their machines on fire. When the telegraph operators disconnected their machines from the batteries, there were still sparks flying. This is because the power of solar flares induced electricity into the lines that carried the telegraph signals. 'There had been a near miss about two weeks ago, a Carrington-class coronal mass ejection crossed the orbit of the Earth and basically just missed us,’ added Peter Vincent Pry, who served on the Congressional EMP Threat Commission. ‘Basically this is a Russian roulette thing,’ he said. ‘We narrowly escape from a Carrington-class disaster.’ The event isn’t rare. In 1989, an EMP effect in Canada knocking out Quebec's electric transmission system. And on May 12, one of the largest solar flares to be recorded this year took place. The Sun sent billions of tons of solar particles into space, but they were not traveling in Earth's direction. An overall increase in solar flare activity has been observed in the past 12 months, as the Sun reaches the peak of its 11-year cycle. President Bill Clinton’s former Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey, led a panel earlier this week on the threat of a natural or nuclear EMP. Experts have also recently demanded that Washington prepare the nation's electric grid for an EMP. A study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting Earth by 2020. The UK, however is relatively well prepared for an extreme solar weather event, according to experts at the Royal Academy of Engineering . EMPs can destroy electrical equipment over continent-scale regions . They want the 2,000-3,000 transformers in the U.S. grid protected with a high-tech metal box and spares ready to rebuild the system. According to Woolsey, knocking out only 20 of these would shut down electricity to parts of the nation for a long time. Woolsey told Secrets, however, that some in Congress are interested in the issue, but the administration is just in the ‘beginnings’ of paying attention. A study into solar storms last year predicted there was a one in eight chance of a major one affecting Earth by 2020. The UK, however is relatively well prepared for an extreme solar weather event, according to experts behind the Royal Academy’s report ‘Extreme space weather: impacts on engineered systems and infrastructure’. Professor Paul Cannon, chair of the working group that produced the Academy’s report, said: ‘It’s an inevitable natural hazard and it will have a wide impact on technology. Extreme space weather has been variously described by some as inconsequential, and by others as potentially cataclysmic. ‘Simplistically, our view is that solar super storms will be a challenge for the UK to deal with but certainly not cataclysmic. And our motto in all this is: “Don’t panic but do prepare”’","Earth has narrowly missed electromagnetic pulses caused by solar flares .

"Daniel Levy will begin a major restructuring of Tottenham’s scouting and recruitment procedures after their poor start to the Barclays Premier League season. The Spurs chairman is planning the overhaul to help manager Mauricio Pochettino’s short-and long-term transfer activity. Although Levy is deeply unhappy with the performance of the team under their new head coach, the Argentine has the chairman’s full support. Tottenham went on a chaotic spending spree after selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for £86m . Erik Lamela was signed for £30m but missed most of last season through injury . Roberto Soldado was signed for £26m from Valencia but has failed to convince the White Hart Lane faithful . Etienne Capoue (right) was signed from Toulouse for £8.6m but has yet to fulfil his potential . Vlad Chiriches (right) was signed from Steaua Bucharest for £8.5m and has also struggled . Christian Eriksen (right) has been Tottenham's best signing since Gareth Bale left . After Gareth Bale was sold to Real Madrid for £86m, Tottenham reinvested that money into their squad - with little success. Paulinho - £17m from Corinthians . Christian Eriksen - £11.5m from Ajax . Roberto Soldado - £26m from Valencia . Nacer Chadli - £6m from FC Twente . Etienne Capoue - £8.6m from Toulouse . Vlad Chiriches - £8.5m from Steaua Bucharest . Erik Lamela - £30m from Roma . Instead Levy is planning a shake-up to ensure the proper procedures are in place to scout and recruit talent after spending the £86million from Gareth Bale’s sale last summer. The club’s head of analysis Jonathan Beaker has already left the club and has moved to Australia, but Levy has plans to restructure his scouting policy in the coming weeks. Spurs are still recovering from that chaotic spending spree last summer and Levy wants to make sure there is a system of accountability in place after last season’s blame game. Tottenham are widely recognised as the most political club in the Premier League and the fingers were being pointed after last season’s depressing results. Their director of football administration, Darren Eales, who was hugely supportive of staff at their new training ground, is serving his notice period. His departure for MLS side Atlanta, announced last month, is unrelated to his work at Spurs. He is leaving for personal reasons and is expected to complete the move to the United States in the next couple of weeks. Paulinho was bought for £17m but the Brazil midfielder has failed to establish himself in the team . Nacer Chadli has hit form this season after a poor first season at White Hart Lane . Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is planning overhaul of short-and long-term transfer policy . Mauricio Pochettino still has Levy's backing despite disappointing start to the season . Levy wants to bring people in to assist Pochettino before the transfer window opens in January. Sporting director Franco Baldini is expected to play a key role in future plans, but Levy is driving the project. He was disappointed by the club’s failure to push on last season under Andre Villas-Boas after he sold Bale to Real Madrid for a world record fee. Instead they squandered vast sums on Paulinho, Nacer Chadli, Roberto Soldado, Etienne Capoue, Vlad Chiriches, Erik Lamela and Christian Eriksen.","Daniel Levy deeply unhappy with the performance of Spurs team this season .

"Two teenage schoolgirls were arrested over suspected terrorism offences after police believed they were trying to fly from Britain to Syria to fight in the civil war, it was revealed today. The 17-year-olds from London were grabbed at Heathrow airport this month amid concerns they had been radicalised and were going to become jihadists. A senior Scotland Yard officer has also revealed 14 young Britons have been held on charges linked to the Syrian conflict in January, compared to 24 for the whole of last year. Revelations: Scotland Yard has revealed it held two 17-year-olds believing they were going to join other women fighting in Syria (pictured) Counter-terrorism Commander Richard Walton warned today there are growing numbers of young 'boys and girls enticed' towards jihad, and some could target Britain next. 'We’ve had a number of teenagers both from London and nationally . who’ve been attempting to go to Syria,' he told the Evening Standard. 'That’s boys and girls . unfortunately. It’s not just the odd one. It’s shocking that they are . such young people.' The two teenagers held at Heathrow were later released, but Commander Walton added the chaos in Syria 'has all the ingredients' to produce terrorists also willing to try to kill people in the UK. Arrests: The two women were held at Heathrow (file picture) and the Met has held 14 teenagers on Syria-related allegations in total this month compared to 24 in all of 2013 . It came as two women accused of trying to smuggle cash from Britain to Syria to fund terrorism appeared in court. Naval Masaad, 26, and Amal El-Wahabi, 27, allegedly tried to take 20,000 Euros on a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. Masaad was arrested at Heathrow airport and found to have the cash wrapped in cling film stashed in her underwear. The two women wept and hugged each other in the dock when they appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today. Mother of two El-Wahabi waved and blew kisses to her family in the public gallery while Masaad's mother Zora Alla ran weeping from court. Masaad, of Holloway, and El-Wahabi, of Willesden, are both charged with becoming concerned in an arrangement as a result of which money was made available or was to be made available to another, and they knew or had reasonable cause to suspect that it would or may be used for the purposes of terrorism. They were both remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on January 31 for a preliminary hearing. Neither indicated a plea to the charge.

"Sue Hemming, head of counter-terrorism at the Crown Prosecution Service, says that Britons who go to fight in Syria will be prosecuted . British citizens who leave the country to join the war in Syria will be prosecuted and could be imprisoned for life, a Crown Prosecution Service chief warned today. Sue Hemming, head of counter-terrorism at the CPS, said even 'freedom fighters' who wanted to defeat 'loathsome' dictators such as president Bashar Assad would be dealt with 'robustly' when they returned to the UK. She said that Britons who go abroad to study at terror training camps were breaking the law and would face charges, saying some could be prosecuted even before they'd left Britain if there was evidence that they were planning to fight. Ms Hemming also warned that further prosecutions would be brought against those yet to depart if police found evidence that they were planning to fight. Her comments came after a recent spate of arrests by police of young Britons travelling to Britain or planning to go, and a warning from a senior police chief about those who went away to fight. Last month at least 16 people were arrested on suspicion of terror offences after travelling between Syria and the UK, compared to 24 in the whole of 2013. Ms Hemming said: 'The message for people who are . considering going out there and getting involved in terrorist training . or getting involved in the conflict is that they will be potentially . breaking the law in this country.' She added: 'Potentially it’s an offence to go out and get involved in a conflict, however loathsome you think the people on the other side are. There are currently seven British residents awaiting trial over charges connected to the war in Syria, including two women from London. Ms Hemming told the London Evening Standard: 'In three of the cases that we are . prosecuting we allege that they have travelled there, got themselves . involved in training and come back again.' She said that three of the cases involved Britons attending training in rebel training camps, and in one of those cases, the CPS will allege that the Briton was going to join al-Nusra, a Syrian rebel group linked to al Qaeda. Increasing numbers of Britons are choosing to leave their lives in the UK and travel to fight in the Syrian civil war . Ms Hemming said that under Section 5 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which bans acts preparatory to terrorism and assisting another person in such activities, the maximum penalty is life. Sections 6 and 8 of the legislation, which make it illegal to train as a terrorist or to attend a training camp, have a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. The prosecutor told the paper that terrorism meant any action driven by political, ideological, religious or racial motives seeking to influence a government or intimidate a section of the public, which meant that even those seeking to oust Assad would be breaking the law. She said helping in humanitarian relief organisations was not a crime, but said Britons heading out to Syria could meet people from terror organisations while out there and then pose a threat to the security of the UK. Scotland . Yard fears more than 300 Britons have swapped ordinary lives in the UK . to go to Syria and fight with groups affiliated to al Qaeda. Akram, 24, who worked for Ludlow Thompson was described by neighbours as 'well-mannered' London estate agent Akram . Sebah, 24, was killed alongside his brother, Mohamed, as they waged . jihad in Syria's civil war, it emerged last month. The . brothers, described as 'well-mannered' by neighbours in Holloway, north . London, had travelled to Syria without telling the rest of their family . and were thought to have been fighting with al-Nusra. A year ago, Akram, who has a biomedical sciences degree, was working as an estate agent for firm Ludlow Thompson in London. His Facebook page contains photographs showing him enjoying himself on nights out with colleagues. One shows him with his arm around a female colleague as they celebrate their sales team ‘smashing their target again!’. Last week Akram's distraught father said his sons had told no-one of their plans to go to fight in Syria. Abdulrahman . Sebah, 62, of Holloway, north London, said: ‘No father or mother wishes . their children to go to hell, or to whatever you call Syria. 'If someone . goes there, absolutely 100 per cent they don’t come back.'

"An ultra-orthodox Jewish village in upstate New York where the welcome sign lists modesty rules has built a series of children’s playgrounds segregated by gender. And though it may sound extreme to some, for a community where male-female interaction is strictly controlled, it was all but a necessity. Kiryas Joel, in New York’s Catskills region, was founded in 1977 by members of the Satmar Hasidim orthodox community as a place where they could practice their strict, morally conservative lifestyle unfettered by outside influence. Segregated: The Satmar Hasidim people who inhabit the New York village of Kiryas Joel exclusively have built a gender segregated playground . The construction of the playground takes this ethos a step forward. ‘It was time, that the city which was founded according to the regulations and directives of Rabbi Joel Teitelbaum, have a park which is fully sex segregated, according the strict laws of true Torah Jews,” a Satmar community activist reportedly said. The playground is partitioned into four parts: one for fathers with their sons, one for mothers with their daughters, a third for just boys and another just for girls. Each sectioned is spaced far from the others and the male facilities are blue, while the female sides are red and white. A sign in Yiddish outlines the gender-specific rules and warns visitors to  ‘maintain gender separation in all public areas.’ Watching: Signs to the partitioned playgrounds warn visitors to obey gender separation rules. The town's 'modest committee' will keep watch . Private: The red and blue playground 'compounds' were built with private finds after the village refused government grant money . BHOLWORLD.com reports that the playground will be ‘under the supervision of the Committee of modesty.’ It has also been reported that only the Satmar of Kiryas Joel will be allowed in the playground. Around one-third of the town’s over 20,000 residents received some form of government assistance in 2011, but the town itself apparently draws a lie at receiving free government money. Kiryas Joel reportedly refused a grant of $195,000 from the state of New York  in 2001 to build a park, and instead used ‘special financing’ courtesy of the mayor, Rabbi Abraham Wieder. Meanwhile, the playground is located at the outskirts of Monroe, New York—the town in which the village is situated—making it uncertain how the strict rules will be greeted by the larger community in the area. The tradition in the villages of Satmar Hasidic Jews is modesty. Even on the hottest of days, most residents cover up from head to toe, with unmarried men and women kept apart at all times. Women also cannot wear provocative clothes as men are not supposed to see anything that inspires inappropriate thoughts. Close: Only around 50 miles outside the largest city in the United States, the town now claims the country first sex-segregated playground .","The Satmar Hasidim of Kiryas Joel, New York built the park without the help of government money .
It remains to be seen if area townspeople will also be welcome in the playground ."
"A smiling Prince Harry crouches over the body of one-ton water buffalo moments after he shot it dead on a hunting trip. This photograph has emerged less than a week after the young royal pledged to do all he could to save Africa’s critically endangered wildlife. And it also follows worldwide condemnation of another royal hunting trip just ten days ago when Prince William went boar shooting in Spain. Croucing over the body of a water buffalo: The picture was taken in November 2004, when the then 20-year-old was on a gap year trip to South America shortly before he enrolled at Sandhurst military academy . Harry, who is also known to stalk stag, is likely to face similar attention following the publication of this picture, which has not been seen before in the UK. It was taken in November 2004, when the then 20-year-old was on a gap year trip to South America shortly before he enrolled at Sandhurst military academy. The prince spent several months working on the El Remanso polo farm in Argentina. During the trip, he and his then girlfriend Chelsy Davy joined an expedition to hunt big game, staying at a private lodge in the province of Entre Rios. The ranch was owned by Count Claudio Zichy-Thyssen, one of the country’s most powerful landowners with more than 170,000 acres stocked with game. Worries: Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Charles - flanked by his two sons - warned that the imminent extinction of some of the world's most precious species would have 'dire consequences for humanity' A firm called CH Hunting organised the shooting party. The . company offers huntsmen the chance to bag red stag, wild deer, puma, . antelope, boar and birds such as doves and pigeon. But the water . buffalo, which can turn deadly if wounded, is the ‘trophy kill’ for any . Argentinian hunter. Prince William has reportedly promised to destroy all the ivory from the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace. The Duke of Cambridge, 31, is said to want to act in the hope that it will ‘send a message’ to illegal elephant poachers and encourage other heads of state to follow suit. The priceless collection includes around 1,200 items which contain ivory – from fans and miniatures to a throne from India presented to Queen Victoria with elephant-ivory plaques. Jane Goodall, a veteran primatologist, said she had spoken to the prince and he declared he would ‘like to see all the ivory owned by Buckingham Palace destroyed’. The plan has been widely praised, with Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith saying: ‘It’s difficult to imagine a stronger symbol of the horrors of ivory than Buckingham Palace publicly destroying its own. Good for Prince William for pushing this.’ But art critic Brian Sewell called the move ‘pointless’, adding: ‘I can’t see the connection between saving elephants and destroying works of art made centuries ago.’ The collection comprises more than a million paintings, antiques and artefacts held in trust on behalf of the nation. A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment. At the . time, a local newspaper claimed the head of the animal  in the picture, . and that of a wild boar shot by Harry, were embalmed so they could be . shipped back to the UK as a gift for the prince. It is not clear whether . this ever took place. A Kensington Palace spokesman declined to comment on the photo last night. But a senior royal aide said: ‘It would be a great shame if the publication of this picture were to detract from the efforts being made  by the three princes to curb the appalling illegal  wildlife trade. ‘Like his father and brother, Prince Harry has always been a strong supporter of the campaign to protect endangered species.’ Speaking at a conference on Thursday, Prince Charles – flanked by his two sons – warned that the imminent extinction of some of the world’s most precious species would have ‘dire consequences for humanity’. The heir to the throne told the meeting of international leaders in London that the ‘appalling’ illegal trade in ivory, rhino horn, tiger parts and endangered animals was ‘annihilating our threatened wildlife’. There is no suggestion that any member of the Royal Family has ever shot an animal illegally. In 1961, on an official visit to India with the Queen, Prince Philip, a former president of the World Wildlife Fund, shot a tiger at Ranthambhore, while a guest of the Maharaja of Jaipur. On the same trip the royal – once a keen big game-hunter who shot stag, pheasant and grouse until recently – killed a crocodile and six urials, a type of mountain sheep. His actions prompted widespread condemnation from British and Indian politicians. But, significantly, they were not against the law at the time.","Picture was taken in 2004 when he was on South America gap year trip .

"Charged: British student Nawal Msaad, 26, is accused of trying to smuggle £16,500 in her underwear to terrorists fighting in Syria . A student accused of trying to smuggle £16,500 in her underwear to terrorists fighting in Syria appeared in court yesterday. Nawal Msaad, 26, and her alleged co-conspirator Amal Elwahabi, 27, are the first British women charged with terror offences over the conflict. Msaad, an undergraduate from Holloway, North London, was arrested at  Heathrow last Thursday as she prepared to board a flight to Istanbul with 20,000 euros wrapped in cling film in her knickers. Hours later, police swooped on Elwahabi, who stands jointly accused of being part of an arrangement in which money was made available for the purposes  of terrorism. Yesterday the two women wept and hugged as they appeared at City of  Westminster Magistrates’ Court. The court heard that the two Britons attempted to send the bundle of rolled-up notes to a suspected British jihadist fighting in Syria’s civil war. Officers from Scotland Yard’s Counter Terrorism Command arrested Msaad at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 at 9.20am last Thursday. Elwahabi was arrested at 2.26pm at her home in Willesden, North-West London, where she lives with her two sons, aged five and seven months old. Yesterday both women spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth. Neither indicated a plea to the charge. District Judge Howard Riddle remanded the women, who are both of Moroccan descent, in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on January 31. The charges became public as police revealed that schoolgirls as young as 17 have been arrested at UK airports over suspected terrorist offences linked to Syria. The head of the Counter Terrorism Command, Richard Walton, said several teenagers had been enticed to join jihadists fighting in the war-torn country, as he warned that the conflict posed a growing threat to national security. Earlier this month, two 17-year-old . girls from London and West Yorkshire were held at Heathrow as they were . boarding a flight to Istanbul. Officers spent five days quizzing the . girls before releasing them without charge. But Mr Walton said yesterday . that other ‘boys and girls’ were being lured to join rebel forces . fighting in Syria. He said . the numbers of Syria-related terror arrests had soared, with 14 in the . first three weeks of this year – more than half the total for the whole . of 2013. He said: ‘We’ve had a number of . teenagers both from London and nationally who’ve been attempting to go . to Syria. That’s boys and girls, unfortunately. ‘It’s not just the odd one. It’s shocking that they are such young people.’ He . told the London Evening Standard it was ‘almost inevitable’ fighters . would try to mount attacks in the UK on their return. Security officials . say hundreds of UK nationals have travelled to the war-torn country . over the past two years. Hearing: A high security prison van arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court today, believed to be carrying Amal Elwahabi, 27, and Nawal Msaad, 26 . Many suspected Islamic extremists have posted messages on social media networks about their experiences in a bid to encourage other Britons to join them. One man who boasted that fighting in . Syria was ‘5-star Jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature, and posted . photos glorifying the violence, died in a battlefield clash 2,000 miles . from his Hampshire home. Ifthekar . Jaman, 23, urged fellow Britons to join him, using his Twitter account . to criticise parents who tried to stop their children travelling to . Syria. In many cases, the fanatics head there with the express intention of fighting alongside Al Qaeda. Others . leave the country intending to carry out humanitarian or medical work, . but are quickly radicalised and decide to take part in ‘jihad’. Court date: Both women spoke only to confirm their names, addresses and dates of birth. Neither indicated a plea to the charge . While it is not a crime to travel to the war-torn country, police are concerned that many who have joined the rebel forces seeking to topple President Bashar Assad have made contact with terrorist groups linked to Al Qaeda before heading back to the UK, where it is feared they could now be plotting terrorist attacks. When radicals return, security officials have to decide if they pose an on-going threat to the UK public. Options include placing them under intensive surveillance or applying for a terrorism prevention order. Mr Walton said several police operations were under way to target British ‘facilitators’ organising terrorist missions to Syria.

The note, written by an FBI agent, reports that Churchill urged Right-wing Republican Senator Styles Bridges to persuade President Harry Truman to launch a nuclear attack which would ‘wipe out’ the Kremlin and make the Soviet Union a ‘very easy problem’ to deal with. The Russians would have been defenceless against a nuclear attack at that time – they did not successfully test their own atomic bomb until 1949. Britain and the Soviet Union had been allies in the Second World War until 1945, the year Churchill lost office as Prime Minister. But he was one of the first international statesmen to recognise the post-war threat posed by the USSR, and in 1946 made a famous speech in Fulton, Missouri, about an ‘iron curtain’ having descended across Europe as Joseph Stalin consolidated his grip on the eastern half of the continent. The FBI document shows Churchill’s belligerence towards Britain’s former wartime ally ran so deep that he was prepared to tolerate the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Soviet civilians in a nuclear strike. Churchill believed a pre-emptive strike on Stalin’s Russia might be the only way to stop Communism conquering the West . The memo claims Churchill ‘stated that the only salvation for the civilisation of the world would be if the President of the United States would declare Russia to be imperilling world peace and attack Russia’. The note continues: ‘He pointed out that if an atomic bomb could be dropped on the Kremlin, wiping it out, it would be a very easy problem to handle the balance of Russia, which would be without direction. ‘Churchill further stated that if this was not done, Russia will attack the United States in the next two or three years when she gets the atomic bomb and civilisation will be wiped out or set back many years.’ The memo is published for the first time in a book called When Lions Roar: The Churchills And The Kennedys, by award-winning investigative journalist Thomas Maier. It is due to be published in Britain next month. John F. Kennedy regarded Churchill as his hero and made him an honorary American citizen in 1963 – the first person to be given such an accolade. The two families shared friends, such as Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who married Jacqueline Kennedy after her husband’s assassination. Maier said: ‘Churchill had been a great historian of warfare. He saw the last great cavalry charge during the First World War and championed the development of tanks. ‘I think he saw a nuclear strike as just another progression of conventional warfare, until he realised there was a lot more devastation with nuclear weapons.’ Maier said Churchill was more ‘bellicose’ when out of office. After he returned to power in 1951, a nuclear attack against the USSR was never mentioned again.","Britain's war-time leader urged the US to launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union to win the Cold War .

"No Spain striker had ever taken so long to score his first international goal but  Diego Costa has finally done it, getting off the mark for his adopted country after 515 minutes in the red shirt. In a 4-0 win against Luxembourg, Costa had toiled for 70 frustrating minutes, burying his head in his Spain shirt after one horror miss, but failing to bury a single chance. It seemed the Premier League’s top scorer was going to continue saving all his goals for Chelsea, but the 26-year-old opened his international account with a scrappy second half goal in the rain at the Stade Josey Barthel. Diego Costa is surrounded by his Spain team-mates after scoring his first international goal on Sunday night against Luxembourg .

Bookings: Costa . Goals: Silva (27), Alcacer (42), Costa (69), Bernat (88) Referee: Pawel Gil (Poland) It took Fernando Morientes just two minutes to get off the mark for Spain, the great Alfredo Di Stefano did it in 47 minutes, former Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo in 77 minutes, Spain’s all-time leading scorer David Villa in 210 minutes and Fernando Torres in 220. Costa was starting to resemble Torres in his worst days at Chelsea and he had also drawn blanks in his brief dalliance with the Brazilian national team, failing to score in two friendlies. He was mobbed by ecstatic team-mates when he finally broke his duck after Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets had seen their shots blocked, before the ball fell to Costa inside the six-yard box and he rifled it home. For the Chelsea marksman it was more relief than celebration and when he made way for Valencia striker Rodrigo with 10 minutes left, he looked as if a massive weight had been lifted from his shoulders. The goal should have come much earlier. He nearly scored on 11 minutes when he got his head to a cross from David Silva but Luxembourg goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert made the save. He then shot from distance but the shot struck a defender and bounced safely into Joubert’s hands. The Chelsea striker came into the game having had 18 shots without a single goal - in sharp contrast to nine goals from 22 shots for Chelsea. He was playing without his club team-mate Cesc Fabregas, left out of Vicente del Bosque’s team. With the provider of so many of his goals on the bench, he tried to turn provider himself for Paco Alcacer but the young Valencia striker playing alongside him failed to get on the end of Costa’s cross. After some intricate play on the edge of the Luxembourg area between Alcacer, Koke, and Andres Iniesta the ball fell to Costa and again he got his shot away well, only for Joubert to save. In Fabregas’s absence, Silva was finding himself in more central areas and he smashed home Spain’s first from the edge of the area. The Manchester City man has now scored 22 goals for Spain - of non-strikers only Fernando Hierro has scored more in Spain’s history. Costa turned out to be offside for this chance but the Chelsea striker was unaware as the linesman took his time to raise his flag . Costa turns away in frustration as he misses a sitter during the Spain game but the striker eventually got his name on the score sheet . Costa hides himself after squandering a great chance to open his goalscoring account for Spain against Luxembourg on Sunday . Costa was frustrated to not open his Spain account in the first half but was able to do so in the second as the visitors ran riot . The goal calmed Spain’s nerves but not Costa’s who snatched at his next chance, running on to Pique’s long pass but not making a clean connection with his shot. His next miss was worst. Another long ball out from the back found the forward in a central position inside the area but his attempt to lift it over the goalkeeper and into the far corner ended with his shot going well wide. Costa buried his head beneath his Spain shirt as team-mates on the pitch and on the bench looked on in disbelief. De Gea was in for the dropped Iker Casillas and he had so little to do he could have taken Roy Keane’s autobiography on to the pitch. But he was tested late in the first half, tipping Daniel Da Mota’s cross-shot just over his bar as the home side finally threatened. Luxembourg are not quite the whipping boys they once were - only two of the last six teams to visit them have come away with a victory, but against a determined Spain side coming into the game having lost four of their last six matches, they were two down before half-time. And as if to make things even worse for Costa, who by now had had seven efforts on goal, it was his strike partner Alcacer who got the second making it three goals in his first three games since his debut. In the second period Costa added the third before substitute Juan Bernat got goal number four. The Bayern Munich full-back had managed to find the net on his debut. It had taken Costa a little longer. But the striker Spain persuaded to defect from Brazil, only to see him fail to spark in his home land at the World Cup, is finally up and running. Costa falls to ground as the Spain striker tries to go around Luxembourg goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert on Sunday night . Costa nabbed his first goal for Spain on Sunday night and the Chelsea striker  certainly had plenty of chances to do so in the first half .","Manchester City midfielder David Silva opens scoring against Luxembourg on Sunday night in Euro 2016 qualifier .

"Brave Kurdish soldiers battling Islamic State militants in northern Syria have converted tractors and lorries into tanks by adding metal plates to create Mad Max-style road warriors. The peshmerga troops were forced to take the initiative and create their own armoured vehicles after the far better equipped ISIS jihadists repeatedly got the better of the Kurds' Soviet-era military fleet. In recent weeks hundreds of thousands of Syrian Kurds have been forced to flee across the border into Turkey, as ISIS launched an onslaught into the autonomous Kurdish territory in northern Syria.

Previously troops from the People's Protection Units (YPG) in northern Syria had little more than rifles and flak jackets - making them incredibly vulnerable in the face of heavily-armed ISIS terrorists. Much of the weaponry and military equipment currently in the hands of the jihadists was gathered after thousands of members of the U.S. trained and expensively equipped Iraqi army melted away in the face of a lightning advance by just a few hundred ISIS militants in June. As the soldiers fled the scene, they left behind millions of pounds worth of top-of-the-range and barely used equipment - all of which was quickly swept up by ISIS. Since then the Kurdish peshmerga forces have carried out the defence of much of northern Syria and Iraq, despite the fact many of the militants only know how to operate clunky, decades-old Soviet-era weapons and are hugely under-resourced in terms of ammunition and protective equipment.

Tough: A peshmerga soldier poses with one of the converted farm vehicles being used in the fight against ISIS . U.S.-led air strikes hit grain silos and other targets in Islamic State-controlled territory in northern and eastern Syria overnight, killing civilians and wounding militants, a group monitoring the war said today. The aircraft may have mistaken the mills and grain storage areas in the northern Syrian town of Manbij for an Islamic State base, said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. There was no immediate comment from Washington. The United States has targeted Islamic State and other fighters in Syria since last week with the help of Arab allies, and in Iraq since last month. It aims to damage and destroy the bases, forces and supply lines of the al Qaeda offshoot which has captured large areas of both countries. The strikes in Manbij appeared to have killed only civilians, not fighters, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory which gathers information from sources in Syria. The Kurdish forces have used their homemade armoured vehicles - which are bright and elaborately decorated -  to keep ISIS advances in check, and in some cases even force them to retreat. One place in which the vehicles have been deployed is Kobane - the small Syrian town that has been besieged by ISIS militants for a week. The Kurdish fighters in Iraq said that although they had been promised equipment from the U.S. and European countries, but so far most of the shipments included food - something they need far less urgently than weapons. Last week, one Kobane resident told the Independent: 'Don't send us food, we don't need food...we will eat mud if we have to. Send us weapons, send us peshmerga.' But while they continue waiting for the Western weapons to materialise, the Kurdish forces are reliant more than ever on their makeshift armoured vehicles to protect their population from the murderous fanatics who pose such a threat to their existence. In recent weeks hundreds of thousands of Syrian Kurds have been forced to flee across the border into Turkey, as Isis launched an onslaught into the autonomous Kurdish territory in northern Syria.

Fierce fighting has been reported on the outskirts of Baghdad where ISIS militants are attempting to seize control of the Iraqi capital - despite ongoing Western airstrikes against the terror group. The fighting is taking place just one mile to the west of the city, with government forces desperately trying to hold off the militants, who allegedly killed up to 1,000 soldiers during clashes yesterday. ISIS have held a number of towns and villages close to the Iraqi capital since earlier in the year, when government troops melted away following a lightning advance in the west of the country - enabling the terrorist group to seize further swaths of territory for their so-called caliphate.

In a message posted on Facebook, the group said: 'The Islamic State are now less than 2km away from entering Baghdad. They said it could never happen and now it almost has. 'Obama says he overestimated what the Iraqi Army could do. Well you only need to be hear a very short while to know they can do very very little,' they added. The claims were backed up by Canon White himself, who shared the message just hours after he had earlier suggested the group were approximately six miles from the centre of Baghdad.

"Mottled bolete mushroom: The researchers believe that the evolution of early fungi may have stopped coal reserves from forming . The arrival of mushrooms may have stopped the formation of coal deposits we burn as fuel today. This fuel is actually the fossilized remains of plants that lived from around 360 to 300 million years ago. But at the end of that period, coal stooped forming. Now scientists believe that the evolution of fungi that 'ate' dead plants may have stopped coal deposits from forming. The discovery might pave the way for new biofuels. The evolution of fungi capable of fully digesting plants may have stopped dead plants building up into peat, and then forming coal. Coal generated nearly half of the roughly four trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity consumed in the United States in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The evidence, presented online in the June 29 edition of the journal Science, suggests that the evolution of fungi capable of breaking down the polymer lignin, which helps keep plant cell walls rigid, may have played a key role in ending the development of coal deposits. With the arrival of the new fungi, dead plant matter could be completely broken down into its basic chemical components. Instead of accumulating as peat, which eventually was transformed into coal, the great bulk of plant biomass decayed and was released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. ‘We're hoping this will get into the biology and geology textbooks,’ said Clark University biologist David Hibbett. ‘When you read about coal formation it's usually explained in terms of physical processes, and that the rate of coal deposition just crashed at the end of the Permo-Carboniferous. Why was that? There are various explanations. 'The evolution of white rot fungi could've been a factor – perhaps a major factor. Once you have white rot you can break down lignin, the major precursor of coal. So the evolution of white rot is a very important event in the evolution of carbon cycle.’ A fern preserved in coal: This fuel is actually the fossilized remains of plants that lived from around 360 to 300 million years ago . The evolution of fungi capable of fully digesting plants may have stopped dead plants building up into peat, and then forming coal . ‘The concept of the invention of an enzyme that can break down the 'unbreakable' is really great,’ said Kenneth Nealson, of the University of Southern California. ‘The idea that a stable (inedible) form of organic carbon can become edible (and thus more difficult to bury over time), changes our perspective not only on global energy storage in the past, but on what it means for present day carbon sequestration and storage, in that sense this idea will have a big impact on our thinking about the past and the present.’ For their study, Hibbett and his colleagues focused on Basidiomycetes, which include mushroom species with the familiar cap-and-stem look that most people associate with fungi. Basidiomycetes also include brown rot fungi such as the dry rot that can destroy houses by breaking down the cellulose in the construction wood but leave the lignin untouched and white rot fungi of interest to the pulp and paper industries that can break down both types of polymers. The researchers then used molecular clock analyses to track the evolution of the enzymes back through the fungal lineages. The idea is that just as the hands of a clock move at a defined rate around the dial, genes accumulate mutations at a roughly constant rate. This rate of change allows researchers to work backwards, estimating when two lineages last shared a common ancestor based on the amount of divergence. The comparative analyses suggested that around 290 million years ago, right at the end of the Carboniferous period, a white rot fungal ancestor with the capacity to break down lignin appeared. Prior to that ancestor, fungi did not have that ability and thus the lignin in plant matter was not degraded, allowing these lignin-rich residues to build up in soil over time.","Coal stopped forming 300 million years ago .

"Claims have been made by a prominent Iranian opposition blogger based in London which suggest Iran killed its own nuclear scientist. Earlier this month Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, was hanged at Tehran's Evin Prison after being sentenced to death for killing the Iranian scientist Masoud Ali Mohammad. But blogger Potkin Azarmehr alleges that certain anomalies in his case contribute to a theory held by many activists, that Iranian intelligence agents may have been the cause of his death. Earlier this month Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, (left) was hanged at Tehran's Evin Prison after being sentenced to death for killing the nuclear scientist, Masoud Ali Mohammadi (right) The recent emergence of a passport purported to belong to Mr Fahi has increased suspicions that he was a scapegoat for the killing, while many opposition activists, such as Mr Azarmehr believe that his execution was a staged hoax. Some Iranian dissidents believe that the country has used the cover of its war with Israel to crack down on internal opponents, with some saying that Mr Mohammadi was killed because he was a supporter of reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi. Ali-Mohammadi died in January 2010 when a remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside his home in Tehran went off. When Mr Mohammadi died, Iran immediately blamed his murder on the U.S, Israel and their 'hired agents.' Questions raised: The recent emergence of a passport purported to belong to Mr Fahi has increased suspicions that he was a scapegoat . State television swiftly blamed Israel for the attacks, although it has always denied any role in the scientist’s killing. But there has always been doubt Mr Mohammadi's death. A spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said at the time that Mr Mohammadi, a 50-year-old Tehran University professor, was not involved in its activities. But Western intelligence agencies have had conflicting information about whether Mr Mohammadi was contributing to the nuclear program. Iranian media broadcast a report which said Mr Fashi had confessed to travelling to Tel Aviv to receive training from Mossad before returning to Iran to plot the assassination. Paraded on TV, the kickboxer also confessed to receiving forged travel documents in Azerbaijan to travel to Israel, Iran's Press TV reported. But in a blog post, ABC News reported that Mr Azarmehr has raised questions of the authenticity of Mr Fashi's passport. The passport was presented on Iranian state television at the weekend as hard evidence that Mr Fashi had been in the pay of Israel. Explosion: The damage caused by the blast that killed Iranian scientist Massoud Ali-Mohammadi in Tehran . Claims: A remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside the scientist's home in Tehran. Iran blamed it on Mossad . But Mr Azarmehr said that the Israeli passport was stamped 2003, when Mr Fashi would have been 15-year-old. But the photo was of a man in his 20s, who is looking away from the camera. The date of birth on the passport is concealed. 'No passport will be issued with such a picture, anywhere in the world,' wrote Mr Azarmehr. 'You need a headshot where you are open-eyed AND looking into the camera.' Mr Azarmehr writes: 'This is yet another question in the whole series of doubts about what Jamali Fashi's role, if any, in the assassination of Iranian particle physicist, Massoud Ali-Mohammadi was.' Mr Azarmehr claims that Mr Fashi was not a Mossad agent and may not even have been executed, reported the website. Mr Azarmehr cites his reasons by noting in earlier posts that Mr Fashi did not appear to be fearful in a video allegedly recorded right before his execution. He also says that the only official photo taken of him after his hanging shows him from far away so is not easy to make out. 'The only picture of Jamali Fashi's execution which is shown in the video above is blurred and from a distant and it can not be verified that its him. Isreal is believed to be keeping a close eye on Iran's nuclear capacity. Here is the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran, which is believed to be part of its programme . 'Given that the regime is not known for its regard for public sensitivity in seeing pictures of the dead and morbid images, why is it that in this instance they have chosen not to show his pictures?' His claims have been cited by some news services - Dubai-based news channel al-Arabiya has said that the passport displayed on Iranian television has a misplaced passport number and design features that indicate it dates from the 1990s. Tehran has accused Israel and the U.S. of assassinating four Iranian scientists since 2010 in order to sabotage its nuclear programme which the West suspects is hiding Iran's attempt to develop a nuclear weapons capability. While Israel has declined to comment on the killings, it regards Iran's nuclear programme as an existential threat and has threatened military action against Tehran. Washington has denied any U.S. role. The most recent attack on an Iranian scientist occurred in January. Mostafa Ahmadi-Roshan - a deputy director of the Natanz uranium enrichment facility - was killed when a magnetic bomb planted on his vehicle detonated.","London-based dissident Potkin Azarmehr made explosive claims about the death of Iranian scientist Masoud Ali Mohammadi in his online blog .

"As a family day out, it must rank as one of the more bizarre and macabre. Men, women and children lined up in the sunshine yesterday for a chance to view the corpse of Muammar Gaddafi.

Grisly sight: Shell-shocked Libyans look at the bloodied body of their former leader Muammar Gaddafi and take photos . Undignified end: Gaddafi's head is turned slightly to the left. There are suggestions that this has been done to hide a bullet hole in his skull . Making history: A soldier takes a photograph next to Gaddafi's body.

Gaddafi’s son Mutassim and ex-defence minister Abu Bakr Younis – was . taken to the storeroom after the dictator was killed on Thursday. But discoloured and fast decaying, it is presenting Libya’s new rulers with one of their first conundrums: what to do with it. With residents of the country’s major . cities refusing to have the dictator buried in their midst, and calls . by Gaddafi’s wife for the body to be sent to her in exile in Algeria, . Libya’s military chiefs are even discussing disposing of it in the . Mediterranean. ‘We don’t want a shrine to him,’ one commander said yesterday. ‘He doesn’t deserve a proper burial. We need to get rid of the body the way the Americans dealt with Osama Bin Laden.’ Before the first families were . allowed into the shopping centre yesterday, a post-mortem was carried . out. The ghoulish scene didn't stop queues stretching around the block as people flocked to gawp at the toppled tyrant. In a dank, cold room in the makeshift mortuary, the former leader's body was covered by a blue blanket that left only his head exposed, hiding the bruises on his torso and scratch marks on his chest. Gaddafi's battered head had been turned to the left, to hide the bullet hole that killed him. Guards overseeing the body had handed out green surgical masks because of the awful smell. Libya's chief forensic pathologist Dr Othman al-Zintani today said an autopsy had confirmed Gaddafi was killed by a shot to the head, and he also had bullet wounds to the abdomen. Doctors completed the examination today but Dr al-Zintani would not give more details until he has given his report to the attorney general. Authorities in Libya want to establish whether he died in crossfire on the way to . hospital, as the government has suggested, or whether he was executed by the . fighters who caught him. Rebel fighters claim they captured the 69-year-old alive and then shot him. But this account differs from the National Transitional Council's version, in which Gaddafi died in a gun-fight. Grim sight: Libyans wear medical masks as they wait in line to visit Muammar Gaddafi's body in Misrata . Wearing masks because of the stench, Libyans queue to visit their former dictator's body . One rebel today claimed that Gaddafi . pleaded for his life, offering them as much gold as they wanted in . return for sparing his life. Hammad Mufti Ali, 28, told Italian . daily Corriere Della Sera that a terrified Gaddafi swore he would  pay . for their children to go to school. Mr Ali added: 'At one point someone . screamed at him that instead of talking about money, as a good Muslim he . should have been praying for his soul to be entrusted to God before . dying. 'But he just kept saying he was ready to give us lots and lots of money and gold.' He said that Gaddafi was then dragged on to the truck in scenes seen around the world and 'that's where he died. 'His body just could not take it. He was losing too much blood.' Gaddafi was said to have more that . $200billion in cash and gold hidden away with some of it spread in . secret accounts across the world, including in Zimbabwe. A row has now broken out over what . will happen to the tyrant's body next, with his surviving family members . demanding it is released so he can be afforded a traditional funeral . with 24 hours. His  widow Safia has also backed international demands for an inquiry into his killing. Reports last night suggested the National . Transitional Council will hand over the dead dictator's corpse to . members of his extended family. Acting prime minister Mahmoud Jibril said today that investigations into who shot Gaddafi were continuing. Final hiding place: The inside of a concrete tunnel into which Gaddafi and a small number of body guards crawled into once their convoy had been hit . No escape now: Gaddafi is surrounded by rebels waving AK-47s and walked . across the barren desert. His left arm has been wounded, possibly when . his convoy of 80 jeeps was hit by air raids . Last gasps of breath: A handgun is pointed at Gaddafi as he lays bleeding on the floor of an ambulance. The next time he was seen in public he was dead . He gave his own account of the likely events leading up to the death of the former Libyan leader. He . said: 'It seems that he was involved in a battle between the Qatari . security brigades of Gaddafi and the freedom fighters. And he was hiding . in some sort of a sewage tube. 'One of the mercenaries, he's a . Mauritanian, when he was caught he told the freedom fighters that . Gaddafi was hiding in the tube,' said Mr Jibril. 'So they went there and they brought him out and they were taking him to that truck to take him to a field hospital. 'On . their way they got in crossfire between the freedom fighters and the . security brigades. He was shot in the head. We don't know whether he was . shot by the freedom fighters or the security brigades.' A local military commander in the city of Misrata, where the force which captured him took his body, said 'over-enthusiastic' fighters took matters into their own hands when they came face to face with their former ruler. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said: 'We wanted to keep him alive but the young guys, things went out of control.' However, few people in Libya say they are troubled by the manner of his death.","Tyrant's body covered, bullet wound to head masked .

"A Frenchwoman denied access to her three children by her Mexican former husband, whom she won child custody over, has taken her case to an international panel in Washington. Maude Versini will today ask the Inter-American Human Rights Commission for help to see her children whom she has not seen for two years. 'I am here to ask... for justice, and for it to force Mexico to take steps so that I am at least allowed access to my children, which so far I have been denied,' Maude Versini told AFP. International help: Maude Versini, ex wife of former Mexican governor Arturo Montiel, has taken her case to seek access to her children to the Inter-American Human Rights Commission . Versini was married to Arturo Montiel, a former governor of Mexico state from 1999-2005 and an uncle of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The couple wed in 2002, divorced in France and Mexico in 2007, and have three children aged between eight and nine. She said she won custody, and the kids were sent to see their father while on school vacations. 'Everything went well for four years, and in December 2011 they went on vacation to Mexico as usual,' said Versini. 'But then on January 1, their father phoned me and said the kids were never coming back to France.' Split: Two years ago the three children went to visit their father, Arturo Montiel, in Mexico, but they never returned home to their mother Maude Versini, in France . Earlier court rulings sided with the father in Mexico, but the mother maintains that justice has been manipulated by her ex-husband, giving her no hope of winning on appeal there. 'I think justice in Mexico state is clearly manipulated by my ex-husband,' Versini alleged. She said that she would ask the international commission to help with her rights and those of her children. 'It has been almost two years that I have had no contact with them,' Versini said, adding of her ex-husband: 'He is trying to make me pay for having left him ... but he is inflicting emotional damage on the children.' Montiel was a presidential hopeful at one point but backed off amid allegations of illicit enrichment and an investigation.","Frenchwoman Maude Versini won custody of her three children when she divorced Mexican Arturo Montiel, a former state governor, in 2007 .

"World-famous photographer David LaChapelle has captured transgender model Carmen Carrera in the nude, both as a man and a woman. The fantastical shots, which appear on two posters promoting the 2014 Life Ball for HIV and AIDS, see Ms Carrera, 28, re-enact a utopian scene, in which she appears in two versions; one as Adam and the other as Eve - both identical but for the genitalia, which are computer generated, leaving the question of whether she has male or female private parts in real life unanswered. 'I'm Adam, I've Eve, I'm me', the caption reads, a celebration of inclusion ahead of the May 31 annual Life Ball in Vienna, which is a the biggest charity event in Europe to support people with HIV. Blurred lines: Transgender model Carmen Carrera (pictured as Eve, censored) appears in photographer David LaChapelle's Garden of Eden inspired posters, which see her completely nude in a surreal, floral setting . 'Your gender should not matter in your heart or in the way you express your personality,' she says of the posters. 'There are so many types of diverse people on this planet. My message is: beauty has no gender. At the end of the day beauty is beauty.' The poster was inspired by this year's Life Ball motto, 'The Garden of Earthly Delights' and borrows from 15th Century artist Hieronymus Bosch's most iconic work of the same name; a chaotic tangle of nude bodies and scenes of Heaven and Hell. Double vision: The twin posters, which promote the 2014 Life Ball, an annual AIDS event, show Ms Carrera as Eve (left) and Adam (right), both are identical but for the computer generated genitalia . Inspiration: The whimsical photo artwork will be auctioned off for charity, and borrows from 15th Century artist Hieronymus Bosch's painting 'The Garden of Earthly Delights' (pictured) - which is this year's Life Ball motto . Mr LaChapelle, 51, went with a whimsical scene, his Garden of Eden landscape punctured with foliage and phallic symbolism - Ms Carrera posing with her long golden locks falling over her bare shoulders, her breasts exposed in both the Adam and the Eve portraits, and gazing at the nude male body before her, whose head is encased in an eerie sphere. 'For me the body is more than something to be looked at as an object of sexual gratification,' explains Mr LaChapelle, discussing his blurring of gender lines. 'The body is a beautiful housing for the soul that we are celebrating in this picture.' Stunner: Ms Carrera, seen in February at New York Fashion Week, has made quite the name for herself as a successful transgender model, and says her message is that 'beauty has no gender' And it's a beautiful body indeed. Ms Carrera first shot to fame on the 2010 season of RuPaul's Drag Race but was eliminated halfway through the season, later to be snapped up by Elite Model Management. Born Christopher Roman, she started her gender re-assignment surgery in 2012, including a breast augmentation and a nose job, but as her fame has grown, she has remained tight-lipped as to whether she has had surgery on her genitalia. 'The . body is more than something to be looked at as an object of sexual . gratification. The body is a beautiful housing for the soul that we are celebrating in this picture' In a 2012 Facebook post, she wrote: 'I live my life as a female but I have not gotten my gender reassignment surgery. To be honest, I'm still thinking about that part. Me and my husband want to be able to have kids one day and once I get the surgery, I will not be able to produce DNA to create an offspring with a genetic females DNA.[sic]' She has since separated from long-term partner Adrian Torres. Change: Ms Carrera originally shot to fame as a man in 2010 when she appeared in RuPaul's Drag Race, before being snapped up by Elite Model Management and having surgery to become a woman in 2012 . Mystery: She has remained tight-lipped as to whether she has had the full gender re-assignment surgery on her genitalia, but admitted in 2012 that she was torn because she wanted the chance to have children . Ms Carrera is now keen to work on breaking down the barriers between the 'normal' modelling industry and that of transgender modelling. Speaking about models such as Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss, she said: 'I want to be like those girls. 'I don't want to just be labelled as a transgender model. Why do I have to be separated? It's the modelling industry - one industry.' As she was: Ms Carrera was born Chris Roman . And she's well on her way. Thousands of fans signed a Change.org petition in a bid to get her involved in Victoria's Secret's 2013 fashion show. And while the lingerie giant never addressed the petition, she has hardly been short on work. Aside from magazine and runway appearances, it has just been announced that she will star in an eight-episode docuseries, TransAmerica, produced by supermodel mogul Tyra Banks, and scheduled to debut at the end of this year. Mr LaChapelle's two photograph artworks will be auctioned at the AIDS Solidarity Gala 2014 in Vienna, just ahead of the Life Ball. 'David’s picture does not deal with sexuality as one might think at first glance, it’s about identity and expresses that human dignity and tolerance have no limits,' says Gery Keszler, founder of Life Ball. 'We are very honored to be able to transport one of Life Ball’s central issues with these outstanding pictures.'","Her genitalia is computer generated in the images, and it remains unclear whether the model has male or female private parts in real life .

"In the dark: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has admitted Barack Obama did not know about the considerable problems with the new health insurance website until after its launch . President Barack Obama was in the dark about the considerable problems with the Affordable Care Act's website until after the launch of the troubled service, the US health chief has revealed. Insurance companies have been complaining about issues using the site, which crashed during a test run before the launch, but the president was apparently unaware of the technical problems. Speaking to CNN, Kathleen Sebelius, the country's Health and Human Services Secretary, said Mr Obama first learned of them 'the first couple of days after' the site went live on October 1. When asked if he knew of any of the website's problems before that, she replied: 'No, sir.' Obama’s healthcare website has come under severe scrutiny since its launch and its programmers have said they expressed concerns beforehand but were ignored by their seniors. Insider interviews and a review of technical specifications found a mind-numbingly complex system put together by harried programmers who pushed out a final product that congressional investigators said was tested by the government and not private developers with more expertise. Sebelius said a team of experts has now been drafted in from Silicon Valley to solve the issues with the site. They are being led by Jeff Zients, a former CEO and acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. Sebelius admitted the government had hoped the HealthCare.gov  website had the 'A-team' working on it from the start, when asked why the experts were not brought in before its launch. 'We want new eyes and ears. We want to make sure that we get all the questions on the table, that we get all the answers and accelerator the fix as quickly as possible.' Part of the problem is attributed to 'extremely high' volume, Sebelius told CNN, with close to 20 million people using the new website in the first three weeks. Ultimately, Sebelius said the president and his team were not satisfied with the workings of the website, which they planned to be easy to use allowing consumers to compare healthcare policy plans. To date, 500,000 accounts had been created on the site, but not all of them have enrolled in healthcare plans. The President has pulled in Jeffrey Zients, left, acting Director of Office of Management and Budget, to manage a team of experts drafted in to resolve the website's  problems . Defending himself: President Obama spoke about the technical problems with the healthcare website on Monday after facing two weeks of backlash over the roll out of the Affordable Care Act . Project developers who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity - because they feared they would otherwise be fired - said they raised doubts among themselves whether the website could be ready in time. They were crammed into conference rooms with pizza for dinner, some programmers working past 10pm with energy drinks in hand. Others rewrote computer code over and over to meet what they considered last-minute requests for changes from the government or other contractors. They complained openly to each other about what they considered tight and unrealistic deadlines. One was nearly brought to tears over the stress of finishing on time, one developer said. Website builders saw red flags for months. A review of internal architectural diagrams obtained by the AP revealed the system's complexity. Problems: Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is the one tasked with the roll out and she has come under scrutiny . Insurance applicants have a host of personal information verified, including income and immigration status. The system connects to other federal computer networks, including ones at the Social Security Administration, IRS, Veterans Administration, Office of Personnel Management and the Peace Corps. President Barack Obama on Monday acknowledged technical problems that he described as 'kinks in the system' in a 'website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance'. He also promised a 'tech surge' by leading technology talent to repair the painfully slow and often unresponsive website to make ti work the 'way it should for everybody'. Adding more options: Following the slow responses on the website, the programers added 'apply by phone' options . 'There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People have been getting stuck during the application process. And I think it's fair to say that nobody is more frustrated by that than I am,' he said. The online system was envisioned as a simple way for people without health insurance to comparison-shop among competing plans offered in their state, pick their preferred level of coverage and cost and sign up. For many, it's not worked out that way so far. Pushing through: The President said that a 'tech surge' is under way, but new reports reveal that programers had concerns before the website launched . Unresolved problems led to visitors experiencing cryptic error messages or enduring long waits trying to sign up. Congressional investigators have concluded that the government's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, not private software developers, tested the exchange's computer systems during the final weeks. That task, known as integration testing, is usually handled by software companies because it ferrets out problems before the public sees the final product. The government spent at least $394million in contracts to build the federal health care exchange and the data hub. Those contracts included major awards to Virginia-based CGI Federal Inc., Maryland-based Quality Software Services Inc. and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. CGI Federal said in a statement Monday it was working with the government and other contractors 'around the clock' to improve the system, which it called 'complex, ambitious and unprecedented.' The flood of computer problems since the website went online has been deeply embarrassing for the White House. The snags have called into question whether the administration is capable of implementing the complex policy and why senior administration officials - including the president - appear to have been unaware of the scope of the problems when the exchange sites opened. Senator Mitch McConnel, the leading . Republican in the Senate, described the launch as a 'failure' on Sunday, . adding he doesn't believe the government can 'get the job done . correctly'. The administration acknowledged on Monday that a planned upgrade to the website had been postponed indefinitely and that online Spanish-language signups would remain unavailable, despite a promise to Hispanic groups that the capability would start this week. The government has now tweaked the website's home page so visitors can view phone numbers to apply the old-fashioned way or window-shop for insurance rates without registering first.","Kathleen Sebelius said Obama found out a couple of days after launch .

"author] . Tearful: Gordon Ramsay has admitted he cried after his New York restaurant, The London, lost both its Michelin stars . With his impassioned outbursts in the kitchen, Gordon Ramsay has been known for reducing others to tears. But the celebrity chef reveals he was the one reaching for his tissues when his New York restaurant was stripped of both its Michelin stars. Gordon Ramsay says he was 'very emotional' after The London lost its prestigious two-star rating last year. Michelin withdrew the much-desired stars and branded the food served at the posh Manhattan eatery as 'erratic'. During his appearance on a Norwegian television show, the 47-year-old chef said: 'I started crying when I lost my stars. It's a very emotional thing for any chef. 'It's like losing a girlfriend. You want her back.' The downgrading of The London came just months after Ramsay's contract for the Art Deco dining rooms at Claridges came to an an end. Following a decline in ratings for his Channel 4 show, Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares, the celebrity chef has also decided not to renew his contract. But Ramsay, who owns 12 restaurants around the capital,  can at least console himself with the fact his other restaurants worldwide currently hold a total of 14 Michelin stars. His signature restaurant, Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, in Chelsea, has held three Michelin stars since 2001. Petrus in Belgravia, Maze in Mayfair and Savoy Grill in Covent Garden also boast one Michelin star each. Internationally, Gordon Ramsay at The Trianon Palace, France, holds two stars, while The London in West Hollywood and Gordon Ramsay at Conrad Tokyo both have one star. Michelin stars have been awarded for more than 100 years by critics in The Michelin Guide. One star is considered 'very good', while two is 'excellent' and three is rated as 'exceptional cuisine'.

"Extraordinary pictures of British jihadists boasting of fighting alongside Al Qaeda-linked groups in Syria emerged yesterday. At least 17 suspected Islamic extremists have posted messages on social media networks about their experiences in the war-torn Middle East state – in a bid to encourage other Britons to join them. One referred to fighting in Syria as ‘5-star jihad’ because of its ‘relaxing’ nature, and photos glorifying their hate-filled mission 2,000 miles from their homes in London and Portsmouth have been posted online. Scroll down for video . Five-star: Mohammed el-Araj, left, from West London, who died during an ambush on Assad forces . One image of a British fighter called Abu Qa’qaa shows how he could carry extra ammunition in his beard. Another shows a combatant wearing a balaclava and holding an assault rifle. Security sources believe up to 350 UK citizens have joined Islamic extremists in deadly combat in Syria. Four – including the son of a London antiques dealer – were killed in two recent incidents. MI5 is becoming increasingly concerned about the threat posed by extremists who return to Britain from Syria, and might carry out an atrocity here. British brigades: Abu Qa'qaa with bullets in his beard . One group of eight recruits from the UK are fighting with an Al Qaeda-linked militia in the north of the country. They are taking part in skirmishes on the border with Turkey and some are venturing 100 miles inland in operations around the rebel-held city of Ar-Raqqah. The group is called the British Kataa’ib, meaning British Brigades. As well as operating social media accounts that detail their activities, some of the group also operate blogs and even participate in question-and-answer sessions with supporters, often urging others to join them ‘while the path is clear’. All members of the group use pseudonyms. They have, for the most part, been careful to avoid showing their full faces in pictures. But inquiries have revealed some identities and connections in London and Portsmouth. Ifthekar Jaman, who calls himself ‘Turab’ online, has posted a series of messages that describe his involvement with Al Qaeda-linked groups in the country. He lived in Southsea, Portsmouth, before flying to Turkey in May, and making his way across the border to Syria to wage jihad. Jaman is 23 and is known in Syria as Abu Abdur Rahman Al-Britani or Abu Abdur Rahman Al-Bengali. In his posts, Jaman – whose parents are originally from Bangladesh – refers to dying as a martyr. On September 30, he said: ‘Any brother hoping to come, then come. Alone or with a group. Both are good. No money is required when you come. The path is open now.’ On September 21, he said: ‘There are people who think that the jihad in Syria is 24/7 fighting but it’s much more relaxed than that. They’re calling it a 5-star jihad.’ Yesterday Jaman’s distraught mother Hena Choudhury told the Mail that she had thought her son was in Turkey studying. Soldier: One of the group's British fighters holding a machine gun . Speaking from her three-bedroom terrace house in Portsmouth, she added tearfully: ‘I don’t know what’s going on but I’m scared for his life.’ His father Enu Miah, who runs a local takeaway, said his son was a ‘normal and educated young man’. He added: ‘It’s a difficult time for the family. He’s been in touch over the phone and we’re hoping he will come back soon.’ The director general of the Security Service MI5, Andrew Parker, has warned of the growing threat posed by jihadists travelling to and from Syria. The relaxing Middle East: A Briton poses with large-calibre ammunition . Three men, believed to be radicalised Muslims from London, died in an explosion as they attacked forces loyal to President Assad near Aleppo. The fourth was shot two weeks later. One of the men has been named as Mohammed el-Araj, 23, of Ladbroke Grove, West London, the son of an antiques dealer. He also used the name Abu Khalid. A Briton calling himself Abu Hujama al-Britani was also killed.","The messages are encouraging other Britons to join them .

"A woman was thrown out of a French opera house after cast members objected to her wearing a Niqab  (file picture is not of the woman involved) France's Socialist government today pledged to toughen up its anti face-covering law after a veiled Muslim woman was ejected from a major Paris opera house. In an incident which has divided opinion  in the city's liberal arts community, cast members performing La Traviata 'objected strongly' to the presence of a woman in the audience wearing a niqab-type veil. 'A singer spotted her in the front row during the second act,' said Jean-Philippe Thiellay, director of the Bastille Opera, which was opened by Socialist president Francois Mitterand in 1989. 'Some performers said they didn't want to sing,' said Mr Thiellay, who confirmed that she was kicked out. There has been a ban on Muslims covering their face in public in France since the introduction of a law in 2011. Women living on housing estates on the outskirts of major cities like Paris are regularly criminalised with a fine, but this is the first incident of someone being ejected from an artistic venue. So far unnamed, she is believed to be a well-off woman from a Gulf State, and was attending the performance with a friend. Referring to a security guard, Mr Thiellay said: 'He told her that in France there is a ban of this nature, asked her to either uncover her face or leave the auditorium. 'The man asked the woman to get up, they left. It was unpleasant getting her to leave. 'But there was a misunderstanding of the law and the lady either had to respect it or leave,' Scroll down for video . But other opera lovers in a city historically renowned for its tolerance were less impressed. 'What possible harm could a woman sitting quietly in the audience with face covered do to anyone?' said Guy Laurent, a regular at the Bastille Opera. 'The woman would clearly have felt utterly humiliated by what happened – French culture should be more tolerant. Cast members performing La Traviata at the Bastille Opera opera house in Paris objected to the veiled woman in the audience. It is not suggested that either of the performers pictured were among those who complained . There has been a ban on Muslims covering their face in public in France since 2011. It is not suggested that either of the performers pictured here on stage at the opera house were among those who complained .

The incident happened on October 3, but it is only now that it is becoming a national polemic. Technically the woman now faces a fine of just over £180, although there is not thought to have been any police involvement. The woman and her friend were not refunded any of their ticket price. Choice: Security at the Bastille Opera opera house in Paris asked the woman to uncover her face or leave . A spokesman for France's Ministry of Culture today said it was 'producing a new set of rules' to make sure the so-called 'burka ban' was better enforced in theatres, museums and other public institutions. France,which is home to some five million Muslims, was the first European country to ban the full-face Islamic veil in public places. Belgium followed suit soon afterwards, but there is no veil ban at all in Britain, despite calls by a minority of right wing MPs for one.","Cast 'objected strongly' to  woman in the audience wearing a niqab-type veil .

"A man is accused of flinging dildos out of his car with teenage girls nearby in multiple instances, then lingering in his vehicle to watch them. Konrad Peters, 28, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested and is accused of exposing children to harmful materials, The Smoking Gun reported. Peters is accused of being involved in three separate instances in West Allis involving the dildos. His alleged victims range in age from 13 to 15 years old. Busted: Konrad Peters is accused of being involved in tossing dildos from his car in three separate instances . A court filing obtained by The Smoking Gun said '33 dildos and multiple sex toys' were discovered. A search warrant obtained by the website revealed that two girls told police September 8 that in a September 4 incident, a black car 'would drive past the alley they were walking down and slow down as it drove by them.' At one point, the car 'stopped about 100 feet in front of them,' the warrant said. 'The driver of the vehicle opened the driver side door and placed an unknown object on the ground. The driver then shut the door and proceeded to drive past the girls.' The two girls inspected and found it to be a 'giant purple dildo' and told the police the man who put it there 'was sitting there staring at them from his care with the driver's side widow rolled down,' the warrant said. The dildo was gone the next day, the girls told police. West Allis police, whose headquarters are seen here, arrested Peters. He is accused of exposing children to harmful materials . The day after the girls spoke to police, a third girl told police of a similar instance, in which a male driver 'threw an item out of the driver's side window, which rolled slightly underneath the car. The driver parked [...] and waited for [the victim's] reaction to the item that was thrown out of the car window. She noted the item was wrapped in clear plastic wrapping tape and was in the shape of a dildo. ' A fourth girl spoke to police on October 8, saying earlier that day she saw a driver fling a dildo out of his car. During her walk home, the girl 'walked past her house, because she was scared and didn't want him to know where she lived,' the warrant said. The dildo was photographed by the girl, and told her father what earlier happened during her walk. He reportedly looked at a garage security tape and later drove around to find the car. West Allis police identified Peters, the warrant said. Peters reportedly contacted his lawyer and did not speak to them. 'All female juvenile victims were shown photo arrays to see if an identification could be made,' the warrant said. '[The third victim] positively identified Konrad Peters as the male party who she observed tossing the sex toy out of his car.'","Konrad Peters, 28, a Milwaukee resident, was arrested and is accused of exposing children to harmful materials .

McCann said sales of the book, simply entitled Madeleine, are 'close to . 400,000' and it may have generated as much as £1 million for the . couple's fund. A paperback edition with a new epilogue will be published on May 10. The information will be examined and entered into the police computer for the first time to ensure no detail has been missed. But it is considered unlikely that any serious investigation will result unless the leads are corroborated by other evidence. Peter Kirkham, a former detective chief inspector with the Metropolitan Police, said he was sceptical about the ability of psychics to help police investigations. ‘As soon as you have a high-profile case you get a range of people coming forward,’ he said. ‘I’m certainly not aware of any case that’s been solved by psychics. ‘You can’t waste resources no matter . how emotive a case may be.’ US crime author Pat Brown said in a Twitter . message: ‘This “review” just gets stupider and stupider.’ Madeleine vanished days before her . fourth birthday from an apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz . while her parents, Kate and Gerry, had dinner with friends in a nearby . tapas restaurant. The review team has sifted through . more than 40,000 pieces of information, including files from the . Portuguese police investigation and from the private detectives used by . Madeleine’s parents. It has identified 195 potential new . leads, but Portuguese police have refused to reopen the case because . they say there is no new evidence. Mr and Mrs McCann said the fact the Metropolitan Police were reviewing the case had made their lives ‘much more bearable’. In a statement to mark yesterday’s . five-year anniversary of her disappearance, the couple said: ‘It’s hard . to define succinctly how it feels to have reached five years without . Madeleine – impossible, heart-breaking, frightening, exasperating, . incomprehensible. ‘Sometimes it feels like forever and at other times, just like yesterday.’ Scotland Yard said: ‘We can confirm we are in close dialogue with Crimestoppers to ensure that all material in their possession – from any source – is shared with us.’ May 3, 2007Kate and Gerry McCann leave their daughter Madeleine and her two-year-old twin brother and sister Sean and Amelie in bed in their apartment and head for dinner at a nearby tapas restaurant.9pmThe couple check on them regularly and at around 9pm, Mr McCann finds nothing amiss when he returns to their room in the seaside resort at the Ocean Club in Praia Da Luz.10pmMrs McCann goes to check on them again and finds the shutter slid up, the bedroom window open and Madeleine gone.May 4The police begin hunting for Maddie.May 15Robert Murat is officially named a suspect by police in Portugal.June 17Portuguese police say Madeleine's friends and family may have destroyed vital evidence in the first few hours after her abduction. September 7Detectives make Mr and Mrs McCann 'arguidos' in their daughter's disappearance.April 7, 2008Three Portuguese detectives fly to Britain to re-interview the seven friends on holiday with the McCanns when Madeleine vanished. July 17Mr Murat receives £600,000 in libel damages from four newspaper groups over 'seriously defamatory' articles connecting him with the child's disappearance.July 21The Portuguese authorities shelve their investigation and lift the 'arguido' status of the McCanns and Mr Murat. Is she alive? There have been no confirmed sightings of Madeleine McCann since she disappeared on May 3, 2007. The original Portuguese police team believed she died in a ‘tragic accident’. Kate and Gerry McCann have always insisted there is no evidence to suggest she is dead, and British police now believe ‘there is a possibility she is alive’. Where is she? There have been reported sightings all round  the world, ranging from the credible to bizarre psychic visions. Of those investigated, none have been confirmed as Madeleine. Who is responsible? Three people were officially named as arguidos, or suspects, in the investigation - Kate and Gerry McCann and British expat Robert Murat. All three were formally cleared when the investigation was shelved and have won libel cases against newspapers and broadcasters which falsely claimed they were involved in Madeleine’s disappearance. The McCanns believe Madeleine was taken by an abductor. Convicted paedophile Raymond Hewlett allegedly said he saw the girl twice before she vanished and claimed she was stolen to order by a gypsy gang, but denied he was involved. He died in 2010. Are there new leads? British . police have identified almost 200 new lines of investigation from the . Portuguese case files and the McCanns’ own private detectives. They have refused to reveal details. Why was this not done before? Portuguese . officers were convinced Madeleine was dead and have admitted publicly . that they did not fully investigate other theories, including many of . the sightings. What else was missed? Police . did not set up effective searches and did not alert the Spanish border . for 12 hours, allowing a potential abductor to escape with Madeleine . undetected. Even a basic . check of the other guests at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz was . not completed for 48 hours, by which time many potential witnesses had . left. Gratitude: The McCanns thanked Scotland Yard for their review and the public for the support they had received for their campaign . What about forensic evidence? Police did not seal off the McCanns’ apartment until 10am the next day, by which time the McCanns, their friends, resort staff, concerned helpers and police officers had all potentially contaminated forensic evidence. Samples were taken and tested for blood and DNA but were found to be so degraded and contaminated that the results were inconclusive. Will the case be solved? British police want the case reopened but public opinion in Portugal has not been supportive of the McCanns and there may be little interest in raking over a five-year mystery which has already damaged the country’s tourist industry. Even if the case is reopened, the reality remains that blunders in the first few days after Madeleine’s disappearance may mean the McCanns will never know what happened to their daughter.","It is five years since Madeleine went missing in Portugal at the age of three .

"A rare fish known for gnawing through men's testicles while they are out swimming has been found in the River Seine in Paris. The sharped-tooth Pacu is a Piranha-style creature with a variety of nicknames, including 'The Nutcracker'. Mainly found in steamy South American waters, it is known for gliding below male swimmers and taking a nibble out of their most sensitive organ, sometimes allegedly ripping it off and swallowing it. On it's way here? The piranha-like Pacu could soon be in the UK . A fisherman in Paris called the river police when he reeled in the frightening looking fish, which can weigh as much as 25 kilos, last Friday morning. 'He sent us an image of the picture through his smart phone and it turned out to be a Pacu,' said a police spokesman. 'It is a fish with a very dangerous bite!' The Pacu, which is of Brazilian Indian origin, is technically a vegetarian, but tends to be attracted to male genitalia for unknown reasons. A fishing competition on the river some years ago - today, when a Pacu turns up in strange places, it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one . There have been unconfirmed reports of fishermen in Papua New Guinea having their manhoods ripped off by the fish. When one was found in Denmark last month, Copenhagen University professor Peter Rask Moller said: 'All we suggested was that swimmers keep their pants on until we know if there are more of these fish out in our brackish waters.' When Pacu turn up in strange places, it is usually because the owner of an exotic aquarium has dumped one. Pacu grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally . 'Pacu are commonly kept in aquaria because they are fairly docile, but look like piranhas,' Peter Moyle, a fish biologist, told the Los Angeles Times last month. 'They grow quickly in captivity and, unlike goldfish, will outgrow aquaria, so owners release them into whatever pond they can find locally.' The Seine is nowadays considered too dirty for swimming in, and police said that the chillier weather would soon ensure that fish like the Pacu would not survive.","A fisherman in Paris called the river police when he reeled in the frightening looking fish .

"The taxman is facing fresh embarrassment after it emerged that thousands more workers were sent tax statements that were in fact incorrect. The blunder comes at a time when HM Revenue and Customs is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers’ bank accounts. Every year, around five million workers are found to have under or overpaid through the Pay As You Earn system. IT blunder: HM Revenue & Customs has admitted some of the five million workers who received an incorrect tax bill in 2013/14 may have again received a 'miscalculated' bill . This can be for a variety of reasons, including because they have moved jobs or taken a second income. The Government must contact each one with a new tax statement telling them how much they must either claw back, by changing their tax code, or how much they must reimburse them. Now HMRC, which has a history of blunders, has admitted thousands of these were miscalculated – an error they were alerted to after being contacted by concerned workers. It said ‘thousands’ of statements sent out to customers showed ‘an incorrect overpayment or underpayment’ during 2013-14. In an email sent to accountants and staff, it added: ‘We currently do not know the scale of the issue, but some large employers are involved, so several thousands of employees may be affected.’ HMRC advised recipients of the email to tell taxpayers who questioned their bills ‘not to repay any underpayment’ – and not to cash any cheques reimbursing them until the error had finally been rectified. The leaked letter said they were ‘very sorry’ about the incorrect calculations and they were ‘urgently investigating these cases’. Revealed: A memo sent to senior staff at HMRC, based in central London, (pictured) admitted that mistakes had been made . The miscalculations are believed to have been caused by incomplete information from employers – something the Government had hoped to limit through its new £270million ‘Real Time Information’ (RTI) programme. The system forces employers to report the amount of money paid to staff on a more frequent weekly or monthly basis, in a bid to ensure changes to employees’ status are quickly updated. But experts said the latest mishap showed there were still major flaws with the system. Stuart Phillips, chief executive of financial advice firm The Private Office, said: ‘This is very bad timing for HMRC. ‘They should only be given more powers if they can prove they can confidently deliver accurate information. This clearly calls into question their ability to do so and their faith in the real-time system.’ Jason Piper, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said it was further evidence that the ‘real-time’ system had been implemented too quickly without sufficient planning or resources. Bad timing: The blunder comes at a time when HM Revenue and Customs is requesting new powers to take unpaid taxes directly from taxpayers’ bank accounts . He added: ‘Yet again, we are seeing errors in the operation of PAYE. Public patience is wearing thin with government IT failures and one like this, which hits so close to home for taxpayers, is bad news for a department trying to extend the reach of its powers into every aspect of our collective financial lives based on the power of its computer systems.’ The Treasury has outlined a string of new powers for HMRC in recent months in a bid to clamp down on tax avoidance. This includes a controversial proposal to allow the taxman to raid people’s bank accounts for money owed without gaining permission from a court first. The ‘direct recovery of debt’ would enable HMRC to confiscate unpaid tax direct from the bank and building society accounts of debtors who owe at least £1,000 and who have been contacted at least four times by HMRC to pay. The taxman would leave at least £5,000 in debtors’ bank accounts. A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘The majority of the errors have happened because an employer failed to make a final payment statement for the 2013-14 tax year, meaning our records were incomplete despite reminders that these submissions had to be made. ‘We are sorry this has happened and we aim to issue corrected calculations in the next few weeks.’ He said no one had been asked ‘for a penny’ as a result of the error and they would receive a new statement within six to eight weeks. While HMRC did not yet know how many people had been affected, it would be fewer than 100,000, the spokesman added.","Thousands more workers were sent tax statements that were incorrect .

"He has not yet reached his 18th birthday. But Mohammed Islam, from Queens, New York, has already made a fortune estimated at as much as $72million - from trading stocks on his lunch breaks at school, according to New York magazine's Monday issue.

Outside of school, he often takes his friends out to dine at Morimoto on 10th Avenue, where they feast on $400 caviar, expensive dishes and freshly-squeezed apple juice. During an interview for the magazine's 10th annual 'Reasons to Love New York issue', Mohammed refused to disclose his exact net worth, but he admitted it was in 'the high eight figures' and provided bank and financial paperwork to back that up. The successful teenager revealed he had used his incredible wealth to purchase a BMW - which he does not yet have a license to drive - and rent a Manhattan apartment. However, his parents, who are immigrants from the Bengal region of South Asia, will not yet allow him to move out of their family home in Queens, according to the New York Post. Mohammed has also taken to social media to show off his well-funded, lavish lifestyle - regularly posting videos of him partying, playing poker and dancing with numerous women on Instagram. His hard-earned cash has certainly been beneficial to his parents. 'My dad doesn't work now and I tend to help out with things, and futures gives me that incentive,' said the student.

But despite its advantages, Mr and Mrs Islam are not overly keen on their son's interest in trading. 'My dad doesn't like [finance] that much,' Mohammed, who has written the phrase, 'More money, less problems',  on his Instagram profile, said in an ISSUU interview. 'He says he is ok with me trading, but my mom is skeptical about the market. But they see it as, if I am good at it, then why not?' A year after he started experimenting with penny stocks, Mohammed was introduced to further financial markets by his cousin. He has since developed a 'life-long passion' for trading. 'What makes the world go round? Money,' he said. 'If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going, there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.' On his LinkedIn profile, the student said he rose to success while trading stocks during his lunch breaks because he 'followed the market, hunted for opportunities and used everything from fundamental analysis to technical analysis and price action to speculate in the markets'. After having high returns in penny stocks, he moved on to small-mid cap equities, then derivatives, before feeling out the futures market and specializing in  oil and gold, he said. He added he has now developed 'a passion for understanding the markets and a passion for making money', and trades 'mainly based on volatility and volume'. Let me take a selfie: Mohammed has the phrase, 'More money, less problems', written on his Instagram profile. Above, a female reveller is pictured taking a selfie in another video on Mohammed's Instagram . Speech: Speaking of his passion for trading stocks, Mohammed (pictured giving a speech), who trades 'mainly based on the volatility and volume' of gold and oil, said: 'What makes the world go round?

Jones, 60, the billionaire founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund, ranks as the 108th-richest American, according to Forbes. Mohammed said that while he had been 'paralyzed' by his losses when he first started trading, he quickly learned from Connecticut-based Jones's ability to get back into the game again and again. 'I had been paralyzed by my loss,' he said. 'But [Jones] was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over.' Inspiration: Mohammed revealed his biggest inspiration in the finance world has been Paul Tudor Jones (pictured), the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation, a private asset management firm and hedge fund .

'He went through obstacles, yet still came out on top' And despite his massive fortune, Mohammed has no plans to give up trading just yet. The teenager said he and his trader friends hope to start a hedge fund in June - when he is old enough to get his broker-dealer license - and intend to make a billion dollars by next year. This, of course, will all be done while attending college. 'It’s not just about the money,' said Mohammed, whose ultimate goal is to pave a path in the financial industry that will enable him to become a reputable hedge fund manager.

"Massive opposition to giving more money to Scotland – and overwhelming support for a new English Parliament is revealed today in a survey of voters in England and Wales. The results suggest solid support in England for David Cameron’s claim that new home rule powers for Scotland must be matched by similar measures in the other three home nations. The Prime Minister’s ‘English votes for English laws’ proposal struck a chord south of the border, with two in three English voters saying MPs representing Scottish seats at Westminster should be banned from voting on issues such as health and education. A mere one in five oppose the move. Scroll down for video . But the Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday underlines the dangers facing Mr Cameron in trying to satisfy both Scots and non-Scots voters. Although most people in England believe Mr Cameron and fellow party leaders Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were panicked into the eleventh hour Scots giveaway by fears Alex Salmond was heading for a shock victory, they believe they cannot go back on their word. The three party leaders are judged to have been wrong to make the commitment to devolve more powers to Scotland by a margin of two to one. A total of 70 per cent say it was a ‘panic’ decision against 16 per cent who say it was wise. And if they try to ram through the Scottish reforms after the next General Election – as they have promised – they could face a public backlash. A majority of English voters say they want their own referendum before more of their cash is transferred from Westminster to Edinburgh. The survey also shows that former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown is considered to have saved the day for the UK – and the chief villain is fellow Scot, tennis player Andy Murray. Some 21 per cent of English voters say Murray’s support for independence means they are less likely to cheer him at Wimbledon. By contrast, the favourite moment for English voters was the Queen’s gentle nudge to Scots to ‘think carefully’ before voting to quit the UK. Most people in England believe David Cameron and Ed Miliband were panicked into the eleventh hour Scots giveaway by fears 'Yes' was heading for a shock victory . More than seven in ten say the Barnett formula, whereby Scots receive around £1,600 of public money per head more than those in England, is unfair with only one in six regarding it as fair. The English votes for English laws issue could have a dramatic effect on the future occupancy of 10 Downing Street. Nearly half say it would make it impossible for a Scots MP to become prime minister, with one in three disagreeing. Several Scots representing Scottish parliamentary constituencies have served as prime minister, including Gordon Brown and Alec Douglas-Home. Tory MP John Redwood’s call for the creation of an English Parliament is supported by six in ten. But despite the heated controversy over the referendum, English voters are adamant there are far more important matters. Immigration is far and away their biggest worry, followed by the economy, jobs, health and schools and fighting terrorism – with constitutional reform well down the list. Nearly nine in ten people in England are relieved that Scots decided against cutting ties with Britain. Well over half believe Scotland will always be part of the UK, while only one in four say it will break away eventually. Survation interviewed 1,081 people online on Friday.","Two in three English voters say MPs in Scottish seats should be banned from voting on English laws at Westminster .

"Horrifying surveillance footage has revealed a teenage girl being beaten up at a juvenile detention center by female guards. Shannon Linn Abbot, 33, can be seen restraining the girl before body-slamming her against a concrete wall, throwing her to the floor and sitting on her upper body for more than ten minutes. Another woman sits on the girl's legs to keep her down. The girl is finally allowed to get up from the ground where she staggers to her feet looking dazed and is given an ice pack for her swollen face at the Florida detention center. Scroll down for video of the attack . Secret abuse: The two guards at the Milton Girls Juvenile Residential Facility in Florida were caught on CCTV slamming a teenage girl off a concrete wall . Shock: The guard then spins round and throws the girl to the floor with the full force of her weight . A police report said the 15-year-old did not appear to be resisting guards. The girl told authorities that she had been restrained for being disruptive in class. During the time that she was pinned to the floor, several employees walk through the room and casually stop to chat to the guards sitting on top of the teenager. One staff member even pulls up a seat and appears to try to converse with the girl while she is still restrained on the floor. When the girl is finally allowed to stand up she is given an ice-pack, according to the police report, as her eye is swollen shut. Although Abbott was arrested after the abuse on August 9, she posted bail and returned to her job the following day - before the Department of Juvenile Justice stepped in this week and asked for her to be removed from contact with children. Abbot, who was a guard at the Milton Girls Juvenile Residential Facility, was charged with battery causing great bodily harm. No charges were brought against the other guard who has not been identified.

Wansley Walters, from the DJJ, told the Miami Herald: 'We are deeply concerned that the . incident, as depicted in the video... contradicts its description to us . by officials representing the facility. 'We are also troubled that the . facility did not officially report the incident to DJJ until two days . after it occurred, and only when the victim called the [Department of . Children & Families] abuse hotline. This lapse is inexplicable.' Ms Walters added that the incident made her 'sick' and the fact that other employees did not appear to see the incident as anything extraordinary caused great cause for concern.","Shannon Linn Abbot, 33, body-slams teenage girl against concrete wall at Florida facility .

"He’s the controversial civil rights campaigner whose colourful past includes accusations of bigotry, racism and anti-Semitism. Now cable news network MSNBC is reportedly handing Reverend Al Sharpton the 6pm primetime slot in a move bound to cause a storm. Rev Sharpton, 56, has been guest hosting the slot for three weeks, after radio host Cenk Uygur had a six-month try-out that failed. Controversial: MSNBC is reportedly handing civil rights campaigner Reverend Al Sharpton, 56, the 6pm primetime slot in a move bound to cause a storm . The former Democratic presidential candidate is set to become the only black host of a U.S. primetime cable news show. Sharpton's profile rose in the late 1980s when 15-year-old Tawana Brawley was discovered sitting in a bin bag outside a New York flat. She claimed to have been raped by a group of white men in a racist attack and Rev Sharpton hit out at her alleged rapists - but doctors found no physical rape evidence. A grand jury decided not to press charges and the court decided that she had made up her story - but Rev Sharpton still believes her. Fame: Rev Sharpton, speaking when the Tawana Brawley case was ongoing in 1988, became well-known in the late 1980s when he helped the 15-year-old . There was uncertainty over who would fill the 6pm MSNBC slot when Keith Olbermann left in January and the network shuffled it's primetime lineup. ‘We never told Cenk what to say or what not to say' MSNBC president Phil Griffin . Mr Uygur was given the slot and his ratings were solid but . failed to satisfy the channel’s president, Phil Griffin, who decided to . give Rev Sharpton a try-out. Mr Uygur said he turned down a new contract including a weekend show because he thought Mr Griffin had come under political pressure. He believed he had upset White House officials - and was seen as the fiercest MSNBC host who criticises President Obama and Democrats. Mr Uygur claimed Mr Griffin told him MSNBC was part of the 'establishment' and 'you need to act like it'. Previously: The former 6pm host was Cenk Uygur, pictured, whose ratings were not bad but failed to satisfy the channel's president, Phil Griffin . Mr Griffin denied he had fallen to political pressure. ‘We never told Cenk what to say or what not to say,’ he told the New York Times. But he explained producers found Mr Uygur’s aggressive body language and demeanour were making it tougher to book guests. ‘I didn’t agree with everything said on the show,’ White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer told the New York Times. ‘But (I) certainly didn’t have any problem with it.’ Other controversial and unsuccessful MSNBC hosts include Jesse Ventura and Michael Savage.

"A Nepalese farmer who was bitten by a venomous snake took revenge by sinking his teeth into the reptile and killing it. Mohamed Salmo Miya was farming near his village southeast of Kathmandu when he encountered the deadly common cobra, said district police chief Uma Prasad Chatrubedi. 'A farmer in Bardanga village has killed a white cobra with his teeth out of anger,' he said.

Miya was treated at a local clinic and is recovering at home. 'I was very angry after the snake bit into me. Then I followed the snake, grabbed it and bit it to death,"" the 55-year-old told the Nepali-language Annapurna Post. 'I could have killed it with a stick but I was mad with anger and wanted to take revenge. I killed it with my teeth.' Mohamed Salmo Miya was farming near his village south-east of Kathmandu when he encountered the deadly common cobra . Nepal has a wide variety of poisonous and non-venomous snakes, which are particularly active during the summer monsoon, including the Indian rock python, which can grow up to 33 feet long, and the deadly king cobra. Conservative estimates suggest that there are 20,000 cases of snake bites in Nepal a year, almost all in the Terai southern plains, causing around 1,000 deaths. The six-and-a-half-foot common cobra, which accounts for the majority of bites, is worshipped by Hindus in some parts of Nepal.","Enraged snakebite victim grabs cobra and kills it with his teeth .

"Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden has attacked Britain's new anti-terror legislation . Fugitive CIA worker Edward Snowden caused fury last night by attacking Britain for introducing emergency legislation to foil terrorist plots. His critics said the new surveillance Bill was being pushed through Parliament today largely because of his treachery in leaking Britain’s spy secrets. Snowden, who has become one of the world’s most wanted men, said the measures to allow the security services and police to monitor the public’s phone, email and internet records ‘defied belief’. He is wanted for treason after stealing classified documents from the US National Security Agency. The defence contractor, a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in Hawaii, leaked highly damaging revelations of attempts by state spy agencies – including Britain’s GCHQ and MI5 – to monitor citizens’ private information. After he revealed how intelligence agents had access to data compiled by the likes of Google and Yahoo, some of the internet giants – under pressure from civil liberties groups – became reluctant to co-operate with the Government and say they may withhold crucial intelligence. David Cameron insisted last week that new snooping laws were urgently needed because Snowden had compromised the ability of the spy agencies to keep track of dangerous extremists. Last night, in an interview with the Guardian newspaper conducted in Russia where the 31-year-old has been granted temporary asylum, Snowden blasted the Government for passing emergency laws in peace time. He said: ‘We don’t have bombs falling. We don’t have U-boats in the harbour.’ He added that the move to introduce anti-terror legislation so quickly mirrored the way the US brought in the Protect America Act in 2007 after the NSA lost  cooperation from telecom and internet companies. ‘The NSA could have written this draft,’ he said. ‘They passed it under the same sort of emergency justification. They said we would be at risk. They said companies will no longer cooperate with us. [They said] We’re losing valuable intelligence that puts the nation at risk.’ Snowden also questioned why the Home Office had introduced new laws following a judgement by the European courts that declared some existing surveillance measures invalid. Communications firms are obliged by a 2006 EU directive to store records such as who a person called, where from and when for at least a year. But this was ruled unlawful by the EU Court of Justice in April and companies had told the  Government that, if they did not pass the new law, they would begin destroying crucial phone records. Snowden has become of the world's most wanted men after he stole classified documents from the NSA . Snowden said: ‘Is it really going to be so costly for us to take a few days to debate where the line should be drawn about the authority and what really serves the public interest? ‘If these surveillance authorities are so interested, so invasive, the courts are actually saying they violate fundamental rights, do we really want to authorise them on a new, increased and more intrusive scale without any public debate?’ He said the British government had been silent in the year since he had exposed the scale of surveillance by the NSA and GCHQ. Snowden said: ‘Yet suddenly we’re told there’s a brand new Bill. And we don’t have time to debate it, despite the fact that this was not a priority, this was not an issue that needed to be discussed at all, for an entire year. It defies belief.’ The Government has justified the legislation amid intelligence fears that Islamist militants are plotting to blow up a transatlantic airliner having developed a stealth bomb undetectable to airport scanners. There are mounting concerns that Al Qaeda’s top bomb-maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri has developed a non-metallic bomb that can be hidden inside human bodies or electronic devices. Civil liberties groups have cast doubt on Government claims that the Bill will not increase the powers of the surveillance agencies. But Tory MP Julian Smith said: ‘Edward Snowden and the Guardian continue with their crackpot conspiracy theories and we should take no lessons from them. ‘This will protect our country from paedophiles and technologically savvy terrorists. This legislation is proportionate and couldn’t come fast enough given the threats our country is under.’","Edward Snowden causes fury for attack on Britain's new surveillance bill .

"Ambulance authorities have been ordered to review their response times after it took more than 23 minutes for paramedics to arrive at the home of a three-year-old found underwater in a bath. Parents of Emmerson Boyle, also known as Emmy, have claimed the delayed response by paramedics prevented their daughter's from surviving when she was found in a bathtub last month at her home in Gowanbrae, in north-west of Melbourne. Paramedics arrived at the scene more than 23 minutes after the first 000 call. Victorian ambulance target response time is 15 minutes. A spokeswoman for the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority attributed the length of time taken to respond to the emergency call to an error in the priority coding by the triple zero operator. Authorities are reviewing why it took paramedics from Victoria 23 minutes to respond to three-year-old Emmerson Boyle's drowning . After failed attempts of revival, Emmy died on September 2 at her family home in Gowanbrae - northwest of Melbourne . The initial call for assistance was received from Gowanbrae at about 4.39pm on September 2. Emmy's mother, Pauline Boyle, told the Herald Sun, she left her daughter in the bathroom as she quickly ran downstairs to grab the three-year-old's favourite pink towel. On her return, Emmy was in the bathtub. 'I saw her hair under the bubbles. I immediately grabbed her out of the bath,' she said. Mrs Boyle found the toddler lying facing upwards in the bath under the water, immediately pulling her out and flagging down her neighbour for help. Mrs Boyle and her neighbour, a fireman of 25 years experience, called an ambulance and tried to revive Emmy. However, the phone disconnected before the neighbour could report the incident to the operator and he made the second call minutes later. An ambulance in Preston, about 14km away, was reportedly sent before ESTA call-takers realised there was an error in the assigned priority of the call. A closer crew in Moonee Ponds, about 9km away, was then sent. It has been confirmed that the incident was incorrectly listed as Priority 1 instead of the highest code Priority 0. Emmy (above) with her parents Pauline and Rohan Boyle . Family and friends paid tribute the three-year-old online. Emmy was due to turn four this Sunday, on October 19 . Grieving parents, Pauline and Rohan Boyle, said ambulances need to respond faster. 'We live 14 minutes from the CBD. It would have been quicker for John and me to jump in the car and drive to the hospital ourselves,' Mrs Boyle told the Herald Sun. 'As parents we'll have to carry this burden now that our daughter might not have had the highest chance of survival.' Mrs Boyle said the family was not blaming paramedics but will never know if a quicker response could have saved their daughter. 'The best thing we can do moving forward is to ensure that no other families have to wait the time we waited for assistance,' Ms Boyle told reporters on Tuesday. 'Look at the photo of our daughter and see it's not a statistic, we're dealing with people's lives.' Emmy's father Rohan Boyle said Victoria's ambulance response times had gone backwards. 'The system did work eight years ago. They had eight-minute response times,' Mr Boyle said. ESTA chief operations officer, Julia Oxley, said this is a 'these are very sad circumstances' and a review is underway. 'An initial error in coding this event as Priority 1 instead of Priority 0 for two minutes and 43 seconds contributed to delays in dispatching the closest ambulance,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'ESTA and Ambulance Victoria representatives have met with them to discuss in detail what happened and we are gathering more information to answer their questions. 'ESTA is also conducting a review of what happened and why. If we identify any ways we could practically improve how we respond to calls like this, we will make those changes.' Ms Oxley said the Inspector-General for Emergency Management has also been informed of the case. Emmy Boyle was found floating in a bathtub at her family home. A funeral was held for her on September 9 . Ambulance Victoria's general manager, Tony Walker, said 'this is an incredibly sad case'. 'A preliminary review indicates that the first call to triple zero came just before 4.40pm,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Unfortunately, the call taker was unable to establish the reason for the call before the call ended and three attempts to call back were unsuccessful.' About two minutes later, a second separate call was received by ESTA and the home address and nature of the case was attained by the operator. 'A fire crew trained to deliver CPR and defibrillation and several Advanced Life Support and MICA paramedic crews were dispatched under lights and sirens,' Mr Walker said. 'The first ambulance arrived at 5.03pm. The first ambulance had been dispatched under lights and sirens from eight kilometres away at 4.46pm. 'Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of bystanders at the scene and fire fighters and paramedics the young child was not able to be resuscitated. 'Ambulance Victoria and ESTA's review into the case is continuing and it is also the subject of a coronial enquiry.' Premier Denis Napthine said the government had increased funding to the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority but realised there was a need to continue improving the process. Opposition Leader Daniel Andrews said ambulance response times are the worst they've been and the government needed to accept there was a crisis. 'To be just 14 minutes from the CBD and have to wait 23 minutes for an ambulance is not good enough, it's unacceptable,' he told reporters. 4:39.57pm . On Tuesday, September 2, an ESTA ambulance call-taker received a call from a landline phone in Gowanbrae. The call dropped out with no voice contact while being transferred by the Telstra operator to the ESTA call-taker. 4:41.35 . An event was correctly created as a Priority 2 event based on no caller information being available and the call-taker made three attempts to call the number back but was unable to get through. 4:41.57 . A second call was received by a second ambulance call-taker. There were only two calls for an ambulance received (not multiple) plus a further one after Metropolitan Fire Brigade of Victoria were on site to check how far off the ambulance was. 4:43.28 . The second ambulance call-taker updated the event to Priority 1 at this time. This was incorrect as the event should have been Priority 0. 4:45.31 . While an ambulance was dispatched from Preston, the correct coding would have allowed an ambulance that was 4.46km closer to be dispatched (Moonee Ponds) and would also have triggered a MFB crew to be sent sooner. 4:46.15 . The ambulance event was updated to the correct Priority 0 coding. Closer paramedics and ambulance unit were dispatched. 4:49.16 . Fire units arrived on scene first. 5:03.35 . The first ambulance arrived on scene and it is understood CPR instructions were provided by the call-taker throughout the call.","Emerson Boyle, also known as Emmy, was found underwater in a bathtub at her family home .

"She says she doesn’t feel a day over 70, but the oldest person in Britain celebrated her 112th birthday today. Gladys Hooper said the secret to her longevity is ‘living a straight life’ and keeping active. She has only just taken the title of Britain’s oldest person after the death of 114-year-old Ethel Lang on Thursday, who was who the last person in the UK born during the reign of Queen Victoria. On finding out the news, Mrs Hooper, who lives in the Isle of Wight, said: ‘I am very surprised, I thought I was just the oldest person on the island.’ Scroll down for video . Milestone: Britain's oldest woman Grace Hooper turned 112 today, left, and right, Mrs Hooper at 21 . Mrs Hooper, who has a son, four grandchildren and six-great-grandchildren, added: ‘I have always been busy, I prefer being busy than being idle. ‘I have always lived a straight life, never done stupid things, I have never gone beyond the limit. I have always been active, I think always being active keeps you young. I have done what I wanted to do and helped others as much as I could. I do not feel anything like the age I am, I do not feel any different to when I was 70.’ The great-grandmother has certainly achieved a lot in her lifetime. Born in 1903 in Dulwich, south-east London, and brought up in Rottingdean, near Brighton, she became a concert pianist in London and often performed with bands in dance halls. In the early 1920s, she also started what is thought to have been one of the first car hire firms, Autodrive, and turned down a request from the founder of Hertz to be his managing director. Gladys Hooper looks at previous years' birthday cards, with three generations of her family - her son Derek (top left), granddaughter Christine (top right) and great-grandsons Matthew (front left) and David (front right) She later ran Kingscliff House School, which is now Brighton College. The theme of aviation has also run through her lifetime. She was born the same year the Wright brothers built the first successful aeroplane, and was close friends with Amy Johnson, the pioneering aviator who was the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. Her husband Leslie, whom she married in 1922, was a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and in the RAF in the Second World War. Her 84-year-old son Derek Hermiston is a retired pilot. After her husband died in 1977, Mrs Hooper moved to the Isle of Wight and now lives in an apartment in her son’s house in Ryde, a town on the coast. His wife Veronica, 68, said: ‘She has done an awful lot. She is a very strong lady, a very amazing person.’ She added: ‘We are very proud of her and we have watched her go on and on, she doesn’t change. Mrs Hooper, dressed as Red Riding Hood aged four, left, and sitting on her father, William Nash's knee, right . ‘She lost her last sister three months ago, the youngest one. There were six of them altogether – five girls and one boy – she was the oldest and the longest. ‘Gladys told me that she had a very difficult birth, she came out with a misshapen head and the midwife said “I do not think she will do much”. But she was brilliant at maths and music and proved the midwife wrong.’ Mr Hermiston said she is still mentally very fit, adding: ‘I am very proud of her, she does very well since she was 100. She is a really nice person who has done a lot of good things for others during her war service.’ Members of her family travelled from Brighton, Derby and even Canada to be with her for her big day. Mrs Hooper said her special treat for the day would be to have ‘a nice birthday cake’. The oldest person in the world is thought to be Misao Okawa, a Japanese woman who turned 116 in March last year.","Gladys Hooper said the secret to her longevity is ‘living a straight life’

"Graphic footage of a police officer shooting a man eleven times outside a suburban home - killing him - has been released a day after the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Attorneys for Ernesto Duenez Jr., 34, showed the video, which was recorded by a camera in the cop's patrol car on June 8, 2011, at a press conference in Oakland, California on Wednesday. It shows police waiting for Duenez, who was wanted in connection with a domestic violence incident that day,  to arrive at a friend's home. They swoop on the home once he arrives in a pickup truck. Duenez, a passenger in the truck, can be seen climbing across the seats and opening a door as Manteca police officer James Moody runs towards the vehicle with his gun pointed. Scroll down for video: Warning - Graphic content . Horrifying: Ernesto Duenez Jr. can be seen climbing out of a truck as officer James Moody reaches for his gun . Gunned down: The officer, who thought Duenez had a throwing knife, fires 14 shots, hitting him 11 times . Police have claimed the officer saw a knife in the man's right hand and feared he might throw it or charge at him in the frantic, fast-paced exchange. Duenez's family's attorney says he was unarmed. On the video, Moody is heard shouting: 'Drop the knife now!' and 'Hands up! Hands up, Ernie! Don't you move, Ernie, don't you move or I'll shoot you!' The officer is seen firing 13 bullets in 4.2 seconds as Duenez moves to get out of the car. He was shot 11 times - once in the head, eight times in the body and twice in the extremities - and four were while he was on the ground. He died of gunshot wounds to his chest and abdomen. Graphic: A bullet wound can be seen in his back. Four of the bullets were shot as Duenez was on the ground . Shock: Duenez's wife runs outside after hearing the gunfire and screams at police officer Moody . Heartbreak: She is seen leaning over her fatally wounded husband as more police arrive on the scene . On the video, a bullet wound can be seen in Duenez's back as he rolls around on the ground clutching his chest. His wife, Whitney Duenez, then runs from the home, screaming at the police officer, who tells her to stay back. She runs to her wounded husband and sobs over his body. The video also shows that it was not until after more officers arrived on scene and attempted to move Duenez that they realised his foot was caught in the seatbelt, the Manteca Bulletin reported. The video was obtained by John Burris, an Oakland attorney who filed a wrongful-death federal lawsuit against Manteca Police and Moody in July, through the . discovery process in the case. He released it at the news conference a day after the San Joaquin County district attorney's . office decided that Moody had been legally justified in shooting the man.

Struggle: Ernesto Duenez, Sr., right, embraces his wife Rosemary Duenez as daughter Sabrina, left, reaches to comfort her mother as a video of their son is played . Police said they later found an . eight-inch 'throwing knife' with a four-inch blade in the bed of the truck. Moody, who has been on . the police force for 12 years, had believed he was in danger, the San Fransisco Chronicle reported. And video experts for the district attorney's office said it did look as though Duenez had a knife in his hand at the start of the footage. Yet they lost sight of it and did not know how it ended up in the bed. He had allegedly been involved in a domestic disturbance that day with his wife and witnesses claimed he was carrying the knife and was known to carry a gun, but none was found at the scene. Burris said that Duenez had not been armed and was trying to surrender. He added that even if there was a knife 'he made no aggressive movements toward the officer'. Devastated: Duenez's friends look on as the video, filmed in June 2011, is played on Wednesday . Sadness: Left, Duenez's mother Rosemary and her lawyer John Burris. Right, his wife Whitney Duenez . The attorney said he has asked the U.S. Justice Department to open an investigation and pursue murder charges . against 40-year-old Moody. 'We have communicated to the Department of Justice that this man should be prosecuted for murder,' Burris said. 'He should be held accountable just like anyone else would be held accountable when they engage in this kind of barbaric conduct.' In the report, the district attorney said Duenez was a gang member who served three prison sentences for drug, stolen vehicle and assault with a deadly weapon charges. Burris added that the man was in violation of his parole. The graphic video has been posted on a Facebook group, Justice for Ernest Duenez, adding: 'We once again ask for your help in seeking justice! We need a public outcry!' Victim: Ernesto Duenez, 34, died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen . Missed: Duenez, who police said was a gang member who had served 3 prison terms, leaves behind a son . Burris added on Wednesday: 'This family seeks retribution. They want this man prosecuted for this conduct and I’m certainly going to do whatever we can with the Department of Justice as well as the US Attorney’s office to see if we can make that happen.' Duenez's mother, Rosemary Duenez, 58, said at the news conference that she wanted to release the video after she realised police 'would never deliver us justice'. 'People need to see what happened,' she said, the Chronicle reported. 'They need to know what we see, and what we're fighting for.'

"Two daycare owners have been arrested after one allegedly repeatedly beat a three-year-old girl, eventually killing her, while the other watched and did nothing. Savannah Cross died on Tuesday after she was left to languish in the care of strangers after her mother, a stripper, had not picked her up from the in-house daycare in Phoenix, Arizona since Thanksgiving. Ryan Reed, 27, told police he repeatedly hit, kicked and grabbed the girl at the home, while Allison Clement, 28, failed to report the abuse or seek medical aid, police spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump said. 'Abuse': Ryan Reed, left, allegedly repeatedly beat a toddler in his care while Allison Clement watched . On Monday night, Reed stomped on the child's stomach while she was on the ground and she curled up and spent the rest of the night in that position, the Arizona Republic reported. Throughout the night, Reed heard Savannah groaning but only called authorities at 7am on Tuesday when he found her unresponsive, police said. She died on the way to hospital. Crump added that Savannah's injuries were so severe that it will take further investigations to discover what killed her. Investigators found the girl was covered in bruises on both side of her body. They were at different stages of healing, suggesting long-term abuse, Maricopa County Superior Courts documents noted. Victim: Savannah Cross, 3, died after Reed allegedly stomped on her stomach following months of abuse . She had been in the care of Reed and Clement since July. Her 27-year-old mother, Ashley, returned sporadically to visit the child and pay the couple, Crump said. The girl's father said he had also left his daughter as he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder and feared he might hurt her - but he had no idea she was being left at the strangers' home. Stephen Cross, a former marine who lives in Colorado, said Savannah's mother told him the child was only with babysitters when she went to work. 'If I would have known that she was being left with complete . strangers for weeks on end, I would have been down there in a skinny . minute to get my daughter,' he told CBS5. Abandoned: Savannah's mother Ashley, left, had not collected her from the daycare since Thanksgiving, while her father, Stephen, right, could not care for her as he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder . Innocent: Other relatives said they were unaware Savannah had been left at the daycare for weeks on end . The girl's grandmother, Cathy Cross, . added: 'You don't drop your kids at daycare and never come back except . to pay them. What is that, paid abandonment? What is that?' Family friend Frank Warneka told ABC15 he lived with Savannah and Ashley until a month ago, but knew the . woman often did not pay her childcare bill. 'They [Reed and Clements] sent a note home to Ashley saying she owned them $1,200,' he said. 'I called them and said Ashley . doesn't live here anymore and that they should call CPS because it isn't . their responsibility to take care of Savannah. 'I think Ashley thought she loved Savannah, but I don't think she knows how to love anything.' Regrets: Cross, pictured with Savannah as a baby, said he wished he had known she needed him . Scene: The couple advertised their 'babysitting' service on Craigslist and had two children of their own . Ashley has not been charged but Crump said more charges may be filed after the medical examiner's office reports back to police. 'If there is any of these injuries that may . have been long term or extended than we might hold somebody else . responsible,' he said. It is believed the couple advertised their daycare services on Craigslist. A child-care facility only needs a license if it is caring for four more children other than their own. Investigators found three children and two belonging to the couple at the home. The children have been taken into the custody of Child Protective Services.","Ryan Reed 'stomped on Savannah Cross' stomach while she was in his care'

"A pregnant mother whose waters broke at just 23 weeks refused to abort her unborn child despite suffering three serious setbacks, with doctors warning that each time that the baby would not survive. Medics offered Leanne Duffield, 29, a termination because they feared her baby would suffer fatal abnormalities caused by a lack of amniotic fluid, which protects and helps the baby's development in the womb. When her waters broke a fortnight later, they were so convinced the baby's lungs would be too small for her to breathe they called in a specialist bereavement midwife to comfort the couple. Mrs Duffield, 29, gave birth to daughter Willow despite three  complications so serious doctors warned her unborn baby would not survive . After being born at 24 weeks - the legal abortion limit- Willow Duffield spent 100 days in hospital . Mrs Duffield, from Pontcymmer in Wales then suffered a placental abruption, a serious complication where bleeding is found in the placenta as it comes away from the womb, which could have killed both her and the baby. But incredibly Mrs Duffield and husband Chris's 'miracle daughter' Willow survived and now at nine-months-old is hitting all her developmental targets. 'She had so many different things that were stacking up against her. She is our miracle baby.' said Mrs Duffield, who lives with her husband and their four other children Ashlea, eight, Deacon, six, Neraya, three, and Ayelah, two. Mrs Duffield's pregnancy appeared to be progressing normally until a routine scan at the Princess of Wales (POW) Hospital in Bridgend last Halloween revealed a terrifying complication. Willow was sent home with an oxygen tank. Although she was born with chronic lung disease, doctors hope that as her lungs grow the diseased part will be minimised and she will suffer nothing more than asthma . Mrs Duffield said: 'When we went for the 20-week scan we found there was no fluid around her and they thought there was some sort of abnormality causing the lack of fluid.' During pregnancy, a baby is cushioned inside a bag filled with amniotic fluid in the womb, which protects the baby from being hurt from a blow to the stomach, help's the baby's lungs and digestive system to mature and protects against infection. Doctors were not able to say what caused the lack of fluid in Mrs Duffield's womb, although they believe the stress of her father's death the previous month could have been a contributing factor. A week later the foetal medicine unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff offered her a termination. Doctors said that a lack of amniotic fluid usually means the baby has suffered abnormalities that would make survival impossible. But the couple refused an abortion. 'We didn't even have to talk about it,' said Mrs Duffield. 'It was one of those things we would never have even considered. It didn't even enter our thoughts.' She was for another appointment a fortnight later, but she did not make it as her waters broke inexplicably at 23 weeks and she was admitted to the POW Hospital. 'When we had been for the scan there was no fluid at all. But when my waters broke at 23 weeks it was just like it was with the others. It was a gush and I couldn't understand.' she said. Babies born before the 24 week legal limit for abortion do not usually survive, and doctors feared Willow's lungs would be too small and stiff for her to breathe on her own or even for medics to ventilate her. Mrs Duffield and her husband Chris call Willow their 'miracle baby' and are fundraising for the family support group at the hospital's baby unit . Mrs Duffield said doctors started to prepare her for her baby's death. She said: 'They thought I would deliver the baby and we had the bereavement midwife come and talk to us. It was a bit overwhelming.' But her labour did not progress as expected and as her pregnancy neared 24 weeks she was transferred to Singleton Hospital in Swansea. She was put on complete bed rest and received steroid injections to help reduce the severity of Willow's lung problems. A scan in mid-December revealed Willow had all her limbs, but doctors could still not be certain she would not have any of the serious problems with muscles and bones that can be caused by a lack of amniotic fluid. After eating their Christmas dinner on the hospital ward as it was too dangerous for Mrs Duffield to leave, the family had to face yet another problem with the pregnancy. Now, at nine-months-old, Willow is thriving and is even hitting all her developmental targets . On January 13 Mrs Duffield suffered placental abruption, a potentially-fatal complication where the placenta comes away from the inside of the womb, causing bleeding. Doctors carried out an emergency caesarean section and Willow was born weighing just 2lb 6oz. Despite being born with chronic lung disease, Willow did not have any of the problems with her limbs or spine which medics had feared. After almost 100 days in the special care baby units in both Singleton and then the POW hospitals she was allowed home in April with an oxygen tank. Since then her oxygen support has been reduced, although she still needs it at night, and Willow has continued to go from strength to strength. Mrs Duffield said doctors hope that as her lungs grow the diseased part will be minimised and Willow will suffer nothing more than asthma. She said: 'The amount of hospital appointments is getting less and less.' 'And at the moment she is hitting all the targets she should be. With premature babies they should have caught up with their peers by two years.' 'We call her the happy wheezer and considering what she has been through, she is so happy' said Mr Duffy . She her husband have now begun fundraising for a support group set up by the special care baby nurses who looked after Willow. She said: 'There are so many bad stories and so much negative press, but if it wasn't for them myself and Willow wouldn't be here today. 'We will never be able to repay them for what they have done for us, but it's just something to say thank you and that their work is appreciated.' Mr Duffield - who works for Harvester in Bridgend and has recently completed the Swansea 10K race to raise more than £300 for the family support group at the POW Hospital special care baby unit. Mr Duffield said: 'A couple of oxygen tubes are nothing compared to what we were prepared for. We didn't know what to expect, but we had prepared ourselves for the worst case scenario. 'We call her the happy wheezer and considering what she has been through, she is so happy.' Mrs Duffield added: 'One of the nurses said that she has seen some defects in similar situations where they are incompatible with life, so we are really lucky.'","Doctors offered Leanne Duffield an abortion after a scan revealed a problem .

"After travelling 352 million miles in eight-and-a-half months, Nasa's rover Curiosity finally landed on Mars at 5.32 GMT . (1.32 EDT) this morning. The high-tech craft hit the top of the Martian atmosphere at 13,000mph, and was then slowly lowered by a radical floating 'sky crane' before gently arriving in a massive crater. The news was greeted with cheers and shouts in Nasa's Pasadena Mission Control, and within seconds the craft had sent back the first pictures of its new home. Scroll down for video . Nasa's HiRise telescope captures the martian rover's descent onto the red planet. Here, the parachute is clearly visible. Jubilant scientists hugged, wept and distributed Mars bars to each other as mission controllers confirmed the landing. 'Touchdown confirmed', controllers said. Curiosity later sent back the first high resolution picture of its landing site, showing one of its wheels on the martian surface. Colour images are expected later this week. 'We are wheels down on Mars. Oh my God.' The rover even has a Twitter feed associated with it, announcing its arrival by saying: 'I'm safely on the surface of Mars. GALE CRATER I AM IN YOU!!!' Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden hailed the success as a big step towards sending men to the red planet. 'Today, the wheels of Curiosity have begun to blaze the trail for human footprints on Mars,' he said. 'We're on Mars again, and it's absolutely incredible. 'It doesn't get any better than this.' Curiosity on the surface of mars: Within seconds of landing, the rover sent back these images. In the left hand picture, the shadow of the rover can be clearly seen, while rocks on the surface can also be seen. The mission was hailed by President Obama, who said: 'Tonight, on the planet Mars, the United States of America made history. 'The successful landing of Curiosity – the most sophisticated roving laboratory ever to land on another planet – marks an unprecedented feat of technology that will stand as a point of national pride far into the future. 'It proves that even the longest of odds are no match for our unique blend of ingenuity and determination.' Flight System Manager Matt Wallace (C) and MSL Lead Flight Director David Oh (2nd R) celebrate curiosity's successful landing . Nasa's Pasadena mission control room erupts with cheers as scientists recieve the first images from the Curiosity mars rover . The trickiest moment of the landing . came in a truly out of this world gymnastics routine during Curiosity's . 'seven minutes of terror' plummet through the atmosphere. When . the rover had safely navigated its landing and touched down on the face . of the Red Planet, Nasa scientists exploded with delight and some even . broke down in tears, overwhelmed at the success of the decades-long . project. The team are already busy analysing the first images from the rover. 'Curiosity's landing site is beginning to come into focus,' said John Grotzinger, project manager of Nasa's Mars Science Laboratory mission at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'In the first HD image (above) we are looking to the northwest. 'What you see on the horizon is the rim of Gale Crater. 'In the foreground, you can see a gravel field. 'The question is, where does this . gravel come from? It is the first of what will be many scientific . questions to come from our new home on Mars.' Curiosity's . trajectory was so accurate that engineers decided to wave off a last . chance to tweak its position before atmosphere entry. 'We're ready to . head in,' said mission manager Brian Portock. As part of a long-running tradition, flight . controllers broke out the 'good luck' peanuts before Curiosity took the . plunge.

High five: Curiosity team member Miguel San Martin, Chief Engineer, Guidance, Navigation, and Control at Jet Propulsion Laboratory, left, celebrates with Adam Steltzner, MSL entry, descent and landing (EDL) worker. One scientist who could relate to the building anxiety was Cornell University planetary scientist Steve Squyres, who headed Nasa's last successful rover mission in 2004. This time around, Squyres has a supporting role and viewed the landing with other researchers in the 'science bullpen.' 'Landing on Mars is always a nerve-racking thing,' he admitted. 'You're never going to get relaxed about something like landing a spacecraft on Mars.' Xavier Cabrera (front, C) of New York, celebrates while watching a live broadcast of the NASA Mission Control center in Time Square . Sunday's touchdown was especially intense because Nasa is testing a brand new landing technique. Due to the communication delay between Mars and Earth, Curiosity was on autopilot. There was also extra pressure because budget woes have forced Nasa to rejig its Mars exploration roadmap. Artist's impression of Nasa's Curiosity rover on the surface of Mars . On average the red planet is 141.6 million miles from the Sun. With a diameter of 4,222 miles, it’s around half the size of the Earth. It’s absolutely freezing there, with an average temperature of -85F (-65C). Gravity is much less powerful - slightly less than 40 per cent of ours. The atmosphere is desperately thin – one per cent of Earth’s pressure – and not very nice for us humans because 95 per cent of it is carbon dioxide. It boasts the solar system’s biggest mountain – Olympus Mons, a dead volcano. Mars’s red colouring comes from the iron oxide that coats its surface. Mars has huge amounts of ice at its polar caps. If they melted, it would cover the whole planet in water 11-metres deep, according to Nasa. 'There's nothing in the pipeline' beyond the planned launch of a Mars orbiter in 2013, said former Nasa Mars czar Scott Hubbard, who teaches at Stanford University. Curiosity was launched to study whether the Martian environment ever had conditions suitable for microbial life. The last Mars rovers, twins Spirit and Opportunity, were cocooned in air bags and bounced to a stop in 2004. The plans for Curiosity called for a series of braking tricks, similar to those used by the space shuttle, and a supersonic parachute to slow it down. Next, it ditched the heat shield used for the fiery descent. And in a new twist, engineers came up with a way to lower the rover by cable from a hovering rocket-powered backpack. At touchdown, the cords cut and the rocket stage crashes a distance away. The nuclear-powered Curiosity, the size of a small car, is packed with scientific tools, cameras and a weather station. It sports a robotic arm with a power drill, a laser that can zap distant rocks, a chemistry lab to sniff for the chemical building blocks of life and a detector to measure dangerous radiation on the surface. It also tracked radiation levels during the journey to help Nasa better understand the risks astronauts could face on a future manned trip. After several weeks of health checkups, the six-wheeled rover could take its first short drive and flex its robotic arm. Curiosity mission managers, flight controllers, scientists and administrators speak at a press conference after the Rover successfully landed on the surface of the Red Planet . The landing site near Mars' equator was picked because there are signs of water everywhere, meeting one of the requirements for life as we know it. Inside Gale Crater is a three-mile-high mountain, and images from space show the base appears rich in minerals that formed in the presence of water. Previous trips to Mars have uncovered ice near the Martian north pole and evidence that water once flowed when the planet was wetter and toastier unlike today's harsh, frigid desert environment. Target: The area known as Gale crater area where Nasa's Curiosity rover landed . Curiosity's goal now is to scour for basic ingredients essential for life, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur and oxygen. It's not equipped to search for living or fossil micro-organisms. To get a definitive answer, a future mission needs to fly Martian rocks and soil back to Earth to be examined by powerful laboratories. The mission comes as Nasa retools its Mars exploration strategy. Spectators in New York's Time Square react as they watch the announcement of the Mars science rover Curiosity, successfully landing . Thousands of spectators gathered in New York's Time Square to watch the mission on the big screen . Imran Yusufzai, a space fan, watches in New York's Time Square . Faced with tough economic times, the space agency pulled out of partnership with the European Space Agency to land a rock-collecting rover in 2018. The Europeans have since teamed with the Russians as Nasa decides on a new roadmap. Despite Mars' reputation as a spacecraft graveyard, humans continue their love affair with the planet, lobbing spacecraft in search of clues about its early history. Out of more than three dozen attempts - flybys, orbiters and landings - by the U.S., Soviet Union, Europe and Japan since the 1960s, more than half have ended disastrously. One Nasa rover that defied expectations is Opportunity, which is still busy wheeling around the rim of a crater in the Martian southern hemisphere eight years later.

"Mitt Romney's commanding performance in Wednesday night's first presidential debate has started to yield results as he took a two-point lead in a respected national poll. The Republican candidate has also raised $12million in online donations over the last couple of days. The two-point boost came via the Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll. The news comes as Barack Obama's lacklustre showing continues to be mocked by top comedians who are strong supporters of the President - including the cast of Saturday Night Live.

"The three women who were held captive and sexually abused in a Cleveland home for a decade have returned to the 'House of Horrors' in an extraordinary show of bravery. On Friday morning, Michelle Knight visited to Ariel Castro's home, where she was held from August 2002 until her escape on May 6, so that she could thank neighbors for their support. Amanda Berry and her father also returned to the home on Tuesday to thank those who helped her when she fled for safety, and Gina DeJesus also visited Seymour Street this week, 19ActionNews reported. Knight's visit came as it emerged her captor will start his term - a life sentence plus 1,000 years - isolated from other inmates. A spokeswoman for Ohio's prisons . department said Castro won't go into general population once he enters . the state's prison system. She says it's for his own protection because . of his high profile. Visit: Michelle Knight, right, is pictured with a neighbor near to the home where she was held captive for ten years in Cleveland. Knight has returned to the home to thank neighbors for their support . At his sentencing on Thursday, Knight told him: 'You took 11 years of my life away, . but now I have it back. I spent 11 years in hell. Now . your hell is just beginning.' As part of Castro's plea agreement, the Seymour Avenue house will be torn down in the near future. Castro was sentenced after pleading guilty to 937 counts including kidnapping, rape and murder. Graphic . and disturbing evidence was heard during the four-and-a-half-hour . hearing, with Castro himself giving a deluded version of events in which . he denied raping or beating his three victims. Moving on: Amanda Berry, left, made a surprise onstage . appearance at a rap concert last weekend, and Gina DeJesus, right, made a . few televised comments as a privacy fence was erected around her house . Locked up: Castro, pictured in court on Thursday, is beginning his prison term in isolation for his safety . Castro said: 'As God as my witness I never beat these women, I never tortured them. These women were not virgins when I met them, all three of them' Standing in an orange jumpsuit, . Castro shocked the packed courtroom by stating there was 'a lot of . harmony' in the house where he trapped and abused the three women. The 53-year-old blamed his behavior on the violence he suffered as a child and his addiction to sex. The detective in charge of the case . described how Castro abducted the three women, took them to his home and . immediately tied them in chains in the basement and raped them. He put a motorbike helmet on each girl and left them in the dark basement overnight, Detective Harasimchuk said. 'Each . woman told me they were repeatedly sexually, physically and emotionally . abused by Ariel Castro during the entire time they were in captivity,' he said. Dr Frank Ochberg described to the court the long-term impact the continuous abuse will have on the victims. Sickening: Chains found in an upstairs bedroom at the Seymour Ave. house are shown on a television monitor during the sentencing phase of Ariel Castro Thursday, Aug. 1, 2013, in Cleveland . Restraints: A rusty chain can be seen over a dirty mattress on the floor of the room Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight shared . Basement: The pole the girls were all chained to and raped many times throughout their time in captivity is pictured . Demo: Sheriff's deputies set in place a model of the house on Seymour Ave where Ariel Castro held three women for a decade . He described their 'terror-induced states of mind, . defilement, dehumanization and how they were treated like animals and . deprived of their sense of self and dignity'. 'They have life sentences. They will never be free of the damage done,' he told the court. FBI agent Andrew Burke described the moment he saw the girls as 'surreal' as they were so pale and malnourished. 'I'll never forget it,' he said. 'It . was surreal to me. I had been involved in the missing persons . investigations for quite some time.' He talked the court through pictures . of inside the home, describing how the back door was equipped with an . alarm, a bedspread separated the kitchen and living area, a porch swing . obstructed a flight of stairs and a curtain was put over the stairs . leading to the area where the women were held. Prison: The court is being shown around the Cleveland House of Horrors through police photos . Clutter: The rooms inside the Castro home are strewn with discarded clothes, toys and shabby furniture, with children's drawings decorating the pink walls . Bedroom windows were boarded shut from the inside with heavy closet . doors and doorknobs had been removed and replaced with multiple locks, . he said. The house was divided in ways to make it more secure and to . hide the existence of rooms, he said. Authorities also found a . 'significant amount' of cash in a washing machine in the basement, the . same room as the pole the women were chained to while he raped them. On occasion, Castro would throw the . money at the women after sexually abusing them and require  they pay him . to pick up any special items for them when he left the house, the agent . said. He would also force them to hold a gun to his head and dare them to shoot him in a sick game of Russian Roulette. Castro has admitted that on one . occasion Knight told him she may be pregnant and he forced a termination . by putting her on a tea-only diet for several days, made her perform . 'knee bends' and jumping jacks. The House of Horrors: Ariel Castro kept the three women captive in his unassuming suburban home . However, when Berry fell pregnant, . Knight helped save the baby's life as Castro threatened to kill her if . the child did not survive. 'It . was Michelle who served as doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician . during the birth. She breathed life into that infant when she wasn't . breathing,' wrote Dr Ochberg. 'At . other times, she interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina, . interposing herself and absorbing physical and sexual trauma. But each . survivor had a will to prevail and used that will to live through the . ordeal.' A memorandum . also describes how Castro controlled the movements of the women, . keeping them in locked rooms and using physical restraints. 'There is only one bathroom in the . house, on the first floor. The Defendant would not allow the victims . downstairs to use the bathroom. They only had access to plastic toilets . in the bedrooms. They were emptied infrequently.' Admission: Ariel Castro wrote a letter saying he was a sexual predator who needed help but did not bother to get it . Bolted doors: A door that is shown to lock from the outside was presented as evidence to the court as Castro's sentencing was handed out today in Cleveland . The . document adds: 'He controlled the temperature and the inflow of food . and drink. He used the cold of the basement and the heat of the attic as . punishment techniques.' Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Detective Dave Jacobs said he talked with . Castro a few days after the women escaped and that Castro said, 'I knew . what I did was wrong.' Detective Harasimchuk also told the court all three girls were vaginally, orally and anally raped throughout their time in captivity. He . said all three women were abducted after Castro offered them a ride and . that each was chained in his basement and sexually assaulted within a . few hours of being kidnapped. Castro lured one of the women into . his Cleveland home with the promise of a puppy for her son and tricked . another by saying she could see his daughter. He chained his captives by their . ankles, fed them only one meal a day and provided plastic toilets in . their bedrooms that were infrequently emptied, the filing said. Malnourished: Pictures of Gina deJesus, left and Amanda Berry, right, on the day they were rescued . Gina DeJesus: All of the victims were described as being malnourished, pale, gaunt and dehydrated . He menaced them with a gun, . threatened them with tales of other captives, some of whom hadn't made . it home, and at one point locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage . for three days while he had a visitor. Castro claimed he didn't have an exit . strategy from his complicated double life and finally gave the women a . chance to escape by leaving a door unlocked, the court filing said. The women, each kidnapped separately . when they accepted a ride from Castro on Cleveland's blue-collar west . side, quickly escaped after Amanda Berry kicked out the door panel on . May 6 and Castro was arrested within hours. The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years.","Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus separately visited the home in Cleveland to thank neighbors for their support .

"This is the man charged with murdering great-grandmother Palmira Silva, who was brutally beheaded in a machete attack in her garden. Nicholas Salvador, 25, is unemployed and was staying with a friend a few doors from the 82-year-old widow in Edmonton, North London. CCTV has emerged of Mr Salvador's movements two hours before the murder, which shows him eating a quarter-pounder burger and an egg in a nearby cafe before apparently walking out without paying. Scroll down for video . Under guard: Nicholas Salvador, 25 (left), has been charged with murdering great-grandmother Palmira Silva . A friend said: ‘He was always down, he never smiled, he never had any money. He was a known failure.’ He was stopped by staff and returned to settle the bill, according to the footage published in The Sun. Waitress Hayley Kaya, 27, told the newspaper he 'looked as if his mind was somewhere else' but added: 'At the time I served him he just seemed like a normal customer.' Last night Salvador was charged with murdering Mrs Silva and with assaulting a police officer. He is due to appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London later this morning. Nicknamed ‘Fat Nick’, the would-be cage fighter being held by police left home 11 years ago. Last night a friend said: ‘Nicholas is an only child and his parents brought him here from Nigeria. But when he was about 13 or 14 he left home.' 'The truth is, he has never felt loved. He has been unlucky all his life. ‘He was always down, he never smiled, he never had any money. He was a known failure.’ Another friend said: ‘He is from a Muslim background but he is not a good Muslim – he gambles, plays roulette. Killed: Great-grandmother Palmira Silva was found beheaded on Thursday in a horrific attack . Happy family: Palmira and her late husband Domenico with their now grown-up children, Celestina and Rino . 'When he left home his mum found him a room somewhere and said she would pay two months’ rent, and after that he was on his own.’ A former classmate at Salisbury School, Edmonton, said: ‘We used to call him St Nicholas because he never got up to anything. He was always saying he wanted a girlfriend.’ Virgin Media worker Myrvin Kirwan, 36, who was in the house next door when the murder happened on Thursday, said: ‘He jumped over the fence and he was standing there with a machete. 'He had blood on his hands. He was looking straight at me, but it was almost as if he was looking straight through me.’ Salvador had been taken to hospital and remained under police guard before being questioned by officers and charged late last night. Investigation: Police at the scene on Thursday in Edmonton, north London . Tributes: Tributes gathered outside one of the London snack bars which had been run by the 82-year-old . Police were forced to stage a dramatic evacuation operation to save neighbours during the incident, and an armed squad Tasered the suspect as he struggled against officers, leaving one with a broken wrist. The house in the busy street where the Italian widow's body was found was the scene of a major police operation after officers were called to the scene initially to reports that a man had beheaded an animal. Scotland Yard said that its officers distracted the man after he was seen going through back gardens in Nightingale Road to prevent him attacking anyone else, while they evacuated people from nearby homes. Palmira Silva moved to London from her native Italy with her husband Domenico to start a new life. They married, started a family and began a successful restaurant business. But six decades on from the day they set foot in the capital, Mrs Silva would become a tragic victim of the other side of Britain, horrifically slaughtered in her garden by a machete-wielding killer. Last night members of the 82-year-old widow’s extended family were in shock as they struggled to come to terms with how anyone could murder a great-grandmother described by neighbours and those who got to know her as ‘an angel… a lovely, smiling grandma’. Her daughter Celestina told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being. We simply can’t make any sense of it.’ Mrs Silva arrived in Britain from southern Italy in the 1950s and immediately found a job as a nanny. Domenico had travelled separately to England but knew he had found his future wife from the moment he first saw her. Yesterday friends and local residents paid tribute to Mrs Silva and sent condolences to her family. Dilek Solma, 19, who works in a shop next door, described her as ‘an angel with a lovely smile’ adding: 'She was really kind' As police remained in the streets Mrs Silva's cafe became a focus for tributes, turning into a carpet of flowers . Together they saved enough money to fulfil a dream of starting their own business and raised Celestina and a son, Rino, making sure they immersed themselves in English culture without forgetting their Italian roots. They ran a succession of cafes and snack bars in different parts of the city before settling in North London. Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. Mrs Silva's daughter said: 'She knew the area was changing but she was determined to stay' She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe that she and her son ran in Church Street, a few minutes walk from her home. Known there as Pam, she had become a much loved and familiar face, gradually handing over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died. Mrs Silva had been back from a family holiday in Italy for only a week when she died. Celestina, 49, said: ‘She knew the area was changing but she was determined to stay. It seems such a dreadful, senseless waste.’ Yesterday friends and local residents paid tribute to Mrs Silva and sent condolences to her family. Dilek Solma, 19, who works in a shop next door, described her as ‘an angel with a lovely smile’ adding: ‘She was really kind… just so nice.’ Andrew Zouvani, 66, owner of Guy’s Hair Salon opposite the cafe, said: ‘I’ve known her for 35 years, I used to go over and she would serve me drinks, she was really nice. ‘She was a very nice lady, and she wouldn’t give up working. We would joke that I couldn’t understand her after 35 years because of her strong Italian accent.’ Chris Moles, 44, a worker at a Church Street florist, said: ‘She was a very friendly lady. She was lovely really, like a lovely grandma.’ By last night the cafe had become a focal point for tributes, a carpet of flowers and wreaths growing in front of the shuttered doors. Most were left by shocked friends, customers and nearby local businesses, one describing her as ‘a truly wonderful lady’. Another encapsulated local anger and grief in six poignant words: ‘One more angel taken,’ it said. ‘So sad.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Suspect in Edmonton, north London, named locally as Nicolas Salvador, 25 .

Forward-thinking Ángela Ruiz Robles invented her Mechanical Encyclopedia in 1949 - more than half a century before the advent of Kindles, Kobos and Nooks. Her main goal was to reduce the weight of books in students' school bags, and she firmly believed the gadget would make reading more accessible to all. Pioneer: Ángela Ruiz Robles invented her Mechanical Encyclopedia in 1949 - some half a century before the Kindles, Kobos and Nooks literature lovers enjoy today . The device worked with pressurised air, allowing readers to add different spools containing the pre-loaded content. It may be well away from the current format of downloading books from the internet, but in a world without the web it was deemed revolutionary. Ruiz, who was at the time aged 54, applied for a patent. Her rather concise application said: 'It has some coils where you place the books that you want to learn in whatever language. 'By a movement of the same [the coils] it passes over all the topics, making it stop where you would like it to.' It also reportedly had a 'zoom' function where readers could focus in on a particular area of the text. María José Rodríguez Fortiz, language professor at the University of Granada, said she also had plans to add a reading light, sound and a hole to place a calculator. But none of these ideas made it to the first prototype. Ángela Ruiz Robles' technology was a million miles away from the e-readers we have today, such as the Kindle, but the core concept was the same . Sadly, the mother-of-three's invention never reached the market as she could not find the right level of funding for her project. Rodríguez told Spanish media: 'There were other priorities in the country and they went for other projects. 'Furthermore, the implementation of all the specifications of the invention was impractical. 'In her later years Ángela tried to resurrect the project, when everything was technologically viable. But she did not manage to secure public or private funding.' Ruiz, born in 1895 in Vallamanín, León, moved to the town of Ferrol in Galicia as a youngster where she spent most of her life. She died in her 80s. The prototype is now in the National Museum of Science and Technology in La Coruña, whose director Ramón Núñez said that Ruiz was 'unique, not only in Spain, but in the world.' He added: 'It is easy to see that there are very few women who have dared to enter their ideas for inventions and innovations. 'For her exceptional character, the fact that she is not well known is very serious.'","Ángela Ruiz Robles invented the 'Mechanical Encyclopedia'

"Up to 19,000 French websites have been hacked since the attacks on the Charlie Hebdo office on January 7, the country's head of cyber-defence has confirmed. Rear Admiral Arnaud Coustilliere has said the scope and severity of the attacks  is 'unprecedented'. According to CNN Money, the French Defense Ministry and ANSSI - its version of America's National Security Agency - said they have been monitoring waves of cyber-attacks on all kinds of websites. The websites of French businesses, religious groups, universities and municipalities were altered to display pro-Islamist messages. Hacked: The website of the French town of Ezanville was replaced with this black Isis flag, and a message reading: 'Death to France' Widespread: France's head of cyber-defence, Rear Admiral Arnaud Coustilliere (pictured), confirmed the scope of the attacks was 'unprecedented' Ezanville was one of the thousands of towns whose website's home page was replaced with a black ISIS flag, and the message: 'The Islamic State Stay Inchallah. Free Palestine. Death To France. Death To Charlie.' The allegedly Anti-Semitic message refers to the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, who have recently printed a 'survivors' edition after eight of their journalists were murdered in a terrorist attack on January 7. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has since claimed responsibility for the attack on its office - as well as another hostage situation in the city, in which four people were killed by Amedy Coulibaly. Their latest magazine cover features a cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad, which has prompted further fear of retaliation against both the publication and France itself. Coustilliere said the French Defense Ministry's website also became temporarily inaccessible after it was 'bombarded' with fake internet traffic - but described the attacks as nothing more than an 'annoyance'. He said: 'These attacks have no effect on the conduct of our operations.' While Guillaume Poupard, the general director of ANSSI, says the websites with 'little computer security' were being targetted by vandals, adding: 'It's not a very complex attack. They're looking for weak targets.' These French websites are not the only ones to face cyber-threats in recent weeks. Cyber-threat: The Twitter account of the US military's Central Command (pictured) appeared to be hacked by ISIS sympathisers, who posted threatening messages against troops and the home addresses of 4-star generals. Threat: One ominous post sent from the hacked Central Command twitter account read: 'American soldiers, we are coming, watch your back. ISIS.' Hacker: US and European governments strongly believed US Central Command's Twitter account was hacked by Junaid Hussain (pictured), 20, who they say was once jailed for hacking the personal address book of former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair . On Monday, the social media accounts of the US military's Central Command appeared to be hacked by ISIS sympathisers - who posted threatening messages against troops and the home addresses of 4-star generals. Sources from US and European governments strongly believed the 'CyberCaliphate' hacking was carried out by Junaid Hussain, 20, who they say was once jailed for hacking the personal address book of former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. He replaced the cover photo of their Twitter account with a photograph of a masked ISIS soldier and the message, 'i love you isis'. Ominous tweets reading 'American soldiers, we are coming, watch your back' and 'We won't stop! We know everything about you, your wives and children' were posted from the account.","France's head of cyber-defence confirmed thousands of websites hacked .

"Circumcised men may soon be able to undergo a procedure to re-grow their foreskin. A U.S. company says it is close to developing a method that will allow men’s foreskins to regenerate – much like a salamander is able to re-grow a limb, the website Motherboard reports. The procedure will help the growing number of men aggrieved about being circumcised before they had the capacity to consent to the procedure. These men - who call themselves ‘intactivists’ - are becoming increasingly vocal with their outrage at being circumcised. A US company claims it may soon be able to regrow a human foreskin, which will help the increasing number of men who are aggrieved about being circumcised, claiming it has reduced sensitivity (file image) Many of them are congregating on forums on websites such as foreskin-restoration.net and circumstitions.com, angry that their foreskins were removed before they were old enough to consent or understand the implications of the procedure. Many complain that they experience de-sensitivity in the head of the penis and cannot enjoy sex in the same way as their non-circumcised peers. Medical experts are increasingly divided over whether circumcision should be performed. While some argue there is a wealth of research showing the health benefits, from a reduced risk of sexually transmitted diseases to penile cancer, critics argue circumcision can cause lifelong trauma, diminish sexual satisfaction and put children at risk of lasting physical damage. In many of the ‘intactivist’ forums, men discuss options and methods of reversing the procedure. Now, one company purports it will soon be able to do just that, reports journalist Arikia Millikan for Motherboard. Regeneration is carried out by creating an extra-cellular matrix, a ‘skeleton’ for tissue which provides an attachment point for cells and makes human tissue 3D. This extra-cellular matrix is then seeded with the appropriate layer of cells, in this case, stem cells that will grow into foreskin. Foregen says it will draw together experts from the field to find a way to make men’s foreskin grow back. It will start with experiments on animals with a view to progressing to trials on humans. In 2013, the company had its first 'breakthrough' and was able to 'decellularize' bull foreskins - a process which marks the first step towards re-growing the bull’s foreskin. An organ donation organisation has now given Foregen the permission to acquire human adult foreskins – and they will carry out the same experiments on these. So far, while they may be close to regrowing foreskin tissue, it is unclear how they will regenerate peripheral nerves. Writing on its website, Foregen said: ‘In the short term, we hope to fully regenerate human foreskins. ‘Once we have accomplished that, our goal is to advance onto human clinical trials as soon as it is safe to do so.’ It says the newly grown foreskin will be fully functioning, as the new tissue reintegrates itself in the body. This means the body recognises it as its own tissue and will not reject it, as is the case for transplanted organs or grafted skin. It claims not only to be able to ‘re-grow’ the removed tissue, but it will also be fully functioning, restoring sensitivity. Foregen, is a US non-profit organisation ‘founded to research and implement regenerative medical therapies for circumcised males’, its website says. It points to research which found that circumcision leads to loss of sensation in the penis, as well as the potential for psychological damage. The company, based in Italy, is researching techniques used in regenerative medicine, a branch of medicine which helps people re-grow tissue that has been lost by injury or disease. Like salamanders, humans naturally have the ability to regenerate while developing in the womb. If a foetus loses a finger, it grows back without forming scar tissue. It is not known why humans lose the ability to regenerate, but one theory is that the process of scarring – which prevents bleeding – was considered during human evolution to be more important. Experts working in regenerative medicine have discovered ways of harnessing the ‘map of the body’ present in cells’ DNA, which allows any part of the body to be regrown, and to inhibit scarring. So far, scientists and doctors have been able to partially regenerate living human hearts, vaginal tissue, breast tissue as well as fully regenerating bladders and the last joint of a human finger. Scientists have also been able to regrow functioning penises in rabbits. Regeneration is carried out by creating an extra-cellular matrix, a ‘skeleton’ for tissue which provides an attachment point for cells and makes human tissue 3D. This extra-cellular matrix is then seeded with the appropriate layer of cells, in this case, stem cells that will grow into foreskin. Growing numbers of men are calling themselves 'intactivists' and are angry at being circumcised as an infant before they could consent to the procedure.

This means the body recognises it as its own tissue and will not reject it, as is the case for transplanted organs or grafted skin. Medical experts are increasingly divided over whether circumcision should be performed . Circumcision has been practised for centuries, with the earliest evidence dating from the time of the pharaohs. Yet it has become a highly controversial procedure, and one that stirs strong passions. Late last year, the U.S. centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - America's leading public health organisation, recently issued draft guidelines recommending the procedure for all boys. Experts there argued that circumcision protects against the risk of urinary tract infections in infants and sexually transmitted diseases in adulthood. This may be because it reduces the risk of bacteria lodging within the foreskin and reduces the risk of tiny tears to the foreskin that become an entry point for infections. The CDC guidelines also suggest that circumcision lowers the risk of men contracting herpes and the human papilloma virus, in turn protecting them against penile cancer - and cutting the risk of their passing the virus on to women, reducing their risk of cervical cancer. The CDC concluded that 'the scientific evidence is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks of physical or mental harm that may be involved'. Those in the 'no' camp say all this is based on flawed studies from Africa that have no relevance to Western populations. Furthermore it ignores research that shows no link between circumcision and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Over the past five years, doctors' groups in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Holland, Iceland and Australia have spoken out against the procedure. Their various national organisations have called for bans on the op unless it is needed on strictly medical grounds. The Council of Europe recently passed a resolution condemning the practice as a 'violation of the physical integrity of children'. It said circumcision can cause lifelong trauma, diminish sexual satisfaction and put children at risk of lasting physical damage. And while the World Health Organisation advocates circumcision in regions with high levels of heterosexual HIV transmission - such as in Africa - it also warns that it can cause pain, excessive bleeding, excessive skin removal, scars and deformation. Last month, England's most senior family judge, Sir James Munby, said male circumcision involved 'significant harm'.","Growing number of men are angry at being circumcised as an infant .

"The book is a guide for British soldiers with how to deal with the German civilian population . Their women are not to be trusted, they struggle to control their feelings and can fly into a rage if things go wrong. However, they are also make excellent sausages and their beer is 'one of the pleasantest in Europe'. These are among the official observations made of Germans for British soldiers preparing to oversee the generation that served Hitler. They appear in the 1944 manual, Instructions for British Servicemen in Germany, that has surprisingly risen to fourth place in the German bestseller list. The book is full of warnings for British soldiers in Germany and explains: 'There are signs that the German leaders are already making plans for a third World War. That must be prevented at all costs.' Intended to condition a conscript army to resist German propaganda, the little red book also covers general cultural topics such as food and drink and social customs. The portraits of Germans in the book are mostly unflattering. However, it does comment on the high quality of German sausages, coffee and beer. It warns British soldiers that: 'The Germans are not good at controlling their feelings. They have a streak of hysteria. 'You will find that Germans may often fly into a passion if some little thing goes wrong.' It urges British soldiers to give orders in a 'firm, military manner' as the German civilian is 'used to it and expects it'. It adds: 'It is important that you should be smart and soldierly in appearance and behaviour. The Germans think nothing of a slovenly soldier.' British soldiers help clear the rubble in front of the Reichstag building in Berlin, in 1948 . The book is full of warnings and advice for British soldiers in Germany. There is a strong emphasis on appearance and the need to look smart. One passage says: 'The Germans adore military show. It's important that you should be smart and soldierly in appearance as the Germans think nothing of a slovenly soldier.' On Hitler, it remarks: 'Hitler's aim was to terrorise the German people so that no one would dare resist him by deed or word. 'Woven into Hitler's doctrine are many deep-seated German ""complexes"", such as hatred of the Jews, a desire to domineer over others and a readiness to believe that they themselves are being persecuted.' In the passage on the condition of the German people it warns 'you will find a war area of bleak poverty and devastation. During the war, their rations have been a good deal lower than ours and they have had much less meat, bread and milk and the quality of the food was inferior.' Commenting on German culture, it says: 'Germans don't know how to make tea, but they are quite expert with coffee.' On alcohol it says: 'Whiskey and gin will be scarce and of poor quality but there are many kinds of spirits called Schnaps. The cheaper sorts are guaranteed to take the skin off one's throat. Go easy on Schnaps.' In a passage on sport, it says: 'Football is the most popular game but is played less vigorously than in Britain. Charging is regarded as foul play.' British soldiers are also told to take caution when mingling with 'attractive' German women. It says: 'Don't be too ready to listen to stories told by attractive women. They may be acting under orders.' In the section called 'What the Germans are like?' it explains that the Germans are bigger and fleshier. 'There are fewer of the wiry type and more big, fleshy, fair-haired men and women, especially in the north.' In the section called 'What the Germans think of us', it says they 'admire the British' and that 'even Hitler had a grudging respect for us'. In particular, it says they admire the British national values of 'imagination, enterprise and tough endurance.' Not surprisingly perhaps, the book was concerned that some soldiers 'may be tempted to feel sorry' for the Germans and stated: 'There will be no brutality about a British occupation, but neither will there be softness of sentimentality. The book, originating from the Ministry of War, was re-released in English some years ago as a novelty and picked up by a German publisher Helge Malchow. Following a post-war gap in the collective consciousness, where the younger generation's interest was blocked by their elders' shame about what had happened, Germans are now more interested than at any other time.

"Last month he said that an 'Iraq first' attack was the best means to combat ISIS, but Obama has reportedly developed a new strategy to defeat the al Qaeda splinter group - starting with the removal of Syrian President Bashar al Assad. Senior White House officials have told CNN that the national security team has met four times, including one meeting chaired by Obama, to orchestrate the new strategy. The U.S. and many of its allies see President Assad as the reason ISIS have been able to gain strength in Syria. Obama's initial approach was to fight ISIS on the ground in Iraq while the government put together their own rebel force that could go after the group. Scroll down for video . Turnaround: Obama has reportedly been forced to overhaul his strategy on how to deal with ISIS following much criticism, changing from fighting them on the ground in Iraq to removing Syrian President Bashar al Assad (left) However  the White House has subsequently run out of time, CNN reported. 'The long running Syria problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat (ISIS), we need not only a defeat in Iraq but a defeat in Syria,' the senior sources told CNN. 'Developments on the ground have caused the national security team to collectively conclude we may not have time for Iraq first. 'In an ideal world you would drive (ISIS) out of Iraq and pivot to Syria. 'But if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and (ISIS) is still there, that doesn’t help.' Embarrassingly, Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told CNN that the U.S. have not yet started preparing their Syrian opposition fighters, despite announcing the plan four months ago. The plan asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip the 5,000 vetted rebels over the space of one year - but nothing has been done. 'The vetting hasn't started,' Admirable Kirby said.

"The chief of UN observers in Syria has said their mission is being suspended because of escalating violence in the country. Major General Robert Mood said that the continued bloodshed is posing significant risks to the observers during patrols and is impeding their ability to carry out their mandate. The announcement comes as opposition activists claimed 12 people were killed in the Syrian capital Damascus after shelling by government troops. Mission suspended: UN observers in Syria are to remain in their present locations and undertake no more patrols until further notice, said Major General Robert Mood, the chief of the mission . Most of the deaths occurred overnight in the suburb of Douma, where regime forces were said to have fired mortars that struck a residential building, killing eight people. Douma-based activist Mohammed Saeed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a further four people were killed in the shelling of Arbeen and Tall suburbs. 'The regime is trying to purge the suburbs of the capital of all resistance,' Mr Saeed said. He said the fire on the suburbs was indiscriminate and that a man, his wife and their child died when a mortar shell hit their apartment in Arbeen. Mr Saeed said UN observers deployed in Syria to monitor the cease-fire, which never really took hold, have not been to Douma in over a week. 'But anyway, all they can do is record what they see, they cannot help,' he said.

There are nearly 300 UN monitors currently in Syria. After today's announcement by Major General Mood they will stop conducting patrols and stay in their locations 'until further notice'. The move to stop patrols is the latest sign that a peace plan brokered by international envoy and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is disintegrating. Major General Mood had said yesterday that an increase in bloodshed is derailing the mission. 'Violence over the past 10 days has been intensifying willingly by the both parties, with losses on both sides and significant risks to our observers,' he told reporters in Damascus. Human cost: A Syrian man carries a wounded girl next to Red Crescent ambulances following an explosion that targeted a military bus near Damascus's Qudssaya nieghbourhood . He also said there was a concern among the states that provide the observers that the risk is approaching an unacceptable level - suggesting the violence could prompt the observers to pull out of the country at some point. Western powers have pinned their hopes on the Annan plan, in part because there are no other options on the table. There is little support for military intervention, and several rounds of sanctions have failed to stop the bloodshed. Activists claim some 14,000 people have been killed since the uprising against president Bashar Assad began in March 2011. The uprising began as a largely peaceful protest movement but has since escalated into an insurgency seeking to topple the regime.","Kofi Annan ceasefire plan disintegrating as 'both sides escalate violence'

"Circumcision before the age of five can double a boy's risk of developing autism, controversial research suggests. Scientists believe the finding may be linked to stress caused by the pain of the procedure. The study of more than 340,000 boys in Denmark found that circumcision raised the overall chances of an autism spectrum disorder before the age of 10 by 46 per cent. But if circumcision took place before the age of five it doubled the risk. Circumcision also appeared to increase the likelihood of boys from non-Muslim families developing hyperactivity disorder. Regardless of cultural background, circumcised boys may run a greater risk of developing autism and ADHD, a study has claimed . The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, examined more than 340,000 boys born in Denmark between 1994 and 2003. At the age of nine, their health was tracked - and almost 5,000 cases of ASD were diagnosed. Professor Morten Frisch of the Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, who led the research, said: 'Our investigation was prompted by the combination of recent animal findings linking a single painful injury to lifelong deficits in stress response...and a study showing a strong, positive correlation between a country's neonatal male circumcision rate and its prevalence of ASD in boys. He added: 'Today it is considered unacceptable practice to circumcise boys without proper pain relief. 'But none of the most common interventions used to reduce circumcision pain completely eliminates it and some boys will endure strongly painful circumcisions.' The study goes on to discuss how painful experiences in babies have been shown - both in animal and human studies - to have a long-term effect on pain perception. This is a characteristic often encountered among children with autism, they add. There is clear scientific evidence that the benefits of circumcision outweigh the risks, a landmark report has declared. A debate has long raged over the ethics of the procedure - and some men believe it has affected their sexual function or satisfaction. But U.S. officials have now said the medical evidence supports having the procedure. The announcement came in new long-awaited draft guidelines released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This is the first time the U.S. Government has released such a report on circumcision, where the foreskin around the tip of the penis is cut away. While the guidelines stop short of telling parents to get their newborn sons circumcised, they are very clear on the health advantages. Professor Frisch said: 'Given the widespread practice of  circumcision in infancy and childhood around the world, our findings should prompt other researchers to examine the possibility that circumcision trauma in infancy or early childhood might carry an increased risk of serious neurodevelopmental and psychological consequences. However experts have urged caution over the findings. Professor Jeremy Turk, Consultant Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist at Southwark Child & Adolescent Mental Health Neurodevelopmental Service, said: 'The findings of this research, while interesting, need to be considered carefully - one cannot draw very strong conclusions from the data. 'This is not a causal study, but instead compares data sets and looks for correlations. 'While this is a valid way of doing a study, it means that we must be careful about any implications. 'For example, many cases of autism are missed until children are older and as there are relatively few cases of autism this could easily skew the data. 'Furthermore, there are many potentially confounding variables which could explain raised ASD rates, which the authors do not explore or account for. 'Finally, I have some issues with the premise in that their speculations regarding early pain as a cause of autism are, to say the least, highly speculative. And Dr Rosa Hoekstra, lecturer in psychology at the Open University, said: 'I think this is an extremely speculative study. 'The study is purely based on register data and takes a registered autism diagnosis at face value, without considering cultural or social factors affecting the likelihood of an (early) autism diagnosis. The researchers suggest the pain caused by circumcision may be partly to blame, in turn affecting how the brain develops and reacts to stress . 'Even in a high income country like Denmark not all children with autism are detected and given a suitable autism diagnosis at an early age (the age under study in this paper). She added: 'An entirely different but in my view much more plausible explanation is as follows: Boys with symptoms of autism who undergo circumcision by a medical professional may have their symptoms recognised as autism more often, and at an earlier age, than boys who are not circumcised and who may therefore fly under the radar of medical professionals. 'In other words: the detection rate of autism (rather than the risk of autism per se) may be higher in boys seeing a medical professional for circumcision. Professor David Katz, from University College London, who chairs Milah UK, a body that speaks for the Jewish community on issues related to circumcision, said: 'This report is far from convincing: correlation does not equal causation. 'There is a long history of attempts to link autistic spectrum disorders to unrelated practices, such as the measles/mumps/rubella association, which proved to be fraudulent. He added: 'There is general agreement that in people suffering from an ASD there are abnormalities that can be identified in brain structure and/or function. 'There is a strong genetic component, which may be a factor within the faith communities studied here, and which does not appear to have been explored amongst them. 'Some contemporary research does indicate that factors besides the genetic component are contributing to the increasing occurrence of ASD. 'For example, a variety of environmental toxins have been invoked to explain why these conditions are more prevalent today than they may have been in the past - but again proof of causation is lacking, and these factors are only likely to be relevant in those who are already vulnerable to them.' Applied statistician Professor Kevin McConway, from the Open University, said: 'This study raises an interesting question, but one that cannot be fully answered with these data.'","The findings hold regardless of cultural background, say researchers .
They suggest the pain caused by circumcision may be partly to blame .

"Footage emerged that casts doubt on George Zimmerman's version of events in the shooting of Trayvon Martin could be used as evidence if the gunman is prosecuted. In the video, filmed shortly after the unarmed teen was killed, Zimmerman is seen emerging from a police vehicle with his hands cuffed behind his back as he is frisked and led into questioning by officers. Despite his lawyer’s account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video shows no injuries consistent with his description. Sources have told ABC News that the video could be used as evidence if Zimmerman is brought to trial over his role in the shooting. The news comes as the funeral director who handled Martin's body has revealed the teenager did not look as though he had been in a fight. Scroll down for video . Cuffed: George Zimmerman, in red jacket, is escorted into the Sanford police station following the shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26 . Sceptical: Funeral director Richard Kurtz said Trayvon Martin showed no signs of having been in a fight . Richard Kurtz told CBS News that as he prepared Martin's body for burial he did not notice injuries which would suggest that he had been involved in a fight, as Zimmerman has insisted. 'We could see no physical signs like there had been a scuffle, there had been a fight,' Mr Kurtz said. 'The hands - I didn't see any knuckles, bruises or what have you. And that is something we would have covered up if it would have been there.' He concluded: 'The story does not make sense, that he was in this type of scuffle, of fight.' Footage: In this video provided to ABC News, George Zimmerman is seen being led out of a police car shortly after the shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Evidence: George Zimmerman is seen emerging from a police vehicle with his hands cuffed behind his back as he's frisked and led away by officers . Doubt? Despite his lawyer's account that Zimmerman was knocked down and suffered a broken nose in a scuffle with Martin, the video shows no injuries consistent with his description . Trayvon's parents Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin told CNN’s Piers Morgan that the video footage of Zimmerman proves 'what they have known all along'. Ms Fulton told Morgan: 'We just looked at the video and we were just surprised because according to the police report, he sustained injuries, but when we looked at the video, it was obvious that there were no visible injuries. [there was no] blood on his shirt.' She later added: 'I believe that this video is the icing on the cake'. The family's lawyer, Benjamin Crumb, told Morgan that the footage proves that the Sanford Police Department 'conspired to cover this up'. Zimmerman, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, told police that he spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighbourhood and called 911 to report a suspicious person. 'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle. He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call. But Trayvon, 17, was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother. Dispute: A national outcry has many demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman, . right, in the killing of Trayvon . Martin (left) Protests: The killing of Trayvon Martin has sparked numerous demonstrations across the country, like this one in front of the White House . A student who drew a 'racist' cartoon featured in a college newspaper that suggested Trayvon Martin's death has been hyped up by the media has left the publication. Stephanie Eisner, cartoonist at The Daily Texan at the University of Texas, said in a statement on Thursday that she no longer worked for the newspaper following her depiction of the media attention surrounding the death of the 17-year-old boy. None of the newspaper's editorial board members, who approved the cartoon, have said that they will step down. Eisner's cartoon sparked outrage by misspelling the gunned down teen's name and referring to Trayvon as 'colored.' In the illustration, a woman wearing glasses sits on a chair called 'The . Media' holding a book called 'Treyvon Martin and the case of yellow . journalism.' She is seen telling a young boy: 'And then…  the Big Bad White man killed the Handsome, sweet, innocent, colored boy!!' Eisner said she wanted to criticise the media's coverage rather than Trayvon. She initially told the publication: 'I feel the news should be unbiased. And in the retelling of this particular event, I felt that that was not . the case.' In her apology, she said it was 'in hindsight an ambiguous cartoon related to the Trayvon Martin shooting'. The newspaper's editorial adviser, Doug Warren, admitted the cartoon . should have spelled the teen's name correctly and not used the word . 'colored'. But he said the cartoon was not inherently racist. A neighbour said there had been several . break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which . burglars took a TV and laptops. A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out. Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked. But Trayvon's girlfriend Deedee, 16, who was on the phone with Trayvon in his last moments alive, emerged Wednesday to add more contradiction to Zimmerman's story. She told ABC News in a brief interview that Trayvon said he saw a strange man following him as he walked back to his father's home. '... and then Trayvon come and said the man was still behind him and I said to him, ""Run!""' the teen said. He and Martin fought, according to witnesses. Zimmerman said Martin punched him in the nose and slammed his head against the ground. Zimmerman’s father Robert Zimmerman echoed those remarks on Wednesday night, telling WOFL-TV his son was being beaten by Trayvon, and the teen threatened him during the scuffle. He told the network: 'Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of ""you're going to die now or you're going to die tonight,"" something to that effect'. He added: ‘[Martin] continued to beat George and at some point, George pulled his pistol and did what he did’. Zimmerman told cops he acted in self-defense, and that he had yelled for help before firing the gun. Police said Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose and the back of his head. But the surveillance video shows no injuries consistent with that type of trauma. Additionally, Richard Kurtz, the funeral director who handled Trayvon's body, told CNN he saw no bruising on the teen's knuckles. 'I didn't see any evdience that he had been fighting anybody,' Kurtz said. In the police video, Zimmerman appears calm as his pockets are checked and he’s led to a questioning room by three officers. In an appearance on MSNBC’s . PoliticsNation on Wednesday night, the mother of a witness in the case . said that she doesn't believe the account of Zimmerman's lawyer. When asked by host Al Sharpton if she believed Zimmerman acted in self-defence, Cheryl Brown answered: 'Not at all'. The . fact that he has not been arrested nor charged in the case has fuelled a . widespread outcry marked by protests, accusations of racism and demands . that Zimmerman be taken in.

"A hunstman trekking through remote Colorado woods stumbled across an unusual prey - a mini-forest of illegally-grown marijuana plants. The man made the find last Wednesday in the unincorporated Eagle County, some three hours' drive from Denver.

"She sells millions of records, is BFFs with Lorde and Selena Gomez, knows the best way to mend a broken heart and never looks less than perfect, is Taylor Swift fashion's new darling? ASOS magazine seems to think so. The high street glossy wanted to tap into the Taylor magic so invited the pop star to cover their New Year issue and gave her stylish new look. Shot in London, 24-year-old Taylor gives the lowdown on her life lessons, what she’s learned and her best kept wardrobe secrets. Scroll down for video . Style princess: ASOS magazine invited Taylor Swift to cover their New Year issue and gave her stylish new look . Although her ex-boyfriends reads like a roll call of Hollywood's hottest, when it comes to getting dressed, she doesn't do it for the men. Sharing her wardrobe secrets, she told the magazine: 'When I’m getting dressed, it’s always based on what my friend’s will think. They are my number one priority and the opinions of girls are more important to me at this point in my life.' Speaking about those friends, she adds: 'My friends are the kind of people that have their own lives, and their own busy schedules, and that’s why we get along so well. 'A lot of ""celebrities"" surround themselves with these very chic cling-ons who don’t really have much of a job or a passion, they follow around their celebrity BFF and provide constant affirmation for them and I’m really not interested in that kind of deal.' Opening up: Although her ex-boyfriends reads like a roll call of Hollywood's hottest, when it comes to getting dressed, she doesn't do it for the men and prefers to impress her female friends . Fashion's darling: Taylor, 24, has become something of a style chameleon in recent  months - and it's landed her the most glossy magazine covers . Clearly it's paying off. Taylor's latest album has totted up 2m in sales (and counting) and she even landed a glossy Vogue cover last month. As well as showcasing some serious sartorial prowess in recent months, Taylor has been experimenting with her beauty look, too. Perhaps she took some tips away from her covershoot for the fashion bible, where industry heavyweight Val Garland created her look. Speaking about her fresh-faced glow, Val said: 'Mario Testino wanted to find a new way of seeing Taylor, he wanted to express another aspect of her personality - something really fresh and spontaneous. 'Taylor has really gorgeous skin and these really sparkly eyes so I thought it would be great to play up her healthy complexion.' The starlet has even speaheaded a new hairstyle: the wob. According to celebrity hairstylist Julien Farel, the wavy hairstyle, which is favored by the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Beyoncé and Taylor, has seen many long-time fans of the lob giving their hairstyle an update and adding a bit of bounce and body in order to create a more modern and youthful look. 'There is a lot of sexy short hair on the red carpet now and I really adore it because it’s such a modern take on femininity,' the celebrity hair stylist and haircare creator told MailOnline. Fresh-faced: As well as showcasing some serious sartorial prowess in recent months, Taylor has been experimenting with her beauty look, too . So what is it about Taylor? Psychologist Linda Papadopoulos believes that much of Taylor’s appeal comes from the fact that she offers a change from over-sexualised stars such as Rihanna, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj. Stars who are as well known for dancing around in risque outfits as they are for their music. ‘I speak to a lot of young girls who don’t feel like they want to be that sexual and Taylor provides that alternative. ‘She bridges the gap. She says you can be sexy sometimes but you can also geek out and just have fun with your friends.’ Plus she works hard, ‘It also helps that she writes her own music. Young people are becoming incredibly savvy to the way in which in the music industry works and the smoke and mirrors but she has that authenticity. ‘You know you see some people telling young women to ""do this"" and ""do that"" but Taylor is just sharing her experiences. She’s very honest and open about that and that’s a lot of her appeal.’ Taylor recently announced her plans for a 1989 world tour. So far she has announced 57 dates across North America and Europe and she is set to perform live at the Victoria's Secret show in London next week.

"The man who is believed to have killed then dismembered his transgender wife in an horrific murder-suicide in a Brisbane apartment was secretly working as a male prostitute, it has emerged. Friends revealed the truth about Marcus Volke's double life and also criticised a Brisbane newspaper for its portrayal of victim Mayang Prasetyo. Interior designer Alex Devantier, who knew the couple well, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had never worked as a chef but used it as a cover story to avoid telling his family and close friends the truth about his life as Heath the male prostitute. Scroll down for video . Friends have revealed Marcus Volke (pictured here with Mayang Prasetyo) was a male prostitute, not a chef as previously reported . Mayang Prasetyo was found dismembered in a Brisbane apartment she shared with her husband on Saturday . Parts of Ms Prasetyo's body were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment . Ms Prasetyo, 27, was described as 'happy, cheerful person' and an 'angel' by friends. Mr Devantier said that the front page headline featuring the term 'shemale' was extremely offensive to both her and the transgender community. He asked The Courier Mail to donate profits from Tuesday's edition to the Gender Centre - a not-for-profit which raises awareness of transgender issues - and Ms Prasetyo's family. It comes as Queensland detectives appealed for friends and associates of the couple to come forward as police continue their investigation into the murder-suicide. 'We would like to make an appeal for anyone who may have known the couple – either individually or together, to contact police,' Detective Senior Sergeant Tom Armitt said. 'As part of our investigation, we would like to speak to either close friends or other associates of the pair – we would like to know the nature of their relationship with the couple, and gather information about how the couple interacted. 'This information is important in order to present a background about the pair's relationship and its dynamic to the Queensland Coroner.' Three days ago, parts of Ms Prasetyo's body were found strewn across the couple's Teneriffe apartment in Brisbane's inner-city, with some cooking in chemicals on a stove. Police arrived at the  couple's home after receiving reports from neighbours about a bad smell coming from the Commercial Road apartment on Saturday night, just weeks after they had moved to the Queensland capital. Volke fled the scene and was later found in an industrial bin with his throat cut in nearby Dath Street. It has also been revealed Ms Prasetyo travelled as a man named Febri Andriansyah on an Indonesian passport. Marcus Peter Volke, 28, slit his own throat as he fled the Brisbane apartment where he is believed to have dismembered his Indonesian wife . The 27-year-old was known as Febri Andriansyah, according to her Indonesian passport . Interior designer Alex Devantier said Volke and Ms Prasetyo married in Europe in August 2013 . Ms Prasetyo was apparently just months away from having an operation to become a woman . Volke and Ms Prasetyo met in 2009 while working at Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome . Ms Prasetyo is originally from Denpasar in Bali - the Indonesian holiday island - according to her Facebook page . Media outlets  have previously reported Volke was a chef who met Ms Prasetyo on an international cruise ship. 'They were leading double lives because of the lives they were leading,' Mr Devantier said. 'Marcus wouldn't even tell his closest friends of the life he was leading. 'They lied to their families, so their families didn't realise what they were actually doing.' In an online advertisement under the name Heath XL, Volke describes himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going'. The ad went onto to say: 'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more'. Media outlets have previously reported the 28-year-old was a chef and had met Ms Prasetyo on an international cruise ship . But Mr Devantier - who was close to the couple - has revealed Volke was a male prostitute . He worked under the name Heath and was registered as a private escort in Melbourne . Mr Devantier met Volke and Ms Prasetyo - who were married in Europe in August 2013 - four years ago in Melbourne and introduced them. He said the pair worked at Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome in 2009 and were employed there as escorts for about two months. 'Mayang left the agency because she was so popular that all the other transsexuals hated her and that's why she asked me to build her own website to get away from those who were jealous of her achievements,' Mr Devantier said. 'They both went into private escorting. I actually helped Marcus register as a private escort in Melbourne and then with his advertising.' Mr Devantier, from Townsville, said he was in shock over the tragedy. 'I still don't believe he [Volke] did it. I can't believe he did it. If he did do it, sometimes you can't judge it, you can't pick it,' Mr Devantier said. 'They were a loving and beautiful couple, and never a bad word from either of them about each other. 'I looked after Mayang's escort website and I was in communication with her all the time. 'There was never any hostility towards each other.' Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container on Monday, following the discovery of Ms Prasetyo's body parts found boiling in chemicals in a Brisbane apartment on Saturday night . Emergency services remove her body from the DoubleOne 3 Apartments in Commercial Road . Queensland Police made the grisly discovery of a woman's body parts just after 9pm on Saturday night . Officers have spent Saturday night at the two crime scenes trying to find out what led to the tragedy . Mr Devantier and Ms Prasetyo's other friends have called on The Courier Mail to donate its profits from Tuesday's edition which labelled the transgender escort as a 'shemale'. When he saw the front page of the News Corp newspaper, Mr Devantier said he was disgusted. He has asked for the donation to be made to the Gender Centre, which helps raise awareness of transgender, issues and Ms Prasetyo's family back in Indonesia for her funeral costs. 'We need to make the community aware of the difference between a post-op and pre-op transgender person, a transvestite, a cross dresser, et cetera,' he said. '[Ms Prasetyo's] family have just lost their sole source of income and money for putting the family's second eldest and third eldest child – both girls - through high school and that was who she was to them, the breadwinner.' Mr Devantier also urged people to a sign a change.org petition asking for The Courier Mail to 'publicly apologise for articles relating to Mayang Prasetyo'. At the time of publication, the petition had amassed more than 15,000 signatures. Mr Devantier said Ms Prasetyo - who was a pre-operation transsexual  - was months away from becoming a woman anatomically. 'She said she knew from 10 years old that she believed she was a woman and I believe she was not far from her goal – it would have been months,' he said. The grisly death is being treated as a murder-suicide after Volke fled the scene and was later found in an industrial bin with his throat cut .

"A multimillionaire New York real estate developer whose charred body was found in a gas station garbage bin was a 'slum lord' and 'loan shark' with a list of enemies 'a mile long,' police have revealed. Detectives attempting to track down the men who kidnapped and murdered Menachem 'Max' Stark Thursday night are learning that their task will not be easy - suspects include nearly all of his dozens of business associates and hundreds of tenants, according to authorities. 'Any number of people wanted to kill this guy,' a law enforcement source told the New York Post. 'He owed a lot of people money,' another source told the newspaper. Menachem 'Max' Stark (pictured) was murdered and his smoldering body found dumped at a Long Island gas station . Grief: Hundreds of mourners carry the coffin of Menachem Stark through the streets of Brooklyn during his funeral. Stark was a member of the ultra-Orthodox Satmar Hasidic sect, which separates itself from secular society and believes that Jews should not have a homeland in Israel until the arrival of the Messiah . Tradition: The funeral took place in Williamsburg just hours after Stark's badly burned body was found in a Dumpster on Long Island . Hundreds of members of a Hasidic . community gathered Saturday in Brooklyn, New York, for an emotional . funeral service honoring 39-year-old Stark, a father of eight. Somber . mourners dressed all in black came together at the Lodiner Bais . Medrash synagogue in Williamsburg to pay tribute to Stark, whose charred . remains were discovered in a Dumpster on Long Island Friday afternoon. Detectives investigating the case are finding a that Stark left a trail of unpaid contractors, ripped-off tenants and tens of millions in debts related to the 17 properties he owned in the Williamsburg and Greenpoint neighborhoods of Brooklyn, according to the Post. In 2008, he and his business partner defaulted on a $29million loan. His creditors were still pursuing legal action in federal court to recoup the losses. His tenants were also furious. His 17 buildings had received 233 complaints and 148  violations - 49 of which were still open. Many tenants told the Post his properties were infested with rodents, sometimes didn't have heat or water and had shabby interiors. 'I’ve had many conversations with him, and of course in many of those conversations I wanted to kill him myself,' Greg Hanlon, who lived in one of Stark's Greenpoint buildings, joked to the Post. In 2009, according to the newspaper, one of Stark's buildings was so rundown, the city ordered all tenants to vacate and deemed it no acceptable to live in. Kind words: Speakers talked about Stark's well-known generosity and readiness to help those less fortunate . Ritual: Eulogies offered at the Lodiner Bais Medrash synagogue were frequently interrupted by wailing from the overflowing crowd . Tenants were forced to track Stark down in order to get back the four-months deposit they had put down. 'He pretty much ripped off the whole building,' a tenant organizer, Ryan Kuonen, said. 'They kept trying to serve him, and he kept hiding from them. When he’d hear ""Are you Max Stark,"" he would take off running.' Said one detective working the case: 'He f***ed a lot of people over.' Some neighbors told police that he was also a neighborhood 'loan shark,' according to the Post. He lent thousands to friends and then demanded it back with interest. 'He's a scammer,' a source told the Post. In accordance with Jewish tradition, Stark's funeral service and burial took place just hours after police . identified the scorched body found at a Great Neck, New York, gas station as the missing real . estate developer who was forced into a van during Thursday's blizzard. During the ceremony, which was conducted in Yiddish and was frequently interrupted by ritual wailing, speakers described the father of eight as a pillar of the Satmar Hasidic community who was always ready to help the less fortunate with money for food and rent, The Jewish Daily Forward reported. A body was found at around 4pm Friday in Great Neck with extensive burns and Nassau County police have identified the remains as that of Stark, 39, who was kidnapped in Brooklyn during the blizzard that hit New York City. A police source told the New York Daily News that the victim was likely suffocated before his killers wrapped his body in fabric, stuffed him into a trash bin at a gas station and set fire to his corpse. Fernando Cerff, the owner of the Getty gas station on Cutter Mill Road, told the paper that Friday morning his workers were shoveling snow when they noticed smoke rising from the Dumpster. Thinking that someone had tossed a cigarette inside, they sprinkled some snow into the container. When Cerff approached the Dumpster in the afternoon, he noticed a horrible stench coming from the bin. Cerff became suspicious and called police, which immediately discovered the body amidst the trash beneath a layer of snow. This development comes as cops released dramatic surveillance footage that shows the suspects forcing Stark into a Dodge Caravan after he left his offices in Williamsburg late on Thursday evening. Hunt: Police are searching security camera footage for the suspects or car, circled . On Friday the family of Stark, 39, offered a $100,000 'no questions asked' reward for his safe return on Friday, as police combed through surveillance video that appears to show his abduction. Officers say the incident happened at around 11.20pm, when Stark was grabbed by two men on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg. Some reports suggest he was carrying $4,000 in cash. DNA Info . reported that Stark was approached and manhandled into a light-colored . van by two men as he left his office at Southside Associates at 331 . Rutledge Street. His wife, . Bashie, apparently became concerned when Stark did not return after . midnight and contacted Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the . Orthodox community. Surveillance . footage was then discovered in Stark's office that shows a struggle . with one man, before the van pulls up and he is wrestled by two men into . the vehicle. Investigations: The incident is being looked into by the police and the Shomrim, a neighborhood patrol group for the Orthodox community, who produced this report . Stark's brothers Yitzy and Yoely told the New York Post: 'We saw two people fighting with him, and they put him into a big white van, a Dodge Caravan,' Yitzy, 30, said. The brothers described Menachem's alleged attackers to the Post as 'big' and 'black.' The New York Daily News . reported that Stark was carrying $4,000 in cash, but Yitzy Stark denied . this when he offered the six-figure reward for his brother's return. 'We're . waiting for a phone call with demands. [We're] just hoping that he is . still alive,' Yitzy told DNA Info. 'We'll do anything they ask.' Shomrim . reportedly informed the NYPD of the incident at around 2.30 a.m. on . Friday. Both the police and the community are now looking for clues on . the white Dodge minivan. Officials spent the day in the local area conducting interviews and reviewing surveillance footage from local businesses. Scene: Stark was reportedly grabbed from outside his office on Rutledge Street in South Williamsburg, seen in this file photo . The Real Deal . claimed that Stark, and associate Israel Perlmutter, were being sued . more than $51 million in 2011, over loans for development projects in . Williamsburg and Greenpoint. And a number of tenants who claimed to . live in properties owned by Southside Associates have left a number of . angry complaints on sites such as Yelp about the condition and maintenance of the apartments, also describing Stark as a 'slumlord.' One . user wrote: 'These people are absolutely terrible. It's as though they . have no hearts and no compassion for anyone else. All they seem to care . about is their bank account.' Yitzy . Stark described his brother to the Daily News as 'a good man, a great . man.'

"With its wheels firmly held in place, a Mercedes-Benz prepares for transport aboard a cargo plane. In similar fashion, supercars ranging from Ferraris to Lamborghinis take to the skies each year as rich Arab playboys bring their vehicles from the Middle East to London, usually for just a few weeks over summer. The car owners, many of them from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait, will happily pay a small fortune - in excess of £20,000 for a return journey - for their metal marvels to be flown around 3,000 miles, and often leave them parked up on the streets of Knightsbridge. Qatar Airways is one such airline that ships the luxury cars from Doha to Heathrow. Secured to the floor of one of their Airbus A330s, the precious cargo can either be accommodated in a single row or in a side-by-side configuration.

Car owners from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait will happily pay a small fortune - in excess of £20,000 for a return journey - for their metal marvels to be flown around 3,000 miles, and often leave them parked up on the streets of London. At this week's Dubai Airshow, the Qatar Airways Cargo A330-200F freighter showed off its cargo-loading capabilities . Qatar Airways provided a demonstration using the latest from the Mercedes-Benz AMG product line of luxury automobiles . Daniel Hallworth, managing director of Dan Car Logistics, which specialises in air freight, told MailOnline: 'The Arabs often use agents to arrange their cars to be flown to the UK - and some of these guys can have two or three cars that they bring over for just one month. 'Once here, they can legally drive it for up to two months. 'A lot of them tour - so they may come to London for a bit and then truck their vehicle to much sunnier places like Marbella to extend their fun.' Mr Hallworth, whose company is based in Manchester, said that a car such as a Ferrari or McLaren can cost up to £5,000 to transport each way, while a Bugatti Veyron would be about £6,000 per journey.

"A high school has canceled the entire football season following 'significant and serious' allegations of harassment, intimidation and bullying. The Middlesex County Prosecutor said it was investigating a report that seniors on the Sayreville High School football team hazed freshmen in various forms - some of which could be considered sexual assault. One local official said these players were 'routinely taunted, bullied and intimidated by the older players, often with sexual overtones.' Scroll down for video . Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying' on the football team . The official also told ABC News, 'They would live in fear of seniors and juniors. They would race to the locker room to get changed and get out before the older kids got there.' This was all uncovered when a parent of one child notified authorities about what was happening at the high school. Superintendent Richard Labbe said there will be a criminal investigation as there is 'enough evidence to substantiate that there were incidences of harassment, intimidation and bullying'. He added that these incidences took place 'on a pervasive level, on a wide scale level and at a level which the players knew, tolerated and in general accepted'. 'Based upon that information, we are canceling the remainder of the football season for the freshman, the junior varsity and varsity football programs,' Supt Labbe said. According to CBS New York, Supt Labbe explained that the school first learned of the allegations last week through an anonymous allegation made to the Sayreville Police Department. 'They informed me that upon preliminary investigation, the matter in the incidents that occurred or that were alleged to have occurred, or were of such a serious nature that they were forced to turn the case over immediately to the office of the Middlesex County prosecutor,' he added. No players have been suspended and Supt Labbe would not comment on whether any personnel will be fired. He said canceling the season sends a clear message that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated. 'This district and this board of education is making a unified stance to say 'no.' No to bullying,' he said. Supt Labbe added that in addition to the criminal investigation, the high school is also investigating to see if similar behavior took place within any other sports. Speaking to CBS New York's radio channel, some parents claimed canceling the football program is not fair to innocent players. 'The students can't play, it's a ding on the entire community, it's a ding on the high school,' one parent whose son is on the team said. The Middlesex County Prosecutor said it was investigating a report that seniors on the Sayreville High School football team hazed freshmen in various forms - some of which could be considered sexual assault . 'For all of them, the ones who are innocent, to have this taken away from them. They're being punished for something they did not do,' another parent added. A number of commentators on Twitter seemed to agree . I feel bad for those Sayreville players,' one person wrote. 'I couldn't imagine having something I work so hard for be taken away because of others poor choices.' But others praised Sayreville's zero tolerance approach to bullying. One person wrote: 'I'm so proud the district took a MAJOR stand against bullying.' 'Was the only choice the program had.' another wrote. 'People didn't want to listen and thought the sport should win out. Safety is priority.' Sayreville High School's football team - which one of New Jersey's top programs having won three sectional titles in four year - has already forfeited multiple games amid the hazing accusations, . Meanwhile, police are investigating former assistant coach of the Sayreville High School football team Charlie Garcia on drug charges. Garcia, 38, resigned from his position at the school after he was found with more than two boxes of steroids and more than a dozen syringes during a traffic stop late last month. According to NJ.com, he was charged with third-degree illegal possession of steroids, possession of hypodermic needles, driving with an expired license, failure to signal a lane change and possession of a controlled dangerous substance in a motor vehicle.","Sayreville War Memorial High School in New Jersey cancelled their entire football season yesterday amid reports of hazing and bullying .

"David Dausey, a researcher at Mercyhurst University, says the US should close its borders to travelers from Ebola-afflicted nations . A top epidemiologist is speaking out to say the US must stop all commercial flights from Ebola-stricken West African nations in order to prevent more outbreaks on American soil. David Dausey, a Yale-educated academic who has been nationally recognized for his research on the spread of infectious diseases, says the bungling public health response to US Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan proves that the country cannot afford another case. Duncan had contact with 100 people in his short time in the US before he was admitted to a hospital. Nearly half of them are still under observation. Writing in the Washington Post, Dr Dausey argues: 'The human errors in this single case highlight why it is urgent that we ban all commercial flights from the impacted countries to all non-affected countries until the outbreak is contained.' Dr Dausey, the dean of the School of Health Professions and Public Health at Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, is one of the first experts to publicly call for the US to close its borders to West Africa. US officials have refused to close US borders to travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - the three countries where Ebola continues to spread like wildfire. On Friday, Centers for Disease Control director Thomas Frieden said closing to borders to West Africans would only make the Ebola outbreak worse by cutting off the supply of aide and strangling the local economies. No U.S. airlines fly to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea, but Brussels Airlines and other European carriers are still offering service from the West African capitals. Duncan flew from Monrovia, Liberia, to Brussels then boarded to United Airlines flight to Washington Dulles International Airport, where he was allowed to enter the country. He then flew to Dallas and days later began experiencing symptoms of Ebola. He is now in critical condition at a Dallas hospital. Congress is becoming increasingly uneasy with the open borders and lawmakers are beginning to make public calls to close US borders to travelers from the Ebola-afflicted nations. Dr Dausey argues that screening to prevent people infected with Ebola from coming into the country is inadequate. Currently, travelers are only screened in West Africa before they leave. Nearly 7,500 people have been infected with Ebola in West Africa and nearly 3,500 have died of the disease. The outbreak remains active only in Liberia (pictured), Sierra Leone and Guinea . Bungled response: Thomas Eric Duncan was sent home from the hospital when he was first admitted. Then, it took days for anyone to remove his infected garments from the Dallas apartment where he was staying . President Barack Obama announced on Monday that new measures would be installed to screen travelers fro Ebola before they enter the US. However, the disease has a 21-day incubation period, meaning that travelers who know they're infected could easily pass through security without showing any signs. Duncan is accused of lying to airport screeners in Monrovia and claiming he had no contact with anyone afflicted with the disease. Dr Dausey says this kind of behavior is only reasonable, given the dire situation at many hospitals in the West African nations, which are among the poorest in the world. 'If they stay in Africa, the probability that they will survive the illness if they have it is quite low. If they make it to the United States, they can expect to receive the best medical care the world can provide, and they will have a much higher probability of survival,' he writes. 'So they are motivated to lie about their exposure status (wouldn’t you, in their shoes?) to airlines and public health officials and travel to the United States.' Dr Dausey argues that commercial airlines aren't the only way to get aide into Liberia. The US military could easily transport supplies and people to the three nations and help contain the disease.","David Dausey, a Yale-educated disease researcher, has argued that the bungled handling of the Thomas Eric Duncan case proves the US must close its borders to keep Ebola out of the country .

"The spy chief: MI5 director-general Andrew Parker has blasted the Guardian's publication of Britain's espionage capabilities . A massive cache of  stolen top-secret documents published in The Guardian has handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists, the head of MI5 warned last night. In a blistering attack, Andrew Parker said the publication of confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden had caused huge ‘harm’ to the capability of Britain’s intelligence services. Security officials say the exposé amounts to a ‘guide book’, advising terrorists on the best way to avoid detection when plotting an atrocity. In Whitehall, it is considered to have caused the greatest damage to the Western security apparatus in history. In his first public speech since taking the job earlier this year, Mr Parker said the leaks handed the ‘advantage’ to terrorists and were a ‘gift they need to evade us and strike at will’. He said there were several thousand Islamist extremists living in the UK who ‘see the British people as a legitimate target’. The security services were working round the clock to stop the fanatics, but MI5 was now ‘tackling threats on more fronts than ever before’. Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, fled the US in May with thousands of classified documents about the NSA and GCHQ, which he gave to The Guardian. The newspaper has since published tens of thousands of words on the secret techniques used by GCHQ to monitor emails, phone records and communications on the internet. The first Guardian revelations came in early June, when it detailed how the NSA – which supplies intelligence to GCHQ, the organisation which gathers intelligence for MI5 and MI6 – had ‘direct access’ to the computer systems of AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Paltalk, Skype, Yahoo and YouTube. The newspaper also revealed how GCHQ has access to a network of cables carrying international phone calls and internet traffic and is processing vast amounts of ‘personal information’. By the time his identity as the source of the leaks emerged, Snowden had fled his home in Hawaii for Hong Kong. After a week in hiding, he travelled to Moscow, where he remains out of the reach of US authorities. The editor and the leaker: The Guardian's Alan Rusbridger and former NSA employee Edward Snowden . In August, police detained David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, for nine hours at Heathrow airport. Mr Miranda had been carrying intelligence files leaked by Snowden. At the time it emerged David Cameron had authorised the destruction of computers at The Guardian offices. Security concerns were so acute that Mr Cameron sent Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to demand that Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger destroy the files after warning they could fall into the hands of terrorists. Members of GCHQ supervised the smashing of laptops and hard drives at the newspaper’s offices. Mr Parker said: ‘What we know about the terrorists, and the detail of the capabilities we use against them, together represent our margin of advantage. That margin gives us the prospect of being able to detect their plots and stop them. GCHQ Headquarters. Thousands of classified documents about the NSA and GCHQ were published by The Guardian . MI5 Headquarters in London. The leak was described as the greatest damage to Western security apparatus in history . ‘But that margin is under attack. Reporting from GCHQ is vital to the safety of this country and its citizens. ‘GCHQ . intelligence has played a vital role in stopping many of the terrorist . plots that MI5 and the police have tackled in the past decade. ‘It causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques. Such information hands the advantage to the terrorists. 'It is the gift they need to evade us and strike at will. Unfashionable as it might seem, that is why we must keep secrets secret, and why not doing so causes such harm.’ In a wide-ranging speech to the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, Mr Parker said the task of MI5 was ‘getting harder’. He pointed to the danger posed by British nationals returning from fighting in Syria. In August, police detained David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, for nine hours at Heathrow airport. Mr Miranda had been carrying intelligence files leaked by Snowden . The spy chief said there is a 'growing proportion of groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to commit acts of terrorism'. Pictured is the 7/7 London bombings, which killed 52 civilians . Mr Parker said: ‘The ability of Al Qaeda to launch the centrally directed large-scale attacks of the last decade has been degraded, though not removed. ‘We have seen the threat shift more to increasing numbers of smaller-scale attacks and a growing proportion of groups and individuals taking it upon themselves to commit acts of terrorism. 'It remains the case that there are several thousand Islamist extremists here who see the British people as a legitimate target. Overall, I do not believe the terrorist threat is worse now than before. But it is more diffuse. More complicated. More unpredictable.’ Mr Parker also warned that, in some quarters, there could be an ‘alarming degree of complacency’ that MI5 and the police could foil all attacks. He said: ‘Terrorism, because of its nature and consequences, is the one area of crime where the expectation sometimes seems to be that the stats should be zero. Zero. Imagine applying the same target to murder in general, or major drugs trafficking. That is the stuff of “pre-crime” in the Tom Cruise movie, Minority Report.’ MI5 has attracted criticism for failing to stop individuals – including two of the July 7 bombers – who were on its radar. But Mr Parker, who replaced Jonathan Evans as director-general of the Security Service earlier this year, said: ‘With greater resources since 7/7 we have worked very hard to identify as many as possible of the people in the country who are active in some way in support of terrorism. ‘The idea that we either can or would want to operate intensive scrutiny of thousands is fanciful. This is not East Germany, or North Korea. Knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them.’ He also made the case for more powers to monitor emails and the internet. Mr Parker said: ‘Shifts in technology can erode our capabilities. There are choices to be made, including, for example, about how and whether communications data is retained. It is not, however, an option to disregard such shifts with an unspoken assumption that somehow security will anyway be sustained. It will not. We cannot work without tools.’ A Guardian News & Media spokesman said: ‘A huge number of people – from President Obama to the US Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper have now conceded that the Snowden revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue. ‘The President has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the US Congress and throughout Europe. Such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed. That is what journalism should do.’ Edward Snowden became one of the world’s most wanted men in early June when he broke cover as the agent who leaked top-secret documents from the US National Security Agency. His initial revelations detailed how the NSA harvested private information from the computer systems of companies including Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Skype and YouTube using a secret US surveillance programme called Prism. The Guardian then claimed the NSA supplied intelligence to GCHQ – accusing agents at the UK’s listening post of attempting to bypass UK law. The British spy agency compiled 197 . intelligence dossiers from the system in a single year, sidestepping the . need to obtain a court order. On June 18, the newspaper claimed UK intelligence agents hacked into the communications of politicians and senior officials from Turkey, South Africa and Russia during the G20 summit in London in 2009 – prompting a furious backlash ahead of the G8 meeting in Moscow. Snowden also revealed how GCHQ was able to hoover up vast amounts of personal information, including websites visited, emails sent and received, text messages, calls and passwords, using a state-of-the-art programme called Tempora. The surveillance operation centres on using probes to access a network of fibre-optic cables coming into and out of the country. Telecoms firms allegedly involved in Tempora include BT, Verizon and Vodafone Cable. The Guardian then revealed that the NSA was providing millions of pounds of funding each year to GCHQ to allow it to trawl for personal data. One document leaked by Snowden and dating from 2010 suggested GCHQ must ‘pull its weight’ to meet the NSA’s ‘minimum expectations’. Snowden also made the highly damaging revelation that the US government had hacked computers in mainland China and Hong Kong for years – threatening to consign relations between the  super-powers to the deep freeze. US intelligence chiefs responded to the leaks with fury. NSA director Keith Alexander told the US Senate the top-secret surveillance programmes had disrupted at least 50 terror plots. The Washington Post reported the NSA had acted illegally on ‘thousands’ of occasions over the harvesting of personal data, and Foreign Secretary William Hague was forced to the Commons to insist any suggestion the British intelligence agencies had colluded with the NSA to act outside the law was ‘fantastical’.","MI5 chief Andrew Parker called paper's expose a 'guide book' for terrorists .

"Snake bites just got a tiny bit less scary. A team of Australian scientists has developed a cutting-edge blood test that could dramatically reduce the time it takes to treat victims nipped by venomous reptiles. The researchers have worked out a way to determine if a person has poison in their system, allowing doctors to give antivenom much earlier than at present. Beating the bite: Australian scientists have developed a blood test that could dramatically reduce the time it takes to treat serious snake bites . Importantly, the test could protect people from irreversible nerve damage which results from a number of different types of snake bites. Medical guidelines say antivenom should be given only if a person has symptoms or has positive blood results. However, symptoms can take up to eight hours to appear, and the current blood test takes about 12 hours, says lead researcher Dr Kalana Maduwage of the University of Newcastle. Dr Maduwage says a one-hour bedside test could be available within a year. So far, his test detects venom from all poisonous snakes in Australia and New Zealand. The next step is to include all snakes in the world, says Dr Maduwage, who presented his research at a meeting of Australian Society for Medical Research in Sydney on Monday. Australia is home to most of the most dangerous snakes on the planet including the inland taipan and the notorious eastern brown snake. Untreated, bites from these snakes result in death up to 80 per cent of the time and can kill in hours.

"The Scouse Brow has been voted the worst female beauty sin, topping a list of crimes that includes foundation tidemarks, spidery eyelashes and caked-on powder. The dark, angular, pencilled-in brow look has been showcased over the years by Liverpool celebrities Coleen Rooney and Alex Curran - but has recently fallen out of favour as girls go for a more natural power brow look like Cara Delevingne's. The survey, which found that over-plucking the brows is almost as offensive as pencilling them in too strong, revealed also that women are harsher judges of each other's looks than they are of men's. WAGS Coleen Rooney and Alex Curran have both fallen victim to the so-called Scouse Brow in the past - a strong, dark, angular pencilled-in brow . The study found that 78 per cent of . women would negatively judge a woman with badly applied make-up, and a . particularly disparaging 22 per cent would even refuse to socialise with . women who happened to be poorly presented.

"The U.S. Air Force is developing tiny unmanned drones that will fly in swarms, hover like bees, crawl like spiders and even sneak up on unsuspecting targets and execute them with lethal precision. The Air Vehicles Directorate, a research arm of the Air Force, has released a computer-animated video outlining the the future capabilities of Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs). The project promises to revolutionize war by down-sizing the combatants. 'MAVs will become a vital element in the ever-changing war-fighting environment and will help ensure success on the battlefield of the future,' the narrator intones. 'Unobtrusive, pervasive, lethal - Micro Air Vehicles, enhancing the capabilities of the future war fighter.' Scroll down for video . Hovering: Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) are the future of the unmanned drones program, according to a new video from the Air Force. The Air Force has already developed a drone capable of hovering like a moth . Perching: The video, released by the Air Vehicle Directorate, shows a pigeon-like drone that can draw power from an electrical wire while its camera watches a target . Crawling: The drones will be equipped with legs so that they can crawl through tight spaces like an insect . The project, which is based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, was revealed in the March issue of the National Geographic magazine. Air Force officials said they have already produced tiny remote-control prototypes - but they consume so much power that can only operate for a few minutes. Researchers estimate that it will take several years of advances in battery technology to make the designs feasible. Still, the Air Force has a clear concept of what it hopes to accomplish with the program. The promotional video begins with a swarm of tiny drones be dropped on a city from a passing plane. The drones will work in concert to patch together a wide, detailed view of the battlefield - singling out individual targets without losing sight of the broader scene. 'Data will be communicated among the MAVs to enable real time, reliable decision-making and to provide an advanced overall picture for other platforms or operators,' the Air Force says. Killing: The video demonstrates how MAVs could be used to sneak up behind unsuspecting targets and kill them with a single, lethal shot . Lethal: The drones could be equipped with incapacitating chemicals, combustible payloads or even explosives 'for precision targeting capability' As the drones fall, they begin to fly - not like planes, but like insects. High frequency flapping wings allow the drones to hover and maneuver in tight spaces. The military has already produced a drone patterned after a hawk moth that can flap its wings 30 times a second. However, the activity exhausts the drone's tiny battery in just a few minutes, according to National Geographic. Another drone type soars like a pigeon and perches unobtrusively on a power line to observe a surveillance target with a camera. The Air Force is working on technology that will allow the drones to steal electricity from power cables and other sources - so they can continue to operate for days or weeks on end. Swarming: The drones couple be dropped en masse over a battlefield or a city and would work together to create a complex surveillance network . Working together: The drones would use advanced software to navigate by 'sight,' rather than GPS - which can be blocked by buildings or by jamming from the enemy . The Air Force training video shows a winged MAV following a target as he drives through the streets of a dense city. Advanced sensors will enable 'optic flow,' which will allow remote pilots to fly by 'sight' - rather than flying by GPS, which can be disrupted by buildings or deliberately jammed by enemy forces. The video depicts three drones following the target into a house, where they maneuver hallways and rooms undetected. 'Small size and agile flight will allow MAVs to covertly enter locations inaccessible by traditional means of aerial surveillance,' the narrator says. The video follows the drones as they fly through an open door and sneak up behind a man who is aiming a sniper rifle. 'Individual MAVs may perform direct attack missions and can be equipped with incapacitating chemicals, combustible payloads or even explosives for precision targeting capability,' according to the video. On screen, a small, hovering vehicle pauses before shooting the man directly in the back of the head.","Air Vehicles Directorate at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, is already developing prototypes of tiny drones that can hover .

"Gary Neville finds himself at the centre of controversy over approaching a player to join Salford City, the non-League team he co-owns with his Class of ’92 colleagues from Manchester United. Neville, who launches his takeover with brother Phil, Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes when the quintet and friends play a match against Salford on August 7, made a telephone call to Lee Gaskell, a prolific goalscorer for Northern League rivals Ramsbottom United. However, Gaskell, whose Ramsbottom side were promoted to the Evo-Stik League Premier, a division above Salford, decided not to move despite Neville’s intervention. Controversy: Gary Neville, pictured here receiving an honorary doctorate by the University of Salford, approached prolific striker Lee Gaskell of Ramsbottom United in an attempt to entice him to Salford City, the Northern Premier League club he owns with fellow Class of '92 members . Takeover: Members of the Manchester United Class of '92 squad (from left) Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes have taken over Salford FC. David Beckham (far right) isn't involved with the club . Ramsbottom manager Anthony Johnson said: ‘Lee told us he’d had a call from Gary Neville. We assumed he’d been picked for England. Lee could easily have had his head turned when someone so well known gets involved. ‘We were surprised as it’s not the way we’re used to doing business at this level of the game. Managers phone each other and ask to speak to players and Phil Power, the Salford manager, told us he knew nothing about Neville’s intervention. But thankfully Lee prefers to stay with us and play at a higher level next season.’ A spokeswoman for the Class of ’92 said Neville, who hadn’t talked money, only contacted Gaskell as he knows the family through Gaskell’s mother working for United at their Carrington training ground. Gaskell would earn less than £100 a week expenses with Ramsbottom, but Salford strongly dispute claims that they will be buying their way into the Football League. Louis van Gaal, the new hardline manager of Manchester United, has made it clear on the pre-season trip to the United States that once the programme for the day has been rubber-stamped by him it cannot be altered.

Weightlifting has been responsible for more drug offences than any other Olympic or Commonwealth Games disciplines yet when asked how much longer it can remain a core event of the Games, Hooper gave his eulogy while also praising the anti-doping programme.

"Horrifying footage has emerged of police officers standing by while Burmese Buddhist rioters set fire to a Muslim man. The video was largely filmed by police in the city of Meiktila during intense clashes between a gang of Buddhists known as the '969 squad' and Muslims last month which left 43 people dead. In the grainy footage posted on the internet a man -  almost certainly a Muslim - is seen rolling around on the . ground in agony after being set alight by an angry mob. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Scroll down for video . Agony: A horrifying moment in the clip is when a man, almost certainly a Muslim, is seen rolling around on the ground having been set alight . Slow death: His body is charred, but he is still alive and moves helplessly as a crowd surrounds him and several policeman watch . Slow death: Buddhists with sticks are . His body is charred, but he is clearly still alive and moves slowly as a crowd surrounds him. Several policeman can be seen looking on. A voice can be heard calling for water, to which another voice replies ' No water for him. Let him die.' The clip surfaced today as Human Rights . Watch published a report which concluded Burmese authorities and members of . Arakanese groups have committed crimes against humanity in a campaign . of ethnic cleansing Muslims. The sectarian violence, the worst seen in Asia's fledgling democracy since last year's conflict, was sparked after an argument between a Muslim gold shop owner and his customers in the city of Meikhtila. Anti-Muslim followers are known as the . '969 squad' and hand out stickers printed with the number '969', which . symbolise elements of Buddhism. Cornered: After a Muslim district is set on fire people are seen fleeing the fire into the bushes, but a young Muslim man is forced into the open . Beating: The rioters can be seen chasing a man wearing black through the long grass and hitting him with sticks . Slaughter: He is pushed on to the ground before a savage blow with a sword strikes him and he is left on the ground, presumed dead . Burma is a mainly Buddhist country, but 8- 9 per cent of its 60 million people are Muslim. There is an open resentment of Muslims, openly expressed and they are referred to with the derogatory term 'kala.' Ashin Wirathu is a firmly anti-Islamic monk who was jailed in 2003 for inciting anti-Muslim violence. He was released last year as part of the broader amnesty for prisoners and admitted being at Meiktila, although insists he played no part in the violence. 'We Buddhist Burmese are too soft,"" he told the BBC in an interview.  'We lack patriotic pride. He urges Buddhists all over the country . to boycott Muslim businesses and hands out stickers printed with the number '969', which symbolise elements of Buddhism, . Wirathu accuses Muslim men of repeatedly raping . Buddhist women, of using their wealth to lure Buddhist women into . marriage, then imprisoning them in the home. But it seems a fear of Muslim success is driving the discrimination. 'They - the Muslims - are good at business, they control transport, construction. Now they are taking over our political parties. If this goes on, we will end up like Afghanistan or Indonesia,' he said. In the grainy clip Buddhist men can be seen looting and attacking the gold shop in the town while police stand by, clearly outnumbered by the crowds - a few monks can also be seen in the angry masses. The tension escalated after a Buddhist monk was attacked after being pulled off a bike - he died later in the town hospital. The next morning a Muslim district  in Mandalay is seen burning - riot police are deployed, but again they stand watching. People are seen fleeing the fire into the bushes, but a young Muslim man is forced into the open. He is pushed on to the ground and beaten with sticks before a savage blow with a sword strikes him and he is left on the ground, presumed dead. As a consequence of the violence a Muslim community that dates back many generations has been wiped out. The unleashing of ethnic hatred, suppressed during 49 years of military rule that ended in March 2011, is challenging the reformist government of one of Asia's most ethnically diverse countries. Jailed dissidents have been released, a free election held and censorship lifted in Myanmar's historic democratic transition. But the government has faced mounting criticism over its failure to stop the bloodshed between Buddhists and Muslims. Hundreds of Muslims fled their homes to shelter at a sports stadium, said local officials. The . unrest is a bloody reprise of last year's violence in Rakhine State in . western Myanmar, which officially killed 110 people and left 120,000 . people homeless, most of them stateless Rohingya Muslims. Locals . complained there were too few police in this city of about 180,000 . people to subdue the unrest. Human Rights Watch said today that forces were complicit in disarming Rohingya Muslims of makeshift weapons and standing by, or even joining in, as Rakhine Buddhist mobs killed men, women and children in June and October 2012. The human rights abuses took place in Myanmar despite widespread political, social and economic reforms by a quasi-civilian government that took power in March 2011 and convinced the West to suspend most sanctions to allow aid and investment into one of Asia's poorest countries. 'While the state security forces in some . instances intervened to prevent violence and protect fleeing Muslims, . more frequently they stood aside during attacks or directly supported . the assailants, committing killings and other abuses,' the report said . of the unrest, in which at least 110 people died. Sparked: The sectarian violence was sparked after an argument between a Muslim gold shop owner and his customers in the city of Meikhtila . Violence: Anti-Muslim protestors are known as the '969 squad' and hand out stickers printed with the number '969', which symbolise elements of Buddhism . Powerless: Police are seen in the video hopelessly outnumbered by the angry mob . The failure to investigate properly or punish state officials had emboldened those behind campaigns against Muslims elsewhere, said Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director at HRW, referring to violence in central Myanmar that killed more than 43 people in March and displaced at least 12,000. 'People are allowed to incite and instigate in a coordinated campaign - this is the lesson taken in by others,' Robertson told Reuters. 'What happened in Arakan (Rakhine) has helped spark radical anti-Muslim activity.' Ye Htut, a presidential spokesman and Myanmar's deputy Minister of Information, dismissed the report for only taking news from 'one side' in a statement on his Facebook page. 'Its words are unacceptable. The government of Myanmar is not going to give any special consideration to a one-sided report,' he wrote, adding that the government would only pay heed to its own investigative commission set up after the initial violence in June. Violence: Unrest between Buddhists and Muslims in central Myanmar has reduced neighbourhoods to ashes . Side-by-side: Burma is a mainly Buddhist country, but 8- 9 per cent of its 60 million people are Muslims . Devastation: Burnt out houses are a symbol of the violence which unfolded between Buddhists and Muslims . Panic: Rumours that violent agitators were heading for the city had set its Muslim community on edge . A decision expected on Monday by the European Union to lift all but its arms embargoes would only weaken the hand of Western powers seeking to clean up Myanmar's poor human rights record, Robertson said. 'They're going to be hostage to what the military and government does,' he said. 'They're not going to have the kind of leverage and capacity to push back on the government if it becomes more oppressive.' The report into the Rakhine state violence, which called for international pressure on the government, said authorities had blocked aid from going into the squalid camps occupied by stateless Rohingya and Kaman Muslims, exposing them to malnourishment and diseases such as cholera or typhoid. Robertson described the segregation of Muslims as 'ghettoisation' that left them vulnerable to abuse. More than 120,000 people fled arson and machete attacks in Rakhine state and thousands have embarked on perilous journeys on rickety wooden boats to other countries, where they are prey to human trafficking gangs. An estimated 800,000 stateless Rohingyas live in Myanmar, where the authorities restrict their movements and access to employment and consider them illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.","The video was largely filmed by police in the town of Meiktila, Burma .

"It took Graham Hughes nearly four years to cover 201 nations to become the first person to travel the world without flying. Now fans can undertake the same journey in only four minutes without needing to leave the house. The 33-year-old from Liverpool used . buses, taxis, trains and his own two feet to travel 160,000 miles in . 1,426 days - all on a shoestring budget of just $100 (£65) a week. Scroll down for video . Graham Hughes' madcap trip around the world has been edited into four short minutes - starting with Brazil . His mission began in South America, taking in Guyana along the way . Hughes' job of editing the footage was made a little easier by the fact that he remembered to film himself saying where he was - seen here on the Caribbean leg in Antigua . Hughes filmed his travels for a documentary after setting off from his hometown on New Year's Day 2009. By December last year, he crossed the border into the newly-created South Sudan and cracked open the champagne to celebrate completing his mission. Now he's edited days of footage into a whirlwind tour of the globe, taking in one nation every second. Handily, Hughes filmed himself announcing where he was for his tour diaries, making his task of including every stop a little easier - even if he did forget Malta on his first attempt. A whistlestop visit to Guinea-Bissau happened on his way from The Gambia to Senegal, where he made it through four African countries in noe day . The Liverpudlian adventurer filmed himself in front of the sign marking the Zimbabwean border . The 1,426-day journey started in Uruguay and ended with its 201st nation, South Sudan . The video sees him posing in the sunshine of South America and the Caribbean, wrapped up warm in Canada, and even pretending to be under arrest by locals in the South Pacific island of Vanuatu. In almost every shot he wears his trusty fedora hat, while his beard ranges from neatly trimmed, to bushy and even a handlebar moustache for his visit to Papua New Guinea. Without planes, some of the nations were harder to reach than others - but not the ones you might expect. Hughes, who has raised nearly £9,000 for WaterAid so far, said it was easier to get into North Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan than it was to reach remote islands such as Nauru in the South Pacific, the Maldives and the Seychelles. Despite going off the typical backpacker's trail for much of his trip, Hughes still found time to fit in a wonder of the world by visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt . In Bangladesh, Hughes proved he was really there by holding up local currency . Hughes also filmed some of the people he met on his travels, including this woman in the Philippines . It took seven attempts to get into the Seychelles because of the threat from Somali pirates. He mainly crossed the seas by hitching lifts with cargo ships but struck lucky on the way to the Dominican Republic when a cruise ship let him come aboard. Hughes spent four days 'crossing open ocean in a leaky boat' to reach Cape Verde from Senegal without any means of communications. He was jailed for a week in the Congo for being a 'spy', was arrested trying to 'sneak into' Russia and had to be 'rescued from Muslim fundamentalists by a Filipino ladyboy called Jenn'. For his visit to Papua New Guinea, Hughes showed off an impressive handlebar moustache . Hughes also shows himself receiving a warm welcome in the Pacific island nation Vanuatu . The end! South Sudan didn't exist as a country when Graham Hughes set off in January 2009, but he crossed its border in December last year and toasted the end of his challenge . His favourite place was Palau, an island state in the Western Pacific. Other highlights included dancing with the Highlanders of Papua New Guinea, befriending orangutans in Borneo, riding through the badlands of Kenya on an 18-wheel truck, meeting the Prime Minister of Tuvalu - and 'warning schoolchildren in Afghanistan about the dangers of men with beards'. Graham Hughes visited 201 nations, including the 193 members of the United Nations, Taiwan, Vatican City, Palestine, Kosovo, Western Sahara and the four home nations of the United Kingdom. Territories are marked with a 'T' before the number. The countries are listed in the order they appear in the video, not in the order he visited.

"Boasts: Jihadists fighting with terror squads in Iraq are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics, such as British IS fighter Reyaad Khan seen posing with a man tied to railings . British jihadists fighting with terror squads in Iraq are using social networking sites to lure young Muslim teenagers from the UK into joining the Islamic State fanatics. The extremists, who boast of ‘slaughtering’ innocent Yazidis and ‘taking their women as slaves’, are advising 15-year-olds that they are ‘not too young’ to die fighting for Allah. Asked by a British 18-year-old girl if she is too young to join, one of them replied: ‘I know sisters younger than you. I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young.’ They are informing their British ‘brothers and sisters’ every day how to make their way to Iraq, claiming they are ‘ordered’ to defy their parents and fight jihad. After one British teenager wrote of having a ‘bad feeling I can’t hack it there and my family will want me to come back’, British jihadist Abu Farris replied: ‘We’re all bros here. Trust me, don’t be scared. 15-year-olds can hack it bro, so why can’t you. It is from Allah.’ And the chilling posts reveal they are advising them down to the smallest detail on how to prepare for travelling to the region – from where to get guns and bulletproof vests to what trainers they should bring and how to avoid being bitten by bugs at night. The revelations raise urgent questions for the security services over whether enough is being done to prevent the spread of radical Islamic  ideology among British teenagers. Young British Muslims are now known to be among the IS terror squads besieging the area around Mount Sinjar where thousands of refugees are trapped, the Mail can reveal. Intelligence officers have identified UK nationals as being part of the fanatical IS army that has swept across northern Iraq, carrying out a horrifying catalogue of medieval war crimes. Scroll down for video . Before they fled: Jihadists Reyaad Khan and Nasser Muthana (circled) hand out food to the needy in Cardiff last year. Both have been tweeting about their involvement with IS while on the front line . The . British IS fighters, who refer to themselves as the ‘Baadiya Boys’ after their original base in Syria, include Reyaad Khan and Nasser . Muthana, the 20-year-olds from Cardiff who notoriously featured in a . jihad recruitment video for the group. The former Catholic college students . have been joined on the frontline by young Muslim men and women from . across the UK, including a group of five friends from Portsmouth, two of . whom have already been killed. Using Twitter, social media site  Ask.fm and smartphone apps, the jihadists are posting disturbing updates on their progress. Uploads . have included pictures of mass executions, beheadings, child soldiers . and selfies with men captured and tied to railings in the oppressive . heat. A British girl who has gone to Syria also posted a picture of . herself in the area, wearing a niqab and with a gun by her side. Some of the British jihadists command followers to ‘make hijrah’ – an Arabic term meaning emigration. They boast about what weapons they are using and offer advice on how to get into Syria and where to buy guns. If those messaging them appear  serious about joining IS, they send private messages on mobile apps Kik and Surespot, which they claim are encrypted and impossible for authorities to monitor. It is thought about 500 British nationals have travelled to the region. United Nations War Crimes investigators said they are monitoring Islamic State online postings. A spokesman for Twitter declined to comment last night. Ask.fm and Kik were unavailable for comment. A spokesman for Surespot said: ‘Any technology has the potential for abuse by nefarious individuals. ‘For example, digital cameras can be used for child porn but they can also be used to take lovely pictures. Are we then to stop selling them? ‘In the same vein, are we supposed to give governments access to all of our private information?’ The Home Office said it is aware of the IS propaganda online and is working with social media companies to remove extremist material. A spokesman added: ‘We do not tolerate the existence of online terrorist and extremist propaganda. ‘We work with the internet industry to remove terrorist material hosted in the UK or overseas.’ One British fighter, Abu Farris, took to  the website Ask.fm – criticised for failing to crack down on harmful content – to convince radicalised youths to join him. Here are some  of his slang-filled posts from his question-and-answer session: . Q: Don’t you miss your mum? Why don’t you just be a British Muslim and live in peace?  A: Of course I miss my mum, I’ll see her in jannah [paradise] if Allah accepts me. Regardless of how we feel, its obligatory. This is more important than my family. Q: Since u left have ur family been more understanding or confused?  A: To be honest, my family think IS  are extreme. They think I was brainwashed. By the grace of Allah I’m not upset. I know that if Allah accepts me I’ll intercede for them and show them who was right on judgment day. Q: I have a bad feeling I can’t  hack it... A: Trust me, when ur here you will have ur brothers to talk to. Don’t be scared. 15-yr-olds can hack it bro, so why can’t you? Ask Allah for help. Q: How much British have  you met over there?  A: So many. Q: Would you advise people going over to learn Arabic first?  A: You’ll pick it up here inshallah [God willing]. You can even study here. Q: I’m 18. Do you know any  18-year-old sisters from the UK?  I think I am too young. A: I heard of maybe 16-year-olds being here from UK. You aren’t too young. Q: Do u find a spouse in advance?  A: There are bros here that wanna get married and sisters out there that wanna get married. Just find a bro or a sis, thru friends or however. Q: Are there gun stores there?  A: Yep, u can buy loads of stuff. Q: Are bulletproof vests hard to get where you are? Would a person be better buying it in Turkey and then crossing over with it?  A: You can buy it here easily, like any random military store in Raqqah u’ll find it.. they’re like $100. Q: Do you use night vision goggles?  A: Of course, we even have spy planes. Q: Are Nikes sufficient footwear? A: I brought one pair of Adidas high-tops. You’ll get what you need here. You won’t enter the battlefield unless ur kitted up and you have ammo etc. Q: Are there a lot of bugs there? Like if I’m sleeping, are they gonna crawl on me? Sorry if this is a weird question. May Allah reward you. A: Nope inshallah, you’ll be fine. Even  if there was bugs, there’s those  bug eliminators. It’s not bad, only thing is mosquitoes really. Q: Is there internet at your homes?  A: Sometimes your house can be  near an internet cafe so you can use internet from there. Q: Are there jobs to be an executioner, like when you  capture kuffar [non-believers]?  A: Yep. Q: How do you earn money?  A: We get ‘pocket money’ to spend, to look after your wife, buy some clothes etc.. they give us what’s necessary. Q: Do I need to do a front-flip  during training?  Nope, training here isn’t as hard as u think. It’s more psychological training, like mentally training you.","Extremists posting updates on Twitter, Ask.fm and smartphone apps .

"Lawsuit: Nancy Silberkleit, 59, of Archie Comics, claims Sam Levitin turned against her for rejecting his 'unwanted and improper sexual advances' The female CEO of Archie Comics, who has been accused of sexual harassment by five employees says she can't be guilty of the accusations - because her employees are all white men. Nancy Silberkeit argues in legal filings that the employees who are suing aren't from a 'protected class' of people - and therefore their claims of harassment aren't legally viable. Silberkeit is accused of repeatedly shouting 'Penis!' at the employees and also referring to them as the male organ instead of their names. She took over as co-CEO of the Westchester County, New York, comics company - which includes Archie, Jughead, Betty and Veronica - when her husband, co-founder Louis Silberkeit, died in 2008. She has been locked in a long-running legal battle over control of the company ever since - with employees accusing her of being mentally unstable and running the comic company into the ground. According to the New York Daily News, Silberkeit recently filed court documents that state: 'Plaintiffs fail to allege that any such comments were directed at any of the plaintiffs in particular, or they could cause extreme emotional distress even if they had been.' Among the employees suing her are Archie Comics president Mike Pellerito and Victor Gorelick, the editor-in-chief. Among the legal allegations that have flown back and forth between Silberkeit and the staff are claims that her liason to the company,  Sam Levitin, 73, turned against her for rejecting his ‘unwanted and improper sexual advances’. Popular series: Mr Levitin claims Mrs Silberkleit even once plotted to make Betty and Veronica - the love interests of the comic books' main character Archie Andrews - more provocative, court documents said . But Mr Levitin alleges in return that Mrs Silberkleit is ‘unstable’ and ‘will greatly damage the business’ if she remains in a position of power, reported the New York Daily News. He also claims she even once plotted to make Betty and Veronica - the love interests of the comic book’s main character Archie Andrews - more provocative, according to court documents. The long-running feud began last year when former schoolteacher Mrs Silberkleit - who took over the co-CEO position from her late husband Michael - made Mr Levitin her liaison. She needed his help as a ‘go-between’ in a court battle with Archie Comics Productions and her fellow CEO, Jon Goldwater - who wanted to fire her, reported the Daily News. They had alleged she was often unreasonable and would explode into tantrums - such as once surging into a meeting, shouting about male genitalia and storming back out again. But their relationship broke down last winter when he turned on her for rejecting his sexual advances, according to court papers filed at Westchester Surrogate’s Court in White Plains, New York. Headquarters: Archie Comics Productions is based at these offices (pictured) in Mamaroneck, New York . Mr Levitin threatened her and asked if she was intending to get breast implants, Mrs Silberkleit claimed, adding that he once warned her: ‘Mess with me, lady, (and) you’re playing with fire’. He admitted telling her she was ‘playing with fire’ when talking about rebranding the traditional characters of Betty and Veronica - but denied calling her ‘lady’, reported the Daily News. ‘Nancy is incapable of working with anyone,’ Mr Levitin said in an affidavit. ‘She lacks functional communication skills and has an unstable temperament.’ Mr Levitin and his lawyer did not return a request for comment, ACP said it was ‘not a party in the litigation’ and Mrs Silberkleit’s lawyer said the allegations against his client were ‘just not true.’ Gay wedding: Life With Archie #16 issue last year featured for the first time a same-sex wedding . The hit comic, which was first published in 1941 in 'Pep Comics', has sold more than 1.5billion and is published in a dozen foreign languages. The Life With Archie series - a spin-off from the original - follows the lives of the Riverdale High School students as they enter their 20s. In the original series, the characters were at high school and the comic itself is aimed at 16 or 17-year-olds, although many fans continue to read it into their 20s. In 2010, the Life With Archie series was revived as a magazine-sized comic devoted to stories that grew out of the main character's wedding to his high school sweethearts Veronica and Betty. Archie marries both in parallel universes, so readers get to enjoy two different storylines. One issue last year featured for the first time a controversial same-sex wedding between characters Kevin Keller and Clay Walker.","Co-CEO Nancy Silberkleit, 59, claims Sam Levitin, 73, turned against her .

Kendall, who cites 'ridiculously beautiful' Angelina Jolie, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Rihanna as her icons, was unveiled as the face of the beauty house last fortnight. It's the latest in a string of successes for the fledgling model, who revealed it has been her lifelong dream to break away from the show that propelled her to fame and cement her name as a model. It comes as Karl Lagerfeld, the industry's most esteemed designer, revealed that Kendall has been chosen as the face of his SS15 campaign. According to WWD, the 19-year-old joins fellow Lagerfeld favourites Sasha Luss, Ming Xi and Baptiste Giabiconi in the campaign, which has already been shot at his Paris studio. So, could a Chanel campaign be next on the cards for the burgeoning star? Kendall is no stranger to the prestigious French fashion house and has already walked in Lagerfeld's shows. If she does land the glossy campaign, she will replace best friend and current face of Chanel, Cara Delevingne. The new Chanel girl? Kendall, left, has already walked in the prestigious Chanel show and could well replace her friend Cara Delevingne, right, as the face of the French fashion house . Cara, 23, recently revealed that she will be focussing more on acting in the New Year, which could well leave the role open for Kendall. Kendall's meteoric rise in the fashion industry from her reality TV roots has led her to compare her double life to that of a certain Disney Channel star. 'It's definitely two different worlds. I feel like Hannah Montana. But it's fun,' the model told the New York Times. The new Cara? Kendall (second right) and Cara Delevingne leave Chanel's show in Paris earlier this year . The brunette socialite currently appears on the KUWTK spin-off Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, which airs Sundays on E! Viewers have seen her grow up in front of the camera as she first appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashians at the age of 11. The daughter of Kris Jenner and half sister of Kim, Khloe and Kourtney Kardashian, some have questioned whether Kendall has won her modelling contracts on merit or because she's part of the famous family. Moving with the times: Estee Lauder have named Kendall as their new face and asked her to announce the news via her social media accounts . Indeed many were surprised when she was named as the new face of Estee Lauder as in the past they have gone for more established A-listers such as Gwyneth Paltow and Elizabeth Hurley. But it seems the cosmetics giant are keen to appeal to a younger, internet-savvy market, making Kendall the perfect choice. She has more than 9 million followers on Twitter and 16m followers on Instagram. They capitalised on her online popularity by getting her to announce her appointment with them via her social media accounts - including a link to their website showcasing her favourite products. Now many in the fashion industry believe Kendall's star power will keep increasing and could eventually elevate her to the status of supermodel. Balmain creative director Olivier Rousteing told Vogue: 'Kendall is the new pop-culture model. She's inspiring girls in the way Claudia Schiffer or Naomi Campbell did. They aspire to look like her.' Despite her glamorous lifestyle, the down-to-earth youngster has revealed she's happiest when she's at home with her family. 'It sounds simple, but that is where I am at my absolute happiest. And on the Greek island of Santorini,' she said.

"The team coach trundled into the Main Stand car park shortly after 6pm. There was no fuss, no fanfare, only a small welcoming committee. As Brendan Rodgers made his way off the bus, followed by his coaching staff then his squad, there was no ringing adulation or none of those famous songs to get them in the mood for the crucial assignment that was looming. How stark the difference. Last season, as Liverpool were trying to win the title, you couldn’t move on Anfield Road when the team arrived at the stadium: flags decorated the streets, flares would be set off, songs were sung. The fans did all they possibly could to lift Rodgers and his men over the line. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-1 Basle . 'You'll Never Walk Alone' was sung but it lacked the oomph normally associated with the Liverpool anthem . Liverpool went out of the Champions League, and their fans were struggling for belief throughout the match . It was supposed to be the same last night, wasn’t it? Magical things are meant to happen at Anfield when the floodlights are on. A raft of Europe’s greatest names have buckled under the frenzy that has tumbled down from the terraces. Basle, so the theory went, would be next. So sure that the atmosphere would play a part in helping Liverpool produce the performance they needed, Brendan Rodgers even devoted 183 words of his programme notes to talk about the mystique of such occasions. ‘Your role is critical,’ Rodgers wrote. ‘I have had my own experiences of seeing the power of Anfield under the lights. I would ask that you play the same crucial role as you always do. Hopefully we can produce a result and a performance to make you proud.’ Now there is no doubting Anfield has witnessed some improbable victories, with St Etienne (1977), Roma (2002) and Chelsea (2005) being prime examples of evenings when the stadium shook to its old foundations. For the warm-up, there was muted apprehension from the stands, rather than support for their team . Raheem Sterling's performance lacked any kind of conviction, much like the majority of the team . But one thing tends to get overlooked when atmosphere comes on to the agenda: players and teams create it. Fans get up for these encounters when they have faith that the men they are going to support will produce for them. It is a two-way street. At this moment, Liverpool’s fan s are struggling for belief and that was apparent from an early stage. During the warm up, many on The Kop stood in muted apprehension as the squad went through their paces. In the far corner of the stadium, by contrast, Basle’s followers were finding their voice. Even the singing of You’ll Never Walk Alone lacked oomph and the anxiety levels had increased just 42 seconds into the encounter, as Simon Mignolet and Dejan Lovren exchanged unnecessary passes, leading Martin Skrtel to slice the ball out of play. You can tell early on in this arena how things are going to unfold and, suddenly, every errant pass was greeted with groans, each decision that went against Liverpool sparking a protests. If a man in Red dithered in possession, they were barracked to quickly find an option. Such was the frustration at the lethargy in Liverpool’s play, there was a chant of ‘Attack! Attack! Attack!’ to try and galvanise some response but, frankly, it was half-hearted and lacked any kind of conviction. Words, quite frankly, that sum up the team. Belatedly, the mood changed but that, more than anything, was down to the local hero. Steven Gerrard’s thundering challenge in the 62nd minute sparked some defiance then his superb free-kick cranked the decibels up to a level they have not been at since Manchester City came here in April. In stark contrast to last season, the Liverpool fans were disappointing on their big Champions League night . The Basle fans found their voice in the warm-up, and continued to support their team throughout the match . ‘This crowd push and they create for the team and they make it difficult,’ Paolo Sousa, Basle’s manager, noted. ‘The last 10 minutes were hard. Liverpool have quality and when they had their first shot on target and they scored.’ Much to their frustration, however, the second goal that would have carried them into the last 16 proved elusive, despite the frenzied exhortations. It was too little, too late. And that, to Rodgers and company, will be a source of immense regret. ‘We want to be playing in Europe,’ said Rodgers. ‘The history for the club is strong. Alongside that we want to finish in the top four and that is something we will try and do.’ At this point in a bitterly disappointing campaign, such goals seem a long way off. Anfield has lost its spark.","Last season, Liverpool fans lined the streets before matches when the team were aiming to win the Premier League title .

"The direct relatives of the executed uncle of Kim Jong-Un have been put to death upon the orders of the North Korean leader, it has been reported. Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren have been condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea. Jang, 67, was executed last month, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Executed: North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, right, is said to have ordered that all relatives of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, left, were put to death following his order to execute his uncle last month . Since Kim Jong-Un came to power in April 2012 he has shown himself to be a brutal tyrant, having executed or demoted a long list of people he has deemed a threat. According to newspaper Chosun Ilbo, Ri Yong-ho, Kim Yong-chun, U Tong-chuk, and Kim Jong-gak, all part of his father Kim Jong-il's inner circle, were handpicked to groom the 31-year-old leader, but have since disappeared or been demoted. As well as his uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, other high-ranking members of the military have been purged, including three defence ministers and three chiefs of the army's general staff. Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him. In August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra — which included his ex-girlfriend — were reportedly publicly machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming themselves naked. There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013. Sources told the Yonhap News Agency it is unclear exactly when the family members were killed, but they are believed to have been put to death after Jang's execution on December 12. 'Some relatives were shot to death by pistol in front of other people if they resisted while being dragged out of their apartment homes,' a source told Yonhap. Among those allegedly executed were Jang's sister Jang Kye-Sun, her husband and Ambassador to Cuba Jon Yong-Jin and Jang's nephew and Ambassador to Malaysia Jang Yong-Chol, as well as his two sons. The children and grandchildren of Jang's two brothers are also said to have been killed. One source told the news agency, which is publicly funded and has close links to the South Korean government: 'All relatives of Jang have been put to death, including even children.' Another source said: 'The executions of Jang's relatives mean that no traces of him should be left. 'The purge of the Jang Song-thaek people is under way on an extensive scale from relatives and low-level officials.' The family were recalled to the Pyongyang area of the country by Ministry of State Security troops in early December before being killed, sources said. It has been reported some relatives were shot to death in front of other people if they resisted as they were dragged from their homes. Plot: Kim Jong-Un, left, gave orders for his uncle Jang, right, to be executed after he was alleged to have plotted to overthrow the communist regime. South Korean media have reported Jang's children, brothers and grandchildren have now been condemned to death by the North Korean leader . Some relatives by marriage, including the wife of the Malaysian ambassador, are said to have been spared from execution, and instead have been sent to remote villages with their families, sources have said. Yonhap's report has yet to be corroborated but in North Korea a culture of 'guilt by association' has prevailed for years with family members of those convicted of crimes facing severe punishment, even death, for decades. Kim Jong-Un's former mentor Jang was accused of a number of crimes against the state. They included plotting a coup, misappropriating resources, womanising, abusing his position of power and 'dreaming different dreams' to the regime. North Korea stunned the world by announcing the execution of the man once seen as the dictator's political regent. His death marks the biggest political upheaval since the 30-year-old inherited power. The Kim dynasty has ruled the isolated country for more than six decades. Jang is the husband of Jong-un's biological aunt, the sister of his father Kim Jong-Il.","Children, brothers and grandchildren of Jang Song-Thaek said to be dead .

"In a modelling career spanning 25 years, she has had plenty of time to learn the tricks of the trade. And now Kate Moss has revealed exactly which tricks she uses to ensure she looks her best at 40 – at the start of the night, at least. Her secrets? Pre-party facials, fake tan and lashings of red lipstick. Scroll down for video . Kate Moss has revealed exactly which tricks she uses to ensure she looks her best at 40 . Sharing her beauty routine in this week’s Grazia magazine, the model said she begins with a facial to make sure her skin is in top condition before applying fake tan. And giving her tips for the morning after a late night, the mother-of-one said the tan can also hide a hangover, while she recommends a cucumber water face bath and juicing to treat puffy, tired-looking skin. Giving a step-by-step guide in this week’s Grazia magazine, she said: ‘Nicola Joss does an amazing lymphatic drainage facial using Sanctuary Spa Wonder Oil Serum. It’s like getting a natural facelift.’ Miss Moss then uses Lucas’ Papaw Ointment, ‘for my lips in winter’, and applies a fake tan. The model says a tan can hide a hangover, and a cucumber water face bath and juicing are best to treat puffy, tired-looking skin . She said: ‘I love a tan. You just look healthier in general and you can get away with a late night with a tan – it covers up a multitude of sins, as well as making your body looked more toned and defined. 'I use St Tropez Self Tan Luxe Dry Oil on my face and body before a big night.’ Next, Miss Moss puts on her make up. Sharing the contents of her cosmetics bag, she said: ‘A red lip and glistening skin is my failsafe party look. It’s nice to have a neutral but glowing face and eyes and then a strong lip for a pop of colour. ‘I always use pencils on my eyes; they’re soft with a bit of a shine so you can smudge them to look just like an eye shadow. Once it’s on it doesn’t budge.’ The model’s lips will always be red – ‘My hero is Rimmel Lasting Finish by Kate Moss Lipstick in 001,’ she said, while her perfume choice is season-dependent – ‘for winter I like a fragrance that’s a bit moodier’. And Miss Moss said she uses products to highlight her cheekbones. She said: ‘I love to mix bronzers and highlighters to contour and bring out my cheekbones. Charlotte Tilbury does a great Filmstar Killer Cheekbones Palette that I love.’ The supermodel said a red lip and glistening skin is her failsafe party look - a natural with a pop of colour . Perhaps it should also come as no surprise that many of Miss Moss’ favourite products come from brands she has connections with. She is the face of Rimmel and of St Tropez, and is good friends with Charlotte Tilbury, whose bronzing powder she wears. Facial treatments: Sanctuary Spa Wonder Oil Serum, £19.50, and Papaw Ointment, £4Fake-tan: St Tropez Self Tan Luxe Dry Oil, £25 . Lips: Rimmel Lasting Finish by Kate Moss Lipstick in 001, £5.49 . Cheeks: Filmstar Killer Cheekbones Palette by Charlotte Tilbury, £82 . Perfume: Ginsberg is God, 1970 and Je T’aime Jane by Bella Freud, £65 each . And for the morning after: The Super Elixir by Elle Macpherson, £39 . Miss Moss is also a client of Sanctuary Spa, whose facial treatments she recommends. Miss Moss’ reputation for being a party animal is well founded. The model, who makes around £12 million a year starring in campaigns for brands including Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, is known to throw raucous, alcohol-fuelled birthday celebrations. So it is perhaps unsurprising that her beauty regime includes hangover-hiding tricks for the following day. Miss Moss, who is married to The Kills guitarist Jamie Hince, said: ‘If I wake up in the morning and look tired and puffy, I fill a sink with ice and cucumber and submerge my face. 'It tightens everything, making you feel and look instantly awake. 'I saw Joan Crawford do it in the biopic Mommie Dearest. 'I also like juicing as it gives you bright eyes with a bit of a twinkle and it keeps your hair shiny. And at the moment I’m using Elle Macpherson The Super Elixir supplement, I add it to my juices.","Kate, 40, reveals her beauty tips and how to look good with a hangover .

"A contractor has emerged as a possible suspect in the murder of a Brooklyn slumlord whose charred corpse was found in a dumpster earlier this month. The suspect has been linked to a Dodge minivan that was used to abduct Menachem Stark outside his real estate firm in Williamsburg during a blizzard on January 2. Police said on Thursday that they suspect Stark may have been killed over a single $20,000 debt that he owed to one individual. The landlord owed millions to various creditors. It was suggested by investigators that Stark's death may have been accidental with the kidnap intended to scare him into coming up with the money. Scroll down for video . A contractor who allegedly murdered slumlord Menachem Stark was owed $20,000 by the Brooklyn developer, it has been claimed .

"He is every council's worst nightmare but artist Clet Abraham has a serious message to get across. Forget Banksy. This classically trained artist, who now lives in Florence, has been sneaking around cities across Europe in the middle of the night and strategically placing stickers on street signs to alter their meanings.

Not everyone has been impressed with the signs and Abraham was reportedly fined 400 euros in one city . Abraham's thought-provoking works of guerrilla art hope to challenge the way society restricts itself with rules and regulations. He believes signs are stopping individual expression and thought and many of his pieces of work make reference to religion. In one a black silhouette sneakily carries off a no-entry bar while in another a crucified Jesus Christ hangs on a dead-end sign. However, not everyone has been impressed.

'As a professional in the world of visual space, I feel called to intervene, both to notify the public of the absurdity of the situation, and to propose a constructive and respectful alternative.

"A 10-year-old German boy has discovered what appears to be an Egyptian mummy in a wooden chest in his grandmother's attic. Alexander Kettler found the 'mummy' inside a sarcophagus in a dark corner of the attic in Diepholz, northern Germany, after it had lain undisturbed for at least four decades. The boy's father, Lutz Wolfgang Kettler, now intends to take the box, covered in hieroglyphics, to Berlin so that experts can ascertain whether it is genuine. Mysterious find: A 10-year-old German boy found what appeared to be a mummy in a sarcophagus in his grandmother's attic . As well as the 'mummy', the box also contained a death mask and a canopic jar used by ancient Egyptians to store removed organs. Mr Ketller believes that the sarcophagus and jar are fake but says that there is every chance that the mummy itself is real. He said: 'You just don't get the feeling that's something you could buy at a shop around the corner.' Mr Kettler's father travelled to north Africa in the 1950s and had a mysterious chest shipped back to Germany. Relic: Mr Kettler believed that his father may have brought an unusual souvenir back from a trip to north Africa in the 1950s . He said that his father had never spoken about the chest or its contents, but told local newspaper Die Kreiszeitung that there was still a trade in genuine mummies when his father, who died more than a decade ago, travelled. Mr kettler added that mummy 'unwrapping parties' - where a genuine mummy was literally unwrapped and the trinkets found within handed out as gifts to guests - were not uncommon in Germany at the time. Dentist Mr Kettler said that the only way to find out if the mummy was genuine would be to x-ray it. The mummification process dates back to 3,500BC with the oldest intact Egyptian mummy dating from 100 years after that. The mummy, known simply as ID #32751, is currently held by the British Museum. It was apparently preserved by direct contact with the dry desert sand, though it is uncertain whether the mummification was intended. Tradition: Ancient Egyptians used to mummify both humans and animals when they died . Ancient Egyptians were firm believers in the afterlife when someone died. But they thought to get there, the body needed to be recognisable, so that the dead person could repossess it. The chief embalmer was a priest wearing the mask of Anubis - the jackal-headed God of the dead. First the brains would be pulled out of the person through the nose using a hook. Then all the internal organs would removed, including the lungs, stomach, intestines and liver and placed in jars. The heart would be replaced. The inside of the body would be rinsed with wine and spices before being covered with salt for 70 days. After 40 days it would be stuffed with linen to give it a more humane shape. At 70 days it would be wrapped in bandages and placed inside a brightly-painted coffin. Mainly wealthy people were mummified because poorer people could not afford it. Animals were also sometimes mummified as gestures to the Gods or so that they could accompany their owners in the afterlife.","Alexander Kettler found the 'mummy' in Diepholz, northern Germany .

"The dining table could become a relic of . the past as nearly a third of Britons now confess to eating there only a . few times a year. New research suggests that the number of us who now eat at our dining or kitchen table is shockingly low. Just five per cent of those polled ate every meal at the table, compared with 13 per cent of those who ate at least one meal a day there. The traditional scene of a family sitting to enjoy a meal together may become a thing of the past, as a third only use their table a few times a year . Almost a fifth of respondents (19 per cent) said that they ate one or two meals a week at the dining or kitchen table. Over a quarter, 26 per cent, of those surveyed confessed to eating at the table no less than once or twice a month and nearly a third (30 per cent) admitted to using it just a few times a year. Only four per cent said they never ate any meals at the table whilst three per cent said they didn’t even own one. Sitting down to meals has been replaced by eating on the go to keep up with fast paced modern lifestyles . A spokesperson from NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, who conducted the research commented: ‘Compared to 40 years ago, we now live in a society which moves at an extremely fast pace. Often, breakfast has to be eaten on the go, and in many cases so does lunch. 1.    Every meal - 5% . 2.    At least one meal a day - 13% . 3.    At least once or twice a week - 19% . 4.    At least once or twice a month - 26% . 5.    A few times a year - 30% . 6.    Never - 4% . 7.    Don’t have a dining/kitchen table - 3% . ‘Also, with people working longer hours, a quick ready meal or a takeaway in front of the TV is the easiest option.’ One woman said: ‘I always make sure my children eat at the dining table, but once you’ve got home from work, fed them and put them to bed, it’s all you can do to crash out in front of the TV with a jacket potato. ‘I can remember always having meals at the table, but then again my mum was a homemaker and had the time to prepare everything.’ Another man commented: ‘I hardly ever eat at the table, I think the only times I do are at Christmas and Easter. ‘In fact the only table I regularly eat at is my desk in the office when I am having my lunch.’ One final respondent said of the poll: ‘I am really worried that my children are growing up in a society where eating meals at the table is something special and not the norm. ‘What does it say about family life in this country if all we can do at meal times is sit and watch the television while stuffing our faces.’","Only 5% of Britons eat every meal at a table, 13% eat one meal a day there .

"Read Martin Samuel's match report from Anfield as the Reds crashed out of the Champions League . Brendan Rodgers branded Lazar Markovic's red card 'an awful decision' as Liverpool were knocked out of the Champions League after drawing with Basle. The Reds were already trailing 1-0 when the substitute was dismissed after pushing his arm out in the direction of Behrang Safari, but he did not appear to make contact, with the Basle player falling to the ground. Markovic was given his marching orders by referee Bjorn Kuipers, with Steven Gerrard's late free-kick not enough to send them through. Lazar Markovic is given his marching orders by referee Bjorn Kuipers on Tuesday night at Anfield . The Serb saw red for pushing his arm out in the direction of Behrang Safari, who dropped to the ground . 'I thought it was an awful decision,' Rodgers said. 'I thought the referee was disappointing on the evening to say the least. 'Markovic came on and was bright, made a difference to the team, he was dynamic. 'He had just taken a touch away, he's obviously got his arm up, but if that's a sending-off you are going to have two or three sendings-off every single game. It was a really, really poor decision. Brendan Rodgers looks dejected after Markovic was sent for an early bath early in the second half . 'I'm not even sure whether the referees have seen it, but I think he's seen the player hold his face and lie down, but there was no way that was a sending-off.' On going out of the Champions League, the Reds boss added: 'We now have to fight going forward to be in it next season and obviously our performance level needs to improve over the course of the season.'","Serbian was sent off for pushing his arm out in direction of Behrang Safari .

"Phil Neville has turned down the chance to work under Louis van Gaal at Manchester United to sit on the television sofa next season for Match of the Day. After being announced as one of the MOTD team in their 50th anniversary season, Neville told his one million Twitter followers that he no longer held a coaching position at Manchester United where he worked as David Moyes’ first-team coach last season. He was asked: 'Phil, are you still on the coaching team at United?' and replied: 'No'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Phil Neville talk Man United tactics with Giggs, Butt and Scholes .

They will now try to speak to Neville to . see if he can remain connected with United in some other way, possibly . in an ambassadorial or community role. A . spokesman said: 'We remain of the view that we wanted him involved and . didn’t think his television work would get in the way, as it hasn’t done . for his brother, Gary.' But . 37-year-old Neville, who was roundly criticised for his co-commentary . during England’s World Cup match against Italy in the summer, decided he . wanted to concentrate fully on his broadcast career.

Explosion: Twin car bombs have ripped through a Damascus suburb killing and wounding dozens of people . Injured: A boy who was injured in the explosions in Jaramana district, near Damascus, receives treatment at a hospital as well as a man who was hurt . Meanwhile this morning twin car bombs have ripped through a Damascus suburb killing and wounding dozens of people. The Syrian state news agency said the cars packed with explosives detonated early in the morning in the eastern Jaramana district which is mostly loyal to president Bashar Assad. At least 34 people died. A series of blasts have struck regime targets since last December, raising fears of a rising Islamic militant element among the forces seeking to topple Assad. Fatal: At least 34 people were killed in explosions which struck the eastern Damascus district of Jaramana . The bombs went off in a car park between two commercial buildings. They were detonated within five minutes of one another as groups of labourers and employees were arriving to work. The blasts shattered windows in nearby buildings, littering the street with glass and debris. Human remains were scattered on the pavement amid pools of blood. After the first explosion, people . rushed to the site to help the injured and then the second bomb went . off, said Ismail Zlaiaa, 54, who lives nearby. There . were conflicting reports about the death toll. Hospitals said at least . 30 bodies were brought in. The British-based Observatory for Human . Rights, which relies on reports from the ground, said 29 people were . killed. And the state SANA news agency put the toll at 34. Medical help: State-run television said four explosions, including two car bombs, hit the area of Jaramana, whose residents are believed to support President Bashar al-Assad . Syria's conflict started 20 months ago as an uprising against Assad and morphed into a civil war, with rebels taking up arms to fight back against a crackdown by the government. According to activists, 40,000 people have been killed since March 2011. Assad blames the revolt on a . conspiracy to destroy Syria, saying the uprising is being driven by . foreign ""terrorists"" - a term the authorities use for the rebels - and . not Syrians seeking change. Analysts . say most of those fighting Assad's regime are ordinary Syrians and . soldiers who have defected, disenchanted with the authoritarian . government. But increasingly, foreign fighters and those adhering to an . extremist Islamist ideology are turning up on the front lines. The . rebels try to play down the Islamists' influence for fear of alienating . Western support. Devastating: A crowd gathers at the site of a blast in Jaramana district . Rebels fighting to topple Assad are predominantly members of the Sunni Muslim majority. In their push to take Damascus, they have frequently targeted state institutions and troops around the country. They have also often hit districts around the capital with the country's minority communities, perceived to be allied with Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot Shiite group that dominates the regime. Central Damascus - the seat of Assad's power - has also seen scores of car bombs and mortar attacks that have targeted state security institutions and troops, areas with homes of wealthy Syrians, army officers, security officials and other members of the regime.","Marched through the middle a market in Damascus carrying red banners that read 'Stop all military operations in Syria. 100% Syrian'

"James Franco has admitted today that he did try to pick up a Scottish schoolgirl using Instagram after his embarrassing attempts to woo her went viral earlier in the week. The Spiderman star, 35, said he had shown 'bad judgment' for chatting up Lucy Clode, 17, from Dollar in Clackmannanshire, after she went to watch him in Of Mice And Men on Broadway in New York. After she shared a photo on Instagram a ‘flirty’ exchange of messages followed, in which he asked her age, if she had a boyfriend and if he should 'rent a room'. The teenager, a pupil at the exclusive independent school Dollar Academy, shared screengrabs,which included two pictures Franco sent of himself to verify she was not speaking with an imposter. 'I'm embarrassed and I guess I'm just a model of how social media is tricky,' the actor said on Friday morning, debunking theories that the exchange had been either an April Fool's Day prank or part of a viral campaign for his latest film . Scroll down for video . Coming clean: James Franco admitted that he did try contacting her on Instagram and asked her to meet him at a hotel only to find out that she was a 17-years-old schoolgirl . Meeting: Lucy shared this photo on Instagram with James in the background outside the Broadway theatre he had performed in, sparking the flirting . Franco did not address the fact that the object of his internet affection was half his age, but he was the one to bring up the incident on 'Live with Kelly and Michael' and said that he did not expect the conversation to be shared. 'It's the way that people meet each other . today, but what I've learned- I guess because I'm new to it- is you . don't know who's on the other end,' he said. 'You get a feel for them, you don't know who you're talking to. 'I used bad judgement and I learned my lesson.' Franco's admission this morning gave the controversy credibility after many initially thought it was a delayed April Fool's prank or some bizarre form of viral marketing for his upcoming film where Franco, playing a teacher, strikes up a sexual relationship with his teenage student, played by Emma Roberts. During the Friday morning talk show appearance, however, Franco said that it was just his way of trying to meet a young woman. 'Unfortunately in my position, not only do I have to go through the embarrassing rituals of meeting someone, but if I do that, then it gets published for the world so it's doubly embarrassing,' he said. What's going on here?: Schoolgirl Lucy Clode, 17, has claimed James Franco tried to meet up with her in a series of Instagram and text messages . Striking up conversation: James allegedly started chatting to Lucy after meeting her outside the the theatre where he was performing Of Mice And Men on Broadway . Not wasting any time: The actor appears to start asking Lucy how old she is and whether she has a boyfriend . Miss . Clode, who attends prestigious independent school Dollar Academy in . Clackmannanshire, reached for her mobile and took some pictures of the star, and then turned the lens on herself and took some ‘selfies’ with the . 35-year-old box office hit in the background. It . is understood that Franco spotted Miss Clode taking the photos and . shouted to her that she should put the photographs on the online . picture-sharing site Instagram and ‘tag’ him so he would be alerted to . them. In . the Instagram screengrabs, Franco works fast to . establish where Miss Clode is from and how long she will be in New York. He . then seems to fire off three questions in quick succession: ‘You’re . 18?’ ‘Who are you with?’ and ‘Do you have a bf (boyfriend)?’ Making a move: The alleged messages show James asking Lucy if he should 'rent a room' in her hotel and attempts to convince her it is really him . 'Don't tell': The teen asks the star to send her a photo of himself holding a piece of paper with her name on, which he apparently does . Miss Clode replies: ‘Nearly 18, my mum and not if you’re around.’ Franco then asks exactly when her birthday is and where she is staying in New York. The . conversation then appeared to switch to text message, and Franco asks . ‘Can I see you? You’re single? What’s the hotel? Should I rent a room?’ When . Miss Clode, from Dollar, voices concerns the conversation could be an . April Fool by an imposter, Franco posts a picture of himself to prove it . is genuine. The sensible teen then decides: ‘I’ll come back when I’m 18.’ Franco responds: ‘If you don’t want to meet text me when you do.’ The . screenshots of the conversation have taken Twitter and US gossip sites . by storm – although it is unclear whether they are genuine or not, and . fans claimed they could just be a publicity stunt. 'Why are you thirsty for underage ones?': James tweeted this after the news broke but later deleted it . Publicity stunt?: Lucy shared this photo in Times Square on Instagram. James' alleged actions could be to promote his new movie Palo Alto, in which he plays a soccer coach who seduces his 14-year-old babysitter . 'Not if you're around': Lucy, who also posted this photo of herself and her mother, apparently told James she was 'nearly 18' and that it didn't matter whether or not she had a boyfriend . It . is worth noting that Franco’s next film is the story of a high school . teacher who is dating one of his pupils – and several eagle-eyed online . commentators last night floated the suggestion that the exchange with . Miss Clode could be a sophisticated joke. One . man who has come out of the story very well is Miss Clode’s boyfriend . Brodie Dickson – an 18-year-old fellow Dollar Academy pupil who seemed . pleased to have beaten Franco in the love stakes. During . a conversation with a friend posted on Instagram, Miss Clode said: . 'James Franco asked me to meet him alone Romy! It was really him and I . rejected him!! [what] am I doing?!' She then added: 'I am going to regret this for years - it's given me a confidence boost though lol.' The . age of consent in New York is 17, so even if the exchange is genuine, . Franco is not doing anything wrong in the eyes of the law – but his . actions drew criticism from fans last night.","On Friday James Franco admitted he tried to meet teen he connected with on Instagram .

"An embarrassing Facebook photo inspired a young woman to ditch unhealthy habits and lose almost half her body weight. At 20st 5lb and wearing size 20 clothes, Nicola McKay, 22, struggled to enjoy walks with her friends and suffered constant headaches. But a photograph taken of her at a family birthday party provided her with the motivation needed to improve her lifestyle for good. Today Miss McKay, a restaurant worker from Greenock, weighs 11st and wears size 10 outfits. Before and after: Nicola McKay lost almost half of her bodyweight after being mortified by a photo of herself on Facebook (L) She said: 'After my cousin’s birthday party I was sat at home, looking at pictures people had taken of the day. Someone had tagged me in a picture and put it on Facebook. 'Usually, I couldn’t bear to look at photographs of myself for more than a few seconds before turning away, but this one really shocked me. I looked really unhealthy. It was horrible. 'I thought, ""I’m disgusting"". I couldn’t believe I’d been in such a state of denial that I hadn’t done anything earlier to lose weight. I decided to destroy my bad health habits before they destroyed me.' She said her weight gain stemmed from her habit of eating at irregular times and her inability to control her portions. 'I was greedy - I couldn’t stop eating. I ate lots of comfort food, like takeaway Chinese and pizzas. I was full, but I kept on eating. Motivated: Miss McKay has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes and joining a gym . Shocked: Nicola described herself as 'disgusting' and decided to join a slimming club. She has since lost over 9 stone . 'I wouldn’t eat regular meals - I just ate when I felt like eating. I ate large portions, but never the right food. As a result, I was overeating without even realising. I would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day.' By the time she saw the fateful photograph in April 2011, a nurse had already advised Miss McKay to lose weight. Miss McKay said: 'My BMI was more than 50. I was told being overweight was the cause of my heartburn, headaches and mood swings. Lifestyle overhaul: Nicola would eat large portions, but never the right food and would snack on crisps and chocolates and sugary drinks through the day. She now follows a healthy diet regime and loves working out . Fashion first: Nicola used to follow her friends' lead and wear tiny skirts but has now found shapes to flatter her . 'I didn’t want to feel pressured into weight loss - it was a decision I had to make myself. Like most people I use Facebook quite a lot and the thought of people having the same reaction to my photo as I did was quite upsetting. 'So, one night I made up my mind that I would go to slimming club and if I enjoyed it, I would stick with it, and everything changed from that point.' After her first week at a slimming club, in October 2011, she was delighted to discover she had lost 7lb. She joined a gym not long afterwards and discovered she enjoyed taking regular exercise. She said: 'I never thought I would go on a treadmill. I walked at first, but eventually built up the courage to start running. When I realised what I was doing, I was amazed. I never thought I would find myself running at a gym. 'I’ve always loved spending time with my friends and going out dancing. Even when I was large I was an outgoing and bubbly person. So I decided to use Zumba classes and dancing video games at home to help me keep the weight off.' Health problems: Her BMI was more than 50 and she was told being overweight was the cause of her heartburn, headaches and mood swings . Miss McKay has managed to lose 9st 5lb by sticking to regular mealtimes. Before losing the weight, she never ate breakfast and opted for fatty takeaways at unpredictable times. Today, she eats cereal and banana for breakfast, followed by a typical lunch of toast and poached eggs and calorie-controlled lasagna or baked potato with tuna and salad for her evening meal. She usually drinks water, snacks on grain bars or enjoys soup if she feels particularly peckish. She said her new slim figure has allowed her to find new outfits to wear. 'When pictures of me are posted on Facebook now, people are usually very encouraging about the way I look. 'When I was bigger, I thought nothing of wearing very short skirts because that’s what my friends were doing. But I look back at those pictures now and think, ""why did everyone let me go out with a dress that was halfway up my bum?"" As she was: Miss McKay never ate breakfast and gorged on fatty takeaways at unpredictable times but that has all changed now . 'But now, when I go out, my whole dress sense has changed. I love fashion and feel I look a lot more sophisticated - I like high-waisted pencil skirts and elegant tops. I feel more classy, more ladylike, when I’m out with girls, which is a wonderful feeling.' She says the secret to her amazing turnaround was that she waited until she felt ready to make a lasting change. She argued that despite the benefits that weight loss can bring, young people should not feel under social or peer pressure to change the way they look. She said: 'Even if you’re overweight, or too skinny, or short or tall, you’re still beautiful inside. That person inside you isn’t going to change - I didn’t.

"An Illinois Congressman was escorted off the floor of the US House after he wore a hoodie as he gave a speech condemning the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Rep Bobby Rush, a Chicago Democrat, is the latest high-profile figure to don a hooded sweatshirt to protest racial profiling and discrimination. The garment, which the Florida 17-year-old was wearing when he was killed last month, has become a political statement for protestors, who believe Trayvon was targeted for being a young black man wearing a hoodie. Scroll down for video... Protest: Illinois Rep Bobby Rush removed his suit jack to reveal a hoody underneath and put the hood over his head as a symbolic show of support for Trayvon Martin . Out of order: Rush was quickly escorted away from the podium and as the acting speaker slammed down his gavel . The Congressman's protest comes as it was revealed Trayvon's girlfriend, 17, had to be hospitalized when she learned that she was the last person to talk to him before his death, according to Radar Online, citing an anonymous source. Trayvon was talking to his girlfriend on the phone as he walked back to his father's home after picking up Skittles and a iced tea. Days after the shooting, following Trayvon's wake, his family's lawyer spokes with the girl to get information about what she heard. When he informed her she was last person to speak to him alive, she became 'absolutely inconsolable and had trouble breathing so her mother took her to a nearby hospital emergency room,' the source told Radar Online. In Washington, Rush took the podium wearing a suit coat. Halfway through his speech Wednesday morning, he took off the jack, revealing a gray sweatshirt underneath, and put the hood over his head. Hallowed halls: Rush (lower left) was led away after acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper (center) began pounding his gavel and called Rush out of order . Political statement: Hoodies have become symbols of racial profiling and discrimination, protestors say, after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed while wearing one . Justified? George Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon in self defense after being attacked by the teen . 'Just because someone wears a hoodie, does not make them a hoodlum,' he said. The . acting speaker, Rep Greg Harper, a Mississippi Republican, began . bagining his gavel and ruled Rush out of order almost immediately. Rush was escorted away by staffers. The US House has a longstanding policy against wearing hats on the floor. 'I . applaud the young people all across the land who are making a statement . about hoodie, about the real hoodlums in this national, especially . those who tread on our law wearing official or quasi-official cloaks,' he said, according to the Washington Post. Rush, who represents a district on the south side of the Chicago that is 65 percent black, is no stranger to high-profile symbolic gestures. In 2004 he was arrested, along with other Congressmen, for trespassing at the Sudanese embassy during a protest of the Darfur genocide. He was a civil rights leader throughout the 1960s and co-founded the Illinois chapter of the Black Panthers. In 2008, he warned Senators that refusing to seat Rolland Burris, who was appointed by scandal-plagued Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich, was tantamount of lynching. In 2009, he sponsored a bill that would require all owners of handguns and semiautomatic rifles to register for federal firearms licenses, one of the strictest gun control proposals in recent years. Hoodies are standard attire for the . thousands of people who have marched in cities across the country . demanding the arrest of George Zimmerman. New York state senators wore hooded sweatshirts at the state legislature earlier this week as a shot of support for the protestors. The hoodie escalated as a political symbol when Fox News commentator Geraldo Rivera said: 'I’ll bet you money that if he didn’t have that hoodie on, that nutty neighborhood watch guy wouldn’t have responded in that violent and aggressive way.' He later added to the fury by saying: 'If you dress like a hoodlum eventually some schmuck is going to take you at your word.' The comments sparked outrage and helped fuel the anger of protestors, who turned them into a symbol of support for Trayvon. Celebrity endorsements: Rapper Sean 'Diddy' Combs and singer Chaka Kahn were just two of the celebrities who wore hoodies in support of Trayvon protestors . Solidarity: Maimi Heat star LeBron James tweeted this photos of he and his teammates wearing hoodies to show their support . Keeping it real? Rapper Nelly (left) poses with a simple, dark hoody. But what, exactly, is New York Knicks star Amar'e Stoudemire wearing? Chaka Kahn produced a music video . with actor Boris Kodjoe called 'Fear Kills, Love Heals,' which was is a . tribute to Trayvon. It features several celebrities including Angela . Bassett, Eva Marcille, and Garcelle Beauvais wearing hoodies and singing . a remake of 'Super Life.' Miami . Heat star LeBron James tweeted a photo of himself and his teammates . wearing hoodies as a show of support for the Trayvon campaign. Zimmerman, . a 28-year-old neighborhood watch volunteer, has not been arrested for . killing the unarmed teenage February 26 in a gated community in Sanford, . Florida, because he claimed the shooting was self-defense. However, . it was revealed Tuesday that the lead homicide detective wanted to . charge Zimmerman with manslaughter in the teen's death after questioning . him for several hours at the police station. The local state attorney's office stopped the arrested, saying they didn't believe they could win a conviction because of Florida's Stand Your Ground law. Zimmerman claimed to police Trayvon punched approached him and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. He said the teen then climb on top of him and bashed his head against the sidewalk several times. Zimmerman said he feared for his life when he pulled out his Kel-Tec semi-automatic 9mm pistol, which he was licensed to carry, and shot the teen in the chest at very close range. Speaking out: Trayvon's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, talked about their son's death at a public forum sponsored by Democrats on Capitol Hill Tuesday . Under state law, a gun owner can open fire if he has a reasonable fear of being killed or severely injured by an attacker. A local grand jury, a the Florida State Attorney's Office and several federal agencies are all investigating the case to see whether the killing was, indeed, lawful. The federal agencies are also looking into whether the case is a hate crime after a 911 call surfaced with Zimmerman muttering a word that was possibly a racial epithet. The information about Zimmerman's possible arrest comes as new information about Trayvon has begun to paint a different picture of the teen. School records from the Miami Herald reveal he was suspended from high school three times -- once for truancy; once after he was caught carving graffiti and a school administrator discovered he had a 'burglary tool' and bag full of women's jewelry; and a third time when he was caught with a marijuana pipe and an empty baggy with drug residue. The conservative news site the Daily Caller dug up a Twitter account that it claims belonged to Trayvon. On the site reveals a message from his cousin implying that Trayvon might have attacked a bus driver. It also makes references to doing drugs. Trayvon's family maintains none of the new information is relevant to the shooting case and that it is an attempt the smear their son's name and harm their credibility.","Acting house speaker slammed hammered the gavel and ruled Rep Bobby Rush out of order after he put the hood of his great sweatshirt over his head .

"Emerging from the shadows of their secret command outpost, these are the members of the only all-female fighting unit in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo.

The katiba, made up of mostly Kurdish women, is fighting beside the Free Syrian Army against government forces on the streets of Syria's second city.

The formation of the women's battalion was announced . in Ifrin, the scene in late 2012 of violence . 'The Kurdish popular committees have . set up the first women's battalion, comprising some 150 women fighters. The battalion is named the Martyr Rokan Battalion,' said the Syrian .

'While women are now fighting . alongside the rebels, pro-regime forces and Kurdish militia, this is the . first women's battalion as such,' said Observatory director Rami Abdel . Rahman. 'Women are now playing a major role in the fighting in Syria,' he said. The formation of the women's battalion was announced . in Ifrin, the scene in late 2012 of violence pitting Kurdish fighters . against Arab rebels fighting the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Assad's troops pulled out from . majority Kurdish areas in 2012, and while Kurds have been split over the . anti-regime revolt in Syria, most have chosen to remain neutral in the . conflict.

A defaced poster of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is seen near garbage containers in Aleppo . A Free Syrian Army fighter takes cover during clashes with Syrian Army in the Salaheddine neighbourhood of central Aleppo . Today, Syria's government and rebels both demanded an international investigation into an alleged chemical weapons attack, as the country's feared arsenal became the latest propaganda tool in the two-year-old civil war. President Barack Obama said the U.S. is investigating whether chemical weapons have been deployed in Syria, but noted that he is 'deeply sceptical' of claims by President Bashar Assad's regime that rebel forces were behind such an attack. 'Once we establish the facts, I have made clear that the use of chemical weapons is a game changer,' Obama said in a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem. The use of chemical weapons by either side is a nightmare scenario. Along with its warnings about Assad, the West is just as concerned that rebel forces, including some linked to Al Qaida, could get their hands on Syria's chemical weapons supplies. Despite the importance, any clear confirmation of the nature of the attack that took place on Tuesday in the northern village of Khan al-Assal, killing at least 31 people, is unlikely. Syria's government seals off areas it controls to journalists and outside observers. The two sides blamed each other for a chemical attack without offering clear proof or documentation, as has frequently been the case in the Syrian civil war. If confirmed, it would be the first time a chemical weapon has been used in Syria's war that has already killed an estimated 70,000 people.","Around 150 formed a katiba, meaning battalion or phalanx in Arabic .

"Click here for all the big match stats from our brilliant Match Zone service . It is as if football’s fates are conspiring to torment Steven Gerrard in his remaining years. They show him the prize, let him glimpse the glory and then snatch it away. That title slip, a wretched World Cup as England captain, and now this, possibly his last appearance in the Champions League, able to do so much, but not enough. No single player worked harder to drag Liverpool into the last 16 than Gerrard. It was not to be. Maybe it never will be again. He needs greatness around him these days, certainly to thrive in the Champions League. He needs a match winner in the manner of Luis Suarez, a rock like Jamie Carragher, a coach with the cussedness of Rafael Benitez to teach ordinary players to defend for their lives. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Liverpool 1-1 Basle . Steven Gerrard looks forlorn after the final whistle as Liverpool are knocked out of the Champions League by Basle .

Ratings by Joe Bernstein at Anfield . They are gone, and so are Liverpool now. Gone from this competition and probably from next season’s too unless they can spectacularly reverse their trajectory in the Premier League. If Gerrard stays a Liverpool player it may be the 2016-17 season before he can think of playing in the Champions League again. He cannot soldier on alone. That this ended in a grandstand finish is to Gerrard’s immense credit. Down to 10 men and ordinary in the extreme for much of the game, Liverpool ultimately took Basle to the wire because their captain refused to surrender. Having won a free-kick on the edge of the area with nine minutes remaining, Gerrard stood over the ball. Could he? Would he? He did. He curled it inside Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik at the near post and gave his team the puncher’s chance they scarcely deserved. And right there is Gerrard’s agony. So close. Jordan Henderson had two chances late on – one a shot in injury time that forced a stunning full length save from Vaclik, but it was to no avail. Gerrard was spared the opprobrium from the Anfield public that greeted this exit, but that will be scant consolation either. Time is slipping away, and he knows it. They shout for him this season, but what else is there to shout about? There were 72 minutes gone when Gerrard had his first chance to change the game. He was through, one on one, and set to equalise. Might this be it? The night of folklore and legend that Brendan Rodgers had forecast? Sadly, Liverpool’s story has lost that magical element this season. Out came Vaclik throwing himself at Gerrard’s feet. His outstretched hand connected with the ball first, then Gerrard’s leg. The captain appealed furiously, so did the crowd. Referee Bjorn Kuipers shook his head. The writers of myths and epic tales had knocked off for the night. Gerrard was doing his best to imbue the occasions with glory, but it was not to be. And the task was straightforward enough. Beat Basle, reach the last 16. Yet only in those frenzied final exchanges did Liverpool come close. A goal down after 25 minutes, they removed their main striker Rickie Lambert at half-time so ordinary was his first-half display, but fared little better for this.

The draw for the knockout phase takes place in Nyon on Monday, December 15 . Lazar Markovic came on in his place, offering a spark of life, but then calamity struck. Just 16 minutes after arriving he was dismissed, a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent. Markovic, who had looked lively out wide with Raheem Sterling moved to Lambert’s role, was speeding away from Behrang Safari when, for reasons best known to himself, he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back. If he touched the Basle man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire. Kuipers bought it, and Markovic was shown a straight red card. He had local sympathy but, let’s face it, if Mario Balotelli had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness. From there, Liverpool’s task appeared impossible. That they ended up even within a goalmouth scramble of victory is due to Gerrard’s refusal to quit. But one day he must quit. One day he will quit. And what will they do then? Markovic makes the slightest of contact with Behrang Safari's face in the incident that led to his sending off . Croatian defender Dejan Lovren protests as substitute Markovic is shown a straight red card for catching Safari . Players from both sides surround the referee as Safari lies on the floor and Markovic leaves the field . The result means Liverpool finish third in Group B behind Real Madrid and Basle . Top and bottom of it, Liverpool looked overwhelmed, almost afraid of the challenge here. The mood was set in the first minute of the match. A loose ball fell to the experienced Martin Skrtel at the heart of Liverpool’s defence, and he cleared in panic, like a novice. Up it went into the night air, barely an inch further forward, requiring much hurried regrouping beneath. Variations on this theme were prevalent throughout the first-half. Simple passes went astray or were miscontrolled, touches were poor and good positions were wasted. Anfield, so often Liverpool’s greatest friend on nights like this, sensed the desperation. The noise was often muted, a worried murmur or frustrated howl as counterpoint to the buoyant visitors from Switzerland. Rodgers had spoken of his team becoming part of Liverpool lore, but the history of this club is great and proud and this group seemed intimidated by the challenge of maintaining that standard. Players that had looked like world beaters last season shied away from the responsibility. Sterling cuts a frustrated figure in the Merseyside rain as Liverpool struggle to get a foothold in the match . Brendan Rodgers looks dejected as Liverpool failed to create any meaningful chances in the first half . Sterling’s shots had no potency and when Gerrard played a good ball to Glen Johnson for a counter-attack on the right, he sloppily let it run out of play, provoking a furious reaction from the former England captain. Lambert did not get a sniff. It was a sobering evening, not only for the player but also for the committee that guides Rodgers’ hand in the transfer market. Liverpool could have bought close to 20 Lamberts for what they got for Suarez, but it is class that is required to win occasions like this; not numbers. Basle are not a great side, but they are competent and technically tight and their goal after 25 minutes was all of that. Fabian Frei played the ball into tormentor in chief Luca Zuffi, who held it up, returned it, and Frei’s shot did the rest. It was in the net without so much as a dive from Simon Mignolet. The defending was slack but why so startled? Switzerland international midfielder Fabian Frei fires in a shot from the edge of the box that gave Basle the lead early in the first half .

Basle could have gone further ahead after 33 minutes when poor marking left striker Marco Streller alone to receive a cross from Taulant Xhaka. He tried to take it on the volley, but missed. Had that gone in, it would have surely been game over – so too, the chance that fell to Fabian Schar six minutes later, blocked on its way to goal. Instead, Gerrard was allowed one more swing at playing the hero. It is an act that never outstays its welcome but, in this competition at least, it may have outlived its effectiveness.

"Distraught: Karla Lopez (believed to be the wife of Fort Hood shooter Ivan Lopez) broke down in tears when she discovered that it was her husband who went on a shooting rampage at Fort Hood on Wednesday afternoon . The distraught wife of Fort Hood shooter Ivan Lopez emerged from her family home on Thursday morning after spending the entire evening with authorities desperate to find any clues as to why her husband embarked on his rampage. Telling reporters, 'I'm sorry. I don't feel well. I've been talking to police all night,' Karla Lopez was then escorted by family members away from the Killeen apartment she moved into three weeks ago with 34-year-old Lopez. Her neighbor, Xanderia Morris, described the family as 'real sweet' and recounted the horrific moment yesterday afternoon when Lopez's wife realized her husband was responsible for shooting dead 3 soldiers and injuring 16 before taking his own life. Morris, who lives near the Lopez . family in Killeen, said Karla Lopez, a former El Paso Community college . student staggered outside as news of the shooting spread. 'She told me that she hadn't talked to her husband since 3 o'clock and was hysterical,' Morris said to ABC News. 'She was shaking and crying.' 'I tried to console her and comfort her, let her know everything was okay.' Tragedy: Pictured are Ivan Lopez and Karla Lopez - the woman believed to be his wife. Ivan Lopez opened fire at Fort Hood military base on Wednesday, killing three and injuring 16 before taking his own life . Sad: Karla Lopez has been whisked away by her relatives to an undisclosed location after cooperating fully with authorities investigating why her husband opened fire on Wednesday - killing three and injuring 16 others . Family photograph: Ivan Lopez appears in another photograph with Karla Lopez - the woman believed to be his wife . Much happier times: Ivan Lopez (picture here with the woman believed to be his wife, Karla Lopez) out for a drive with what are believed to be his and Karla's children . Initially, Karla feared her husband . may have simply been caught up in the shooting, but when news reports . identified him as the shooter she become inconsolable. Morris claimed that the Lopez family was just like any others and the shooting has left her reeling. 'He was always smiling and waving whenever I saw him, so I didn't think anything strange or unusual,' she said. It is thought that Ivan Lopez has a teenage daughter and Karla Lopez two children from a previous relationship. The news of the second mass shooting in five years at Fort Hood has caused investigators to delve into the background of Lopez, who was being assessed for a mental illness before he killed three people and himself a day earlier at an Army base in Fort Hood, Texas. There was no motive given for the incident, although officials ruled out terrorism. The shooting also wounded 16 others, and the gunman, who had been treated for depression and anxiety, was yet to be officially identified. The victims were all military personnel at the massive Army base, which houses many soldiers who have seen combat abroad. The soldier had served four months in Iraq in 2011 and was undergoing evaluation for post-traumatic stress disorder, said Fort Hood commanding officer Lieutenant General Mark Milley. Far from home: Lopez was born and raised in Puerto Rico and got his start in the military via the Puerto Rico National Guard . Closest to combat: Lopez was in Iraq for four months in 2011 and proudly posted this photo online . Security officials said preliminary information identified the gunman as Ivan Lopez, but Milley declined to name the shooter, who is married, until his family was notified. The suspect's wife, who is believed to be Karla Lopez was cooperating with law enforcement officers, a Federal Bureau of Investigation official said, according to CNN. The shooter had 'self-reported' a traumatic brain injury after returning from Iraq but was never wounded in action, Milley said. He arrived in Fort Hood in February from another military installation. 'We are digging deep into his background,' Milley said, with the investigation looking at his mental health and criminal and combat history. At about 4:00 p.m. local time on Wednesday, the soldier went to two buildings on the base and opened fire before he was confronted by military police, Milley said. Watch Video Here . Family man: Official reports stated that Lopez was married and the father of a young girl but his Facebook pictures show him with multiple children on a number of occasions like this one . The gunman then shot himself in the head with a .45-caliber pistol, he said. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul of Texas told reporters the man was wearing an Army uniform. Milley said law enforcement was looking into reports of an argument at the base ahead of the shooting. 'At this time there is no indication that this incident is related to terrorism,' Milley told a news conference. The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in schools and malls, has sparked a national debate over gun-control regulations. The Scott & White Hospital in Temple, Texas, where some of the wounded were taken, said nine patients were in intensive care, of which three were in critical condition and six were stable. Other victims were taken to Fort Hood's Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center, near the site of the shooting. Injured: Patients were rushed to Carl R. Darnall Army Medical Center and Scott & White Memorial hospital in Killeen, Texas . How the shocking incident played out . U.S. President Barack Obama said he was 'heartbroken' another shooting had occurred, and that the incident 'reopens the pain of what happened at Fort Hood five years ago. 'We are going to get to the bottom of exactly what happened,' Obama said. The incident highlights the U.S. military's so-far frustrated efforts to secure its bases from potential shooters, who increasingly appear to target the facilities. Milley said the shooter walked into one of the unit buildings, opened fire, then got into a vehicle and fired from there. He then went into another building and opened fire again, until he was engaged by Fort Hood law enforcement officers. When confronted by a female military police officer, he shot himself with his semi-automatic weapon in the parking lot. 'He was approaching her at about 20 feet. He put his hands up, then reached under his jacket, pulled out the (.45) and she pulled out her weapon and then she engaged, and he then put the weapon to his head,' Milley said. Transfixed: Soldiers watch Fort Hood news from Fort Irwin . Response: President Obama (left) and Secretary . of Defense Chuck Hagel (right) were quick to issue statements of . condolences to the victims on Wednesday . One of the buildings housed medical brigade day-to-day operations and the other, nearby, served the administration of the transportation battalion. As soon as the shooting broke out, the base went on lockdown. Police secured the base perimeter, emergency vehicles rushed to the scene, helicopters circled Fort Hood and officers went from building to building searching for the shooter. Fort Hood, a base from which soldiers prepare to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan, had overhauled its security to better deal with potential 'insider threats' after a 2009 rampage by an Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 others. During that attack, Major Nidal Hasan shouted 'Allahu Akbar,' Arabic for 'God is greatest,' and later said he wanted to be a martyr. He was convicted and faces death by lethal injection. In September, a gunman opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 and wounding four before being killed by police. Last month, a civilian shot dead a sailor aboard a ship at a U.S. Navy base in Norfolk, Virginia. U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel ordered steps to improve Pentagon security after reviews found the Navy Yard shooting could have been averted if the gunman's mental health had been properly handled.","The wife of Ivan Lopez became hysterical when she realized that her husband was responsible for the deaths of three soldiers and injuring 16 others at Fort Hood on Wednesday .

He said: 'It is a natural progression beyond the core vehicle's outstanding on- and off-road capabilities and leading-edge design. 'Its exhilarating performance will satisfy a particularly demanding set of customers. 'It takes the vehicle's dynamic capabilities to the next level without impacting on comfort, refinement or all-terrain versatility.' Off-the scale: The off-roader sits on huge 22 inch alloy wheels specially made for high performance . Wow factor: In a world first for Land Rover, the new Range Rover Sport SVR has a two-stage active exhaust featuring electronically controlled valves . The new British 4X4 which thinks it's a supercar had its world debut among the super-rich at the prestigious Pebble Beach concourse event in California . The super-4X4 is fitted with permanent four-wheel drive, has lightweight aluminium suspension, .

The pictures, which cannot be verified, were released today as SACOM held a protest outside Hong Kong's flagship Apple store in the International Finance Centre shopping mall . This picture allegedly shows a Biel Crystal employee in hospital after apparently getting injured at work . It also alleges that workers did not get fair compensation and claimed five suicides had taken place in the factory since 2011. Hong Kong-based firm Biel Crystal reportedly makes touch screens for around 60 per cent of Apple's products. According to Biel Crystal's website, the company employs more than 60,000 workers and has more than 15 production lines. It says: 'Biel Crystal commits to provide the best services with the most competitive price to our customers. 'We have provided our products to the industry leader in watches, mobile phone, tablet and notebook.

Although underage labor is rare in our supply chain, we report all incidents we find, as well as the actions taken to correct problems and prevent future occurrences.' Biel Crystal is not mentioned in the report. The claims by SACOM come four months after another labour rights group accused a Chinese company that makes iPhones for Apple of abuses including withholding pay and excessive working hours. China Labour Watch said it found violations of the law and of Apple's pledges about working conditions at factories operated by Pegatron, a Taiwanese company. Apple said in a statement it was 'committed to providing safe and fair working conditions' and would investigate the claims about Pegatron. Hong Kong-based firm Biel Crystal reportedly makes touch screens for around 60 per cent of Apple's products . Apple said it had published a code of conduct for its suppliers and joined the Fair Labour Association, a worker rights monitoring group. The Taiwanese company's chief executive, in a separate statement, also promised to investigate. Two years ago, SACOM also revealed that factories making Apple iPads and iPhones in China were forcing staff to sign pledges not to commit suicide after at least 14 workers at Foxconn factories had killed themselves in just 16 months as a result of horrendous working conditions. A report commissioned by the computer giant also found in March last year that factory staff were working exhausting hours for low pay.

"Children trapped on a mountain by Islamic State militants in Iraq are drinking blood from their parents to stay alive, it emerged today. Their horrendous plight was revealed after some 8,000 Yazidis were finally able to escape down Mount Sinjar where they have been under siege from jihadist fighters for the last week. Those fleeing have made it to relative safety at a camp in Dohuk Province in Kurdistan, where they have told horrific stories of the 30,000 who have been left behind. Sky News correspondent Sherine Tadros, who is at the camp, said: 'One man has just told us how he saw four children die of thirst. 'There was nowhere to bury them on the mountain so they just put rocks on their bodies. 'Another man was saying the children were so thirsty, their parents started cutting their own hands and giving them blood to drink.' Desperate: Displaced Yazidis are clawing for food and drink to stay alive in the desert, with children allegedly drinking their parents' blood . Those fleeing have made it to relative safety at a camp in Dohuk Province in Kurdistan, where they have told horrific stories of the 30,000 left behind . Hundreds of other families have also made it across the border after trekking for hundreds of kilometres through sweltering temperatures to safety .

Hundreds of other families have also . made it across the border after trekking for hundreds of kilometres . through sweltering temperatures to safety. They . are being given food, water and medical treatment at shelters in Turkey . and Syria after being driven out of their town by ISIS more than a week . ago. Some have been . forced to pay smugglers their life savings to take them on perilous . journeys across the border into Turkey, sometimes through minefields. They . are among several gruelling treks to freedom the community has taken . after they were sent scattering to the four corners by the insurgency, . which has trapped around 30,000 others on Sinjar Mountain with no food . or water. Refuge at last: Displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community look for clothes to wear among items provided by a charity organisation at the Nowruz camp, in Derike, Syria . Fleeing jihad: Syrian Kurdish fighters battled Islamic State militants to carve an escape route to tens of thousands trapped on a mountain top . Displaced: Thousands of Yazidis have trekked for hundreds of kilometres to make it across the border after they were driven from their town by ISIS more than a week ago . Scattered: A graphic showing the various escape routes the Yazidis have taken, often through hundreds of kilometres of desert terrain, after being attacked by ISIS . Around 2,000 Yazidis have made it to a refugee camp in Derabon, a small village near Zakho on the Iraqi Kurdistan-Turkey border. But with no passports, many are having to sit tight and hope the uprising is crushed or pay smugglers to help them avoid the official border crossing at Habur. One mother who suffers agonising rheumatism told how she and her three young children waded through the Tigris River, tip-toed her way through a minefield and climbed through a barbed-wire fence to make it into Turkey. Half-way through the five-hour journey, Amal said the smuggler wanted her children to leave her behind because she was too slow, but they chose to carry her instead. The 43-year-old told The Times: 'My . sons gathered around me and they refused. We were not afraid of dying . there. We were afraid of dying at the hands of the Islamic State.' Another teenager has not been so lucky. Amer . Omar Pajo said he watched his father get shot in the head by ISIS . gunmen as they fled to the mountains and his mother later succumbed to . dehydration. Starving: Yazidi children scramble for food at the Nowruz camp in Derike, Syria after trekking hundreds of miles to escape ISIS . Suffering: Sick children from the Yazidi community wait for treatment at a clinic at the Nowruz refugee camp in Derike, Syria . Persecuted: A former senior Iraqi politician warned that the country risks becoming another Syria unless a way to preserve its unity is found . The family sold . the last of their belongings to pay a smuggler to get them to Derabon, . but now he doesn't have the $600 to pay another trafficker to get him . across the border. Meanwhile, . another 130 U.S. troops have arrived in Iraq on what the Pentagon . described as a temporary mission to assess the scope of the humanitarian . crisis facing thousands of displaced civilians trapped on Sinjar. The British Government also remained . under pressure today to consider military intervention as more aid was . delivered to the mountain top. International . Development Secretary Justine Greening confirmed that a third round of . successful UK air drops took place last night. The supplies included two C130 consignments containing 2,640 reusable water purification containers filled with clean water. More . than 500 shelter kits to provide shade in temperatures of more than 40C . (104F) were also inside the packages. There have now been five . successful drops over three nights. But . Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted the UK will not intervene . militarily - despite increasing calls from experienced commanders . yesterday for it to join the US in air strikes on IS targets. Taking shelter: Iraqi Yazidi refugees escaping from attacks by the Islamic State settle into their makeshift home in the Turkish city of Sirnak . Ms . Greening, who announced £8 million in new assistance last week: said: . 'As thousands of Iraqi people remain cut off away from their homes, we . are focused on getting help to those in need, particularly those trapped . on Mount Sinjar. 'After . last night the RAF have successfully made five drops, including . thousands of containers filled with clean water that can also be used to . purify dirty water and hundreds of shelter kits.' Islamic State, which sees Shi'ites as . heretics who deserve death, has seized a series of towns in northern . Iraq, in a sweeping advance that has left the Iraqi government reeling . and prompted tens of thousands to flee. The group has declared religious rule in a caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq, offering . both Christians and members of the ancient Yazidi sect, whom it calls . 'devil worshippers', the stark choice between conversion to Islam or . death. It came as a . former senior Iraqi politician warned that the country risks becoming . another Syria unless a way to preserve its unity is found. Hajem . Hassani, previously speaker in the Iraqi parliament, said if the . society did not come together, it would leave the door wide open to the . Islamic State (IS). He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'This is probably one of the hardest times Iraq is facing. 'If we don't come together, then probably we will open the door too wide for the IS or other terrorist organisations. 'We . need to take the control...(or) it definitely will take us to the . Syrian path if we are not very careful and finding ways to solve the . problems.' Asked whether . newly-appointed prime minister Haider Abadi understood the need for an . inclusive government, he replied: 'He should do.' Sustenance: Refugees who fled across the border wait to receive food after reaching a camp in the city of Sirnak in Turkey's Silopi district . Meanwhile, unrest continued in Baghdad, where Iraqi troops imposed heightened security as international support mounted for a new prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki, who has called on the armed forces to stay out of politics amid fears of a possible coup. Tanks and Humvees were positioned on Baghdad bridges and at major intersections on Wednesday, with security personnel more visible than usual. About 100 pro-Maliki demonstrators took to Firdous Square in the capital, pledging their allegiance to him. The embattled premier has grown increasingly isolated, with Iraqi politicians and much of the international community lining up behind Haider al-Abadi, a fellow member of his Shiite Dawa party tasked by the president with forming a new government that can unite the country in the face of an onslaught by Sunni militants. Widespread discontent with al-Maliki's divisive rule has reached the point where both Saudi Arabia and Iran - regional rivals often bitterly divided over Iraq - have expressed support for al-Abadi. The United States, the European Union and the United Nations have also expressed support for new leadership. But al-Maliki, whose bloc won the most votes in April elections, has thus far refused to step aside and rejected the appointment of al-Abadi as unconstitutional. Al-Abadi was selected by the main Shiite alliance which includes al-Maliki's bloc, but the Islamic Dawa party says al-Abadi 'only represents himself.'","Horrific stories of 30,000 Yazidis trapped by Islamic State jihadists emerge after 8,000 escape down the mountain .

"Koalas may be best known for being cute and cuddly, even borderline benign creatures, but even they have days when their temper is tested. Rare footage of two of the native Australian marsupials in the world having a tiff was posted by Swedish tourist Elin Nordlander on YouTube and went viral with more than 2.5million views and counting. The two adorable creatures are filmed laconically coming to blows, with one appearing to be affectionate while the other isn't impressed, under a tree at Great Otway National Park in Victoria. Scroll down for video . Serious face: The two koalas look sternly at each other before coming to blows at their own pace . During the video the koala on the left looks disgruntled and while the koala on the right appears to try to patch things up, but gets a clip around the ear and a gentle bit near the face. When the one on the right fights back, the other koala seems to be taken aback and till the same dance is repeated with both making their distinctive wailing or grunting sound. Distance: The koala on the right appears as if he is trying to move closer to the other koala . Tension: As the koala on the right makes advances the koala on the left howls aggressively . Midway through the footage the amused cameraman turns the camera on himself to show his amusement as he watches the drama unfold. He smiles into the camera for a few moments before turning the camera back to the irritable koalas.

"From breathtakingly clear shots of brittle stars and vivid sea sponges, to the intricate, yet delicate skeletons of coral, one photographer has managed to document the beauty of Caribbean reefs in exquisite detail. Massachusetts-based artist and designer Jessica Rosenkratz took the shots during dives off the coasts of Windsock beach, Bari Reef and Tolo on the island of Bonaire. She used macro lenses and strobe lights to capture the extremely close-up images and is planning to use them as inspiration in her design studio, Nervous System. Massachusetts-based artist and designer Jessica Rosenkratz captured the close-up shots, including this star encrusting coral, during dives off the coasts of Windsock beach, Bari Reef and Tolo on the island of Bonaire. Encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces. They grow larger in diameter, rather than height, which is common in many other coral species. This gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size, yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions . Nervous System was set up in 2007 by . creative director Rosenkrantz and fellow MIT graduate Jesse . Louis-Rosenberg, who is chief science officer. It specialises in creating jewellery, homeware, lighting and puzzles inspired by patterns found in nature. Among her Bonaire photos, Rosenkratz captured images of the Callyspongia plicifera, also known as the Azure Vase Sponge. It is shaped like a vase, with grooves . and pits on the outside, and grows to approximately 18 inches tall. It . is found in coral reefs in the Caribbean, Bahamas, and Florida. It is one of the most colourful sponges found in corals around the world ranging from pink to purple to fluorescent light blue. During the dive, Rosenkrantz also managed to take macro photos of maze coral, known as the Platygyra Brain Worm Coral. Platygyra comes from the Greek word platys, meaning flat, and gyros, which means wide circle. This describes the maze-like channels of its skeleton. Large maze corals can grow up to 7-inches wide. One of the most hardy corals photographed during Rosenkratz's trip was the zoanthid, pictured, a type of so-called colonial coral. Colonies of coral consist of separate polyps that can live together and each contribute to the area¿s ecosystem. Zoanthids are photosynthetic yet can live in very low light levels and may occasionally eat brine shrip, for example.The Palythoa zoanthid produces Polytoxin that can be deadly . The majority of corals found in the Caribbean and Bahamas are known colloquially as reef builders. They secrete calcium carbonate which hardens to form a coral skeleton, like the one pictured .

Zoanthids are photosynthetic, yet can live in very low light levels and may occasionally eat brine shrip, for example.The Palythoa zoanthid, for example, produces Polytoxin, which can be deadly. There are in excess of 30 different variations of zoanthid and palythoa polyps. The individual golden zoanthids, also captured by Rosenkratz, are approximately 0.25-inches wide. They are found in the Carribbean and the Bahamas, predominately in shallow waters. The golden zaonthid grows symbiotically on several species of sponge in small groups and rows on the surface of their host.

They are part of a group known as brittle stars closely related to starfish and found in deep waters. The average basket weighs almost a stone (11lb) and doesn't contain any blood. Instead they use their water vascular system to convert gases into energy. Elsewhere, Rosenkratz found star encrusting corals. Encrusting corals grow on hard rocky surfaces. They grow larger in diameter, rather than height, which is most common in many other coral species. This gives them the advantage over other corals in terms of size, yet they are brittle and can break in storm conditions. Rosenkrantz graduated from MIT in 2005 with degrees in Architecture and Biology. 'We are attracted to complex and unconventional geometries. Our inspirations are grounded in the natural forms and corresponding processes which construct the world around us,’ Rosenkratz said. ‘From coral aggregations to interference patterns, a study of natural phenomena is an essential ingredient to our design process. ‘We created Nervous System to explore a design approach that relates process and form in a context of interactivity and openness.’ The company writes computer programs, based on patterns found in nature, and uses these programs to create art, jewellery, household items, lights and puzzles. These include earrings shaped like dendrites, similar to those found in neurons, lamps inspired by the veins of leaves, and an amoeba jigsaw.","The breathtakingly clear and detailed images of marine life were captured during a trip to the Caribbean .

"For the second year running a charity dedicated to supporting returned servicemen and women has enlisted the help of dozens of celebrities for a unique campaign. But for Australian country singer Samantha McClymont, the Take A Seat for Legacy initiative holds a very special significance. While performing for the troops in Iraq with her two sisters Brooke and Mollie as their band The McClymonts, Samantha had the experience of a lifetime, as well as a little extra something else she hadn't quite bargained for. Scroll down for video . Australian country singer Samantha McClymont met her future husband Ben Poxon while touring Iraq with her band The McClymonts over the Christmas period in 2006 . When the singers were invited to see the inside of one of the planes they were travelling around Iraq in, Samantha had no idea that all these years later she would be walking down the aisle with one of the men she met. 'Being the Captain of the plane he actually invited the singers up to the front, he was pulling all the moves out,' the singer told Daily Mail Australia. Over the 20-day tour of Iraq, where the trio played a concert every day or two, Samantha got to know many of the troops well, but she had a special connection with Wing Commander Ben Poxon. Ben is Executive Officer of number 84 Wing, a pilot who flies the C130J Hercules. 'We actually didn't meet up until about eight months later, and then once we did it was kind of like - that was it!' Samantha said. 'I was down in Sydney and he took me on a date and we were pretty much inseparable after that. This year Samantha is involved in the Take A Seat For Legacy campaign, and has decorated her own chair which will be auctioned off this week . The three sisters spent 20 days performing in Iraq at the end of 2006 . 'It's kinda crazy that we met all these people and soon they'd be in our circle of friends and then coming to our wedding!' the country singer revealed. Speaking of her own experience in the war-torn region in 2006, Samantha said as she was only 21 at the time so the seriousness of the situation didn't really sink in until she was back home. 'You're wearing camo and bullet proof vests and helmets ... But you block it out so you can have a good time, and you want them to have a good time while you're there as well,' she said speaking of the troops. Samantha also revealed how her time travelling Iraq helped her put things in perspective. 'They're going through this every day, we only had to do it for 20,' she said. 'It's a pretty full-on experience, and bombs do go off there ... but you put them out of your mind.' The McClymonts have also returned overseas for more performances in East Timor since then . Ben (right) and Samantha will get married in Tasmania later this year . The ARIA award winner also said that what she saw improved her relationship with Ben infinitely. 'I think it helped our relationship down the track as he's had to go back on deployment.  But he's currently at home ahead of their wedding in Tasmania later this year. 'It actually put my mind at ease ... I think if you don't have any picture in your mind at all you always think the absolute worst,' Samantha said. Plus their busy careers which often take both of them around the world mean they're used to being apart. 'You wouldn't think that a pilot and country singer would be compatible,' Samantha laughed. The Take A Seat Campaign campaign, devised by homewares company Temple & Webster, enlists the help of 40 personalities from around Australia and asks them to decorate a chair, which is then auctioned off with all proceeds going back into the charity. Legacy is particularly close to Samantha's heart, and she said she wanted to do 'anything I can to help bring awareness', but joked that the process of designing the piece of furniture helped her realise that she should 'stick to singing and playing guitar'. This is the chair Samantha created, which will be auctioned off along with 39 others over the next week . Chairs designed by a range of Australians such as Socceroos star Tim Cahill, journalist Melissa Doyle and food stylist Donna Hay are being auctioned off online until Thursday October 30th . 'I think the last time I used glue was in primary school,' the singer laughed. The chair, which is 'all covered in music paper, like a decollage' has a lot of The McClymonts in it, with three red ribbons wound across the back to represent the trio of band members. 'For a touch of glamour we put a pair of red high heels on the seat', Samantha revealed. Since 2006, the singer has taken more trips to perform for the troops with her sisters, and said some of the men and women they met overseas still travel to their shows. 'You kind of have that connection forever really, cause you have experienced what these men and women experience every day,' Samantha said. The chairs designed by a range of Australians such as Socceroos star Tim Cahill, journalist Melissa Doyle, model Rebecca Judd and food stylist Donna Hay are being auctioned off online until Thursday October 30th. They will also be on display at The Grounds of Alexandria until this Sunday.","Samantha McClymont was touring Iraq with her sisters Brooke and Mollie in 2005 .

"500 women are being trained and will help the Syrian National Defence force with security tasks . Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has recruited an army of women to guard checkpoints and carry out security checks in an attempt to plug the holes left by defections and casualties in his dwindling army. Up to 500 women have been drafted into the new paramilitary force known as the 'Lionesses for National Defence.' They have been in trained at a boot camp in Wadi al-Dahab in the Syrian city of Homs. They form part of the recently formed 10,000-strong National Defence Force (NDF), a key part of Assad's counter insurgency strategy, as the president desperately tries to regain control of the country's towns and cities. Decked out in army fatigues and armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, the women have also been seen guarding areas of Homs where the majority of locals are known to support the government's regime. Part of their role is to carry out security checks on veiled women. A grainy video uploaded four days ago to LiveLeak.com clearly shows at least ten women guarding a checkpoint in Palmyra, Homs. Abu Rami, a spokesman for the Syrian Revolution General Commission in Homs told The Independent: 'I was very surprised, it's the first time I have seen this. 'I think it is an excuse to make the Free Syrian Army kill women and then show the world as propaganda, but anyone with a weapon is a legitimate target.' One Homs resident told Al Arabiya: The sight of these girls is disturbing.

Decked out in army fatigues and armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles, female soldiers have also been seen guarding areas of Homs where the majority of locals are known to support the government's regime . The women have become part of a new paramilitary force known as the 'Lionesses for National Defence' Syrian National Defence forces who just finished training, stand to attention at their training centre in Wadi al-Dahab . Girls guarding Gadaffi . The Amazonian Guard was the name given by Western journalists to an all-female elite troop of bodyguards responsible for protecting the former leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi. The group was formed in the early 1980s. Gaddafi reportedly employed female soldiers because he believed that an Arab gunman would have difficulty firing at women. Others believe it was just another aspect of the dictator's eccentricity and his fondness for young women. He would usually travel with 15 of his Amazonian Guards assigned to security or housekeeping. Prior to Gadaffi's death, reports emerged of him and other senior military commanders raping and sexually abusing the women. There were also reports that the women were forced to execute rebels or be killed themselves . 'They look like predators and treat every woman that passes by as if she’s a slave or a Jew in the concentration camp.” He . said he saw one female soldier push an elderly lady in the area of . Dawar Al-Muaslat in central Homs after forcing her to take off her . headscarf. It comes as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . said today that there could be no peaceful resolution of the conflict . in Syria as long as opponents of President Bashar al-Assad demand his . exit from power and refuse to negotiate with his government. Lavrov's . comments at an annual news conference signalled no shift in the . position of Russia, which says Assad's exit must not be a precondition . for a deal to end 22 months of violence in which more than 60,000 people . have been killed. 'Everything . runs up against the opposition members' obsession with the idea of the . overthrow of the Assad regime.

"Photobomb has been announced as the 2014 Word of the Year after seeing off competition from 50,000 new additions to the dictionary that include twerk, bakeoff and normcore. While it has been referred to as far back as 2008, the photobomb received a powerful endorsement from Prince Harry and the Queen this year when they were both pictured photobombing athletes at the Commonwealth Games. The photobomb is officially defined by the Collins English Dictionary as 'to intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge'. Scroll down for video . The Queen photobombing two Australian athletes at this year's Commonwealth Games . Prince Harry (background) photobombed a picture of New Zealand rugby sevens coach Sir Gordon Tietjens . Benedict Cumberbatch pictured photobombing U2 at the Academy Awards earlier this year . Although the photobomb has been practiced - as it's currently known - since at least 2008, a string of high profile photobombs this year rocketed it into position as the number one Word of the Year. Publisher Collins explained its decision to coincide with the release of the 12th edition of its English Dictionary. 'The first recording of the word is in 2008 as the subject of a Google search and it gained wider use in 2012 when a number of photographs exhibiting the phenomenon went viral on the web. 'This year saw an unprecedented level of high-profile photobombing, most notable were Jennifer Lawrence photobombing Taylor Swift at the Golden Globes in January, Benedict Cumberbatch photobombing U2 at the Oscars, and the Queen, who unwittingly photobombed members of the Australian hockey team at the Commonwealth Games. 'Her grandsons took a more direct approach with Prince William photobombing Sir Chris Hoy and Prince Harry photobombing the New Zealand rugby coach.' Collins claimed this year had seen an 'unprecedented level' of photobombing, including the Royals' antics at the Games and film stars hijacking each other's photographs at red carpet events. Ian Brookes, a consultant lexicographer for Collins English Dictionary, said the high-profile photobombs made it the undeniable Word of the Year. He said: 'We had been tracking 'photobomb' for a couple of years but were not sure that it would become widely established. 'It's vastly increased prominence in 2014 shows the power of media and sporting events to publicize a word and bring it into wider use.' It comes as the 12th edition of the Collins English Dictionary is released with 50,000 words receiving a seal of approval and becoming an official part of the English language. 1. Photobomb: To intrude into the background of a photograph without the subject's knowledge. 2. Tinder: The dating app Tinder matches users in their local area, who swipe right to like a profile and left to reject it. 3. Bakeoff: A baking competition. 4. Normcore: A trend in fashion emphasizing the practical and/or ordinary. 5. Devo Max: An arrangement in which a central government transfers the maximum amount of authority to a regional government while still retaining sovereignty over it. And whether you love it or loathe it, Miley Cyrus' twerking has been accepted. Twerking, in which a dancer gyrates in a sexually provocative manner, has been popularised by pop star Cyrus in the past few years. Another notable new addition is adorkable, a blend of adorable and dork, and which is defined as someone socially inept in a charming way. However, photobomb was the winner in a shortlist of five words which rose to prominence this year. In second place was Tinder, the mobile dating app which shows users profiles of people within their area and matches the two - enabling them to chat if they indicate a mutual interest in one another. In third place was bakeoff. Although Collins cites use of the word as far back as 1949 when a flour company in Minneapolis, U.S., launched a baking competition, its popularity skyrocketed when The Great British Bakeoff first aired in 2010. In fourth and fifth places were normcore and devo max, respectively.

"Catch me if you can: On-the-run Colonel Gaddafi has a £1m bounty on his head to be caught dead or alive . Libyan rebels today offered a £1m reward to capture Gaddafi as the hunt intensified to find the runaway leader. The opposition council in Benghazi hopes that the sum will tempt members of Gaddafi's inner circle to turn him in. The rebels will have large amounts of cash available when Libyan assets are unfrozen and they have promised amnesty to anybody who captures or kills Gaddafi. The offer came after the toppled dictator fled his palace in Tripoli and is believed to have escaped through a 2,000 mile network of tunnels running through the country. Scroll down for video . Raided: A rebel holds a Kalashnikov automatic rifle as he kicks over a sofa in the infamous Bedouin tent where Gaddafi carried out business deals . The deal in the desert: Prime Minister Tony Blair meets Gaddafi in the same tent that has now been ransacked. It is identifiable by the camel-lined fabric adorning its sides . Leaving behind a deserted mansion, Libyans rummaged through the forbidden home of the leader - even taking their children along to see the ruins of the fallen leader's home. Rebels were pictured overturning couches and breaking up furniture in Gaddafi's Bedouin tent - the scene of his famous meeting with Tony Blair in 2004. As fighting continued, a woman who said she was Gaddafi's only daughter, Aisha, told loyalist television channel Al Orouba today that . Libyans must unite against Nato and unite behind her father. 'I tell the Libyan people to stand . hand-in-hand against Nato,' she told the TV station by telephone. 'I . tell the Libyan people not to fear the armed forces.The leader is in the . right.' Despite insistence from the Gaddafi . inner circle that they still have the upper hand in the war, the first . pictures emerged of rebels destroying the . luxury confines of Gaddafi's former compound. Compound carnage: A rebel fighter sprays graffiti over an oil painting hanging over the luxury bed once slept in by the dictator before he fled the area . Inside the rat's lair: Rebel fighters rummage through Gaddafi's compound today. Sofas have been overturned and graffiti is scribbled on the walls . Free for all: A Libyan man holds his child as he celebrates among rebel fighters in front of Gaddafi's iconic gold fist statue . Rebel fighters look through an album they found inside Gaddafi's compound in Bab Al-Aziziya, Tripoli. Condoleezza Rice is seen on one of the pages . One . Libyan wearing army camouflage sprayed graffiti onto an oil painting . hanging above Gaddafi's bed. Lengths of wood from the ceiling collapsed . onto the mattress and glass in the room was smashed. Elsewhere in the building, sofas in the Gaddafi clan's sitting room were overturned as men wandered through the different rooms. They found a treasured photo album featuring pictures of Gaddafi with . other world leaders. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is . seen on one of the pages. In the grounds of the main compound, . jubilant Libyans celebrated alongside rebel fighters. One man even . brought his two young children along. Burning: Smoke rises above one of Gaddafi's infamous Bedouin tents where he is reported to have slept surrounded by female bodyguards holding machine guns . Smile for the camera: Armed rebels take pictures in front of the iconic golden fist statue . The garden of evil: Rebel fighters rush into the leafy grounds where Gaddafi once strolled while plotting his tyrannical moves . Gaddafi last . night made a defiant speech from his hideout in which he vowed that the . fight against Libyan rebels would end in 'death or victory'. In . a desperate attempt to dent the rebels’ morale after they had ransacked . his compound earlier in the day, he also claimed the withdrawal from . his Bab al-Aziziya fortress was merely a 'tactical move'. 'I . have been out a bit in Tripoli discreetly, without being seen by . people, and... I did not feel that Tripoli was in danger,' Gaddafi . said. In a second statement, he pledged to turn Libya into ‘volcanoes, lava and fire’ - echoes of Saddam Hussein's parting shot in 1991 when he set fire to oil fields in Kuwait. But the aggressive messages did little . to intimidate rebels who were fighting today in a southern area of the . city where Gaddafi may be hiding. There was also heavy bombing of the . Gaddafi compound by government forces and clashes in the Abu Salim part . of the city. Children of war: A young boy plays on top of a tank belonging to forces loyal to Gaddafi, which was captured by rebel fighters, in the city centre of Zawiyah . Cupboards are bare: Rebels stomp through one of the rooms in Gaddafi's home that appears to have once been used as a kitchen . Rebels use their AK47 assault rifles to smash through shutters and break into a living room at Gaddafi's palace . A rebel fighter climbs on top of Gaddafi's golden fist statue which he built after fending off U.S. airstrikes in 1986 . 'We think Gaddafi is still hiding somewhere in Tripoli. He is likely to be in the al-Hadhba al-Khadra area,' the official in Tripoli, who gave his name as Abdulrahman, said. 'There is fighting in the al-Hadhba al-Khadra area.' In his radio address, Gaddafi also told residents they must . 'cleanse' Tripoli of the rebels and free it from the 'devils' who have . overrun it. The beleaguered tyrant vowed victory or martyrdom in his . fight to remain in power. Another . message was aired on two Arabic networks in which Gaddafi vowed 'to . clear the city of Tripoli and eliminate the criminals, traitors and . rats. They are hiding between the families and inside the civilian . houses. It's your duty to enter these houses and take them out. The . rebels will slaughter you and desecrate your bodies.' He had been speaking to a Tripoli . radio station but his whereabouts after leaving the compound remain a . mystery. The United States believes that he is still in Libya, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Dave Lapan said today. Party atmosphere: Wearing Gaddafi's prized hat, an enormous gold chain and clutching his walking stick and wig, the rebel who broke into the dictator's bedroom celebrates alongside Libyans . Stamped out: Rebels trample on a bust of Gaddafi yesterday as they screamed chants claiming that they were going to get him . If the cap fits...: Colonel Gaddafi (left) pictured in military uniform . in 2009 and (right), a rebel proudly shows off the same cap after . ransacking the dictator's compound . The leader is believed to have escaped his compound in a 2,000 mile network of secret . vaults under the capital which lead to key buildings, airports and . military bases. One of the underground tunnels is known to surface at the Rixos Hotel 1.5km away where 35 international journalists were trapped earlier but have since been freed. Another tunnel leads to the coastline while a third comes up at Mitiga Airport 7km away. Blockades and checkpoints have been . set up around the capital, but if Gaddafi is able to leave Tripoli, he . could find a safe haven 500km away in the east in his home town of Sirte, from which scud missiles were fired at rebels yesterday. Gaddafi . could also head 775km south to Sabha, his ancestral home, where he was . reported to have built nuclear bunkers in the 1980s. From there he could . travel through the desert or fly to neighbouring Chad, the country from . which he recruited hundreds of mercenaries. There were also suggestions that he could travel west to Algeria although sources today suggest that he has remained in Tripoli. Gaddafi rides in his golf cart earlier this year, and right, rebels wave their tricolor flag and joyride in the same vehicle that Gaddafi would have once used to drive around his now fallen compound . Stocking up: A Libyan rebel holds weapons taken from Gaddafi's Bab Al-Aziziya compound yesterday after the stronghold fell to the revolution . The tunnels were built by Western companies, however, few people have knowledge of the full extent of the network. The 69-year-old's remaining forces are said to be heading for Sirte, raising the prospect of a bloody final showdown with the rebels. There pockets of resistance today from government forces around the fallen compound and at the border with Tunisia. Pockets of motor and rocket  fire were heard around Tripoli as die-hard Gaddafi loyalists with 'lots to lose' battled with rebels. There were even fears that Gaddafi could unleash an arsenal of chemical weapons or poison the country's water supply. Al Jazeera correspondent Evan Hill said: 'Explosions have been heard here and occasional gunfire. Rebels told me there are snipers about and that four people have been injured by gunshots.' British journalists were among the foreign nationals who had been trapped inside the Rixos hotel by gunmen loyal to Gaddafi. The corporation's Matthew Price said he was one of around 35 foreigners, including journalists and politicians, who were inside the besieged establishment. The hotel, which the regime has allowed international journalists to use, was the scene of Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam's surprise reappearance earlier this week and has remained in the hands of those loyal to the dictator even as large parts of the capital fell to rebel advances. A few miles away from the hotel a Maltese boat, Triva 1, has allowed British nationals fleeing Tripoli to board. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office posted messages on its website and Twitter in the early hours to alert UK citizens remaining in Libya. It stressed it expects only a small number of British nationals to leave on the boat as most were evacuated during its own operations. The FCO continues to advise anyone remaining in Libya to leave, warning of the possibility of retaliatory attacks from pro-Gaddafi forces as a result of the international intervention. Foreign Secretary William Hague has called on Muammar Gaddafi to recognise his 42-year rule over Libya was over and stand down his forces. Mr Hague insisted the Libyan people had delivered a 'decisive rejection' of the dictator and dismissed his vow to fight on as 'delusional'. 'I think it is time now for Colonel Gaddafi to stop issuing delusional statements,' he said.","Catch me if you can: On-the-run Colonel Gaddafi has a £1m bounty on his head to be caught dead or alive .

"A teenage Afghan girl was brutally tortured, beaten and locked in a toilet by her husband's family for five months after she refused to become a prostitute, it has emerged. Sahar Gul, 15, was in critical condition when she was rescued from a house in northern Baghlan province last week, after her neighbours reported hearing Miss Gul crying and moaning in pain. According to police in Baghlan, her in-laws pulled out her nails and hair, and locked her in a dark basement bathroom for about five months, with barely enough food and water to survive. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Cruel: Sahar Gul was brutally tortured by her husband's family. The 15-year-old was burned with cigarettes and had chunks of her flesh cut out with pliers . Disgusting: Sahar Gul's in-laws pulled out her nails and hair, and locked her in a dark basement bathroom for about five months, with barely enough food and water to survive . Her husband's family also burned the teenager with cigarettes and cut out chunks of her flesh with pliers. After meeting with senior security officials today, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai said those responsible would be punished. Despite being barely able to speak, Miss Gul managed to tell media about the terrifying ordeal. 'For several months I was locked up in a toilet by my in-laws and . particularly my mother-in-law,' she said. 'I was denied food and water. I was tortured and beaten.' Doctors say the youngster has suffered both mentally and physically and will need weeks of treatment in order to recover. 'She was married seven months ago, and was originally from Badakhshan province. Her in-laws tried to force her into prostitution to earn money,' Rahima Zarifi, head of women's affairs in Baghlan told Reuters. Upsetting: Sahar Gul was kept in a terrible condition by her husband's family, who tortured and beat her . Dreadful: Sahar Gul's appalling physical condition shortly after she was  rescued can be seen in this image . Distressing: This picture shows how frail the teenager was when taken into hospital following her rescue . Miss Gul is covered in scars and bruises, with one eye still swollen shut six days after her rescue. She is being treated in a government hospital in Kabul, but she may have to be sent to India, doctors said. 'This is one of the worst cases of violence against Afghan women. The perpetrators must be punished so others learn a lesson,' health minister Suraya Dalil told journalists after visiting Miss Gul today with the women's affairs minister. Mohammad Zia, a senior police official in Baghlan, who helped to rescue the girl, said Miss Gul's mother-in-law and sister-in-law have been detained, but her husband and father-in-law had escaped. 'We have launched a serious hunt to get her husband and the others involved,' Mr Zia said. Action needed: Afghanistan's acting minister of public health Suraya Dalil, left, and the caretaker minister for women's affairs Dr Husn Banu Ghazanfar visit Sahar Gul in hospital . Recovery: Sahar Gul was treated in a government hospital in Kabul, but doctors have said she may have to be sent to India . Despite progress in women's rights and freedom since the fall of the Taliban 10 years ago, women throughout the country are still at risk of abduction, rape, forced marriage and being traded as commodity. However it can be hard for women to escape violent situations at home, because of huge social and sometimes legal pressure to stay in marriages. Running away from an abusive husband or a forced marriage are considered 'moral crimes,' for which women are currently imprisoned in Afghanistan. Some rape victims have also been imprisoned, because sex outside marriage, even when the woman is forced, is considered adultery, another 'moral crime.'","15-year-old was beaten and burned with cigarettes after being locked in a toilet for five months .

"At least two civilian workers were killed after missiles launched in a US airstrike targeting an ISIS-controlled region in Syria struck grain silos, according to a human rights group. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights believes aircraft may have mistaken the mills and grain storage areas in the northern Syrian town of Manbij for an Islamic State base. The US-led coalition has been targeting towns and villages in northern and eastern Syria controlled by the Islamic State group since last week. Scroll down for video .

Search and rescue team members try to rescue a man, trapped under rubble of a building damaged following the American-led coalition's airstrikes  in a residential area of Al-Bab district of Aleppo, Syria . The campaign expands upon US airstrikes against militants in Iraq since early August. The Observatory, which gathers information from sources in Syria, says a grain silo was set ablaze by a missile from one of the most recent airstrikes - killing at least two civilians. Strikes on a building on a road leading out of the town also killed a number of Islamic State fighters, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Observatory which gathers information from sources in Syria. Mr Abdulrahman, said today: 'These were the workers at the silos. They provide food for the people.' The airstrikes 'destroyed the food that was stored there'. Buildings in the Al-Bab residential district of Aleppo, Syria, are left destroyed by the American-led airstrikes . The US-led coalition has been targeting towns and villages in northern and eastern Syria controlled by the Islamic State group since last week . The Observatory says that at least 19 civilians have been killed so far in coalition airstrikes . The group says at least 19 civilians have been killed so far in coalition airstrikes. The US military said tonight that an American air strike overnight had targeted Islamic State vehicles in a staging area adjacent to a grain storage facility near Manbij, and added it had no evidence so far of civilian casualties. 'We are aware of media reports alleging civilian casualties, but have no evidence to corroborate these claims,' said Colonel Patrick Ryder, a spokesman at the US military's Central Command. He promised that the military would look into the report further, saying it took such matters seriously. The United States has been bombing Islamic State and other groups in Syria for a week with the help of Arab allies, and hitting targets in neighbouring Iraq since last month. European countries have joined the campaign in Iraq but not in Syria. Manbij sits between Aleppo city in the west and the town of Kobani on the northern border with Turkey, which Islamic State has been trying to capture from Kurdish forces, forcing tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds to flee over the frontier . The US said the facility targeted was used by the Islamic State as a logistics hub and vehicle staging area. Manbij sits between Aleppo city in the west and the town of Kobani on the northern border with Turkey, which Islamic State has been trying to capture from Kurdish forces, forcing tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds to flee over the frontier. On Sunday, Human Rights Watch said that it had confirmed the deaths of at least seven civilians - two women and five children - from apparent U.S. missile strikes on September 23 in the village of Kafr Derian in Idlib province. The New York-based group said two men were also killed in the strikes, but that they may have been militants, basing its conclusions on conversations with three local residents. 'The US and its allies in Syria should be taking all feasible precautions to avoid harming civilians,' said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.

"Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria is facing mounting pressure from its members to form an ultra-alliance with the rival Islamic State to confront a common enemy after U.S.-led air strikes hit both groups this week. Al Nusra, long one of the most effective forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, was weakened this year by battles with Islamic State, an Al Qaeda splinter group that routinely employs ruthless methods such as beheadings and mass executions. U.S.-led air and missile strikes, which have hit Al Nusra as well as Islamic State bases in Syria, have angered many Al Nusra members who say the West and its allies have joined forces in a 'crusader' campaign against Islam. The two share the same ideology and rigid Islamic beliefs, but fell out during a power struggle that pitted Islamic State head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi against Al Qaeda chief Ayman Zawahri and Al Nusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani. But merging would require pledging loyalty to Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate in territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, which would effectively put an end to the Al Nusra Front, fighters in the group say. Rising up: Supporters of the Al Nusra Front protest in Aleppo against Syrian President Bashar Al Assad and the U.S.- led international coalition after the rebel group was hit by air strikes this week . Members of the Al Nusra Front (above) want their leaders to reconcile with its rival Islamic State to confront a common enemy, namely President Assad and Western forces launching bombing raids in Syria and Iraq . Sources close to Islamic State said some Al Nusra fighters were joining them after the strikes and there was a growing sense among many that it was time to put their differences aside. 'There are hardline voices inside Nusra who are pushing for reconciliation with Islamic State,' a source close to Nusra's leadership told Reuters, though he doubted it would happen. 'I know Golani. He would never reconcile with Islamic State. If he ever does it, it would be in a direct order from the leadership, and that is Zawahri himself.' However, one Islamic State fighter said he believed there was an '80 per cent chance that the brothers of Nusra will join the State'. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said on Friday over 200 fighters had joined Islamic State in the northern Aleppo area, many from the Nusra Front, since U.S. President Barack Obama said he was prepared to strike the group in Syria. Sources close to Islamic State (above) said some Al Nusra fighters were joining them after the U.S.-led strikes . The two groups share the same ideology, but fell out during a power struggle that pitted ISIS head Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (above) against Al Qaeda chief Ayman Zawahri and Al Nusra Front leader Abu Mohammad al-Golani . Even before the air strikes, Nusra was facing difficulties and was losing fighters to the Islamic State, which is seen as more organised and determined to impose Islamic rule. 'This goes without saying, this is a crusader war that includes all infidel nations against the Islamic State,' said Nusra commander Abu Mussab al-Makdessi in a voice message posted in jihadi forums online in response to a question from an Islamist about the group's reaction to the strikes. 'Regardless of what happened between us, they remain our brothers, and the ideological bond between us is stronger than anything. We are ready to fight by their side ... our blood is their blood.' One former Nusra fighter inside Syria said the air strikes had strengthened Islamic State's position even further. 'Nusra is in a very difficult situation. I think now it should just announce the end of itself. Zawahri has to be brave,' he told Reuters. 'It is no longer like the old days. He needs to understand this. This is a new era with a caliph,' he said. Yet sources from and close to both sides said it would be difficult for the two groups to work together without merging - and with Nusra in a weaker position, that would effectively mean being subsumed by Islamic State. Such a decision should be taken by Zawahri himself. Sources say he should give a speech outlining Al Qaeda's position on the attacks soon. Structure: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi employs a network of deputies, councils and executives with the power to act on the ISIS leader's behalf. These senior militants are believed to give orders to a group of 24 regional governors, who in turn head 'councils' managing everything from the sale of oil, to the treatment of prisoners . 'Golani does not trust Baghdadi, and he doesn't like his politics and agenda, he sees it as distorted and astray,' the source close to the Nusra leadership said. But there were figures inside Nusra who were seen as more extreme that wanted to make peace with Islamic State, he said, naming top Nusra cleric Sheikh Sami al-Aridi, who is also close to Golani, as a particularly strong proponent of reconciliation. If that does happen, it would be an alliance and not a merger, the source said, adding merger would be impossible since Baghdadi, who has declared himself leader of all the world's Muslims, would want Zawahri to pledge allegiance to him. But even if Zawahri only orders Nusra to fight alongside Islamic State, it is likely to accelerate any haemorrhaging of influence from him to Baghdadi. Nusra, which has been trying with allies to remove its name from the U.N. terrorist list, was taken by surprise when U.S.-led coalition warplanes bombed several of its positions in Idlib province. Several commanders are believed to have been killed in the strikes, including Kuwaiti-born Mohsin al-Fadhli - also known as Abu Asmaa al-Jazrawi - reputedly a former member of Osama bin Laden's inner circle, and whom United State officials call the head of the 'Khorasan group'. Khorasan is the Islamic term for an area including parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan, where al Qaeda's main council is believed to be in hiding. The source close to the Nusra leadership said the Khorasan group was led by veterans from Afghanistan. 'It is a very small group - dozens of fighters only. It is more symbolic because it is composed of veterans who came from Afghanistan, and they are all wanted by Washington. They directly follow the Qaeda leadership,' he said. Another Nusra source said Fadhli and al-Golani had fallen out recently but had continued to cooperate. The strikes on the 'Khorasan group' also showed that the United States knew more than it should, he said. This could embarrass Nusra leaders by leading fighters to suspect they were infiltrated. Nusra leaders have reportedly gone underground and changed locations since the strikes. 'The precision of the raids on these positions shows clearly that the Americans have intelligence members among the Nusra fighters. It is very clear to us now,' the Nusra source said. Islamic State fighters and sympathisers have vowed to respond to the strikes. In particular they accused Saudi Arabia of being the mastermind behind the attacks. But jihadis also say the group is in no hurry and is waiting to see what the coalition plans to do. The group's leaders went underground even before the strikes, it has evacuated most of its buildings in its stronghold of Raqqa province, and its fighters are rarely seen on the streets. 'The response will be in every country that took part in bombing Muslims and their state,' said an Islamic State fighter in Syria. 'Masks have fallen. In our eyes, it fell a long time ago, but now Muslims across the world saw it.'","Al Qaeda affiliate in Syria under pressure from members to merge with ISIS .

"Brazilian police investigating the on-stage shooting of a rapper say he may have been the victim of a vigilante death squad with links to the police that could also be responsible for the murders of six other MCs. Daniel Pellegrine, a 20-year-old funk singer known as MC Daleste, was shot in the stomach in front of more than 4,000 fans while performing at a free concert in Campinas, São Paulo on Saturday night. Video footage of the incident posted on the internet shows the rapper slumping to the ground mid-way through a rant about the police. GRAPHIC CONTENT WARNING: Scroll down for video. Killed on stage: Daniel Pellegrine, a 20-year-old funk singer known as MC Daleste, was shot in the stomach in front of a crowd of more than 4,000 fans . Moments from death:  He was performing at a free concert in Campinas, São Paulo on Saturday night in which many of his songs contain anti-police lyrics. Right, the moment he is struck by the second bullet . This is the seventh death of an MC . since 2010. It could have been eight but rapper Julio Cesar Ferreira, . 26, also known as MC Neguinho Caxeta, miraculously survived when gunmen sprayed his car . with bullets in June 2012. Four lodged in his back, narrowly missing his . vital organs. Detectives investigating the murder of Daleste, who before his death was raking in £60,000 a . month as a rapper, are refusing to rule out the possibility that he was . deliberately executed by a hitman connected to the police. The . vigilante gangs are widely referred to in Brazil as ‘grupos de . extermínio’ or ‘Milicia’ and operate in and around São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Watch in full online here . Fatal shot: Video footage of the incident posted on the internet shows the rapper slumping to the ground after two shots taken from 20 to 30 metres away hit him in the armpit and abdomen, pointing to it being a professional execution . 'They are a group . of assassins that are made up of ex-policemen and serving officers,' said Marcelo Rezende, an investigative journalist and presenter of . Record TV’s prime-time crime show. 'They are mainly military police officers who have either been expelled from the force or have left to go into crime because it offers a more lucrative return than their salaries. 'They are supported by some insiders who continue to serve in the force. These bad guys use their experience combined with their police powers to carry out their criminal activities.' Attacked:  MC Primo, left, was shot dead in front of his family. Rapper Julio Cesar Ferreira, 26, right, also known as MC Neguinho Caxeta miraculously survived when gunmen sprayed his car with bullets in June 2012 . In April last year three military police officers were arrested but later released over the murder of a rapper known as MC Primo, a 27-year-old father of two who was shot dead on his doorstep in front of his family. At the time the military police launched an internal investigation which is said to be still ongoing. A year earlier in April 2011, MC Duda Marapé, 27 - real name Eduardo Antônio Lara - was also gunned down. Forensic evidence taken from the scene revealed that the bullets used in his murder came from a .40mm pistol - standard issue for Brazil’s military police. Did the police do it? On Tuesday this week, a video adding more ammunition to the claim of police vengeance killings emerged online. It was posted by a youth claiming to be a friend of the dead rapper. In it he accuses the police of assassinating Daleste . According to Pegolo Rui, the homicide detective leading the investigation into Daleste’s case, the killer knew what he was doing. Two shots taken from 20 to 30 metres away from the stage, point to it being a professional execution. The first bullet skimmed underneath Daleste’s armpit, the second was a direct hit. 'We're not dealing with someone who was shooting for the first time,' said Rui. 'The killer was calm and accurate.' On Tuesday this week, a video was posted online by a youth claiming to be a friend of the dead rapper accusing the police of assassinating Daleste. Talking directly to the camera, the unnamed friend claims that Daleste was stopped by uniformed officers on the day of the show. Brazilian police: Investigators into the murder of Daleste, who before his death was raking in £60,000 a month as a rapper, are refusing to rule out the possibility that he was deliberately executed by a hitmen connected to the police . 'The police asked him where did you get your expensive car from, money, clothes and other things. (Daleste) said from hard work but the police didn’t believe him,' says the friend. 'Then they asked him for money. He said he didn’t have any and he wasn’t going to give them any. 'The police said, ""Okay."" And they let them go,' he adds.  The friend then claims the same officers returned that night to seek revenge. Daleste’s father Roland Pellegrine said his son was a good boy who never had any enemies but was killed because of jealousy. Police have since retrieved the first bullet from the scene of Daleste’s murder. It allegedly matches the .40mm ammunition issued by the military police.","Daniel Pellegrine was a 20-year-old funk singer known as MC Daleste .

"Recruitment agencies are being inundated with requests from Romanians about how they can receive benefits. File photo . Recruitment firms are being inundated with requests from Romanians about how they can claim benefits in Britain. From January, residents of Romania and Bulgaria – two of Europe’s poorest countries – will be entitled to travel to the UK. They will be able to claim the same benefits and NHS care as other EU citizens. As a result, job agencies say they are being bombarded with requests from many who want to know how they can make claims. One consultancy, based in Birmingham, said it had turned away dozens who wanted to know which of the UK’s generous state hand-outs they were eligible for. Adrian Pop, the firm’s managing director, said: ‘People are calling me asking “how do I claim benefits?”.’ Mr Pop, who is Romanian-born, warned many would be attracted to Britain by the benefits alone. He said some agencies were offering to help Romanians claim benefits in return for a slice of the money. ‘Some Roma families will come to the UK with seven or eight children and claim £3,000 a month,’ he said. ‘But this is the system that Britain has created.’ He added many would claim to be self employed so they can get a National Insurance number, before simply claiming benefits. ‘There are forums where people talk about it. There are also adverts for companies which help them claim benefits,’ he said. ‘It is giving all Romanians a bad name in England.’ Other companies have set up lucrative hotlines offering migrants information on how they can claim benefits. The Mail found several such ‘immigration specialists’ openly advertising their services. One Middlesex firm is currently . advertising on a host of Romanian websites under the banner ‘find out if . you are entitled to claim benefits in the UK – call now’. Romanian migrants such as those who congregate in Marble Arch, London, will soon have access to the same benefits and NHS facilities as other EU members . Eurolutions boasts it has a 100 per cent success rate for helping clients obtain child benefit. And a London-based company is claiming to offer ‘assistance for getting benefits in the UK (maternity allowance, child benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit, housing benefit & council, Sure Start maternity grant etc)’. MPs said that until Britain left the EU there was no way of stopping large numbers from Romania and Bulgaria coming to the UK in January. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘It’s happening – everything the experts said wouldn’t happen is happening, and everything the Mail and others said would happen is coming to pass. 'Until we leave the EU, there is nothing we can do about it.’ Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has pushed for a change in EU law that would delay migrants' access to benefits . At a UK jobs fair in Bucharest on Saturday, hosted by Mr Pop and recruitment firm US Travel, dozens had travelled for up to four hours to hear about vacancies for housekeepers, waiters and bartenders. But others were more interested in the benefits on offer in Britain. Dorin Zamfirescu told the Mail: ‘The benefits are much more in England than here. ‘People in England get benefits, so what is the difference if I do? ‘Just because I wasn’t born in England, what does that mean? That’s prejudiced.’ A study by the European Commission last month revealed the number of EU migrants without a job living in Britain had risen to more than 600,000, the equivalent of a city the size of Glasgow. There were also calls by the Mayor of London Boris Johnson for the Government to push for a change in EU laws to delay migrants’ access to benefits. Paul Nuttall MEP, deputy leader of UKIP, said: ‘The Government’s Euro chickens are coming home to roost. ‘UKIP have warned that this would be the result until we were hoarse, but the legacy parties have refused to listen. 'Now the taxpayer will suffer and our welfare system will be looted. What is tragic is that this is avoidable.’","Romanians and Bulgarians will be entitled to certain UK benefits from January .

"Scotland have been granted automatic qualification for the 2017 World Cup. The Rugby League International Federation have decided that seven of the quarter-finalists at the 2013 World Cup will not need to qualify for the next tournament, which will comprise 14 teams and will be co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. The exceptions are the United States Tomahawks, who qualified for the first time in 2013 and pulled off upset wins over Wales and the Cook Islands to reach the knockout stages but are not full members of the RLIF. Joy: Matthew Russell is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring a try for Scotland . Crunch: Peter Wallace of Scotland is tackled by Brent Kite and Nafe Seluini (right) of Tonga . Heartbreak: Shaun Johnson scores the winning try for New Zealand against England at the 2013 World Cup . Frustration: Sam Burgess shows his disappoint after England lose to New Zealand at the semi-final stage . The Tomahawks must also resolve the difficulties arising from having two rival domestic competitions but will still have the chance to book their trip to Australasia via the Americas qualifying tournament. Scotland, under long-serving coach Steve McCormack, were another of the notable successes of 2013 RLWC after going through their group unbeaten to earn a meeting with holders New Zealand in the last eight. The Bravehearts, who have risen to 11th in the latest world rankings, beat Tonga and the United States and drew with Italy to book their place in the quarter-finals, where they lost 40-4 to the Kiwis at Headingley. The other automatic qualifiers are holders Australia, New Zealand, England, Fiji, France and Samoa, who have also qualified for the 2014 Four Nations Series to be held Down Under this autumn. Ireland, who were in the 'group of death' in 2013 alongside England, Australia and Fiji, must qualify, along with Wales and Papua New Guinea, who also failed to win a match last time.

"An Ohio girl has been pulled out of the school  after being bullied for cutting off her hair to donate it to charity, her mother says. Ten-year-old Jetta Fosburg of Dayton had long hair when she decided she would make a donation to Wigs for Kids that could be used to help young cancer patients who had lost their hair. 'I have some family members who have cancer so I thought it was the right thing to do,' she told Fox. Bullied: Jetta was the target of a weeks of bullying from other students after donating her long hair to a charity supporting cancer patients . 'Of course, we were super proud,' Jetta's mother Heidi Fosburg told WHIO. 'We thought it was the coolest idea that she came up with on her own.' Chopping off 14 inches left Jetta with a short new hairstyle, but when she showed up at Pathway School of Discovery, her classmates started hurling hurtful insults at her. 'They said things like she wants to be a boy, she's ugly now, a lot of hurtful things,' her mother said. Jetta tried to ignore the bullying, but as days wore on and nothing changed, her mother asked the school to step in. She brought the issue to the principal, but his response according to Heidi was to tell the girl to 'tough it out.' Though he said he would 'deal with it how he saw appropriate,' the principal would not step in more aggressively because 'he didn't know of any child that had ever died from words.' Long: The donation yielded 14 inches of hair for Wigs for Kids and afterwards, Jetta decided to take her hairstyle even shorter . Snip-snip: Jetta's mother said neither of them realized that the haircut would have such a dramatic impact on the little girl's life . Support: A Facebook page created by Jetta's mother became a place for other people to share stories of being bullied and to voice support for Jetta . Eventually, Jetta's mother pulled her out of school because the weeks-long streak of bullying was taking its toll on her. To try and lift her spirits, her mom started an anti-bullying Facebook page which has now received almost 14,000 likes. Women have posted photos of themselves with their short hair and shaved heads in support of Jetta and other supporters have voiced encouragement. 'You just keep being yourself,' read one post from Tanna Rose Sherrill. 'Your actions speak louder and matter more to who you are as a person than any hairstyle ever could.'

"Despite their father's claim that they 'tend to do everything together' most siblings would balk at sharing their wedding day with their brothers and sisters - particularly the brides. However the five Waldie siblings - Emily, Sydney, Walker, Bradford and Brooke - synchronized their weddings and all married on the same day, one after the other, at the LDS temple in Mesa, Arizona. The brothers and sisters - aged between 20 and 28 - then threw a joint reception so large it had to be held in a hangar at an airplane museum. The joint Mormon wedding took place on August 10. One by one, the ceremonies were held - three in the morning with a break for lunch and then two in the afternoon. Scroll down for videos . Marriage en masse: From left, Todd and Brooke Cook, Walker and Jillian Waldie, Bradford and Megan Waldie, Doug and Sydney Schaub, and Will and Emily Allen. The five couples each include a sibling from the Waldie family . Getting married en masse was the suggestion of father Doug Waldie. After seeing that his children were in serious relationships, he joked that they should all tie the knot together. Doug Waldie told the Desert News: 'We do tend to do everything together. We’re the ones who would take all eight . to the grocery store. But I never thought they would each give up their . special day; they did it to be together.' The Waldies have eight children - one child is already married, another attends Brigham Young University while the third is still living at home. The details of the big day fell to the siblings' mother Kristen who made four of the five wedding cakes and most . of the food for the 1,200 guests who were invited. She also sewed special folders to hold all five invitations that were sent out. Big love: The Waldie siblings kiss their other halves at the airplane museum in Mesa, Arizona -which was large enough to fit their 1,200 wedding guests . Center of attention: From left, Brooke, Megan, Sydney, Jillian and Emily sit on the steps of the LDS Temple in Mesa, Arizona . The reception was held in Mesa's Air Force museum - with signs hung from the rafters to designate each couple's special wedding zone. However all the important moments were taken together - including first dance and removing the brides' garters. Fortunately for each bride, the marriage proposals took place separately. The eldest Waldie sibling Emily was the first to get engaged to partner Will Allen at Disneyland in California back in March. The couple met at work after Mr Allen moved to the state from Utah. Younger sister Sydney got engaged . less than a month later on April 16 after falling in love with Doug . Schaub over a shared love of college football. Brothers . Bradford and Walker made it a joint affair by proposing to their . girlfriends - Megan Turner and Jillian Alger respectively - on the same day, April 21, albeit in different locations. Kristen . Waldie said as the family began to plan for four weddings, it made . sense to combine the events so that family from out of state and across . the world could see all the brothers and sisters getting married. The huge celebration was completed when sister Brooke and her boyfriend Todd Cook got engaged just two months ago in June. The couples were already planning to mark their special day by organizing a joint trip to mark their first wedding anniversary next year.

It is a quiet road and there is no street light where I was filming. ‘If anything it looked like a massive star. ‘Eventually it just disappeared. ‘The whole thing is really mysterious and we are still scratching our heads trying to work out what it was.’","Mysterious glowing light was seen above homes in Eltham in south London .

"Rebel leaders in Syria warned last night that gunmen linked to Al Qaeda were undermining the battle to oust tyrant Bashar al-Assad.

One of the groups, the Raqqa Revolutionaries, is said to . have about 750 fighters. A video uploaded by activists from .

The video’s . title said it was a newly unified force of Nusra fighters and other . rebel battalions which had recently pledged loyalty. In one glimmer of reconciliation, Al . Qaeda fighters and a rival Syrian rebel group agreed a truce to end two . days of vicious infighting in the northern town of Azaz which militant . Islamists had seized from more moderate rebels. The clashes – dubbed a ‘civil war . within the civil war’ – have alarmed London, Washington and Paris, . especially as it is seen as weakening the two-and-a-half-year revolt . against Assad. Fighting has been intensifying between Nusra/ISIL and the . less effective but more moderate forces that make up the majority of . opposition fighters.

"The letters demanded to know why Marc, who claimed Employment and Support Allowance, hadn't kept  appointments to help him find work . The family of a man who died ten months ago have slammed benefits bosses for repeatedly trying to contact their dead son to ask why he hasn’t been to see them about finding employment. The letters demanded to know why Marc Whiteside, who claimed Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), hadn’t kept scheduled appointments arranged to help him find work, despite being told the 31-year-old had died. More letters chasing Marc, who lived in Langley, for £268 he owed the DWP for a crisis loan he took out before he died in March have also been sent. The DWP have apologised to the family for a ‘regrettable error’ and say they have taken action to stop any more letters being sent to Marc. His father Terry, 66, who works at Springvale Household Waste Recycling Centre, said it was ‘unbelievable’ the letters were still arriving 10 months after his son died. He said: 'Every time I ring them up they apologise and say the letters will stop, but they keep on arriving. 'It’s almost a year since he died and the letters are still coming, it’s just unbelievable. A flagship government scheme to tackle Britain’s troubled families has helped just 720 people back to work. The Whitehall spending watchdog warned the scheme, which set an overall target of getting 20,000 into jobs, was ‘under-performing’ and urged ministers to intervene more quickly when things go wrong. The project is supposed to turn around families, by putting children back in school, cutting crime and helping thousands of parents back in work. The Department for Communities and Local Government’s ‘troubled families’ programme has a budget of £448 million. The Department for Work and pensions (DWP) aimed to get 22 per cent of people on the programme into work employment over three years to March 2015, with a budget of £200 million. But the National Audit Office (NAO) said the DWP programme had achieved only resulted in 720 people finding work, just 4 per cent of its target. None of the firms it was using to provide services had met the department's target. 'If I did something that caused as . much distress as this at my work I would be sacked, instantly, yet no . one at the DWP seems to be accountable.' An . inquest into Marc’s death is yet to take place, but the family say they . believe his death was related to a prescription drug addiction which . also prevented him working and led to him claim ESA. The DWP have apologised to Terry Whiteside for the 'regrettable error' His dad Terry said he didn’t want another family to have to wake up to find letters addressed to their dead relative sent to them by the DWP. He said: 'Every time we get one of these letters I get very angry while my ex-wife gets really upset. 'I’ve written a letter to the DWP telling them exactly what I think of them but I dare not send it to them. 'I won’t accept them saying it’s a computer error as a computer does what someone has told it do to. 'When the latest letter arrived last week we felt we had no option but to go to the paper to try and get the DWP to do something. 'This year has been difficult enough for us all and we want to make sure another family doesn’t have to have the same battle with the DWP we’ve had.' A spokesperson for the DWP said the letters sent to Marc had been generated automatically, but said no more would be sent. They said: 'We apologise to Mr Whiteside’s family for this regrettable error. 'We have taken action to ensure further letters are not issued.'","The letters demanded to know why Marc Whiteside, who claimed Employment and Support Allowance, hadn't kept appointments .

"Ancient warriors armed with swords and spears from 3,000 years ago suffered from shell shock just like modern soldiers, according to a study. Soldiers who experienced the horrors of the battlefield and were left with post traumatic stress disorder is not a phenomenon of modern warfare, say the researchers. An analysis of ancient texts shows PTSD became common considerably earlier than previously believed, although the symptoms were explained away as 'the spirits of those enemies whom the patient had killed.' UK researchers have found signs of PTSD up to 3,000 years ago. They say soldiers experiencing horrors of the battlefield (stock image shown) is not just a phenomenon of modern warfare. The earliest reference had been from the Battle of Marathon, 490BC. Pictured is a Mycenaean Vase decorated with Bronze Age warriors . The earliest reference had been from the Battle of Marathon 490BC but scientists traced mention of 'shell shock' back to 1,300 BC in ancient Mesopotamia . The study, published in Early Science and Medicine, said that while modern technology has increased the effectiveness and types of weaponry, 'ancient soldiers facing the risk of injury and death must have been just as terrified of hardened and sharpened swords, showers of sling-stones or iron-hardened tips of arrows and fire arrows.' 'The risk of death and the witnessing of the death of fellow soldiers appears to have been a major source of psychological trauma,' the researchers from Queen Mary University of London and Anglia Ruskin University wrote. 'Moreover, the chance of death from injuries, which can nowadays be surgically treated, must have been much greater in those days. 'All these factors contributed to post traumatic or other psychiatric stress disorders resulting from the experience on the ancient battlefield.' Previously, the first documented instance of PTSD was Greek historian Herodotus' account of an Athenian spearman called Epizelus who lost his sight against the Persians in 49O BC at the Battle of Marathon and whose 'psychogenic mutism' followed. But it now appears much earlier traumas were suffered in Mesopotamia, now Iraq, during the Assyrian Dynasty between 1300 and 609 BC. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety caused by very stressful or frightening events. They may include military combat, terrorist attacks, assault, natural disasters, road accidents or witnessing violent deaths. PTSD can develop immediately after a disturbing event, or can emerge months or years later. It's thought that one in three people who have a traumatic experience are affected by PTSD, NHS Choices say. Sufferers often relive the event through nightmares or flashbacks and can feel isolated, frightened or guilty. Symptoms, including difficulty sleeping, can be persistent and severe enough to impact on a person's day-to-day life. PTSD is currently treated with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) as well as antidepressant medication. The study said that while modern technology has increased the effectiveness and types of weaponry, 'ancient soldiers facing the risk of injury and death must have been just as terrified of hardened and sharpened swords.' Shown is a stock image of a US servicemen returning home from Iraq in 2006 . Writings uncovered from the time mention the King of Elam's 'mind changed', meaning he became disturbed. The researchers argue he may have been suffering from PTSD. Trauma was also suffered by soldiers, with the male population of Assyria called upon to fight in battles in every third year during their military service, also possibly the cause of post traumatic stress disorders. But the researchers said people would have found it difficult to diagnose these traumas and to treat sufferers accordingly due to a lack of understanding. Clinical psychologist Professor Jamie Hacker Hughes, of Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, said: 'For many years it has often been stated the first documented evidence of post traumatic symptoms dates back to the Battle of Marathon, as chronicled by the historian Herodotus. 'This paper, and the research on which it is based, demonstrates post traumatic psychological symptoms of battle were evident in ancient Mesopotamia.. 'Well before the Greek and Roman eras, before the time of Abraham and the biblical kings, David and Solomon, and contemporarily with the time of the Pharaohs. There really is nothing new under the sun. 'Especially significant is this evidence comes from the area known as the cradle of civilisation and, of course, the site of much recent conflict including the recent Gulf and Iraq Wars in which many British service personnel were involved.'","UK researchers have found signs of PTSD up to 3,000 years ago .

"Two hapless restauranteurs - who became the first to be abandoned by Gordon Ramsay on Kitchen Nightmares - have become the subject of Internet ridicule after their ham-fisted attempts to repair their reputation. Samy and Amy Bouzaglo, who clashed with the TV chef after inviting him to critique their Arizona bistro, took on the entire Internet of 'haters' after the episode showed the married owners of bistro Amy's Baking Company in an unflattering light. After the episode aired on Fox on May 10, the online criticism for Amy's Baking Company flowed forth - causing apoplectic reactions from the Bouzaglos. See extract below... Under pressure: Chef Gordon Ramsay walked off his first ever episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to get through to Samy and Amy Bouzaglo about the problems with their Scottsdale, Arizona bistro. However, they say THEY stopped filming. Controversial couple: Samy and Amy Bouzaglo (pictured), owners of Amy's Baking Company, made headlines after appearing on reality show Kitchen Nightmares in May - and being accused of stealing their servers tips . Filming at the restaurant before Ramsey arrived showed diners waiting more than hour for their meals, with Amy cooking each meal one at a time. One told the Phoenix New Times: 'You could hear Amy yelling in the kitchen and Samy was running all over the dining room. 'Other tables were complaining and people were leaving because they were waiting so long for their food. My partner and I had reservations for 6:45. By 9:30, we still hadn't received our pizza.' And when one customer confronted Samy about the fact he still had not been served he as told to 'go f--- yourself.' Ramsay, who has made millions in the . restaurant business and holds 14 Michelin stars, was filming his 82nd episode at Amy's Baking . Company in Scottsdale, serving up his typical no-nonsense . advice of the venture's failings to the owners. Rage: The owners of Amy's Baking Company Bakery Boutique & Bistro respond to their 'haters' on Facebook after the episode of Kitchen Nightmares aired on May 10 . Threats: The owners of the restaurant appeared to lash out at criticism via social media . Fury: The post came shortly after the episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares featuring the Scottsdale restaurant aired . However even the fiery British chef . was left open-mouthed by the chaotic goings-on at the bistro -  which . included a young waitress being fired for asking a question and Mrs . Bouzaglo . threatening to call the police on a customer who tried to leave after . waiting an extra long time for his pizza. When Ramsay tried to give the husband . and wife team some pointers as to where they were going wrong, he was . met with open aggression from Samy and complete denial about the quality . of the food from Amy. When Ramsay tells diners that the . owners are keeping their waiting staff's tips, the chef ends up close to . trading blows with Mr Bouzaglo. It later comes to light that the couple have fired more than 100 employees - in a year. Negative comments appeared on Reddit, . Yelp and Facebook, calling the restauranteurs 'incredibly immature, . rude, unprofessional' while another added: 'these people were so . arrogant that they couldn't see that a Michelin-star chef was trying to . help them'. Claims: Days after the abusive messages appeared, the owners claimed that the social media accounts of the restaurant had been hacked . In response, the husband and wife team allegedly . began posting torrents of abuse directed at commentors on their business's Facebook . page. Shortly before the Kitchen Nightmares episode aired, the Bouzaglos wrote on Facebook: 'We do not feel the need to make any excuses for our behavior on tonight’s show.' They also challenged ex-employees to come forward with evidence that they had stolen their tips as was claimed in the episode. After . the show aired, hundreds of negative comments appeared across social . media sites, slating the owners' attitudes, their treatment of staff and . the quality of food. In . response, a message appeared on Monday on the Amy's Bistro Facebook page: 'TO . REDDIT. I FORBID YOU FROM SPREADING YOUR HATE ON THAT SITE. THIS IS MY . FACEBOOK, AND I AM NOT ALLOWING YOU TO USE MY COMPANY ON YOUR HATE . FILLED PAGE.' It was quickly followed by: 'This is . Samy. I am keeping note of all names here. We will be pursuing action . against you legaly [sic], and against reddit and yelp, for this plot you . have come together on. you are all just punks.' First fail: Gordon Ramsay was forced to walk off the 82nd episode of Kitchen Nightmares after being unable to work with the owners, who have courted controversy ever since the episode aired . Another . read: 'To all of the Yelpers and Reddits: Bring it on. you are just . p******. come to arizona. you are weaker than my wife, and weaker than . me. come to my business. say it to my face. man to man. my wife is a . jewel in the desert. you are just trash, reddits and yelpers just . working together to bring us down. pathetic.' The . war of words rolled on for several days, before coming to an abrupt . halt with this message on Tuesday: 'Obviously our Facebook, YELP, . Twitter and Website have been hacked. We are working with the local . authorities as well as the FBI computer crimes unit to ensure this does . not happen again. We did not post those horrible things. Thank You Amy . &Samy.' MailOnline was awaiting a response from restaurateurs Amy and Samy Bouzaglo. During a morning meeting to clear the air, the tense situation once again escalates with Amy threatening to walk out. Finally, Ramsay wishes the couple good luck with their business but tells him he cannot help them and leaves.","British chef filming at Samy and Amy Bouzaglo of Amy's Bistro in Arizona .

"Samsung has shown off a bendable battery that can wrap around a person's wrist. The company says it is the 'world's first truly flexible battery' and could be used in a variety of wearable devices. It comes after the company had announced a phone with a curved edge and a bendable battery for the Gear Fit earlier this year. South Korean tech giant Samsung has unveiled a flexible battery (shown). It can bend back upon itself and can even fit around your wrist or a cup. The battery is expected to feature heavily in upcoming wearable technology from the company. No further details were announced other than a release in 'years' The product was shown off at the InterBattery 2014 convention in South Korea by Samsung SDI, the energy and battery division of the company. The battery can either be laid flat or bent into a U shape, and is shown being bent back on itself. Flexible phones and other devices are expected to be the future for several technologies. The unique look is seen at eventually being a key selling point for mobile and tablets, but it doesn't feature heavily in many devices yet. Samsung's Galaxy Edge, for example, is one of the first phones to have a bendy part to the device - in this case a 'rolled' side where notifications and alerts can appear. 'An edge-based display will give Samsung's smartphone clear differentiation in a crowded market,' said Ian Fogg, an analyst covering the mobile industry at IHS in London. 'But for Samsung to maximise the potential of an edge display it needs third party apps to support the display with additional Samsung-specific functions.' It is currently only in development and no time frame has been put on when it might be used in actual phones other than a loose term of 'years', reports Digital Trends. It can apparently even be rolled up, as well as bent, and is intended to ultimately used in Samsung's wearable technologies. 'As we secured winding manufacturing technology - a key process to cut production costs - and related patents, we will be able to become a leader in the wearable era,' said spokesman Seo Hae-su according to the Korea Times. No further details were released about the battery and when reached for comment by MailOnline Samsung was yet to respond. The announcement comes a few months after other bendy devices were unveiled by Samsung. In April the company revealed the 210 mAh curved battery now found in the Samsung Gear Fit. Samsung says smart wristbands are a lucrative part of the emerging wearable technology industry, with them expected to take up to 25 per cent of the market.

Smart wristbands are expected to take up a quarter of the wearable technology market . Last month, meanwhile, Samsung announced the Galaxy Note Edge - a phone with a screen that curves around the phone on one side. This is intended to be used as a 'ticker' for notifications, and also as a quick access point to apps, alerts and device functions. The move also comes as Samsung rival LG discussed its own plans to make flexible batteries. Last year, the firm suggested it may release a battery so bendy it could be tied in a knot. Samsung also revealed another battery at the show, an unusual pill-sized one. Measuring 0.14 inches (3.6mm) across and 0.79 inches (20mm) long, the tiny pill battery has a capacity of just 10mAh, although again no further details were revealed.

"Former marine Brandon J. Raub has been detained for psychiatric testing . An ex-marine involuntarily detained for psychiatric questioning after posting anti-establishment messages on his Facebook page has sparked an outpouring of support from protestors who say the move is against his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Brandon J. Raub who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan was seized by authorities in Virginia’s Chesterfield County last Thursday for posting ‘ominous posts’ which refer to an upcoming revolution. According to Authorities one message put up by the 26-year-old earlier this month stated: 'Sharpen my axe; I'm here to sever heads.' After being questioned by secret . service agents and the FBI, Mr Raub received a short hearing, before being detained in custody for 30 days. Police . used a state law which allows emergency, temporary psychiatric . commitments upon the recommendation of a mental health professional to . hold Mr Raub at the John Randolph Medical Centre in Hopewell, although . he has not been charged with any crime. But there has been a public backlash to the move with protesters taking to the street outside the hospital and Virginia-based civil liberties group, The Rutherford Institute, sending an attorney to the hospital to represent Mr Raub. Rutherford executive director John Whitehead said: 'For government officials to not only arrest Brandon Raub for doing nothing more than exercising his First Amendment rights but to actually force him to undergo psychological evaluations and detain him against his will goes against every constitutional principle this country was founded upon.' Scroll down to see a video of Mr Raub being detained . This video grab shows the moment Mr Raub was taken in by officers for psychiatric questioning on Thursday night . The detainment of the former marine has sparked angry protests by civil rights campaigners who says it goes against the First Amendment . Thousands of people have joined a string of  Facebook pages in support of Mr Raub which have sprung up since his detainment. Speaking from the hospital yesterday Mr Raub said he was surprised by the turn of events. He added: ‘It’s ironic, I was considering re-enlisting, I’ve really enjoyed the six years I spent as a reserve and the two and a half years I spent on active duty. ‘I’ve been very open with the things I’ve had to say on my wall on Facebook. It’s interesting to me that the Government is watching Facebook in the first place. That ought to raise some eyebrows and cause some good American citizens some concern.’ A string of Facebook pages have been created in support of Mr Raub . Raub's mother, Cathleen Thomas, said by telephone that the government had overstepped its bounds. 'The bottom line is his freedom of speech has been violated,' she said. Thomas said her son, who served tours as a combat engineer in Iraq and Afghanistan, is 'concerned about all the wars we've experienced' and believes the U.S. government was complicit in the September 11 terrorist attacks. One of his Facebook posts, she said, pictured the gaping hole in the Pentagon and asked 'where's the plane?' Whitehead said he found nothing . alarming in Raub's social media commentaries. 'The posts I read that . supposedly were of concern were libertarian-type posts I see all the . time,' he said. The big . concern, Whitehead said, is whether government officials are monitoring . citizens' private Facebook pages and detaining people with whom they . disagree. Dee Rybiski, an FBI spokeswoman in Richmond, said there was no Facebook snooping by her agency. 'We received quite a few complaints about what were perceived as threatening posts,' she said. 'Given the circumstances with the things that have gone on in the country with some of these mass shootings, it would be horrible for law enforcement not to pay attention to complaints.' Campaigners have taken to the streets to protest against Mr Raub's detainment . Whitehead said some of the posts in question were made on a closed Facebook page that Raub had recently created so he questioned whether anyone from the public would have complained about them. 'Support Brandon Raub' Facebook pages have drawn significant interest, and other Internet sites had numerous comments from people outraged by the veteran's detention. Raub's supporters characterized the detention as an arrest, complaining he was handcuffed and whisked away in a police cruiser without being served a warrant or read his rights. But authorities say it wasn't an arrest because Raub doesn't face criminal charges. Colonel Thierry Dupuis, the county police chief, said Raub was taken into custody upon the recommendation of mental health crisis intervention workers. He said the action was taken under the state's emergency custody statute, which allows a magistrate to order the civil detention and psychiatric evaluation of a person who is considered potentially dangerous. He said Raub was handcuffed because he resisted officers' attempts to take him into custody.","Protestors take to the streets saying the move is against the First Amendment .

"Pensioners will today be offered new freedoms to dip into their retirement cash. In the latest phase of the biggest shake-up of private pensions in a century, the over-55s will be able to withdraw several lump sums from their pension pots instead of just one. George Osborne’s move raises the prospect of pensioners using their funds almost like bank accounts to invest in property or shares, pay off debts or help children and grandchildren. Shake-up: The latest phase in changes to pensions will be announced today by Chancellor George Osborne . The Chancellor has already announced that they will no longer have to buy poor- value annuities. And a crippling 55 per cent tax charge on pensions left to children and grandchildren is being abolished altogether. Up until now, retirees were able to take 25 per cent of their pension tax free – a sum fixed on the day they first dipped into their pots. If you had a £100,000 pot at the age of 55, the maximum you could take tax-free was £25,000. The rest typically went into an annuity. However, in the Pensions Bill the Chancellor will announce you can dip into your fund multiple times and have 25 per cent of each slice tax free. The balance would remain invested and grow, again tax free – giving savers an incentive to keep their money invested in the stock market. Money headaches: Previously couples had to decide what they would do with their pensions the first time they dipped into the pot, creating a system which was less flexible than the one being introduced (posed by models) Under today’s proposals, if the 55-year-old with a pension pot of £100,000 was to withdraw £5,000 they would receive £1,250 – or 25 per cent – tax free and the remaining £3,750 would be taxed at their current income tax rate. The £95,000 remaining in their pension fund – and any growth – could later be withdrawn in as many instalments as they wanted – 25 per cent of it tax free. Mr Osborne said: ‘People who have worked hard and saved all their lives should be free to choose what they do with their money, and that freedom is central to our long-term economic plan. ‘From next year they’ll be able to access as much or as little of their defined contribution pension as they want and pass on their hard-earned pensions to their families tax-free.’ Criticism: Labour MPs said the move could encourage people to overspend early in retirement . Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and a Government adviser on older people, said: ‘The Government’s changes have the potential to help millions of pension savers make better use of their pension funds. Being free to access their money freely as they need to, rather than being forced to buy particular products, will be very popular. ‘It’s something you couldn’t do ever before because of the inflexibility of the system. ‘As soon as you wanted to take any money at all out of your pension fund, you had to secure an income with the remainder. So you had to buy an annuity or a drawdown product. ‘Now you will have the freedom to do what you want. However, people need to know that their pension provider will allow them to take advantage of the new freedoms. ‘Currently, most pension companies are not ensuring that their customers can take money out flexibly. I call on the industry to make sure people can really benefit from the new changes as quickly as possible.’ Some economists and Labour MPs warn that allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pots rather than forcing most to buy an annuity, providing an income for life, was risky. Most people at 60 or 65 underestimate their life expectancy and could overspend early in retirement, they argue. But Mr Osborne insisted that the 13million people in defined contribution pension schemes are ‘responsible people’ who had saved throughout their lives and were quite capable of making decisions for themselves, with professional advice. He used his party conference speech last month to announce another reform – an end to ‘penal’ taxes on pension cash left by people to their children and grandchildren. At present, if people die without exhausting their pension funds, their inheritance to any children or grandchildren over the age of 23 is taxed at a ruinous 55 per cent. But from April next year, the tax will be abolished altogether, bringing it into line with money left to spouses. In another boost for pensioners, the Government’s ‘triple lock’ to guarantee rises in the state pension above inflation and wages is expected to take effect today. Today’s inflation figures are the ones traditionally used to fix the pension increase for next year. But with experts saying the inflation rate is likely to be well below 2.5 per cent, the triple lock will kick in to ensure a rise at that level – meaning another significant real-terms increase in pensioners’ pockets.","Move will be announced today by the Chancellor George Osborne .
It is latest phase of biggest shake-up of private pensions for a century .
Change is in rule which allows 25% of pension to be withdrawn tax-free .
Previously the total was fixed on the day pots were first accessed .
It will now change with inflation, with 25% tax-free in every withdrawal .

"Hitler and Eva Braun ‘had sex without touching each other or taking their clothes off’ because he was so fanatical about hygiene, says author Martin Amis. Speaking at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature, the novelist claimed he believes the German dictator kept Eva at arm’s length and would achieve orgasm just by watching her lift her skirt. He also claimed that Hitler was an asexual and may have had a similar kind of sexual relationship with his half niece, Angela ‘Geli’ Raubal. Scroll down for video . Adolf Hitler pictured with long-term lover and wife Eva Braun who 'had sex without taking their clothes off' Amis told visitors he imagined the leader of the Nazi Party ‘would fortify his underpants with clean serviettes and then would go into some form of excitation with Eva Braun at a safe distance’. He said: ‘I imagine Eva would stand a good distance away and lift her skirt and then there would be some sort of soggy climax on Hitler’s part and that would be that.’ The award-winning writer was speaking about his second Nazi-era novel, ‘Zone of Interest’ which is being released 23 years after his first, ‘Time’s Arrow’, was published. And although he feels he has come to know Hitler well, he maintains the truth about his sexuality remains a ‘black hole’. Author Martin Amis made the claims while speaking at the Cheltenham Festival of Literature yesterday . ‘Sexuality is one of the ways we recognise each other,’ he said . ‘Knowing whether someone is married or gay or whatever it might be, you recognise that. ‘I don’t want to be reductive, simplistic or frivolous but I am convinced one of the reasons why Hitler is an unrecognisable figure is that sexually he is a void. ‘With Stalin or Mao there is clear pattern seigniorial behaviour - of having a big appetite – but with Hitler there is absolutely nothing.’ His explanation is that Hitler was ‘not quite the full quid’ and may simply have been insane. ‘In Hitler studies there are three schools of thought about Hitler’s sexuality. ‘One is normality but I think you can boot out that consideration immediately. Can you see Eva Braun relishing a post coital cigarette? Can you consider Hitler’s tender foreplay, a considerate and energetic lover? No you can’t begin to imagine that. ‘So I’d say normality is out. Asexuality is the other one - and the third one is perversion. ‘Historians and psycho-historians who adduce perversion all come up with the filthiest stuff you could possible imagine - coprophilia, coprophagia, all things to do with excretion.” ‘But there are no real clues about his sexuality - except that he wouldn’t take his clothes off, even for his physician and he was almost fanatical about cleanliness, which suggests to me asexuality plus.’ In his latest book he explores the horrors faced by thousands of Jews when they were sent to concentration camp Auschwitz. The author said one thing which had shocked him during research for the book is that the Nazis had their wives and children living with them in the death camps. Amis claims that Hitler kept Eva at arm’s length and would achieve orgasm just by watching her lift her skirt . Hitler asleep in an armchair next to Eva Braun in the teahouse on the Eagle's Nest in Berchtesgaden . Hitler kisses the hand of Eva Braun, in 1941. Author Martin Amis claims Hitler was an 'asexual' and insane . He also discovered how Jews had to pay for their own train fares to the camps - one-way tickets and with children under-12 going free. Martin Amis was speaking about his second Nazi-era book 'The Zone of Interest' at festival yesterday . But even though he was gaining in knowledge, Amis said he had still not discovered the reason for Hitler’s policies, particularly the hatred of the Jews. ‘One can’t understand the Nazi hatred because it’s anti-human, it’s counter-human. ‘It is a hatred that is not in us, it is outside man.’ Amis dubbed Hitler ‘a bourgeois anti-Christ’ and also spoke of his concern for the high percentages of people in many countries who remain anti-Semitic to this day. A survey of Greeks showed 69 per cent were anti-Jew, possibly proving that a country in economic crisis was more likely to feel hostility towards Jews, who are seen to be clever, successful and better off. He also said 93 per cent of Iraqi and Saudi Arabian people are anti-Semitic while Iran is the most benevolent country in the Middle East with ‘only’ 56 percent disliking Jews. In England the figure is eight percent and in Sweden just four percent, he added. Amis believes that for some reason Jews inspire either love or hatred in people - his own first love was a Jewish girl - and that few remain neutral on the issue. He is planning on writing a third novel set against the same grim backdrop. Hitler was rumoured to have had sexual relations with his niece Angela 'Geli' Raubal who later killed herself . Historian's have spent years debating the sexual preferences of the Nazi dictator - with some claiming he may have been homosexual. Despite sending around 100,000 gay men to concentration camps, scholar Lothar Machtan claims Hitler was gay or bisexual and his party's opposition to homosexuality was likely to be a defence mechanism oh his 'internalised homophobia'. But most historians reject this idea and say he was heterosexual with a number of female lovers. There were also speculation that he had sexual relations with his young half-niece Angela 'Geli' Raubal, who worked for him in his Munich apartment. Nineteen years his junior, she would attend meetings, restaurants and visit the theatre with the man she called 'Uncle Alf'. One of Hitler's opponents of the Nazi Party, Otto Strasser, claimed he forced her to urinate and defecate on him. Following an argument between the pair on September 18, 1931, Geli was found dead in her room with a gunshot wound to her lung. Police ruled out foul play and put it down to suicide - although an inquest was never carried out. After her death, Hitler was said to be devastated and went into an 'intense depression'. Of his supposed six female lovers, two committed suicide, one died from injuries eight years after attempting suicide and another made a failed suicide attempt. He was engaged to two women in his lifetime before he went on to marry Eva Braun, and subsequently the pair killed themselves a day later.","Novelist believes German dictator was an asexual and may have been insane .

"England has become the most overcrowded major country in Europe. Population growth is so rapid that four times as many people will soon be crammed in as France and twice as many as Germany.

Over the next 30 years the gap will widen because Germany, France and Holland will either decline or grow only slowly. The House of Commons figures – based on data from the UK and EU statistical agencies – show the huge impact of Labour’s open-door immigration policy. By 2046, an estimated 494 people will be squeezed into every square kilometre of England compared with 411 now and only 374 when Tony Blair took power in 1997. Lax controls: The figures - based on data from the UK and EU statistical . agencies - show the huge impact of Labour's open-door immigration . policy . The revelations will fuel the debate . over immigration, especially with the UK opening its borders to Romanian . and Bulgarian workers on New Year’s Day. James Clappison, the Tory MP who . obtained the figures, said: ‘Under the last Labour government, England’s . green and pleasant land became England’s green and crowded land. Number of people expected to be living per square kilometre in 2015 - by country . ‘For reasons which have never been properly explained, Labour instigated a policy of massive expansion of immigration. The fear must be a future Labour . government would do the same’. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the . Migrationwatch think-tank, said 90 per cent of immigrants to the UK . headed to England. ‘The rapidly growing population density is an inevitable consequence of Labour’s mass immigration of nearly four million in 13 years,’ he added. ‘We already see the pressure on maternity units and primary schools. Less visible is the pressure on housing, which is already in crisis. ‘We will need to build 200 houses a day for the next 20 years or so simply for new immigrants and their families.’ The House of Commons report says the number of people living in every square kilometre in England will rise from 411 now to 419 in 2015, to 433 in 2020 and to 460 in 2030. By 2046, an astonishing 494 people will be living in each square kilometre. The equivalent figure for France will be just 115, for Germany 204 and the Netherlands 421. By 2015, England will also be more than three times more packed than Poland – where an estimated one million of the arrivals under Labour originated from.

The large numbers packed into the . country will also affect water and power supplies, and will increase . pressure to build over green spaces. David Cameron, under pressure to . confront the electoral threat posed by UKIP, has changed the law to . prevent EU migrants claiming any benefits in the first three months . following arrival. In the wake of the open door immigration policies deliberately pursued by New Labour, England  is now the most crowded country  in Europe. By 2015, there will be twice as many people crammed into every square kilometre as in Germany, and four times more than in France. Only three decades from now, unless there is a significant tightening in border controls, there will be almost 495 people living in each square kilometre – compared to only 374 when Labour came to power in 1997. Vince Cable and his colleagues  on the Left disgracefully suggest  that it is somehow racist to worry about immigration. As our revelations show, it has nothing to do with race – and everything to do with how schools, social services, the NHS and housing can possibly be expected to cope with such unprecedented pressure. Officials say they want to reduce the ‘pull factor’ to the UK. Last weekend, tensions between the two Coalition government parties boiled over when Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable likened Tory policies to Enoch Powell’s notorious 1960s ‘rivers of blood’ speech. The Office for National Statistics has already warned that Britain must make room for almost 10million more people over the next 25 years – the equivalent of building a city even larger than London. The increase, mainly a result of immigration and high migrant birthrates, will push numbers to 73.3million by 2037. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Immigration has brought benefits to the UK and we welcome people who want to come here to contribute to our economy and society. ‘However, it is important to control immigration because of its effect on social cohesion, our public services, and on jobs and wages.’ The figures for the rest of the UK in 2015 are predicted to be: Scotland 40 per square kilometre, Wales 258 and Northern Ireland 131.

"Facebook and other social networking sites can actually send you mad, according to scientists in Israel. Researchers from Tel Aviv University have linked psychotic episodes in patients to internet addiction and delusions caused by virtual relationships cultivated on social networking sites. Although all the participants had underlying problems of loneliness, none had any history of psychosis or drug abuse, the team say. Case studies from patients in Israel have found that using Facebook, and other social networking sites, can lead to psychotic episodes and delusions. Lonely people are more likely to rely on virtual relationships and this can lead to hurt and betrayal . A study from the University of Gothenberg found that people with low income and low-educated people spend the most time on Facebook. And within this group, those who spent the most time on the site were less happy and less content with their lives. Up to 85 percent of Facebook users surveyed said they logged into the social networking site on a daily basis. And 26 percent of them felt 'uneasy' if they didn't log in regularly. Women spend an average of 81 minutes per day on Facebook. Whereas men spend 64 minutes per day on the site. Lead researcher Doctor Uri Nitzan of . Tel Aviv University's Sackler Faculty of Medicine and the Shalvata . Mental Health Care Centre said: 'As internet access becomes increasingly . widespread, so do related psychopathologies. 'Computer communications such as Facebook and chat groups are an important part of this story.' The study took an in-depth look at three of Dr Nitzan's patients. The studies found a direct link between psychotic episodes and their internet or Facebook communications. All three of Dr Nitzan's patients sought refuge from a lonely situation and found solace in intense virtual relationships. Although these relationships were positive at first, they eventually led to feelings of hurt, betrayal, and invasion of privacy. Dr Nitzan said: 'The patients shared . some crucial characteristics, including loneliness or vulnerability due . to the loss of or separation from a loved one, relative inexperience . with technology, and no prior history of psychosis or substance abuse. 'In each case, a connection was found . between the gradual development and exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, . including delusions, anxiety, confusion, and intensified use of . computer communications. 'The good news is that all of the . patients, who willingly sought out treatment on their own, were able to . make a full recovery with proper treatment and care.' A study in 2012 found that women spend the most time on Facebook - 81 minutes per day - compared to 64 minutes for men. The poorly educated are most likely to be addicted to the site, too . Dr Nitzan said: 'All of the . patients developed psychotic symptoms related to the situation, . including delusions regarding the person behind the screen and their . connection through the computer. 'Two patients began to feel . vulnerable as a result of sharing private information, and one even . experienced tactile hallucinations, believing that the person beyond the . screen was physically touching her. 'Some of the problematic features of . the internet relate to issues of geographical and spatial distortion, . the absence of non-verbal cues, and the tendency to idealise the person . with whom someone is communicating, becoming intimate without ever . meeting face-to-face.' He added that mental health professionals should not overlook the internet's influence when speaking to patients. 'When you ask . somebody about their social life, it's very sensible to ask about . Facebook and social networking habits, as well as internet use. Here are six basic statements. Choose from the following scale: 1 = Very rarely; 2 = Rarely; 3 = Sometimes; 4 = Often and 5 = Very often. You spend a lot of time thinking about Facebook or plan use of Facebook. You feel an urge to use Facebook more and more. You use Facebook in order to forget about personal problems. You have tried to cut down on the use of Facebook without success. You become restless or troubled if you are prohibited from using Facebook. You use Facebook so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies. If you score 4 (often) or 5 (always) on at least four of these six points, then you could be addicted to Facebook. 'How people conduct themselves on the . internet is quite important to psychiatrists, who shouldn't ignore this . dimension of their patients' behaviour patterns.' Dr Nitzan said: 'Our study shows that . while technologies such as Facebook have numerous advantages, some . patients are harmed by these social networking sites, which can attract . those who are lonely or vulnerable in their day-to-day lives or act as a . platform for cyber-bullying and other predatory behaviour. 'All of these factors can contribute to a patient's break with reality, and the development of a psychotic state.' The paper was published in the Israel Journal of Psychiatry and Related Sciences. The authors plan to do more in-depth . research on Facebook, studying the features and applications that have . the potential to harm patients emotionally or permit patients to cause . emotional harm to others.","Israeli scientists find Facebook can cause 'hurt and betrayal'

"It was the most eagerly anticipated handset launch this year, and now Apple’s iPhone 6 has been named the fastest on the market. Independent researchers tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from Apple, Samsung, HTC and LG. Processing speed determines how quickly the phones can open apps, play videos and games, multitask and more. Apple’s iPhone 6 came out on top in Which? magazine’s poll, ahead of the firm’s supersized iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung’s Galaxy S5. Independent researchers tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from Apple, Samsung, HTC and LG. They found that Apple's iPhone 6 was the fastest, followed by the firm's larger iPhone 6 Plus handset and the Samsung Galaxy S5 (all pictured) Apple's older iPhone 5S model came fourth, followed by the HTC One and Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The Sony Experia Z2 came in seventh place, ahead of the LG G3 and iPhone 5C. However, in a blog post Which? noted that ‘we’re only ever a month or two away from the next breakthrough in mobile phone speed. ‘The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus might be the fastest smartphones around right now, but don’t expect that to last for long.’ Experts will soon test the raw speed of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4 and Sony Experia Z3, which are both expected to give Apple’s new handsets a run for their money. To put the phones through their paces, researchers used ‘Geekbench 3 software’ to calculate their speed. This graphic shows how they compare - with Apple performing well . To put the phones through their paces, researchers used ‘Geekbench 3 software’ to calculate their speed. The software is designed to replicate how people use their phones in the real world and calculates single and multi-core performance. The phones were given a score for the numerous performance tests, which were then combined and weighted. The higher a phone's score, the better and faster it is and if a score is double, for example, the phone offers double the performance. The raw speed of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4 (pictured left) and Sony Experia Z3 (right) - which have yet to be tested - are both expected to give Apple’s new handsets a run for their money . Both the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models have a dual core, 1.4GHz A8 processor. Their rivals, such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 have quad-core processors. Quad-core processors are believed to be faster, yet having more cores doesn't necessarily increase speed. It instead increases the phone's ability to do more things at once, faster, which is a small but significant distinction. Last year, Which? crowned the iPhone 5S the fastest phone,followed by LG's G2 and the Samsung Galaxy S4. The iPhone 5S was recorded to have a multi-core speed of 3,971, which is almost 600 points lower than this year’s fastest – the iPhone 6 at 4,569 – showing how quickly technology improves. While processor speed matters when it comes to opening apps and playing games, Which? did not compare the quality of the phones’ cameras or screens.","Independent researchers at Which? tested the processing speeds and performance of the latest phones from Apple, Samsung, HTC and LG .

"Consumers may be clamouring for a super-slim iPad Air 2, but there are more revolutionary tablets on the horizon. Intel hopes to lead the way by incorporating a 3D scanner into a tablet set to be released next year. The technology would allow users to scan an object and manipulate an image on their screen using hand gestures before printing it out using a 3D printer. Intel plans on incorporating a 3D scanner into a tablet set to be released next year ( a concept is pictured). It would allow users to scan an object and manipulate the 3D image on their screen using hand gestures, before possible deciding to print it out using a 3D printer . Intel’s RealSense technology, which allows devices to gauge depth like the human eye, will also be included in smartphones in the next couple of years, according to the chip maker, which is based in Santa Clara, California. Users will scan an object from 360 degrees using a specially-adapted camera, which the firm says will fit into the slimmest of tablets. The scanner will comprise a standard webcam plus an infrared sensor to collect the depth information. It will ‘see’ an object in a way that it can work out how it is put together in 3D so that it can be accurately recreated on screen. Tablets, as well as laptops and smartphones, will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears, while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens .

When working together, Intel's RealSense technology will let the tablet gauge depth like the human eye and will feature in tablets and smartphones. The idea is that a user could then manipulate the scanned object. So, if they scanned a teapot and wanted to make its spout longer, they could, and then print out the improved design using a 3D printer. 3D object tracking will also be used to bring books to life, allowing people to interact with characters and make playing games on tablets more immersive and precise to control. Intel says: ‘With Intel RealSense technology, you can scan, modify, print, and share in 3D, giving you a creative platform like you've never seen. ‘What's more, you'll be able to naturally manipulate and play with scanned 3D objects using our hand - and finger-sensing technology.

They will use advanced depth cameras as eyes and duel array microphones as ears, while people will use more precise hand and finger gestures to navigate screens. Facial recognition and natural language voice technology will also let users edit content without relying heavily on typing with a standard keyboard, which takes up screen space on a tablet.

"Kansas prosecutors have filed state-level murder charges Tuesday against the white supremacist accused in shootings that left three people dead at two Jewish community sites in suburban Kansas City. Frazier Glenn Cross has been charged with one count of capital murder for the deaths of 14-year-old boy and his grandfather outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City. Cross also faces one count of first-degree, premeditated murder for the death of a woman who was gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex. The capital murder charge carries the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond. Scroll down for video . Precautions: Frazier Glenn Cross chose to wear a quilted sleeveless vest rather than clothes during his Tuesday court appearance . Charged: Cross, 73, now faces three counts of murder and is expected to have hate crimes brought against him following the triple homicide on Sunday at two Jewish facilities near Kansas City . The 73-year-old Vietnam War veteran is scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm Tuesday in Johnson County District Court. Cross was arrested Sunday after shooting and killing three people at two different Jewish centers in Kansas City, Kansas. Cross is from southwest Missouri who founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in his native North Carolina and later the White Patriot Party. None of Sunday's victims were Jewish: . Dr. William Lewis Corporon, 69, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood, . 14, were at the community center for a singing contest audition, while . 53-year-old Terri LaManno was visiting her mother at the retirement . complex. The Southern . Poverty Law Center also monitors, to varying degrees, the activities of . hundreds of known white supremacists and anti-Semites at any given time. Federal authorities were . well-aware of the racist war vet, as were the SPLC and the ADL, who . sometimes was known as Frazier Glenn Miller. Familiar: Cross, seen during his arrest on Sunday and in the subsequent mugshot, was put in witness protection in 1987 in exchange for testimony on fellow KKK members . After a 1986 contempt-of-court conviction in North Carolina for operating a paramilitary camp, Cross went in hiding while free on bond and fled to Missouri. There, federal agents found him and several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades, automatic weapons and thousands of bullets. Cross entered federal witness protection programs in 1987, according to The Wall Street Journal, and agreed to cooperate with authorities. It is not clear when the protection ended. Indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of SPLC founder Morris Dees, Cross served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other KKK leaders. 'We were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups,' FBI special agent Michael Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Federal prosecutors say there's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime. Victims: Dr. William Lewis Corporan, and his grandson Reat Griffin Underwood (left) were at the Jewish Community Center for a singing competition while Terri LaManno (right) was visiting her mother at a Jewish assisted living facility. None of the victims were Jewish . Moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if Cross is convicted. 'The motivation behind these attacks was a hate crime... He was trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity,’ FBI agent Kaste said at a Monday press conference. Before the shootings, Cross had been contemptuous of some of his like-minded allies' reliance on social media over violent confrontation. 'He felt it was easy to be a 'keyboard commando,' but that the only way activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets,' said Devin Burghart, the vice president of the Institute for Research & Education on Human Rights. History of violence: Authorities were aware of Frazier Glenn Cross (who also went by the name Glann Miller) since the early 1980s when he founded the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, seen here in 1984 . Racist: In recent years, watchdog groups were aware of Cross, seen here in an undated photo, and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often, they became less concerned . Burghart said his group made a presentation on white supremacists to the Jewish Community Center in August, a discussion that included a description of Cross as an example of dangerous anti-Semitic figures in the region. It wasn't clear what, if any, steps were taken by the center to act on the information. The timing of the attack is worth . noting, as a group monitoring anti-Semitic attacks in the U.S. cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two . weeks before this weekend’s attack. In . a report April 1, the Anti-Defamation League noted a 19 per cent drop . in anti-Semitic incidents last year compared to 2012, part of what the . group called a 'decade-long downward slide' and one of its lowest . tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979.","Frazier Glenn Cross has been charged with three counts of murder and separate hate crime charges are expected later .

"Laughing as confetti floats to the ground around them, Maria Pantazopoulos and her husband Billy couldn't look happier as they celebrate their nuptials among grinning friends. But, just weeks after his wedding, Billy has been left a widower after Pantazopoulos drowned while posing for photographs in her gown in a river near Montreal. These first pictures of the couple, who had just bought a house together and were planning to have children right away, paint a heartbreaking picture of a future destroyed by a tragic accident. Pantazopoulos was dragged to her death after climbing into the water as part of a ritual called 'Trash the Dress', where brides pose for pictures while playfully destroying their wedding gowns. Tragic: Maria Pantazopoulos and her new husband Billy laugh with friends during their June 9 wedding - but just over two months later, she drowned while posing for pictures in her wedding dress . The 30-year-old  real estate agent had commissioned the shoot . following her June 9 wedding and instructed the photographer, Louis Pagakis, to snap away while she was in the Ouareau . River. 'At . one point, she told him, ""I want you to take some photos of me floating . in the water"",' the photographer's wife, Anouk Benzacar, said. But within moments of climbing in she realised that the weight of the soaked wedding dress was pulling her under. 'I can't anymore, it's too heavy,' she cried before letting go of the photographer and slipping under to her death, the Toronto Sun reported. Loss: Maria Pantazopoulos poses with her new husband, left. The 30-year-old was dragged to her death when she posed in a river near Montreal as part of a 'Trash the Dress' photo ritual . Horror: Pantazopoulos' wedding dress and shoes remain on the rocks after she was dragged under water to her death while posing for pictures as part of a popular 'Trash the Dress' ritual . 'She was screaming and scratching and . trying to stay above water,' Benzacar said. '[Louis] tried to swim with . her, but she was pulling him down. She was too heavy. He couldn't . breathe anymore.' The newlywed was dragged into the river, which is near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal, and her body was found by a scuba diver two hours later. Her bridal gown and high-heeled wedding shoes were later pictured lying on rocks along the river. Pagakis told CTV Montreal that he did everything he could to save her. 'She . had her wedding dress on and she said, ""take some pictures of me while I . swim a little bit in the lake,""' he said. 'She went in and her dress got heavy, I . tried everything I could to save her.' The soaked dress would have weighed at . least 100 pounds, provincial policeman Jean-Michel Masse said. 'It was . like an anvil,' he added to the QMI news agency. Struggle: Rescue teams attempted to save Pantazopoulos, but her body was found two hours later . Killed: A scuba diver found her body around 30 meters from her original posing place . Crime scene: Police found her body at 6pm on Friday after she failed to stay above water in the heavy dress . In a statement, her family said the bride had trusted she would be safe, and called for stricter safety measures. 'One thing we are certain about is that our Maria would have never put her life at risk,' the statement said. 'Her love for life, for her husband and for her family would never allow it. 'She trusted Mr. Louis Pagakis' recommendation for the location and felt safe enough to attend the photo . shoot alone with the photographers. 'The family asks the municipal . council of Rawdon to work on putting in place stronger security measures . to avoid any future tragedies.' Quebec provincial police spokesman . Sgt. Ronald McInnis described the site as being elevated and rocky, with . water 'violently' rushing below. Distraught: Photographer Louis Pagakis said that he did everything he could to save Ms Pantazopoulos . Plunge: She was pulled into the Ouareau River near Dorwin Falls, north of Montreal in Canada . 'She . was doing the photo shoot in about six inches or one foot of water when . part of her wedding dress got soaked and became extremely heavy,' Mr McInnis told MailOnline. 'She . started slipping and falling down when the photographer grabbed her but . she was too heavy that he couldn't pull her from the edge.' Leeza Pousoulidis told the Montreal Gazette her friend wanted 'Trash the Dress' photographs. 'She’s a really fun girl, and she just didn’t want her wedding dress . sitting in a box in the closet,' she . said. 'She said ""I want to have fun with my wedding dress. I want to . have great pictures and memories of me in my wedding dress.""' Mr McInnis . said Ms Pantazopoulos, from Laval, a small Island north of Montreal, was . found 100 feet from where she fell by a private diver who knows the . river and volunteered to help with the search. Loss: Pantazopoulos, a real estate agent, had just bought a home with her new husband, Billy . Ritual: This file picture shows a bride taking part in the 'Trash the Dress' phenomenon . The . diver pulled the young woman’s body from an area of the river which was 20 feet deep. 'She had sunk to the bottom,' Mr McInnis said. Two witnesses, the photographer and an assistant, were hospitalised for extreme shock. Mr McInnis . said the bride's husband was not present for the photo-shoot and . neither were any family members. However, her cousins and her brother went to the site when they heard that she had died. 'It's horrible,' Mr McInnis said. 'This is the first time I've heard of a . story like that. I told my partner, this is a story that is going to go . all around the world.'","First pictures of Maria Pantazopoulos, 30, and her husband Billy .

"The wealth gap between those governing the U.S. and the people they represent has dramatically widened, research shows. Against a backdrop of a vast budget deficit and fears of the fragility of the economy, analysis by the Washington Post shows that the median net worth of a member of Congress has nearly tripled over 25 years while the income of an average U.S. family has actually fallen. It calculated that their median net worth, between 1984 and 2009 and excluding home equity, rose from $280,000 to $725,000. The Occupy Wall Street activists have given voice to rising concerns over banker bonuses, unemployment and distribution of wealth. Here they are pictured demonstrating last week in Times Square, in New York City to mark the three-month anniversary of the movement . Research by the Washington Post calculated that the median net worth of a House member, between 1984 and 2009, rose from $280,000 to $725,000. This graphic shows the level of U.S. debt which has grown dramatically in the past 30 years . The analysis comes at a time of growing concern about unemployment and the prospects for the economy . Over those same 25 years the wealth of the average U.S. family slipped from $20,500 from $20,600, a University of Michigan study shows. In 1984, one in five House members had zero or negative net worth and by 2009 that number had dropped to one in 12. 1984 was chosen as the starting point for the analysis because it is the earliest year in which consistent wealth statistics are available, the newspaper said. From captains of industry to former finance executives members of Congress have always been richer than their fellow Americans. The reasons put forward for their wealth now include the high cost of entering politics in the first place as well as inheriting wealth and marrying into money. Protected from the economic ravages faced by the rest of the population the lawmakers are now edging into the '1 percenter' income group attacked by the Occupy Wall Street protesters. The anti-corporation protesters have given voice to rising concerns over banker bonuses, unemployment and distribution of wealth. The movement which began in New York in September - and marked its 100th day of protests last week - has spread to cities across the U.S. and across the world. While the rise in lawmaker's wealth might not attract controversy when times are good it starts to become an issue when times are tough. 'With the American public feeling all this economic pain, people just resent it more,' Professor Alan J Ziobrowski of Georgia State told the New York Times. As Wall Street closed for the .

The New York Times' report into the wealth of members of Congress found that they were also getting rich compared with affluent Americans. It found that the median net worth of members of Congress rose 15 per cent from 2004 to 2010 as the net worth of the richest 10 per cent of the country remained for the most part flat. This disparity between those they represent also translated into a wider gap in their experiences of the economy, the Post found. It interviewed Gary Myers, the son of a bricklayer, a Republican who entered Congress in 1975. He said his experience of having worked as a foreman in a steel mill shaped his outlook and led him to vote in favour of raising the minimum wage and helped him to understand the need for workers to have a safety net. 'It would be hard to argue that the work in the steel mill didn't give me a different perspective,' he told the Post. 'I think everybody's history has an impact on them.' The same area is now represented by Republican Mike Kelly who was elected last year. After graduating he married the heiress to an oil fortune and took over his father's car dealership where he had worked as a youngster. He told the paper he believed he was overtaxed already and that unemployment benefits made some people less willing to look for employment.","Median net worth of member of Congress rose from $280,000 to $725,000 between 1984 and 2009 .

"A murder investigation  was under way yesterday after the body of a young woman was found on the Queen’s estate at Sandringham. The remains were discovered in a copse close to where senior members of the Royal Family had gathered to enjoy their Boxing Day shoot. A dog walker stumbled across the  body at 4pm on New Year’s Day. Sandringham house where the Queen resides, and circled, wherwe the woman's body was found . Detectives said it had been lying on the Norfolk estate for up to four months. They confirmed the woman was ‘probably . the victim of a murder’ but would not reveal how she might have been . killed or if she was clothed. Officers are sifting through missing . person reports in the north Norfolk area. If this does not produce a . match they will examine cold cases nationwide. The Queen spent the festive period at . Sandringham and is still in residence. She is thought to have been . briefed by police about the investigation. Grim discovery: Police guard the entrance to woods where a body was found on the Sandringham estate . Police say the circumstances suggest that the woman was murdered and are now looking at cold case files across the country . The 30ft-wide copse where the body was . found sits between two fields and is 200 yards along a farm track. It . is one mile from the entrance to Sandringham House and half a mile from . the Sandringham Stud where the Queen breeds racehorses. The Royal Family are thought to have been shooting in a field of sugar beet next to the copse last week. Prince Philip, 90, normally leads . shooting parties on the estate and has previously been seen with his gun . in the field next to the wooded area. However, he missed the Boxing Day . shoot because he spent four days in Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire, . where he had a stent inserted in an artery after suffering chest pains. He has been recovering at Sandringham since last Tuesday. A villager said: ‘Prince Philip loves shooting in the field because it is a brilliant spot to bag birds. ‘The beaters walk through the woods to . scare the birds so they fly towards the guns. The copse is quite wide . so often a lot of pheasants gather there so it means there is no . shortage of birds flying out. ‘It is incredible to think that the Royals . were just yards away from where this poor woman lay dead.’ The remains were found by a dog-walker in woods at the village of Anmer .

Macabre discovery: Alisa's remains were found on the Queen's estate at Sandringham less than a mile from where the Royal family gathered for Christmas (bottom left) Sandringham is the private country estate of Her Majesty the Queen. It is the property of the British royal family and not part of the Crown Estate. In 1862, Sandringham hall was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII). But the Prince decide it was too small and had it knocked down and the current house built on the site. King George VI was born at York Cottage on the estate and died in 1952 at the house. Since then Queen Elizabeth spends the anniversary of her father's death and her own Accession privately with her family at the house. It is her official base until February each year and she is joined by the rest of the Royal family over Christmas. The house was first opened to the public in 1977, and there is a museum with displays of Royal life and Estate history. A shoot took place on the estate yesterday. It is not known if Prince Philip took part. The track leading to the copse remained cordoned off as officers searched for clues. Last night Norfolk Police said the young victim had been lying on the Sandringham estate for between one and four months. A spokesman said: ‘The pathologist believes it is highly unlikely the death was through natural causes. ‘There is no evidence of accidental . injury, damage due to firearms or bladed weapon.’ Earlier, Detective . Chief Inspector Jes Fry had described the case as ‘challenging’. He said: ‘The body has been in situ . for some time. The body is female and the circumstances indicate that . she is probably the victim of a murder. ‘We will be continuing our inquiries . over the next few days and weeks to establish who she is and how she . came to be here. 'Members of the public were walking around, but unless . someone went into that wooded area, they would not have found her.’ Mr Fry added: ‘It is early days, but . on the face of things, it could be a challenging investigation. We will . be looking at missing persons across the UK as well as locally. ‘We will also be using fingerprints . and DNA to help identify the  victim.’ Mr Fry said that one of the . missing persons cases being looked at would be that of Latvian-born . teenager Alisa Dmitrijeva, who disappeared shortly after midnight in .

JP Morgan refused to say what role the man had, although a source said he was a banker. He worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired. Mr Broeksmit was also employed by Merrill Lynch for a period. Mr Broeksmit was one of around 100 bankers who left Merrill Lynch for Deutsche when its investment banking arm was founded in the 1990s. He was involved in the process of rescuing the bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investment banks found their debts were 'toxic', and unlikely ever to be repaid. Mr Broeksmit, a renowned risk expert, assisted the bank's efforts to shift the worst of the debt, and reduce its total amount of lending.

"Employees at JP Morgan have held a minute's silence today for a bank executive who died after jumping 500ft from the top of the bank's European headquarters in London yesterday. Gabriel Magee, an American senior manager, 39, fell from the 33-storey skyscraper at around 8am and was found on the ninth floor roof, which surrounds the Canary Wharf skyscraper. His body was left in full view of City workers in surrounding buildings for up to four hours as police investigated the death. Tragedy: IT executive Gabriel Magee was found dead at the end of January after jumping from the top of JP Morgan's headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, and landing on a surrounding roof .

Senior colleagues were last night investigating Mr Magee’s  recent workload as rumours swirled around the City over what may have prompted his death. Last night a colleague said: ‘They’re going to be going through his stuff to try to find out if  he’d made some kind of terrible error. It’s possible he had been in the office all night trying to put it right before the fall.’ Canary Wharf workers were in shock after the death, with one trader telling MailOnline that his body lay on the flat roof until around midday.

'I got into the office at about 8.10 and the body was on the floor and there were police up there, and they put a white cover on him. 'I think he was in a suit.

"An elderly British man faces up to three years in a Pakistani prison after he was tricked into reading the Koran in public. Masud Ahmad, 72, belongs to the minority Ahmadiyya sect, who under Pakistani law are banned from calling themselves Muslim, with Amnesty International saying he was deliberately tricked into reading the holy book in Lahore by figures linked to a right-wing religious group. The case comes just a week after Mohammad Asghar, a 69-year-old alleged paranoid schizophrenic from Edinburgh, was sentenced to death in Pakistan for apparently claiming to be the Prophet Mohammad in letters he wrote to government officials. Banned: Masud Ahmad belongs to the minority Ahmadiyya sect, who under Pakistani law are not allowed to call themselves Muslim or read the Koran in public. His family say he was duped into doing so . It is believed Mr Ahmad was secretly filmed reading from the Koran in November last year by two men posing as patients at the homeopathy clinic he ran in Lahore. Amnesty International say he was maliciously targeted because of his religion. Every year dozens of Ahmadi Muslims are charged with breaching Pakistan's strict blasphemy laws simply for practicing Islam, while they and other minority groups are also at risk of sectarian violence. Speaking to The Independent, Mr Ahmad's son Abbas, 39, said: 'We are concerned he will never see his nine grandchildren but we are concerned with his life. We know what happens [in] these sort of cases.' Abbas Ahmad said his father had been released on bail ahead of a trial and is currently in secure accommodation. He added: We want to bring him back to Britain... In Pakistan there is no justice. Someone has made a false case and they have sent him to prison for nothing'. Until he returned to Pakistan in 1982 for an operation to remove a tumour, Mr Ahmad had lived in London for 22-years working as a photographer. Strict: Scores of people have been arrested in Pakistan under the country's harsh blasphemy laws. Every year dozens of Ahmadis are punished by strict religious courts . His case echoes that of Mohammad Asghar - the mentally ill man from Edinburgh who was sentenced to death in Pakistan last week after he allegedly claimed to be the Prophet Mohammad. Mr Asghar was arrested in 2010 in Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, for making the claims in letters he sent to various government officials. But a lawyer who defended Mr Asghar said and the case was really a property dispute and that his 69-year-old client is currently in very poor health facing death for a crime that was never committed. Amnesty . International's deputy Asia Pacific director Polly Truscott said: . 'Mohammad Asghar is now facing the gallows simply for writing a series . of letters. He does not deserve punishment. No one should be charged on . the basis of this sort of conduct. David Cameron spoke out against the verdict in the week, saying he was 'deeply concerned' that the Pakistani court had failed to include medical evidence in Mr Asghar's trial.","Masud Ahmad belongs to the Ahmadiyya sect who cannot practice Islam .

"The world's most popular websites could impose an 'internet blackout' in protest at a proposed law which would extend government censorship in an effort to tackle online piracy. The battle over the SOPA bill has seen leading web firms square off against Hollywood media companies in a trade-off between internet freedom and intellectual property rights. Now it could burst into the open as technology giants are planning to 'censoring' their own homepages, according to a leading internet lobby group. Blackout? Sites including Google are planning drastic action to protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act . Sites such as Google, Amazon and Facebook could temporarily replace their usual homepage with a black screen and a message asking users to contact politicians and urge them to oppose the Stop Online Piracy Act. The move could come as early as January 24, when the bill is due to be debated in the House of Representatives. Marham Erickson, head of NetCoalition, a body representing many of the world's biggest websites, said that the drastic action of a blackout was being contemplated. 'There have been some serious discussions about that,' he said, while pointing out that 'it has never happened before'. Opposition: Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, is one of many tech pioneers hoping to defeat SOPA . GoDaddy, the world's largest domain registration company, had been a rare example of a web firm which supported SOPA, but was today forced to reverse its position after thousands of users deserted it over its political stance. A boycott campaign which involved giants such as Wikipedia as well as a network of individual users and small companies led to GoDaddy announcing today that was no longer in favour of the bill. The firm's chief executive Warren Adelman said in a statement: 'GoDaddy opposes SOPA because the legislation has not fulfilled its basic requirement to build a consensus among stake-holders in the technology and Internet communities.' The unorthodox campaigning methods used by opponents of SOPA are a response to their being heavily outspent by Hollywood firms. Author: Representative Lamar Smith (R-Texas), sponsor of the bill . Media companies are spending ten times as much as technology firms on lobbying in relation to SOPA, which they hope will crack down on copyright theft around the world by allowing the government to remove links to piracy websites from search engines and social networks. And Hollywood, traditionally a Democratic stronghold, has teamed up with the Republican-supporting Chamber of Commerce in its efforts to push the bill - sponsored by Texas Representative Lamar Smith - through Congress. Ranged against them are many of the tech world's most iconic figures, including Google's Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, and 'father of the internet' Vint Cerf. SOPA's opponents fear that the bill will allow the government and corporations to pursue alleged offenders without having to establish proof that they are breaking the law. The .

House bill would allow a private party to go straight to a website's . advertising and payment providers and request they sever ties.

"IKEA has been forced to recall two junior beds after several reports of a broken metal rods  which expose sharp edges and could injure a sleeping child. The leading furniture chain issued the recall across the world after a number of the beds had suffered the fault. The concerned models are called Kritter and Sniglar, and over 10,000 beds have been sold in Sweden alone. Total recall: Two of IKEA's junior bed models have been recalled after reports of the frame's metal rod (pictured) breaking which would injure children . The recall, announced by IKEA on its national websites, concerned several countries including its native Sweden and Britain. Other countries affected are Belgium, China, Czech Republic, Ireland, Israel, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Switzerland, Thailand and Turkey. To avoid children cutting themselves on the sharp edges, customers can return the bed, exchange it at the store or pick up a free repair kit, IKEA said. Anna Pilkrona Godden, Swedish spokesperson for IKEA said about 10,000 beds of the two models had been sold in the Scandinavian country, but she was unable to specify how many beds had been sold abroad. Worldwide alert: The recall of the beds was made across the globe in countries including Britain, China and Canada . The flat-pack giant was founded by 87-year-old Ingvar Kamprad in 1943, celebrating its 70th anniversary this year. IKEA is the world’s largest furniture retailer, recording an annual net profit of £3.2billion in 2012, achieving sales of £27.6billion in 44 countries. In the UK, where the company first set up shop in 1987, it was voted the country’s most popular shop in a survey.

"Pulling hard on a cigarette as she sauntered down the road, the unkempt brunette in the hoodie barely drew a glance from photographers outside Ronnie Scott’s nightclub in Soho last week. The flashbulbs duly exploded into action for Kate Moss, Noel Gallagher, Stephen Fry and many more. But what of the girl in the tracksuit and grubby trainers? She would have looked more at home begging for change. It was only when her companion was refused entry to the club, sparking an unseemly argument with door staff, that the penny dropped. This was no beggar; it was Kate Rothschild, mother-of-three and heiress to one of the world’s most illustrious — and notorious — banking dynasties, with her rapper boyfriend, the extravagantly monikered Jay Electronica. ‘To be quite frank I was shocked when I saw the pictures,’ a long-standing family friend of the Rothschilds told me this week. ‘One tries not to jump to conclusions, but when she goes out looking like that it is terribly worrying. Dishevelled: Kate Rothschild with Jay Electronica last week . ‘The past 18 months have been particularly difficult for Kate. Everyone had been hoping that things would settle down, but she is increasingly out of reach. Fundamentally, she is a wonderful girl with a sensible head on her shoulders. She’s also a great mum. But there is a wild, creative side which has a tendency to give everyone around her sleepless nights. ‘From what I hear of the events the other day, they made quite a spectacle of themselves. What was she thinking?’ Indeed, Kate Rothschild’s life has undergone a total transformation since 2005, when she was happy to describe herself as a housewife. Now she is a rock chick, hanging out with rappers. It is certainly hard to believe that . Tuesday’s apparition is the stunning girl who lit up the gossip columns a . decade ago in the society wedding of the year. The marriage of of Ben Goldsmith and Kate Rothschild ended in divorce in April 2013. Kate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty as she wed Ben bringing together two of Britain's most fabulously wealthy dynasties . Kate, then 21, was a vision of understated beauty with flowers in her hair as she wed Ben Goldsmith, bringing together two of Britain’s most fabulously wealthy dynasties. He was worth £300 million; his bride a comparatively paltry £18 million. Now, her marriage destroyed, she spends her life trying to control a wannabe rapper. As Jay’s manager, Kate, 31, has had to fit in with him — swapping designer dresses and jolly lunches for tracksuits and snatched cigarettes outside recording studios. Meanwhile, Jay, who has a daughter by a previous relationship and a penchant for marijuana and Jack Daniels, has introduced her to life a world away from her comfortable upbringing. When they go out partying, which is often, Jay likes to make an impression. His reputation is as a man who doesn’t care who he offends — a trait that many blame for his failure thus far to turn talent into record sales. A smitten Kate, however, feels he can do no wrong. Witness the events of last week, when Jay, 37, (real name Timothy Elpadaro Thedford) demonstrated that while you can take the rapper out of the deprived housing projects of New Orleans, a questionable legacy remains. Kate's marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben uncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the two . ‘He got into a massive argument with the bouncers because they wouldn’t let him into the club,’ says a witness to the fracas, which ended with the couple being admitted. Then, when they left, Jay was clearly the worse for wear because he started trying to open car doors, saying he was going to drive them home. Kate had to drag him away. ‘Then he got into another argument — I think it was something to do with the ridiculous shorts and knee-high socks he was wearing — and Kate just leaned against a car, looking fed up. ‘Eventually, they headed off home, but not with any dignity.’ Ben Goldnsmith was so angry when he uncovered Kate's affair that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a child's toy at her . Dignity, sadly, has been in short supply . since Kate’s marriage spectacularly imploded in 2012 after Ben . uncovered her year-long affair with Jay after reading texts between the . two. He was so angry that he is alleged to have slapped her and kicked a . child’s toy at her. Cue the police being summoned and a hugely unedifying public spat on Twitter, which culminated in divorce. Since then, Kate’s life has changed almost beyond recognition. Always interested in the performing arts, she had been dabbling in the music industry and had set up her own business, Roundtable Records, for whom Jay was a star client, before the marriage broke down. She has now swapped life within the London society bubble for a more chaotic existence with Jay. A number of society invitations have been discreetly withdrawn, not least because many of her and Ben’s mutual friends were unimpressed by the public manner of their split. ‘Kate leads a dual life,’ adds the family friend. ‘She is a fantastic mother, utterly dedicated to her three children, but when not on mummy duty she and Jay have a very different lifestyle. ‘When I met him I found him perfectly charming. In a curious way, he’s not at all dissimilar to Russell Brand because he is very passionate and articulate in an unconventional manner. ‘He’s a peacock, but a very masculine peacock. Whereas Ben is socially confident and comfortable dealing with huge financial deals, he wouldn’t be able to change a tyre. Jay could strip down the entire engine and put it back together. I think Kate finds that exciting. There is a passion in this relationship which was sadly lacking with Ben, for all that they were best friends.’ Like Brand — currently in a relationship with Kate’s erstwhile sister-in-law, Jemima Khan — Jay is not your typical ‘bit of rough’. His home, secured with the assistance of his ever-attentive manager, Kate, is a fifth-floor apartment in Belgravia. The few who have been invited in speak of a minimalist space with record decks, ashtrays (he and Kate are unreconstructed smokers) and bookshelves lined with weighty tomes including Sartre’s Being And Nothingness and The Communist Manifesto. Kate shares Jay's social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world . Jay nips around London on a motor scooter and spends the evenings at gigs with his girlfriend. Kate, who lives with her three children in a £20 million mansion in nearby Kensington, likes nothing more than to drop round to Jay’s at the end of the day and cook dinner. ‘It’s not like they’re jetting around the world and he’s hanging on her coat tails,’ adds the friend. ‘They’re living quite a basic existence and he’s very old-fashioned — when they go out, he pays his way. ‘It’s his combination of incredible talent and unassuming manner which appeals to Kate. She’s a thoroughly nice girl who just wants to be normal. She loves urban music, and she’d far rather go to Nando’s than sit in a VIP suite sipping Bollinger and chatting to chinless wonders. ‘They’re both square pegs in round holes. Perhaps that’s what has kept them together through everything.’ Certainly, they have weathered more storms than anyone expected. Last year, rumours abounded of an impending split when Jay was said to be spending time chatting up Cara Delevingne and her fellow models. But harmony returned. Today, Kate is happily divorced, combining motherhood with her new life. Family time is, in the words of a well-heeled contemporary, ‘a life of Batman costumes, cupcakes and play-dates’. Those who have observed her at close quarters say she is following her heart. Kate is understood to believe that were it not for her illustrious surname, she would have followed a different path. She shares Jay’s social conscience and believes his brand of spiritual rap can make a difference to the world. In America, many influential figures still have high hopes for him. Beyonce’s husband Jay Z, the billionaire overlord of rap, has signed him up. Yet for all his undoubted talent, he has yet to produce the goods. His debut album has been so long awaited it has become an industry joke. Occasionally, he gets drunk and takes to Twitter railing against his critics. His reputation as a womaniser is enhanced by the fact he has a daughter with Erykah Badu, the Grammy award-winning singer. Sadly, he has never seen much of the little girl, who lives in America.Kate’s faith in Jay seems unshakeable, but her music business is still to take off. According to her company accounts, Roundtable Records had stocks of £1,885 and cash of £761, but owes Kate £365,606. Looking on the bright side, her relationship with her ex-husband has improved markedly as they share custody and strive to do their best for the children. While Ben, 33, remains hurt by her behaviour, he, too, has moved on and lives near to the family home with his new partner, Jemima Jones, 26, a lingerie model now working as a film producer. It is a conventional life, but he is happy. Whether the same can be said of Kate is questionable.","Kate Rothschild is a mum and heiress to a world famous banking dynasty .

"You might think you have to pay through the nose at the moment to access the Internet. But one ambitious organisation called the Media Development Investment Fund (MDIF) is planning to turn the age of online computing on its head by giving free web access to every person on Earth. Known as Outernet, MDIF plans to launch hundreds of satellites into orbit by 2015. And they say the project could provide unrestricted Internet access to countries where their web access is censored, including China and North Korea. The New York company plans to ask NASA to test their Outernet technology on the International Space Station (left) so that they can begin broadcasting Wi-Fi to web users around the world (right) Using something known as datacasting technology, which involves sending data over wide radio waves, the New York-based company says they'll be able to broadcast the Internet around the world. The group is hoping to raise tens of millions of dollars in donations to get the project on the road. The Outernet team claim that only 60% of the world's population currently have access to the wealth of knowledge that can be found on the Internet. This is because, despite a wide spread of Wi-FI devices across the globe, many countries are unable or unwilling to provide people with the infrastructure needed to access the web. The Outernet project is aiming to raise tens of millions of dollars to launch hundreds of miniature satellites known as cubesats to make their dream a reality . The company's plan is to launch hundreds of low-cost miniature satellites, known as cubesats, into low Earth orbit. Here, each satellite will receive data from a network of ground stations across the globe. Using a technique known as User Datagram Protocol (UDP) multitasking, which is the sharing of data between users on a network, Outernet will beam information to users. Much like how you receive a signal on your television and flick through channels, Outernet will broadcast the Internet to you and allow you to flick through certain websites. By June of this year the Outernet project aims to begin deploying prototype satellites to test their technology . In September 2014 they will make a request to NASA to test their technology on the International Space Station . By early 2015 they intend to begin manufacturing and launching their satellites . And in June 2015 the company says they will begin broadcasting the Outernet from space . 'We have a very solid understand of the costs involved, as well as experience working on numerous spacecraft,' said Project Lead of Outernet Syed Karim, who fielded some questions on Reddit. 'There isn't a lot of raw research that is being done here; much of what is being described has already been proven by other small satellite programs and experiments. There's really nothing that is technically impossible to this' But at the prospect of telecoms operators trying to shut the project down before it gets off the ground, Karim said: 'We will fight... and win.' If everything goes to plan, the Outernet project aims to ask NASA for permission to test the technology on the International Space Station. And their ultimate goal will be to beginning deploying the Outernet satellites into Earth orbit, which they say can begin in June 2015.","An ambitious project known as Outernet is aiming to launch hundreds of miniature satellites into low Earth orbit by June 2015 .

"Unexplained rash? Check your iPad. It turns out the popular tablet computer may contain nickel, one of the most common allergy-inducing metals. Allergic to his iPad: A rash on this unidentified 11-year old boy was traced back to a nickel allergy caused by the use of his iPad, which was purchased in 2010. Case reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from other personal electronic devices including laptops and cell phones . Recent reports in medical journals detail nickel allergies from a variety of personal electronic devices, including laptops and cellphones. But it was an Apple iPad that caused an itchy body rash in an 11-year-old boy recently treated at a San Diego hospital, according to a report in Monday's Pediatrics. Nickel rashes aren't life-threatening but they can be very uncomfortable, and they may require treatment with steroids and antibiotics if the skin eruptions become infected, said Dr. Sharon Jacob, a dermatologist at Rady Children's Hospital, where the boy was treated. Jacob, who co-wrote the report, said the young patient had to miss school because of the rash. The boy had a common skin condition that causes scaly patches, but he developed a different rash all over his body that didn't respond to usual treatment. Skin testing showed he had a nickel allergy, and doctors traced it to an iPad his family had bought in 2010. Doctors tested the device and detected a chemical compound found in nickel in the iPad's outside coating. 'He used the iPad daily,' she said. He got better after putting it in a protective case, she said . Whether all iPad models and other Apple devices contain nickel is uncertain; Apple spokesman Chris Gaither said the company had no comment. Nickel rashes also have been traced to other common products including some jewelry, eyeglass frames and zippers. Jacob said evidence suggests nickel allergies are become more common, or increasingly recognized. She cited national data showing that about 25 percent of children who get skin tests for allergies have nickel allergies, versus about 17 percent a decade ago. She said doctors need to consider electronic devices as potential sources when patients seek treatment for skin rashes. Common: It is unclear if all models of iPads contain potentially allergy-inducing nickel, but studies show that a wide range of consumer electronics contain the metal .","Nickel is the most common metal to cause allergic reactions .
