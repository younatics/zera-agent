"(CNN) -- The U.S., European Union and international security organizations Friday called for an end to fighting between Georgia and militant separatists that has dragged in Russian forces. Russia's Channel 1 shows heavy tanks purported to be on their way to South Ossetia. President George Bush and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin discussed the conflict in Georgia, the White House confirmed. Both men were attending the opening of the Summer Olympics in the Chinese capital and spoke during a luncheon hosted by Chinese President Hu Jintao. White House spokesman Tony Fratto did not provide any additional details. But Putin, according to his spokesman, said: ""There are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region, and it's very hard to withhold them from taking part. A real war is going on."" White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said: ""I want to reiterate on [President Bush's] behalf that the United States supports Georgia's territorial integrity and we call for an immediate cease fire. ""We urge all parties, Georgians, South Ossetians and Russians to de-escalate the tension and avoid conflict. We are working on mediation efforts to secure a cease fire and we are urging the parties to restart their dialogue."" The U.S. military was also reviewing plans for the possible evacuation of the more than 2,000 of its citizens in the Republic of Georgia, two military officials said Friday. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told his counterparts in the United States and Germany and the European Union's foreign policy chief that Georgia was the aggressor and should immediately withdraw its troops from South Ossetia. The EU and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are sending envoys to Georgia to secure a cease-fire, but a senior U.S. State Department official said the United States would only send a representative after a cease-fire is in place. The European Union said it was working with other parties ""towards a ceasefire in order to prevent further escalation of this conflict."" EU spokeswoman Christina Gallach told CNN: ""We think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction."" OSCE chairman-in-office, Finnish Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb, said: ""The intense fighting in the South Ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full-fledged war. ""War would have a devastating impact for the entire region. I urge the Georgians, South Ossetians and Russians to cease fire, end military action and stop further escalation. We need to pull back from the brink of a full-fledged war."" NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer issued a statement Friday saying he was seriously concerned about the recent events in the region, and he called on all sides to end armed clashes and begin direct talks.  Watch more about NATO's attempts to help Georgia Â» . Carmen Romero, a NATO spokeswoman in Brussels, said NATO was in regular contact with Georgia's president and was talking to Russia. Britain also urged all sides to bring an immediate end to the violence. ""We are monitoring developments. We urge an immediate cease-fire in the fighting in South Ossetia and for a resumption of direct dialogue between all parties."" Georgia, formerly part of the Soviet Union, is now looking west and has ambitions of joining NATO. South Ossetia has longed for and sometimes fought for independence since the 1920s when the Soviet Government made it an autonomous region within Georgia. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia broke away from Moscow in 1991 and South Ossetia voted overwhelmingly for its own independence. Violence has been mounting in the region in recent days, with sporadic clashes between Georgian forces and South Ossetian separatists. Georgian troops launched new attacks in South Ossetia late Thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with separatist artillery fire. An emergency session of the U.N. Security Council on Friday discussed the dramatic escalation of violence. The session ended Friday morning without a statement about the fighting. Copyright 2008 CNN.

"During a surprisingly emotional appearance before a congressional panel on Tuesday, Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, admitted the league made a ""crucial mistake"" in its initial punishment of Ray Rice and got choked up when describing his commitment to improving their policies. ""I've committed my life, worked for the last 20 years as an advocate against domestic violence in an effort to keep others from experiencing this lifetime pain,"" Vincent said, his voice strained. ""I relate to the twenty million victims -- survivors -- of domestic violence, sexual abuse, in every community across our great nation."" Under pointed questioning from Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, and Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, who serve on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, before which Vincent appeared, the NFL executive admitted the league should have acted sooner in punishing the Baltimore Ravens cornerback. Rice was seen in two separate videos assaulting his then-fiancee, now wife, Janay Rice. The NFL initially handed down a two-game suspension for the star, before deciding to rethink the punishment and suspend him indefinitely. ""I don't think there was a need for a second video to impose a proper discipline,"" Vincent told Thune, the committee's top Republican. ""We failed in that particular area ... we made a critical mistake."" Janay Rice: Ray Rice was 'terrified' after hitting me . The first video, posted by TMZ in January, shows Rice dragging the unconscious Janay out of a hotel elevator. The second video, released in September, shows Rice hitting her with such great force that it knocks her unconscious, before he proceeds to drag her out of the elevator. The league has consistently denied that it saw the second video before it was posted online by TMZ. But, as Thune pointed out in the hearing, the league admitted in a June testimony that it suspected that a full video of the incident did exist. Vincent said regardless of whether the league had access to the video, or knew of its existence, it should have taken action sooner. ""As we look at our personal conduct policy, we failed,"" Vincent said. ""The commissioner failed to impose the proper Ray Rice penalty in the beginning."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has also denied having ever been granted access to the second video, telling CBS in September, ""We asked for anything that's pertinent, but we were never granted that opportunity."" According to Vincent, the NFL is working to hard reform their process of dealing with issues of domestic violence, with the goal of both preventing and punishing such misbehavior. ""We believe that wearing a uniform of NFL player is a privilege,"" he said. ""It is not a right. Every member of the NFL community must embrace this unique leadership role that we play in our society and the trust that you place in us."" But at the same time, Vincent stressed his commitment to ensuring that players receive fair due process. ""I support the interests of all players in a fair process,"" Vincent said. ""I have led these efforts. I know that a majority of our current and former players are terrific husbands, fathers and men who have made incredible contributions to their communities."" Vincent said he expects the full investigation into the Ray Rice episode to conclude ""at any time"" and he believes the report will be made public. Opinion: Ray Rice doesn't deserve second chance .","Top NFL executive tells congressional panel the league made a mistake in its initial disciplining of Ray Rice .

"(CNN) -- It's reading matter not for the faint of heart. Experts at Harvard said this week that they have confirmed that a 19th-century book housed in one of the university's libraries is bound in human skin. Scientists and conservators carried out a series of tests on Houghton Library's copy of the French writer Arsene Houssaye's ""Des destinees de l'ame"" and concluded with 99.9% confidence that the binding material came from a human. According to the library, Houssaye presented the text, described as ""a meditation on the soul and life after death,"" to one of his friends, a book-loving medical doctor, in the mid-1880s. The recipient, Dr. Ludovic Bouland, bound the book ""with skin from the unclaimed body of a female mental patient who had died of a stroke,"" the library said. Bouland left a note in the volume explaining what he had done. ""A book about the human soul deserved to have a human covering,"" he wrote. Centuries-old practice . Although binding a book in another person's skin may seem creepy nowadays, the library says it wasn't always so unusual and reviled. ""Termed anthropodermic bibliopegy, the binding of books in human skin has occurred at least since the 16th century,"" it said. ""The confessions of criminals were occasionally bound in the skin of the convicted, or an individual might request to be memorialized for family or lovers in the form of a book."" Bouland refers in his note to another book in his collection, SÃÂ©verin Pineau's ""De integritatis & corruptionis virginum notis,"" that was also covered in human hide. The skin on that 17th-century volume, now in the collection of the Wellcome Library in London, is tanned with sumac, a natural dye. Sheepskin rivals . The macabre version of ""Des destinees de l'ame"" was deposited at Houghton Library in 1934 by a book collector and given to the library permanently 20 years later by the collector's widow. The Crimson, Harvard's college newspaper, reported in 2006 that there were at least three books in the university's vast collection that were bound in human skin. But Houghton Library said that testing of the other two volumes, at the Harvard Law School Library and the Harvard Medical School's Countway Library, established that they were actually wrapped in sheepskin. ""Houghton's book is now the only known book at Harvard bound in human skin,"" said the library, the college's main repository for rare books and manuscripts. Tests to rule out apes . The tests, taking microscopic samples from various parts of the binding, allowed analysts to identify the source of the material through its proteins. The analysis of ""Des destinees de l'ame"" matched ""the human reference, and clearly eliminated other common parchment sources, such as sheep, cattle and goat,"" said Bill Lane, the director of the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics Resource Laboratory. But the scientists had to do further tests to make them confident that the binding didn't come from another primate closely related to humans, like the great apes and gibbons.

"As Weibo, the largest social media platform in China, gets ready for its initial public offering (IPO), a recent university study claims Chinese micro-blogging activity might not be as vibrant as expected. Only 5% of Weibo users generate original posts, while the rest of the Chinese micro-blogging world just re-posts from them, according to research by Fu King-wa from the University of Hong Kong. He also found that more than half of the registered accounts were ""empty"" with little or no activity. Weibo claims it has 130 million active users -- though Fu believes the definition of ""active user"" is debatable. In March, Weibo filed to debut on the U.S. NASDAQ exchange. It updated its regulatory filing last week, adjusting its offer to 20 million shares for $17 to $19 apiece, which would value the company at $3.9 billion. The IPO launch sparks discussions on the company's worth. Weiboscope . Fu has been running his Weibo monitoring project since January 2011. Dubbed the ""Weiboscope,"" the computer program was originally set up to expose and make publicly available the censored posts from a select group of users with more than 1,000 followers. Weibo penetrates deep into the Chinese online world. By 2012, one in every two Chinese netizens used Weibo, according to the China Internet Network Information Center. That year was also when Fu began analyzing the usage pattern of Weibo's registered accounts. To obtain representative data, Fu and his team obtained the timelines of a random sample of micro-bloggers. In March 2013, Fu had looked at nearly 30,000 Weibo accounts. He found that 57% of the account timelines were empty, and out of the active ones about 4.8% contributed more than 80% of the original posts. Fu stepped up his research in January and found the figures were becoming more pronounced. Sampling 1,500 accounts each week, Fu found only 5%, or just 10 million users, generate most of the original posts on Weibo. In contrast, Weibo claims it has 130 million active users but does not say whether these users post original content. But Weibo spokesperson Liu Qi questioned the analysis. ""The researcher doesn't have any cooperation with our database and he didn't obtain any data by accessing our official interface, as far as I know,"" he said. ""We know better than they do about our own numbers. I don't intend to offend third parties, but I believe our data are more accurate."" However, Fu argued his study is a better reflection of user activity. ""In the Sina Weibo's IPO F-1 document, 'active users' is defined as those micro-bloggers who logged in the system by different means,"" he said. ""I would say that this definition cannot reflect the real activities on Sina Weibo. For example, a mobile user commonly keeps the app in 'logged in' state but indeed has no usage at all. ""In contrast, my figures are calculated on the basis of the very nature of user-generated-content -- that is those who generate original posts. I think this is a much better way to indicate social media usage in the Web 2.0 era."" More reposts, more value . For Internet service watchers, Weibo's low active-user rate is not entirely a surprise. ""Research has consistently shown that active, original contributors constitute a tiny proportion, typically 1-2%, of any Internet service. So the figure of 5% cited in that research is comparatively high,"" according to Dominic Yeo, Research Assistant Professor from the Department of Communication Studies at Hong Kong Baptist University. Yeo pointed to one of the earliest and most often cited studies on the so-called ""free-riding"" of Internet users, where the Gnutella network -- a popular peer-to-peer file-sharing service -- was scrutinized to reveal that 70% of users share no files, and nearly 50% of all responses are returned by the top 1% of sharing hosts. He explained that active and original participation on the Internet by ordinary users has always been low because people do not primarily go on to these platforms to create content. For Weibo, users specifically join the community to share other users' interesting posts with their friends,"" he added. It also just takes a lot of effort for people to create original content. ""There is a considerable amount of 'social risk' in creating original content because you can't be sure that what you create will be popular or appreciated by others. Thus the costs far outweigh the benefits, unless you're passionate enough to write or create something original, you'll realize that it's much better to re-post something already out there,"" said Yeo. As for whether Fu's new findings will affect Weibo's upcoming IPO, Yeo predicted it would actually confirm Weibo's influence and value even more. ""The value of Weibo comes from having many users re-posting a particular item,"" he said. ""It is the ability to encourage people to re-post content rather than create their own that really matters. The company ultimately wields some control as to what becomes popularly shared and gains prominence through its data management. A business model based on a tiny proportion of active, original contributors is actually a norm for social media platforms."" Other Weibo critics point to larger problems on the company's horizon. Doug Young, author of ""The Party Line,"" an in-depth look at Chinese media says that even though he is a user of the micro-blogging service, he won't be investing in Weibo because ""there is the sense that Weibo has passed its prime. ""Most people treat Weibo as a news source, because they don't trust traditional media. The big question though is whether it can keep up with the times. I don't see how they have done much to innovate beyond knocking off Twitter.""","Independent research shows 10 million Weibo users generate nearly all the original content .

"He's 5 months old, about 10 pounds of adorable, and he already has more than 90,000 Facebook friends. His name is Lentil, and he's a French Bulldog puppy who has made quite a name for himself in Philadelphia by helping raise awareness of children with craniofacial abnormalities affecting the head and face, such as cleft palate or cleft lip. Lentil's story began in February when a litter of four puppies was born in New Jersey. All the puppies had facial defects; only Lentil survived, with a cleft palate and a cleft lip. Because of his palate problems, Lentil was unable to eat or drink on his own, and he had to be fed through a tube every couple of hours. He needed constant care, so Lindsay Condefer, a volunteer with the French Bull Dog Rescue Network of Philadelphia, stepped in to help. She began a 24/7 feeding program, making sure Lentil was getting nutrition properly and frequently. His palate was so deformed that food and liquid going up Lentil's nose and into his lungs was a danger. The first three months of Lentil's life were touch-and-go. Condefer says she was constantly on edge. ""In the beginning, he ate every two hours throughout, over a 24-hour period, and then as he got older, we were able to stretch it to three hours,"" she explains. It was obvious Lentil would eventually need surgery, so she sought the help of doctors at the University of Pennsylvania's veterinary school. She also started to blog about her experiences with Lentil and created a Facebook page called ""My name is Lentil,"" figuring it would be a good way to create awareness of the problems cleft lips and palates cause in animals including dogs. She never thought Lentil would become so popular. ""I started the blog first just to sit and write and get all my thoughts out, to like let people know what I was feeling and going through,"" says Condefer. ""And then the blog turned into his Facebook page, and I remember looking at him and thinking ... 'Wait, he has 3,000 people following him? Oh my gosh, he has up to 10,000?' "" Because Lentil was so young, doctors had to wait a few months before performing his surgery. Drs. Alexander Reiter and John Lewis, both with the vet school's Department of Dentistry and Oral Surgery, had worked on animals with cleft palates before, but Lentil's case was special because he also had the cleft lip. The two consulted with Dr. Jesse Taylor, a plastic surgeon at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, on the best way to treat the puppy. Because Lentil's lip was only a cosmetic problem that did not interfere with his eating and drinking, the surgeons agreed to fix just his palate. ""The cleft lip itself is more of a cosmetic surgery,"" Reiter notes. ""It's not really a necessity for patients that are not fully aware of what they look like."" Because Lentil would still have his cleft lip, the vet school wanted the pup to become part of a program it was developing where kids with certain conditions met animals with the same conditions. Lentil, the doctors felt, would be the perfect ""ambassodog"" for children with craniofacial issues. ""We started to talk about how it may be beneficial to be able to allow some of our veterinary patients who were having some pretty complex craniofacial surgeries and some changes in appearance to be able to meet some children and even adults who are going through some pretty similar procedures and having to deal with some similar problems,"" Lewis says. ""It's sort of a pet therapy where people can relate a little bit more with those pets that have gone through things that they've gone through as well."" It's that need to relate to others that pediatric plastic surgeons such as Taylor say is important, because kids with with facial differences need to feel as normal as possible. ""Our passion is to help these children and their families become normal parts of society,"" Taylor says. ""They need to be able to interact with other people on a very human level."" SInce that time, Lentil has visited hundreds of patients at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He's enormously popular there, and children such as hospital patient Danny Pfeiffer have bonded with him. Pfeiffer, 14, has a genetic condition called Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, in which the skull bones fuse prematurely, preventing the skull from growing normally and affecting the shape of the head and face. He says Lentil has helped him deal with the many complications that come with facial surgeries. ""He doesn't look like, you know, a regular dog,"" says Pfeiffer. ""So that kind of makes him special, so it probably makes kids who have something that I have, makes them feel special."" Since his successful surgery in May, Lentil has been able to eat and drink without help. He's already been the mascot for the Lentil Festival in Philadelphia to raise money for craniofacial awareness, and he just returned from a Children's Craniofacial Association kids' camp in Orlando, Florida, a gathering place for children nationwide with craniofacial conditions. Pop star Cher serves as a national spokeswoman for the group. When he isn't traveling, Lentil greets fans at Condefer's Philadelphia pet shop. They come to thank him for his work in raising awareness. Fans call him ""the Bean"" and themselves ""Beanstalkers."" Meanwhile, Lentil's Facebook page just keeps growing. Condefer still can't get over her pet's impact. ""Seeing him meet these children -- and he would just go up to them, sleep on their lap and you could see how they related to him and how he related to these children -- it was wonderful,"" she says. ""He's here for a reason, and he's made it for a reason, and that's what makes him special.""","Lentil, a French Bulldog puppy, was born with cleft lip and cleft palate .

"(CNN)Police rescued 37 babies and a 3-year-old girl after busting a child trafficking ring in eastern China's Shandong province, reported the state-run China Central Television. The newborn babies, many suffering from HIV/AIDS and malnutrition, were sold for between 50,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan ($8,000 to $12,912 dollars). The boys fetched higher prices than girls, according to the online video report published on Tuesday. Babies were often transported in large handbags and suitcases to prospective buyers. And they were allegedly fed instant noodles and leftover vegetables, according to Chinese state media. Authorities have arrested 103 people, suspected of trafficking or purchasing the infants. Police spotted a suspicious group of pregnant women being ushered into an abandoned factory in the city of Jining, last July, where they found baby diapers and other evidence of it being used as an ""underground delivery room."" ""We noticed there has been some new developments in the methods for child trafficking related crimes,"" Chen Shiqu, director of the Ministry of Public Security's Anti-trafficking Office told CCTV. ""For example, some criminal gangs would send pregnant women who are about to give birth via public transport to another city. The babies are then sold after the women give birth,"" says Chen. Squalid conditions . An investigator who was on the case said they detained seven suspects and found one baby nearly smothered under blankets in the run-down factory with squalid living conditions. ""At that time, the baby's face was already turning purple, if we didn't search through those blankets, that baby may have already died,"" said Liu Yang, a police investigator. In a two-month sting operation following the raid, police discovered that the babies were often transported from the factory in bags to a hospital for infectious diseases in a nearby suburb where they were kept, awaiting buyers. ""Out of the 37 babies we rescued, almost none of them were healthy. All had varying levels of some sickness. They let the babies eat instant noodles,"" said Hou Jun, a local police officer. One of the buyers, Liu Zhiyou said an agent told him it was an illegitimate child from a student. Some of the babies have remained with their adoptive parents, while others are in orphanages. The 3-year-old was reunited with her mother, according to Chinese media. According to Chinese law, child traffickers can be imprisoned up to 10 years for selling more than three children or sentenced to death in more serious cases. Major concern . Child trafficking has become a major concern in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in China and beyond. In March last year, Chinese officials uncovered four child-trafficking rings and arrested more than a thousand people for using websites and instant messaging groups to sell babies. A Chinese obstetrician was also convicted for selling babies after telling their parents they were sick in early 2014.","Police rescued 37 babies and a 3-year-old girl in a trafficking ring bust in China, reported CCTV .

"(CNN) -- What does it feel like to kill a man? James Lenihan of Brooklyn, New York, knew. He fought in Europe in World War II and he killed a German soldier during a battle in Holland. He described how it felt in a poem. I shot a man yesterday . And much to my surprise, . The strangest thing happened to me . I began to cry. So begins ""Murder: Most Foul,"" a work that echoes poetry about war in the tradition of William Shakespeare and borrows its title from the bard's ""Hamlet."" As powerful as the poem is, the story behind it is also fascinating. Sgt. James Lenihan returned home after the war, got married, had children and made a career as a salesman in the meatpacking industry. If he ever wrote any other poems, his son Robert and daughter Joan, who still live in Brooklyn, New York, don't know of any. In fact, they didn't know about this poem until after their father died. They found it when they were going through his possessions. Robert and Joan Lenihan found two typewritten pages, each with a copy of the poem. It was unsigned, but Robert believes the poem was written by his father and later typed up by his mother for safekeeping. The poem describes a killing in Holland, where Lenihan served in the 104th Infantry Division as it battled German units. It portrays a soldier very upset about taking a life. I knelt beside him . And held his hand -- . I begged his forgiveness . Did he understand? But even while he describes the shooting as murder, Lenihan makes clear he had no choice. It was the War . And he was the enemy . If I hadn't shot him . He would have shot me. Robert Lenihan said the poem is a bit unlike the father he grew up with -- a man who could be a ""tough customer"" if need be, not someone tormented by a fleeting, albeit intense, moment on a battlefield in Holland. ""I'm just starting to appreciate how much he suffered only now in this part of my life. When I was a kid, like if he yelled at me or something, I'd say 'Well, Dad's being cranky,' "" Lenihan said. Lenihan said even though the incident in the poem took place more than 60 years ago, it still resonates and should be a lesson to young soldiers coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan that they aren't the first to face such emotional turmoil as this. ""That feeling they may have of regret and pain and shock of what they've done. It shows they are not alone,"" Lenihan said. While Lenihan is obviously proud of his father's poem, CNN sent it to Georgetown University professor David Gewanter, who has published several books of poetry, including ""War Bird"" published last year. Gewanter called the poem ""accomplished."" In an e-mail to CNN, Gewanter said the poem ""is good, and its truths are that of experience and some literary traditions."" Robert Lenihan sounded surprised when he heard Gewanter's analysis of his father's amateur poem. ""I'm very deeply touched,"" Lenihan said. ""For an expert to assess it that way and make such important comparisons I'm amazed and quite touched."" The poetry professor said Sgt. Lenihan's poem reminds him of a famous portion of Shakespeare's play ""Henry V."" From this day to the ending of the world, . But we in it shall be remembered -- . We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; . But Gewanter said it perhaps most closely resembles ""The Man He Killed,"" a work by Thomas Hardy written at the start of World War I. In that poem, Hardy writes that the soldier and the foe he killed might have shared a drink or loaned each other money had they met somewhere other than a battlefield. Sgt. Lenihan's poem ends not with talk of loans or drinks, but a darker scene. I shot a man yesterday . And much to surprise . A part of me died with Him . When Death came to close His eyes.","Sgt.

"The man accused of killing a dozen people in a shooting rampage at a Colorado movie theater had offered to plead guilty if authorities would spare his life. But the prosecutor denied that request Monday, announcing that he will seek the state's highest punishment for shooting suspect James Holmes: the death penalty. ""It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death,"" Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler said. Speaking directly with dozens of victims' family members, Brauchler said, helped inform his choice. Many of them watched the prosecutor announce his intentions in court Monday. Bryan Beard, whose close friend was killed in the massacre, said one thought ran through his mind: ""Thank goodness. I am so happy this is happening."" ""The only way death will receive justice when somebody murders somebody else is death,"" Beard told CNN Denver affiliate KMGH-TV during a break in Monday's court proceedings. ""I guess you fight fire with fire."" Beard told reporters that if Holmes is executed, he wants to attend. ""I've already said, give me a front-row ticket."" New trial date . But the legal wrangling in the case is just revving up, and Holmes' trial won't begin until next year. The trial was originally scheduled for August, but a judge Monday pushed back the start date to February 3 and said it could be delayed further. Once it starts, the trial is expected to last four months. Public defender Tamara Brady argued that it is important to provide enough time to present arguments in the case. ""Your honor, this case is the most important matter this courtroom and this courthouse will ever hear,"" she said. ""They're trying to execute our client."" Last week defense attorneys filed documents saying Holmes had offered to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life behind bars in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. Prosecutors took the defense to task for publicly offering it, saying they hadn't been given enough information to even consider such a deal. ""Not only improper, but grossly improper,"" prosecutors said in a Thursday court filing.  ""For the intended purpose of generating predictable publicity."" The case against Holmes . Attorneys on both sides are under a gag order, leaving case watchers to divine tactics from court documents. Federal agents have said the 25-year-old former University of Colorado doctoral student planned the attack for months. Authorities said Holmes booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, armed with weapons, tear gas and body armor. He planned to ambush audience members during a screening of ""The Dark Knight Rises,"" authorities said, and he did. Witnesses who spoke to CNN said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. At the end of the July 20 rampage, 12 people were dead and 58 were wounded. Tom Teves, the father of shooting victim Alex Teves, told CNN's Piers Morgan Live Monday night that he thinks Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims. ""I have no interest in understanding him,"" he said. ""My interest would be to see him exterminated."" Attorneys prepare an insanity defense . Holmes faces 166 counts of murder and attempted murder for the shooting. Last month, a judge entered a standard plea of not guilty for Holmes. His parents sat among reporters in the courtroom during Monday's hearing. As the prosecutor announced his plans to pursue the death penalty, Holmes' father put his arm around his mother. Both of them rocked back and forth. Eerie sounds of cell phones amid disaster . Holmes' attorneys have suggested they intend to pursue an insanity defense. In the documents filed last Wednesday, his attorneys said they were still exploring a mental health defense, ""and counsel will vigorously present and argue any and all appropriate defenses at a trial or sentencing proceeding, as necessary."" Peter Burns was outraged at the possibility of an insanity defense. His friend, Jessica Ghawi, was among those killed in the movie theater shooting. Holmes' distracted appearance in court, he said, doesn't jibe with the details investigators have revealed about a man who they said created and executed a detailed, deadly plan. ""I think this is an act,"" Burns told CNN Monday. ""I think this coward that shows up every day in court with this aloof look in his eyes that he's just spaced out -- well, I can't imagine somebody pulling off something like this to be in that case. I think as soon as he knows he goes into the courtroom, he knows exactly what's going on."" Burns said he wanted Holmes to receive the toughest punishment possible, but he questioned whether the death penalty -- with the lengthy court proceedings and appeals that come with it -- was the right approach. ""We want justice, but at the same time we want closure,"" he said. ""Do we ever really get closure 17 years down the road?""","A victim's father says James Holmes should get the same mercy he showed his victims .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In spite of prevention efforts, new cases of some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are going up, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Much of the burden of STDs falls on adolescents and people in their early 20s, the CDC says. The report, ""Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2007,"" also said that women and minorities in particular are more likely to have sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs. That fact isn't surprising, experts say, as studies on STDs in the past have also shown that women and minorities bear the greatest burden of STDs. The age of those affected hasn't changed much either -- nearly 19 million new sexually transmitted infections occur each year, and almost half of those affect 15- to 24-year-olds. The CDC began a national syphilis elimination program in the late 1990s, targeted at African-American heterosexuals, especially women and their babies. As a result, the condition was nearly eradicated as an ongoing health problem in the United States. But in the last two years, the trend has reversed, said Dr. John Douglas, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention. ""The success we've been experiencing for a number of years in African-American heterosexual populations, particularly women, is beginning to be eroded,"" he said.  Watch more on the CDC's report Â» . Syphilis resurfaced as a danger in 2001, and cases went up by 15.2 percent between 2006 and 2007, the CDC said. Reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea together surpassed 1.4 million in 2007, the report said. Both of these conditions can cause infertility when left untreated. The CDC will address HIV rates in the United States in a later report. A record number of chlamydia cases were reported nationally this year, the report said. But Douglas noted that a major strategy is detecting infection before it spreads, so each case is an opportunity to prevent ongoing transmission. Chlamydia is the most common reportable STD and infectious disease, he said. Since the early 1980s, there has been a dramatic downturn in gonorrhea cases, but for the last 10 years, the rates have leveled off, especially in African-American populations. The CDC is looking at a number of ways to create awareness of the problem, he said. STDs affect not only individuals' health, but also the economy, the CDC said -- the conditions cost the U.S. health care system as much as $15.3 billion annually. The report reflects what Dr. Yolanda Wimberly, assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Morehouse School of Medicine and the medical director for the Center for Excellence in Sexual Health, sees in the clinics where she works. In her 14 years of practicing, she has been diagnosing more and more cases of chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea, she said. Based on the report and her own observations, it's safe to say that some of the prevention efforts are not working, Wimberly said. New, innovative methods will be required to get through to this generation of young people, for whom text messaging and the Internet are integral parts of daily life. Many people hold the misconception that STDs come along with a visible sign, such as irregular discharge or a rash or bump. But, in fact, most STDs do not present symptoms, she said. ""That's how STDs are so easily spread,"" she said. ""It's not people who know they have gonorrhea and who go out say, 'I'm going to spread it to all these people.' It's the people who don't even know, who maybe don't get checked up regularly."" It's important to be screened at least once annually, even twice a year for younger people, Wimberly said. She offers to test everyone who comes into her office for STDs, even if they do not have any symptoms or came to see her for a different reason, if they haven't been tested in at least the last six months. However, not all doctors are so conscientious about STD testing, Douglas said. Particularly in nonminority populations, doctors are inclined to think, ""The young woman sitting in front of me looks pretty healthy, she looks pretty respectable -- she wouldn't have a sexually transmitted disease, right?"" Douglas said. ""We simply miss those screening opportunities."" Other doctors simply don't want to broach the subject of sex with their adolescent female patients, he said. There's also the problem of access to health care -- some women do not have physicians for this reason. Current prevention efforts include promoting awareness of STDs, personal protective behaviors such as limiting partners and using condoms, and screening programs, Douglas said. A key area to work on is normalizing conversations about STDs and sexual health, he said. ""If the parents assume that's the doctor's business, or the teacher's business, and don't roll up their sleeves and get in there themselves, and if our schools aren't giving comprehensive education, and if our clergy and other community leaders who are interested in youth well-being aren't including sexual health on the agenda, we're going to create missed opportunities.""","CDC: Women, minorities, 15- to 24-year-olds bear greatest STD burden .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- As his presidency nears its end, a reflective President Bush suggested Tuesday that he regrets some of his more blunt statements on the war on terrorism over the last eight years and said he wishes he had not spoken in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner only a month after U.S. troops in Iraq were deployed. President Bush says his wife told him that as president, he should watch his words carefully. ""I regret saying some things I shouldn't have said,"" Bush told CNN's Heidi Collins when asked to reflect on his regrets over his two terms as president. ""Like 'dead or alive' and 'bring 'em on.' My wife reminded me that, hey, as president of the United States, be careful what you say."" The interview, aboard the USS Intrepid in New York, came after the president addressed a Veterans Day ceremony. Shortly after the attacks of September 11, the president said of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden: ""I want justice. There's an old poster out West that said, 'Wanted, dead or alive.' ""   Watch President Bush talk about his regrets Â» . Bush was also criticized in 2003 for his answer addressing insurgents in Iraq. ""There are some who feel like that the conditions are such that they can attack us there. My answer is, bring 'em on,"" he said then. On Tuesday, the president also referenced the moment aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on May 1, 2003, during which he declared an end to major combat operations in Iraq. ""They had a sign that said 'Mission Accomplished.' It was a sign aimed at the sailors on the ship, but it conveyed a broader knowledge. To some it said, well, Bush thinks the war in Iraq is over, when I didn't think that. But nonetheless, it conveyed the wrong message."" The president, whose legacy is sure to be hotly debated for decades, said there also is much he is proud of. ""I am proud to be the commander in chief of people who are so selfless and so courageous that they would volunteer to serve our country in a time of war,"" he said. ""I'm proud when I see people feed the hungry. I'm proud when I'm in Africa and see volunteers helping those citizens dying of HIV/AIDS."" In the wide-ranging interview, the president also discussed his Monday meeting with President-elect Barack Obama and said he consulted former President Clinton before his meeting with the future commander in chief. ""I remember the conversation I had with my predecessor Bill Clinton,"" Bush said. ""As a matter of fact, [I] called him yesterday and said, 'Bill, I'm getting ready to meet with the new president, and I remember how gracious you were to me. I hope I can be as gracious to President-elect Obama as you were to me.' '' Bush described the atmosphere in his Oval Office meeting with Obama as relaxed and said he offered the future president advice on the transition process. Bush also said Obama was specifically interested in how his two young daughters would adjust to life in the White House. ""It was interesting to watch him go upstairs,"" Bush said. ""He wanted to see where his little girls were going to sleep. Clearly, this guy is going to bring a sense of family to the White House, and I hope Laura and I did the same thing. But I believe he will, and I know his girls are on his mind and he wants to make sure that first and foremost, he is a good dad. And I think that's going to be an important part of his presidency."" Bush said he plans to return to Texas after he leaves office January 20 and ""may write a book"" but otherwise has few plans. ""No doubt I'm heading straight home. I miss Texas; I love Texas; I've got a lot of friends in Texas. ""I'll probably get back and take a deep breath,"" he said. Bush said he has begun to think about an outline for the book. ""I want people to know what it was like to make some of the decisions I had to make,"" he said. ""In other words, what was the moment like? And I've had one of those presidencies where I've had to make some tough calls, and I want people to know the truth about what it was like sitting in the Oval Office."" Bush expressed regret that Republican presidential nominee John McCain did not win the presidency but called the election of Obama ""good for our country."" ""The election of Barack Obama is an historic moment for our country. There are a lot of people in America who did not believe they would ever see this day. It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity,"" Bush said. ""I really do wish him all the best. I am just as American as he is American, and it is good for our country that the president succeeds.""","In CNN interview, president reflects on his term .

"Federal authorities have filed the first criminal charges in the investigation of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, people briefed on the matter said. Several suspects charged in the armed assault last September 11 include prominent Libyan militia figure Ahmed Abu Khattala, the sources said. Other identities were not disclosed. The counts initially sought months ago in New York are still under seal, according to the sources. The investigation of the attack that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans  continues, these people said, as investigators try to build their case against Khattala and others who authorities believe were involved. If CNN can interview Benghazi suspect, why can't FBI? Justice Department spokesman Brian Fallon declined to comment as did FBI spokesman J. Peter Donald in New York. But word of the development comes as the Justice Department has come in for sharp criticism from congressional lawmakers about the pace and progress of the investigation. Attorney General Eric Holder had earlier this year promised them that the Justice Department would soon make public what actions it would take. Republicans have demanded more aggressive steps from the incoming FBI Director James Comey. But people close to the case said the investigation has moved significantly in recent months. In that time, the FBI has released photos of what it called persons of interest who were present during the attacks, seeking tips from the Libyan public. It couldn't be learned when the United States plans to announce the charges or whether there is any intention to try to detain Khattala or the others. None of those briefed on the matter would discuss the precise counts. Benghazi attack timeline . In a recent interview with CNN's Arwa Damon, Khattala acknowledged being at the Benghazi mission after the attack but denied any involvement. Benghazi has become a political flashpoint in a long-running battle between the Obama administration and Republicans, who accuse it of not bolstering security before the attack, of botching the response to it and of misleading the public for political gain less than two months before the November election. The investigation is led by agents from the FBI in New York and has included some members of the Washington field office, who have traveled to Libya to interview hundreds of witnesses, those briefed on the investigation said. Khattala told CNN that he had not been questioned by either Libyan authorities or the FBI. U.S. law enforcement officials said it's not unusual for the FBI not to seek to interview defendants in a case while they collect other evidence. The Benghazi attack involved scores of militants using rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons. Stevens took refuge behind a fortified door with heavy metal bars to keep the attackers from breaking in. But they set fire to the mission -- a villa -- with diesel fuel. Stevens was overcome by smoke. U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview on ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that he would not describe the investigation as proceeding rapidly. ""It's been frustrating for many of us that it hasn't moved faster, but it is a very difficult working environment for our agents,"" said Schiff. ""Gathering evidence in Libya, you might imagine, is very difficult, finding, interviewing witnesses, extremely difficult."" But Schiff said there has been progress. ""We have identified many of the parties involved. We're still trying to identify what the command-and-control structure would be. A lot of missing pieces still, but we are finally making progress,"" said Schiff. King: Why Benghazi matters .","FIRST ON CNN: Charges filed against Libyan militia leader Ahmed Abu Khattala, others .

"A Facebook policy that asks users to provide real names on profiles has people from all walks of life worrying their accounts might be in jeopardy. Several gay and transgender entertainers reported last week that Facebook temporarily suspended their personal accounts for not providing their ""real name."" San Francisco drag queen Sister Roma -- a member of activist group Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence -- begrudgingly made the change on her personal profile to Michael Williams, a name she has not used publicly for 27 years. She registered her contempt for the policy on social media, leading others to come forward with similar claims using the hashtag #MyNameIs. Since then, the issue has raised concern beyond the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community that anyone could lose their account for not agreeing to Facebook's definition of a ""real name."" It also raises questions around identity and the right to self-determination on social media  -- whether you're a drag queen, a mental health provider or an everyday user grasping for some semblance of privacy. Facebook met Wednesday with San Francisco city officials and activists, including Roma, to discuss the policy. For now, the policy remains unchanged, but Facebook said it would ""temporarily reactivate"" the profiles of several hundred members of the LGBT community who'd been affected. ""We had a good discussion with the group about their perspectives on our real name standard, and we stressed how the standard helps prevent bad behavior while creating a safer and more accountable environment,"" Facebook spokesman Andrew Souvall said. ""Over the next two weeks, we hope that they will decide to confirm their real name, change their name to their real name, or convert their profile to a Page."" Many people use fake names on Facebook for safety reasons, Roma said. Victims of stalking and relationship abuse have a right to participate in social media anonymously, as do members of the LGBT community who cannot safely be ""out,"" she said. Public figures such as Roma have spent years building personas under their drag names on Facebook and continue to rely on it for socializing and networking. ""This is bigger than the trans community,"" Roma said. ""I don't have a problem with Facebook. I have a problem with the policy. It's shortsighted, and I don't think (Facebook) realizes the far-reaching implications of this policy."" What's in a 'real name'? Many outside the LGBT community sided with Roma's view of the policy, calling the right to anonymity ""an important element of free speech."" But with more than 1 billion users, Facebook says it relies on the community to self-police, suggesting that other users may have reported Roma and her contemporaries. ""We require everyone to provide their real names, so you always know who you're connecting with. This helps keep our community safe,"" its name and birthday policy states. If people want to use alternative names on Facebook, they have several different options, Souvall said. They can provide aliases under their names on their profiles, or create fan pages specifically for those alternative personas. ""As part of our overall standards, we ask that people who use Facebook provide their real name on their profile,"" Souvall said. So, what's a real name? The name you use on your credit card, driver's license or student ID, according to Facebook. Nicknames are allowed as a first or middle name if they're a variation of your real first or last name. Memoir details transgender sibling's journey . For many, it's not enough. Blissom BooblÃ© is a retired burlesque dancer who does advocacy work for LGBT homeless youth and HIV awareness, but her main source of income comes from being a flight attendant. Using a ""pen name"" on her personal profile allows her to earn a living ""while also doing work that I feel is vital"" but not always recognized as acceptable. ""Facebook is key to connection for just about everyone these days, and many of us are known more by our chosen names than by our legal ones. My concern is that this rule has less to do with names and more to do with whose identity is acceptable versus whose identity is not."" Those who no longer identify by their real name worry it will cause confusion among friends and professional contacts. New York drag queen Ruby Roo reluctantly changed his Facebook profile last week to his legal name so he would not lose friends and contacts going back to his high school years. Still, he's worried that people who never knew him as Christopher Van Cleave will ignore his messages and posts. ""It's like Facebook is telling me I can't promote myself in the way I wanna promote myself, personally or professionally,"" he said. ""While my drag career is my business, my only source of income, if Facebook wants us to use fan pages then they need to give us the same benefits that regular profiles have, like tagging statuses and pictures."" At least one person says he was targeted, even though he used his real name. Chase Silva was born in Hawaii, and his full name is Chase  Nahooikaikakeolamauloaokalani Silva, according to a birth certificate posted on his Facebook account. Silva says he also received a notification from Facebook temporarily suspending his account because ""it looks like you're not using your real name."" ""I am a proud Hawaiian who wants to be able display my Hawaiian given name,"" Silva said in a Facebook post. He did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Doctors, mental health professionals and therapists also are known to use pseudonyms or fake names so clients cannot friend them. ""It is counterproductive for a client of mine seeking mental health services to be able to, especially at the beginning of our work together, know and see me as I appear on Facebook,"" said Benjamin Harden, a pre-doctoral therapist intern in the San Francisco Bay Area, who uses a fake name on Facebook. ""Many of my colleagues also use a fake last name to prevent this exact type of access by our clients."" Public pages vs. personal profiles . The policy also raises concerns among entertainers and public figures who maintain personal and professional Facebook accounts under their stage names. A coalition of performers launched an online petition asking Facebook to let them use stage names on personal accounts. ""Our chosen names are an important part of our identities and how we interact with our peers and audiences,"" the petition says. ""We build our networks, community, and audience under the names we have chosen, and forcing us to switch our names after years of operating under them has caused nothing but confusion and pain by preventing us from presenting our profiles under the names we have built them up with."" The petition, which has drawn nearly 20,000 signatures so far, cites safety from stalkers and overzealous fans as one reason performers use stage names on public pages and personal profiles. Sex educator Sunny Megatron (not her real last name) is a frequent talk show guest, and has a show debuting on Showtime this fall. Over the years she said she has received numerous emails from stalkers threatening to attack her in her home. ""Divulging my real name publicly could very well put me and my family in danger. Anonymity is important not only to people in the public eye but to anyone who may feel threatened having their private info publicly available."" The petition also cites the limited functionality of public pages, implying that Facebook has financial motivations for pushing performers to use fan pages. Business pages only reach about 16% of their fans on average, according to Facebook's own accounting, but many performers cannot afford to pay $30 or more to boost posts, the petition states. Megatron uses her public page to engage with fans, but it's a ""one-way street"" because she cannot post or comment on other people's pages using her public account. That's why she uses her personal profile under her stage name for socializing, networking and building business opportunities. ""Engagement on business pages is a fraction of what it is on personal pages. Although I have three times the amount of followers on my business page as my personal, the interaction just isn't there,"" Megatron said. ""If I want to interact with them I need to have a personal page that I also do some business on,"" she said. ""And, frankly, in this day and age when you freelance, it's nearly impossible to completely separate online personal interactions from online business interactions. Any interaction could generate business.""","Facebook temporarily reactivates hundreds of profiles after meeting with activists .

"The locks at London's Olympic football final venue Wembley Stadium have had to be changed, after police responsible for security at the world-famous sports arena lost their keys. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN on Monday that officers at the ground first realized the keys had gone missing last Tuesday, July 24. Scotland Yard sent a team of detectives to the site to search for the missing set, but despite determining that they had not been stolen, officers were unable to find them. As a result, Olympic Games organizers and embarrassed police chiefs decided that all internal locks inside the 90,000-seat stadium would have to be replaced.

These were internal keys, locks have been changed and the security of the venue has not been compromised in any way."" Police insist there is no evidence of any criminal offense in relation to the keys, and no risk to security because of their loss. ""There is absolutely no security concern in relation to the stadium, as measures were taken immediately to secure all key areas of the venue,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- It's official. Lewis Hamilton is Mercedes' main man -- and the new Formula One world champion. After a rollercoaster eight months of intense competition with his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, the Briton captured a second world title with victory at the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi. The 29-year-old added the 2014 crown at the twilight season finale to the 2008 title he won with McLaren. The hyped desert duel between Hamilton and Rosberg failed to materialize when the German's car lost power from its hybrid energy recovery system at the halfway stage of the race and his challenge fell away. Mercedes told Rosberg to retire his car because of ""too many problems"" but he responded: ""I would like to go to the end."" As his title rival and teenage friend had to swallow a bitter defeat, Hamilton, who had passed Rosberg for the lead at the start, sailed to the checkered flag, winning his 11th race of the season -- and with it a second world title. ""Woo Hoo! World champion, I can't believe it!"" an ecstatic Hamilton cheered over the pit to car radio on his victory lap. Keeping his swelling emotions under wraps, Hamilton did not take off his helmet as he hugged his family and girlfriend, American pop star Nicole Scherzinger, when he climbed out of the car. ""I'm a bit lost for words really,"" Hamilton beamed from the Abu Dhabi podium. ""This is the greatest day of my life. It's really due to the people around me. 2008 was a special time in my life but the feeling I have now is way, way past that. ""It means even more than the first one. It feels like it's the first time."" Before Hamilton joined the two Williams drivers of Felipe Massa and Valtteri Bottas, who had finished second and third, on the podium, Rosberg also came to hug it out with Hamilton. ""He just came into the room and said 'you drove really well'"" revealed Hamilton. ""Nico put on an incredible fight throughout the year. He was a phenomenal competitor."" Rosberg had held the championship lead until the fifth race of the season in Spain where a fourth victory for his British rival saw him take over at the top of the standings. It was a bittersweet homecoming for the two drivers at the next race in Monaco, the glamorous European principality where the pair both live in the same apartment building. Rosberg was accused and cleared of blocking Hamilton during qualifying and he went on to celebrate a victory on the streets of Monte Carlo. In Belgium, there was another flashpoint between the Mercedes teammates, who have been friends and racing rivals since they were teenagers. Rosberg collided with the rear of Hamilton's car while battling to regain the lead and the resulting damage to his car ultimately put the Briton out of the race. From May to September, Rosberg held the championship lead but the pendulum swung back in Hamilton's favor as, reinvigorated by the Belgium bust-up, he motored to the checkered flag in Singapore. The Briton ticked off victories in Japan, Russia and the United States to make it five in a row before Rosberg fought back at the penultimate race in Brazil to close the gap to 17 points. The desert denouement in Abu Dhabi awarded double points to the top 10 drivers with 50 points, instead of 25, on offer for the race winner. The new rule gave Rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion Keke Rosberg -- a tantalizing golden carrot as he chased a first world title of his own. But the final twist of a mesmerizing Formula One season, came not from the gimmick of double points but from Mercedes' own making. The mighty Mercedes engine that had driven the fierce rivalry between the two championship rivals proved to be Rosberg's undoing. At the halfway stage of the race, he radioed in to report his car was losing power. The team confirmed his hybrid car's energy recovery system -- which is worth 160 British horse power for around 33 second per lap -- was no longer working. Rosberg tried to stay positive and manage his race. Asked by reporters in Abu Dhabi if he ever gave up on the title he said: ""I still believed in it for a long time as there was the possibility Lewis would have a problem. ""I was still pushing on the last lap and that's why I wanted to finish the race."" The German crossed the line in 14th, his lowest finish of the season aside from two retirements in Britain and Singapore. Hamilton won the title by 67 points but even without the bonus of double points his championship victory would have been emphatic. The tense tale of competition between the two Mercedes drivers gave a thrilling narrative to the 2014 F1 season, which saw the introduction of major rules changes focused on engine technology. Both drivers will have undoubtedly learned something from their see sawing mano a mano contest through 19 races around the globe. ""He was the best on the grid this year and I came very close,"" Rosberg acknowledged to reporters in Abu Dhabi. ""To be able to fight with Lewis has been great. ""To be up against him, the level was incredibly high and so I also had to find and deliver the next level. I'm very proud."" Friends at last? The teamwork between the two Mercedes drivers ensured the Silver Arrows marque won its first ever team title with three races to spare. An 11th one-two finish in Brazil saw the team also break the previous record for the most one-two finishes in a single season set by fierce McLaren rivals Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost in 1988. ""This has been an incredible year,"" said Hamilton. ""I just cannot believe how amazing this has all been. ""The decision to come here, when a lot of people said it was the wrong choice. The steps we took last year and then coming into this year, it was just unbelievable."" Speaking of his relationship with Rosberg, Hamilton added: ""It's been so intense between us all year long. ""Without a doubt we've had a friendship that we built a long, long, long time ago, so that will always be there. ""Perhaps things naturally will ease up a little now. I know what it's like losing a championship so, for sure, we'll keep working at it."" As the sun set on the 2014 season, Hamilton prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. But the world of F1 moves fast and even for the new world champion and the runner-up there is little pause to digest what has been achieved or what might have been. The preparation for the Mercedes title defense loom large. Hamilton said he will have a seat fitting for the 2015 car next week while Rosberg takes part in the end of season test.","Lewis Hamilton wins the 2014 Formula One drivers' championship for Mercedes .

"The beheading of British aid worker David Haines by ISIS has intensified fears for other Western hostages being held by the jihadist group. Haines' grisly execution follows those of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff in recent weeks -- all of them shown in videos posted online. ISIS militants have killed thousands of Syrians and Iraqis in their violent onslaught aimed at building an Islamic caliphate across a wide area of territory. But the beheading of Western captives carries greater shock value beyond the region -- and works as a powerful propaganda tool for a group that has drawn members from Western Europe and North America. ""ISIS looks at this as a low cost strategy,"" said Peter Neumann, professor of security studies at King's College London. ""They are seeing that in order to capture the world's attention and recruit people, they no longer need to take down the World Trade Towers or hit the Pentagon."" As the United States builds an international coalition to take on the Sunni extremist group in both Iraq and Syria, uncertainty remains about exactly how many more Western hostages the militants have in their possession. What is the world going to do about ISIS? Has ISIS identified any of its other Western captives? In the video of Haines' killing, the black-clad ISIS executioner places his hand on another hostage, whom he identifies as Alan Henning, a British citizen. The implied threat is clear. Sotloff appeared in the same way in the video of Foley's beheading. Haines appeared similarly in the video of Sotloff's death. On Sunday, Henning's family distributed an image of him holding a child at a refugee camp on the Syria-Turkey border. The family asked media to use this image rather than the one of Henning in an orange jumpsuit kneeling beside his captor. Are any other Americans being held? ISIS is believed to be holding a number of Americans, a U.S. official told CNN in August after Foley's execution. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to identify them or say exactly how many Americans are being held. CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen reports that ISIS is understood to be holding at least two other American citizens, as well as hostages from additional Western countries. Two Italian women were reported in August to be among the militant group's newest captives. A Dane and a Japanese national were said to be seized along with the two Italians. It's hard to know how many captives there are because governments, employers and families tend to keep kidnappings quiet for fear of putting the victims in greater danger while negotiators work to secure their release. Have the identities of any missing Americans been made public? The family of one missing U.S. journalist, Austin Tice, has talked to the media about his case. But it's not clear which group in Syria's brutal civil war might be holding him. Tice, a freelance journalist who was contributing articles to The Washington Post and other news outlets, disappeared in Syria in August 2012. A shaky video uploaded to YouTube in October 2012 showed Tice blindfolded and in obvious distress. It was unclear who the people holding him were. The U.S. State Department said at the time that it believed Tice was in the custody of the Syrian government -- but the regime of President Bashar al-Assad hasn't admitted detaining him. Tice's parents spoke last week to CBS This Morning about their concerns for their 33-year-old son. ""I do not accept that he is missing, I live in a place where he is coming home,"" said Debra Tice, his mother. She described hearing the news of the killings of Foley and Sotloff as ""a gut punch."" What about other journalists? The Committee to Protect Journalists estimates that about 20 journalists are missing in Syria -- most of them local, some from outside Syria. It says many of them are believed to be held by ISIS. Altogether, more than 80 journalists have been abducted in Syria since the country's civil war started, according to the CPJ. Some have been freed, others killed. Often a media blackout on journalists' abductions is lifted generally in best- and worst-case scenarios. Which Westerners have been released in Syria? American journalist Peter Theo Curtis was handed over to U.N. peacekeepers in August by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with al Qaeda ties, after almost two years in captivity. Qatari officials helped secure his release, his family said. Two Spanish journalists -- Javier Espinosa and Ricardo Garcia Vilanova -- were freed in March. At the time of their capture, their newspaper said the journalists' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to ISIS. Four French journalists -- Nicolas Henin, Pierre Torres, Didier Francois and Edouard Elias -- were released in April. And a Danish photographer, Daniel Rye Ottosen, was freed in June, the Danish Foreign Ministry said. Why are some hostages freed and others killed? A multitude of factors are at work, including who the captors are and where the captives come from. Different Western governments take different approaches to kidnappings. Britain and the United States are known to take hard line, refusing to negotiate with terrorists or pay ransoms. But some European governments are believed to have handed over cash to terrorist groups to ensure the release of their citizens. An investigation by The New York Times found that al Qaeda and its affiliates have netted at least $125 million in ransoms since 2008, with much of the revenue reportedly coming from France -- although the French government denied paying money to terrorists. What about getting the hostages out by force? The United States and other countries attempted hostage rescues, but these have achieved mixed results. In 2012, Navy SEALs saved U.S. aid worker Jessica Buchanan and fellow aid worker Poul Thisted of Denmark after three months' captivity in Somalia. But the attempts can also go badly wrong. Linda Norgrove, a kidnapped British aid worker, was accidentally killed by a U.S. grenade during a SEAL rescue effort in Afghanistan in 2010. U.S. special operations forces went into Syria in July to try to retrieve Foley and other ISIS captives. But the mission failed after the commandos were unable to find the hostages. The British government said earlier this month an attempt was made to rescue Haines ""some time ago"" but was unsuccessful. It declined to provide details on what happened.

"In August, al Qaeda's propaganda arm released a video starring the German rapper Deso Dogg. Wearing combat fatigues and standing next to a waterfall in Syria, Deso Dogg raps in German calling on others to join the jihad and ""to make an effort for Paradise."" Deso Dogg, whose real name is Denis Cuspert, is one of several dozen German citizens who have fought in Syria. Their move to Syria marks an important shift in the focus of global jihadists. Videos by German militants training with groups associated with al Qaeda during 2009 and 2010 were invariably taped in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. That region now is largely shunned by foreign militants partly because of effective CIA drones strikes and partly because Syria is now the destination choice for jihadists from around the world. Deso Dogg is one of the many thousands of foreign fighters who have been drawn to the jihad in Syria against the regime of Bashar al-Assad over the past three years. This group includes an estimated 800 to 900 from Europe, mostly from Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Belgium. A handful of Americans have also fought in Syria. The concern, of course, is that these militants will swap business cards and will acquire arms training and bomb-making skills and will return to Western countries and carry out acts of terrorism. This is what happened after the war in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Arab veterans of those wars formed the heart of al Qaeda and affiliated groups. Osama bin Laden fought in the Afghan War against the Soviets and then founded al Qaeda, which subsequently, of course, launched the 9/11 attacks. The failure to pay adequate attention to the so-called ""Afghan Arabs"" such as bin Laden proved an expensive one for the United Sates and her allies. Could Syria be a new Afghanistan? Maybe. Last month, for instance, British authorities arrested militants who were allegedly planning a terrorist attack. Two British officials who work on counterterrorism issues told us that that the militants had traveled to Syria. The 37-year-old Deso Dogg was born in Berlin. His mother is German and his father from the West African nation of Ghana. As a teenager, he became politicized during the first Gulf War, joining anti-American demonstrations in Berlin. ""We marched, shouted and burned the American flag,"" Cuspert recalled. Cuspert joined Berlin street gangs and became a popular artist in the German gangsta-rap scene, known by his nom de rap ""Deso Dogg"" and touring with other rappers such as DMX. After surviving a car accident, he started questioning his lifestyle and turned to Islam for answers. In 2010, he ended his career as a rapper. Deso Dogg changed his name again to ""Abu Talha al-Almani"" and his rap songs became nasheeds, Islamic devotional songs. Cuspert's nasheeds were posted on jihadist websites and became popular among al Qaeda supporters. The ex-rapper went on to become one of the key figures in the militant Millatu-Ibrahim group in Germany. The group was banned by the German government last year and several of its members, including Cuspert, moved to Egypt to avoid possible arrest by German authorities. Cuspert's whereabouts remained unclear for many months until the video was released in August showing him to be in Syria and rapping about the duty to ""go into battle."" Some 6,000 to 10,000 foreign fighters from more than 80 countries are believed to have traveled to Syria since the beginning of the conflict to join the rebels who aim to topple al-Assad's regime. Close to 800 of those foreigners are from Saudi Arabia. Tunisia and Libya are the next highest contributors, according to residents and analysts, but Chechnya, Kuwait, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates have also seen citizens join the rebel forces in Syria. Not all of these fighters have joined al-Qaeda linked groups in Syria, but it is likely that many of them have done so because they are generally Sunni militants who are drawn to the conflict for religious reasons. Canadian news reports estimate the number of Canadian citizens fighting in Syria range from a few dozen to as many as 100. An American filmmaker, Bilal Abdul Kareen, who lived with an Islamist group in Syria for a year said he met with 20 to 30 Canadians. Experts say the number of Americans fighting in Syria is likely less than 10. Eric Harroun, a former U.S. solider, was charged this year with conspiring to use a rocket-propelled grenade in Syria, and he admitted to fighting with the al Qaeda affiliate group, al-Nusra. Nicole Mansfield of Flint, Michigan, was killed in May by Syrian government forces who claimed she was fighting with an al Qaeda linked insurgent group. How to prevent the foreign fighters in Syria fomenting acts of terrorism around the world? The United States and its allies should make a careful effort to find out the identities of the foreign fighters who have joined the jihadist groups fighting in Syria. And the U.S. should make clear to countries such as Saudi Arabia, which is supplying hundreds of Saudi fighters in Syria, that encouraging this kind of militancy could create a ""blowback"" problem in the Middle East in the form of terrorism directed at Arab regimes. As for the former Deso Dogg, in September a jihadi forum released a statement saying that the German ex-rapper had been wounded by an air strike in Syria.","Germany's Deso Dogg converted to Islam, taped propaganda for al Qaeda .

"The attorney for a Florida man who shot at a car of teens over the weekend, killing one, says the incident bears no resemblance to the Trayvon Martin case. Her client, Michael Dunn, is no ""vigilante"" but did feel threatened and shot out of ""self defense,"" the attorney said. ""There are no comparisons to the Trayvon Martin situation,"" said Robin Lemonidis, Dunn's attorney.  ""He is devastated and horrified by the death of the teen."" Dunn, 45, was denied bond Monday on a murder charge stemming from the weekend shooting in Jacksonville. The violence was sparked by a confrontation about loud music at a gas station, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said. Dunn told authorities that he had asked the teens to turn down the blaring music from their vehicle adjacent to his, as he waited for his girlfriend to return to the car. He heard threats from the teens, Dunn told police, he felt threatened and thought he saw a gun in the teens' car. He grabbed his gun and fired at least eight shots, authorities said. Seventeen-year-old Jordan Davis, among the teens, was killed. There were no guns found inside the teens' car, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said. Ron Davis, the victim's father, said he is devastated and doesn't believe the shooting was self defense. ""He did something that there was no defense for,"" the father said of the suspect. Ron Davis said his son didn't own any guns, wasn't part of a gang and was a good kid. When Dunn pulled out the gun, the teens' initially thought it was a fake then frantically tried to back up the car before being caught in the gunfire, Ron Davis said. The father said he talked to two of the teens who were in the car, and they are ""really shaken."" Jordan's body will be moved to Atlanta, the home of his mother, on Thursday, before a Saturday funeral. Some have compared this incident to the Trayvon Martin case, the shooting of an unarmed Florida teen earlier this year that sparked nationwide protests and inflamed public passions over race relations and gun control. Martin's shooting also focused a spotlight on Florida's controversial ""Stand Your Ground"" law, which allows the use of deadly force when a person perceives a threat to safety. Similar to Trayvon Martin, Davis was 17 and African American. But Dunn's attorney said her client's action should not be compared to George Zimmerman, the volunteer neighborhood watchman who is charged with second-degree murder in the February 26 shooting death of Martin in Sanford, Florida. ""That's ridiculous. Michael is not a vigilante,"" the attorney said. ""He's a brilliant software developer. It was never his intention to kill anyone."" The attorney said she is contemplating what defense she will use if the case goes to trial. ""Self defense applies because Mr. Dunn was threatened,"" Lemonidis said. ""We can't say what the defense will be at this stage ... but stand your ground is a possibility.""","A 17-year-old is dead after a weekend shooting in a gas station parking lot .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York Police Department helicopter made an emergency landing in the water off Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn Wednesday afternoon, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Six people were aboard the aircraft. All got out safely but all six suffered minor back and neck injuries, according to Browne. ""They  were flying during our coverage of the presidential visit and  were on standby  for that and the United Nations General Assembly,"" said Browne, referring to President Barack Obama, in New York to speak at the United Nations. Browne says the crew was coming in  for a landing at the time of the  crash. ""They had some time and they were coming  in to top off their  fuel. They were not out of  fuel,"" he said. ""About 30 to 35 yards from the   (landing) field, there was some kind of mechanical difficulty which  caused them  to make an emergency landing on the water, "" Browne said, adding that inflatable pontoons on the aircraft deployed around its skids. Police  and private boats quickly  approached the chopper. ""They (the crew)  stepped off the chopper onto the boats.  They were never in the water, ""  Browne said. Browne says there was a pilot and  co-pilot, a crew chief, a crew chief in training, and two scuba  divers on the helicopter. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly met  with the crew at a local hospital. None of the crew was admitted to Lutheran Medical Center. The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident.

"New Delhi (CNN)If there were an annual prize for the ""World's Most Hopeful Economy,"" it would likely go to India. After years of disappointing returns, the world's largest democracy rediscovered vigor in 2014. Stocks rose by a third; foreign investment grew by a quarter; the economy at one stage expanded at its fastest pace in two years. Beyond economics, the public mood seemed to lift: There was new hope for a young and tech-savvy India, unburdened by the failures of the past. One man dominated the headlines, peddling optimism: India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi has fashioned a role for himself not only as CEO of India Inc. but also as its global ambassador, with blockbuster speeches promoting India in New York, Tokyo and Sydney. He is also India's brand manager, launching catchy campaigns such as ""Make in India,"" ""#MyCleanIndia"" and ""Digital India."" Modi has won a broad mandate, as evidenced by his party's performance in tricky state elections in December. And yet, 2015 marks the end of Modi's honeymoon. After all, hope can only go so far. Modi's greatest accomplishment in 2014 was to offer promise: He energized weary Indians. He convinced the world that India had a giant ""open"" sign on its front doorstep -- almost literally, with visas on arrival. He spent much of the year in campaign mode, in India and abroad. But in 2015, Modi will need to transition from speechmaker to doer, or else risk disenchanting another generation. That suggests 2015 will be a defining year for India. Let's start with economics. India was blessed with favorable tail winds last year. At the start of Modi's term, Brent crude was trading at about $110 a barrel. By year-end, prices had halved. Cheaper oil was a boon to India's economy: The deficit shrank, inflation fell, and perhaps most crucially, the government took the opportunity to end decades of subsidies and deregulated diesel. New taxes on oil look set to generate billions of dollars in excess revenue every year. India's government will look to use that money well. Can it deliver on its promises of clean water and power to 1.25 billion Indians? Can it really improve India's broken infrastructure -- ports, roads, trains and bridges, some of which never seem to connect? Can it begin to fulfill its promise to put a toilet in every home? Or has too much been promised? In any case, India needs much more money and investment, likely from abroad. And Modi will need another important currency: cooperation from his lawmakers. India needs to rid itself of arcane laws on retrospective taxation. It will look to unite its states under a common tax system to foster free trade and business. But these acts will take political will and wile. Can Modi legislate as well as he can campaign? Can he really, as his government has promised, improve India's ranking for doing business from a dismal 142nd in the world to somewhere in the top 50? These are all questions that Modi will need to answer in 2015. Foreign policy has come easily to Modi so far. He will begin 2015 basking in the glow of receiving President Barack Obama, the chief guest at India's Republic Day, on January 26. Obama will be the first sitting American president to visit India more than once. For Modi, however, good foreign policy means good business. He will look to strike deals not only with Obama, but with many other world leaders in 2015 -- on energy, trade, defense and infrastructure partnerships. All that sounds right up Modi's alley. The great unknown is how he will respond to a major foreign policy crisis, the likes of which he largely escaped in 2014. How will he react to a major skirmish with Pakistan? How will he balance his desire to boost Chinese trade with fears about Beijing's growing assertiveness in the region? And what will he do if, in a big global crisis, he is pushed to choose sides between any of Russia, China and the United States? Can India remain everyone's friend? Will Modi develop a values-based vision of India's place in the world? On domestic issues, a year ago, Modi was known outside India mostly for his inability -- or worse, apathy -- in stopping one of the worst religious riots in modern Indian history, when some 2,000 Muslims were killed in Gujarat, the state he ran at the time. Modi's perceived role led to his U.S. visa being revoked. A year on, New York City received Modi as if he were a rock star. In the space of a year, Modi has managed to transform his image abroad from pariah to visionary leader. Recent events are cause for renewed worry. Reports of Hindu groups forcing Christians and Muslims to ""convert"" to Hinduism threaten the very basis of the Indian secular state. Minorities simply cannot live in fear. In 2015, Modi will need not only to be a voice of reason, but he will also have to rein in radical fringe elements of his Hindu support base. The safety of women will remain a major issue of concern at home and abroad. At his 2014 Independence Day speech, Modi remarked how the Indian people's heads ""hang in shame"" with each report of rape. The sad reality is that Modi will probably make the same comment at this year's speech. As I've written previously, India has let its women down for centuries: They rank 134th in the world for economic opportunities, 126th for education and 141st for health. How can that be good enough for a country that aspires to be a major world power? Beyond politics, from living and reporting in India, I am hopeful about this country's future. My optimism is based less on politics or economics, and more on a larger trend: the country's technology boom. While the West has evolved in its Internet use -- from dial-up to cable to mobile 4G -- India's journey has been different. It has jumped straight to a mobile revolution. Most Indians who discover the Internet will discover it on a cheap smartphone, not a PC. The pace of technology adoption, coupled with faster and cheaper hardware, will transform India in ways we are only just beginning to comprehend. So, expect India to start leapfrogging many of the problems the West has spent decades dealing with: India has never had a real database of its citizens, but soon it will be the first country to have an entirely digital biometric ID system. There will be real changes in people's lives and their economies with the help of e-commerce and apps for health, education, banking and transport. Beyond oil, politics or demographics, the biggest tail wind for India lies in its adoption of technology. This will be India's real revolution, and it is already underway.","Ravi Agrawal: India needs much more money and investment, likely from abroad .

"Editor's note: You can follow the Bilsons' progress on CNN American Morning 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. through February 4. Mary Bilson tries to contain her autistic daughter Marissa's tantrum, as Marissa's brother Brendan looks on. Seal Beach, CALIFORNIA (CNN) -- The Bilson family is like many other families: three kids, a cat, and a small, lovely home with lots of family photos and carved wooden wall signs with sayings like ""Live, Laugh, Love."" But step inside their house after 4 p.m. most weekdays and you'll want to cover your ears because of the noise -- the screaming, to be exact. These are not the shouts of sibling rivalry or parental annoyance. This is the high-pitched, ear-shattering sound of a 13-year-old girl. More accurately, it is the sound of a frustrated, irritated, very loud teenager with autism. Marissa, the middle Bilson child, was diagnosed with autism when she was a toddler. Her mother, Mary, a nurse, knew something wasn't right early on, when young Marissa's tantrums were off the charts and seemingly unwarranted. But during the first few years, doctors told Mary Bilson that her daughter was fine and this behavior would eventually pass. They were wrong on both counts. Marissa's behavior has not passed; it has, in fact, become worse. According to Bilson, Marissa and her tantrums rule the household. ""I don't want to hear her screaming and tantruming, so we pretty much let her do what she wants,"" Bilson says. ""We"" means Mary, her husband, John, and their two other children, Brittany, 15, and 6-year-old Brendan. Keeping the peace means that, when it comes to Marissa, the rules are different. She is allowed unlimited time on the one family computer. She is allowed access to her siblings' rooms and possessions. She is allowed to eat dinner at the computer instead of the family table.  Watch part one of the Bilsons' journey Â» . But before you sit in judgment of the Bilsons, and suggest they just need a firm hand to keep their middle child in line, consider one thing: They are trying to cope with a child with severely impaired social sensibilities. ""Do you think people who don't have children with autism know how tough it is to deal with them?"" CNN's senior medical correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen, asked Marissa's mom in a recent interview. ""No,"" Mary Bilson replied. ""And I don't see how they could."" She's right -- we can't, because many of us have never seen autism in action, day in and day out.  Learn more about autism Â» . Autism is described on the National Institutes of Health Web site as a ""developmental disorder that appears in the first three years of life, and affects the brain's normal development of social and communication skills."" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, autism and related disorders affect about one out of every 150 babies born each year. Autism manifests itself in many different ways. Although there are some common threads, like language issues, repetitive movements and difficulties connecting to others, specific behavioral patterns are largely unique to the individual. ""Children with autism are all different; they are like snowflakes,"" explains Dr. Ronald Leaf, co-director of the group Autism Partnership. The one thing that Leaf believes they all have in common is that ""they are not expected to do enough."" Leaf insists we have set the bar too low for what we think children and adults with autism can do. ""They are highly teachable,"" he says. ""You just have to have a good teacher."" A good teacher is exactly what Bilson was looking for to help her with Marissa. The family had already tried various programs, starting when Marissa was a toddler -- but nothing completely worked for her. And as Marissa entered her teen years, her behavior grew worse. Mary knew that her daughter needed to be reined in, and it needed to be done now. ""She is getting older. She's 13 and her tantrums are louder and longer than they used to be. It's just so inappropriate. It was OK when she was much younger, but now that she's going to be an adult soon, she can't be behaving this way,"" Bilson says with tired resignation. But what could the Bilsons do? This family doesn't have a lot of extra money, and most programs either aren't covered by insurance or have long waiting lists. The costs are staggering, according to the Web site FightingAutism.org. Families with autistic children can expect to spend $30,000 annually to provide proper medical, educational and other assistance necessary for dealing with an autistic child.  Watch part two of the Bilsons' journey Â» . Enter Autism Partnership, or AP. This group, founded in 1994, offers extensive therapeutic services to children and adults with the disorder. One of its most unique programs is an intensive one-on-one, at-home intervention service that is similar in scope to what happens on the television show ""Nanny 911."" It's not cheap -- about $2,500 per day, typically for a five-day period (with additional days on an ""as needed"" basis). Most of AP's work is grounded in a behavior modification technique known as Applied Behavioral Analysis or ABA. Essentially, the method breaks down behavior patterns, rewarding proper behavior while being careful not to encourage improper responses. And that is exactly how AP therapist Rick Schroeder hopes to reshape Marissa Bilson's worst behavior. The group, which met Marissa while working in her school, offered the Bilson family a free week-long intervention with the proviso that CNN be allowed to record the process. The week started off with a day of observation -- a day with lots and lots of screaming and tantrums, that left Schroeder stunned.  He had observed Marissa at school where, he says, she was much less demonstrative. But Schroeder is still eager and ready to tackle the challenge. ""I think the family is starting to realize something needs to change, and that's very good,"" he says after his day of observation. ""As far as Marissa's behavior goes -- and the level that she is capable of going to -- she's pretty much out of control, for sure.""","CDC: Autism and related disorders affect one out of every 150 children .

"Rhode Island resident Lisa Kondvar remembers her mother as a beautiful, small and vivacious blonde. So she was shocked to see the body of a tall brunette woman lying in the open casket at her mother's wake in New Jersey on December 9. Right away, the tears and the crying stopped. Kondvar and her family immediately closed the casket and left the room, she said. ""It wasn't mom,"" Kondvar said. ""They sent us the wrong body."" Her mother, Margaret Porkka, was vacationing in St. Maarten on the family's annual Thanksgiving trip when Porkka suddenly died after feeling light-headed. Porkka, 82, was pronounced dead at St. Maarten Medical Center on November 29, the morning after Thanksgiving. Other than a pacemaker and a right hip replacement, Kondvar said, her mother was in good health and very active. ""It didn't make sense. She was full of life,"" Kondvar said. ""My mother was a picture of health. She ran circles around me."" Kondvar said her family was told their mother's body had been taken to Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten, where the funeral director denied their request to see their mother and demanded a $7,000 wire-transfer-only fee to send the body back to the United States. ""That gave me a red flag,"" Kondvar told CNN. ""When I hear 'wire transfer,' I get cautious."" Eager to get their mother's body back on American soil and not knowing of any alternative, the family wired the money and left their mother's passport, necessary information for the death certificate, and a set of clothes for the funeral services. The body that arrived in a casket at the New Jersey funeral home on December 6 was not her mother, Kondvar said. But the body was dressed in Porkka's clothing and was accompanied by her passport and death certificate. The casket also had a small, red-velvet pouch containing jewelry and items that Kondvar said did not belong to her mother. ""There was a medical bracelet that said 'angina.' My mother didn't have angina,"" she told CNN. Now, Kondvar and her family want answers, and they want their mother back, she said. ""It pains me that she's gone, and it's even worse because I don't have her and I want to hold her one more time, and I can't do that,"" Kondvar said. Repeated calls to St. Maarten Medical Center and Emerald Funeral Home over the weekend were not returned. Kondvar said she hasn't heard from the hospital or the funeral home since leaving St. Maarten. Kondvar, who is a nurse, said she contacted U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, for help. Reed, a personal friend of Kondvar, has been in touch with the U.S. consulate in St. Maarten and is closely monitoring the situation, according to Reed's spokesman, Chip Unruh. According to Kondvar, Emerald Funeral Home in St. Maarten was supposed to notify the U.S. consulate of Porkka's death so the office could arrange for the body to be accompanied back to America. That never happened, Kondvar said. As if the situation weren't already complicated, there's reason to believe that somehow her mother's body was mistakenly sent to a family in Canada and cremated, Kondvar told CNN. ""If it is mom up in Canada, we want her back. We certainly don't hold anything against this family because they're in grief,"" she said. ""I can't even imagine what they're going through."" Unruh said Reed has expedited a DNA test to determine whether the body that was sent to Canada is in fact Kondvar's mother. ""It's a nightmare,"" Unruh said. The government of St. Maarten issued a statement on its website explaining some of what happened. Two women, one Canadian and one American, died on November 29 and were taken to the same funeral home, it said.  The government honored the families' requests to send the bodies to their respective homes, and the deceased women were flown to the United States on the same airline. ""Upon collection of the deceased the next of kin of both deceased persons claimed that this was not the body of their respective relatives and have lodged a complaint with the local law enforcement authorities. The body that was flown to Canada has since been cremated,"" the government website said. DNA analyses ""will be carried out in order to verify conclusively the identity of both bodies. As soon as there is more information available it will be made available through the representatives of the respective Governments, the families of the deceased and the respective media outlets,"" the government statement said. As Porkka's family awaits the test results, Kondvar said she has a terrible, gut feeling the body in Canada is not her mother's. ""If it's not her, I don't know where that leaves us,"" she said. Kondvar told CNN the St. Maarten government is performing an internal investigation into what went wrong. But Kondvar is wary. She's been in touch with the State Department and wants to hire an international attorney to lead her own investigation. ""I want an outside investigation. I don't trust that government. They've hurt my family,"" she said. Kondvar, a resident of Warwick, said she's not sure whether she will ever return to St. Maarten, although she has fond memories of the island and the residents from her family vacations. ""(My mother) loved St. Maarten. That's why it brings me some kind of peace, is that she died in paradise,"" Kondvar said.","Margaret Porkka, 82, died during a family vacation in St. Maarten .

"CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee (CNN) -- When meeting Jeff Donohoo, it's not immediately apparent he is a 36-year-old man living with autism. In fact, unless you get him talking about the Atlanta Braves -- one of his true passions in life -- he is a very quiet person. Jeff Donohoo, 36, at work in the kitchen at Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Early on, his younger brothers and sister didn't know, either. ""Since they grew up with him, they just knew Jeff was Jeff,"" said Nancy Donohoo, his mother. ""They didn't think of him as weird or anything."" But when friends started to notice Donohoo was different, Nancy Donohoo was quick to explain to a group of 10-year-olds why. ""Jeff has a social problem, not a mental problem,"" she explained. ""He's very smart. He reads encyclopedias ... he just doesn't know how to talk to people."" From then on, friends who visited the house always made an effort to interact with Donohoo, through a high-five or a simple ""hello."" Today, it's unlikely Donohoo will be the first to say hello in a group setting, but interacting with people is easier for him than it once was.  See how Donohoo copes every day Â» . Questioned about his childhood, his most elaborate response is ""yeah"" or ""no."" But when the topic is the Braves, it's hard to get him to stop talking about the latest statistics or his favorite player, Mark Teixeira. Asked how long he's been a Braves fan, there was little hesitation: ""All my life."" He's come a long way since he was a child. Then, just teaching Donohoo to talk was a challenge in itself, Nancy Donohoo said. ""There was no eye contact, so I would hold his face in front of me, and say the word I wanted him to say."" Donohoo entered the first grade as a special education student. It was the first year special education was offered in his family's hometown of Florence, Alabama. He carried on with special education until the sixth grade, when he was mainstreamed, or put in classes with children without disabilities.  Explainer: Understanding autism Â» . For most of Donohoo's childhood, his mother had suspicions about his condition. ""When he was little, I had watched a 'Marcus Welby' show, and they had an autistic child on there. But he was very passive; he sat in the corner and just hit things,"" Nancy Donohoo said. ""Jeff was wild. He was the opposite, so I just assumed he couldn't be autistic. But he had a lot of those mannerisms."" It was Donohoo's freshman year of high school when Nancy and Bill Donohoo learned what was wrong with their son. ""There was a doctor in Huntsville that dealt a lot with hyperactive children,"" Nancy Donohoo said. ""He said, 'I'm going to give you this sheet of paper; these are all the symptoms of autism.' "" The list had 19 symptoms, and Nancy Donohoo was instructed to circle the ones her son had. She circled 17. The diagnosis didn't change how Nancy Donohoo dealt with her first-born son. In fact, the doctor said she already was doing all the right things, working to socialize Donohoo. Today, Donohoo, living with his parents, finds comfort in strict routine. He wakes each day at 5 a.m. to make himself breakfast and prepare for work. At 6, Nancy Donohoo drives her son to Memorial Hospital, where he's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria. Ollie FortÃ© is Donohoo's supervisor, and has worked with Donohoo almost since the beginning. ""He's very valuable to us at this department. He's dependable, on time, no attendance problems,"" said FortÃ©. ""We love Jeff."" After work, at 2:30 p.m., Donohoo rides with his mother to the YMCA, where he works out for about three hours. Then it's back home, where he fixes himself dinner and spends hours online looking up Braves statistics, or reading a number of baseball-related books from his personal library. This cycle repeats on days Donohoo works at the hospital. On his days off, the schedule is equally strict, with little variation. He'll still go to the YMCA, and he'll also make the occasional trip to the bookstore, adding to his collection of baseball-related literature. Sudden changes to daily plans are still a challenge. ""If he's made his plans to do something tonight,"" said Bill Donohoo, ""and we come and say, 'We're going to get something to eat. Do you want to go?' that upsets his plans for what he's going to do that night."" Physical contact is also difficult. ""He doesn't like to be touched,"" Nancy Donohoo said. ""He doesn't freak, but he doesn't like it. He stiffens up. He'll want to give you a hug, but he still has a hard time."" The many challenges aside, Donohoo has a fine appreciation for things like cooking. In addition to preparing his own meals, he also enjoys baking. ""He loves desserts -- he loves sweets,"" Nancy Donohoo said with a laugh. ""He's a little heavy, but we're working on that."" Nancy and Bill Donohoo have endured the challenges, and they acknowledge their son will never be fully independent. But one can tell they couldn't be prouder of him. ""It's rewarding today, because he's come so far, but it was a long road,"" Nancy Donohoo said. E-mail to a friend .","Jeff Donohoo, 36, is an adult living with autism .

"When Microsoft introduced a preview version of a fresh and inventive webmail service it called Outlook.com last August, it was pretty clear that it was telling the world that it intended to start winding down its venerable Hotmail sooner or later. Now it's official. The company is announcing that Outlook.com is coming out of preview mode and is now officially available worldwide. And so it's going to start moving more than 300 million Hotmail users over. They'll be able to keep their Hotmail.com e-mail addresses â or Live.com or MSN.com, if that's what they've got â but the Hotmail service and brand will be going away. The transition will be gradual: At first, the Hotmail faithful will get e-mails and other alerts telling them about the switchover. They'll be able to make the jump immediately, or postpone it. But by the end of the summer, the company intends to have moved all Hotmail users over to Outlook.com. For most of those people, that should be a good thing â or at least, as forced transitions go, not a bad thing. While it's impossible to underestimate the ferocity with which some folks prefer to clutch onto whatever they've already got, Outlook.com is a far better service than Hotmail, with a radically decluttered interface and useful new organization tools. (I also like its interface â which is a variant of the Windows 8 look formerly known as Metro â better than Gmail's.) Yet it's also recognizable as having a family connection to Hotmail, reducing the chances that anyone will be bewildered by it or will lose a favorite feature once the switchover is complete. At the moment, Microsoft says, Outlook.com has 60 million active members, a third of which are Gmail users. (Presumably some of those are true defectors from Gmail, while others use both Gmail and Outlook.com.) Once the Hotmail transition is complete, Outlook.com will have hundreds of millions of users, giving it the same sort of massive scale as Gmail (425 million users as of June 2012) and Yahoo Mail (281 million users as of December 2012). And Microsoft seems to be serious about winning over lots more users from Gmail and other services: It's planning to advertise Outlook.com heavily in all sorts of media. The company has posted a couple of splashy TV spots â both of which, unlike the current Scroogled campaign, are devoted to making people feel good about Outlook.com rather than bad about Gmail. While I'm favorably impressed by Outlook.com, I'm not considering dumping Gmail myself anytime soon; Google's service remains a much richer platform, with additional useful features, mobile apps and support from third-party apps and services. Microsoft says to expect more Outlook.com features now that the service is out of preview mode, including Skype video calls and a calendar, both of which the company first promised when it announced the service last year. I'll be keeping an eye on it â an Outlook.com which retained its sleek look and competed with Gmail in depth and breadth of capabilities could be spectacular. Even Gmail users who have no intention of leaving the service should be happy that Outlook.com exists. Just as Microsoft's Bing gives Google's search engine its only serious competition, Outlook.com is poised to be Gmail's most imposing rival. I'm still getting used to the notion of Microsoft, of all companies, being a plucky underdog â but I'm glad it's giving Google at least two incentives to avoid resting on its laurels.","Microsoft says its Outlook.com e-mail service is now officially available worldwide .

"(CNN)Two girls accused of stabbing a friend to impress the fictional Internet bogeyman Slenderman have been found competent to stand trial. The decision came out of a Wisconsin courtroom Thursday, Waukesha County Circuit Court reporter Kathy Fus told CNN. Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier have been charged with attempted murder after authorities say they stabbed their classmate 19 times in May. All three were 12 at the time. The suspects allegedly left the victim to crawl to her own rescue. She was taken to a hospital after a passing bicyclist found her. Bicyclist who found victim: 'Who did that to you?' According to a criminal complaint, the suspects were arrested hours after the victim was discovered. The girls were allegedly trying to please Slenderman, a horror story meme the girls had encountered on a website known as Creepypasta Wiki. One of the suspects is said to have told police that Slenderman is the site's supposed leader, and to climb into his realm, a user must kill someone. Geyser and Weier are being charged as adults. A preliminary hearing is set for February 18. Who is Slenderman? CNN's Jason Hanna and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier are being charged as adults with attempted murder .

"Venezuelans have taken to the streets in recent days, leading to gruesome clashes between protesters and police. Their demands are varied, from economic to social. Here's a Q and A to bring you up to speed with what's going on. When did the protests in Venezuela begin? Nationwide student protests started this month. On February 12, the demonstrations attracted  global attention when three people were killed. Demonstrators are demanding better security, an end to goods shortages and protected freedom of speech. Major social and economic problems have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors and accused the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. Some blame Venezuela's government, led by President Nicolas Maduro, for those problems. Maduro and other officials blame the opposition for the security and economic problems. The protests are the largest Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power. He has called opposition members fascists and compared them to an infection that needs to be cured. Who's protesting? Many demonstrators across the country are students, but prominent opposition politicians have also joined marches. Since February 13, more than 2,000 stories from Venezuela have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos are gruesome, and depict violent scenes between demonstrators and police. Who are some of the opposition figures involved? You'll be hearing a lot about opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez in the coming days. He's become the opposition's face of demonstrations against the government. Lopez was detained this week on  terrorism and murder charges, but prosecutors dropped those charges, replacing them with arson and conspiracy counts, his lawyer said Thursday. What did Lopez do? Lopez was arrested in connection with the deaths of four anti-government protesters and a government supporter in clashes nationwide. He was targeted because he organized protests. He has denied the charges, which the human rights group Amnesty International said ""smack of a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the country."" Human Rights Watch weighed in, too, warning that Venezuela must avoid ""scapegoating"" political opponents. You mentioned something about a U.S. plot to destabilize Venezuela ... Yes. Top Venezuelan officials have accused the United States of trying to destabilize the government. This week, Venezuela gave three U.S. diplomats 48 hours to leave the country, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At a rally Tuesday, Maduro shouted, ""Yankee, go home"" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. U.S. President Barack Obama was not amused. ""Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,"" Obama said. Is this the first time Venezuela has had protests? No.  Bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won re-election. What happened to Hugo Chavez? He ruled for 14 years until his death last year after a long battle with cancer.  Maduro, who was then his vice president, won the presidential election and is now running the country. What's the latest? Lopez remained in a military prison Thursday. His wife, Lilian Tintori de Lopez, called on supporters to keep the pressure on the government. ""Don't give up,"" she said. ""I won't."" Tell me more about Venezuela . Venezuela is on the northern coast of South America and shares a border with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana.  Its formal name is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The oil-rich nation -- one of the world's top 10 oil exporting countries worldwide -- has a population of about 30 million.","Murder, terror charges against opposition leader Lopez dropped; new charges brought .

"Smokers with high levels of a carcinogen byproduct (NNAL) are at higher risk of developing lung cancer. Smoking is a lot like Russian roulette: You never know who will end up developing lung cancer and who won't. But Dr. Jian-Min Yuan, as well as other researchers from the University of Minnesota, say they are one step closer to determining a smoker's risk for developing the disease. In a study, they tracked the carcinogen and nicotine levels in nearly 500 smokers through a simple urine test and discovered a link between the level of a specific carcinogen and lung cancer. Their findings were presented at the American Association for Cancer Research conference. Why did researchers track only  the levels of one carcinogen? We all know that tobacco smoke is bad: It's loaded with 60 different carcinogens, which cause all sorts of health risks. There is one carcinogen in particular that researchers suspected for years contributed to human lung cancer. But there were never any scientific human studies showing this relationship. This carcinogen is known as NNK. It releases into your body when you inhale smoke, quickly passes through the liver, gets metabolized and releases NNAL, a byproduct of NNK, into the bloodstream. University of Minnesota researchers were tracking the NNAL levels via urine samples.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain the findings Â» . How much did a person have to smoke to develop high levels of NNAL? The exact amount is a little tricky to determine because a lot depends on how honest a person is about how many cigarettes he or she smoked per day. Additionally, the type of cigarette and how deeply a person inhales could affect the amount of carcinogens in the body. Researchers say a person with high levels of NNAL and high levels of nicotine (equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes a day) is 8.5 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared with a smoker with lower levels. While the researchers point out that not everyone who has a high level of NNAL is going to develop lung cancer, it does help assign a number to a risk that was hard to quantify before. Isn't smoking bad for you regardless? What is the benefit of having this type of information? There is nothing healthy about smoking. Even if this test pegs you at low risk of developing lung cancer, it doesn't mean you won't develop a dozen other cancers commonly cause by smoking. If you smoke, the No. 1 thing you should do is quit. But that is easier said than done. If it were easy, 23 percent of adults in the United States would not smoke regularly. One benefit of knowing whether a smoker is at increased risk for lung cancer is for his or her doctor to screen the person regularly for abnormalities, in the hopes of catching the cancer early. Lung cancer is but one consequence of smoking, so this type of testing is not going to fix everything. But as far as lung cancer goes, it may give people a better idea of when and how often to get screened. Reported by CNN's Danielle Dellorto .","First study to quantify link between carcinogen byproduct and lung cancer rates .
Researchers tracked levels of byproduct (NNAL) using urine samples .
Smokers with high levels of NNAL doubled their risk of developing lung cancer .
Test could identify high-risk people, aid in early detection and treatment .
Bottom Line: This test may one day be used to identify smokers at high risk for lung cancer, but won't help against smoking's other health hazards."
"Asked which school meals were their favorites, students at a public school in the New York borough of Queens don't say chicken fingers or meatballs. Instead, they name rice and kidney beans, black bean quesadillas or tofu with Chinese noodles. ""Whoever thought they would hear a third-grader saying that they liked tofu and Chinese noodles?"" asked Dennis Walcott, New York City schools chancellor. Walcott was at the Active Learning Elementary School this week to celebrate its move to all-vegetarian meals five days a week. The school of nearly 400 students, from pre-kindergarten to third grade, was founded five years ago on the principle that a healthy lifestyle leads to strong academic achievement. ""We decided on a vision where health and nutrition would be a part of educating the whole child,"" school principal Bob Groff said. The school's focus on healthier meals began three years ago when Groff noticed a majority of students were bringing their own vegetarian meals. The school went meatless three days a week about a year and a half ago. It also tested meals on a small group of students, gathering feedback and changing the menu accordingly. Active Learning's student body may be more accustomed to vegetarian diets than most, with 85% of the students being Asian and another 10% Hispanic, said Margie Feinberg, spokeswoman for the New York Department of Education. ""Rice was a staple of many of their home foods,"" Groff said of the students. Study: Too much red meat may shorten life span . The vegetarian program expanded to four days a week last spring but reverted back to three days when the U.S. Department of Agriculture changed its requirements for protein per serving in the fall, he said. The school worked closely with the city's education department food program to ensure menu items met USDA standards. It officially went all-vegetarian in January. ""We've been working with tofu for a few months,"" Groff said. At first, the tofu was served as a seasonless block; now, smaller pieces of barbeque-flavored, oven roasted tofu are served with noodles. That, Groff said, ""changes how the kids perceive it."" Other options might include roasted chickpeas, vegetarian chili and brown rice, or falafel, the city Department of Education said in a statement. Students appear to be enthusiastic about their healthy meals. ""When you're healthy, you can do better on tests and you can fight more diseases,"" student Nick Lin told CNN affiliate NY1. Following the announcement this week, Groff said he was welcomed into a PTA meeting with roaring applause. He told parents the children may still bring whatever meal they like for lunch. But ""the vegetarian menu fits right in with our mission, and we are thrilled that our students in pre-kindergarten all the way up to grade three understand the importance of healthy and nutritious meals,"" Groff said in a statement. New York schools -- which provide meals for 1.1 million students daily -- offer principals vegetarian and nonvegetarian lunch options. Groff worked closely with the department so that the menu changes came at no additional cost to the school. He hired a school parent as a vegetarian chef to develop the menu and described his school as the vegetarian test kitchen for the city. One original recipe, called ""Malini's Curry Chickpeas"" after the school's chef, was offered as an option in schools across the city on Earth Day, he said. The department hopes other schools will consider going vegetarian. ""As far as we know, (Active Learning) is the only public school in the nation that offers an all-vegetarian menu,"" Feinberg said.

"Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old Georgia woman who lost both hands and feet to a bacterial infection, is now breathing on her own, her father said. ""Aimee is being Aimee. She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours,"" Andy Copeland said in a blog post Sunday night. Though the University of West Georgia student is still receiving an oxygen ""mask,"" Andy Copeland wrote, ""the important thing is that she is getting zero breath per minute (bpm) assists. In other words, she is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?"" ""Bottom line: Aimee is doing great today."" The progress came after a harrowing week, in which Copeland's remaining foot and both hands were amputated. Prior to the surgery, a website posting by Copeland's friend and fellow psychology student Ken Lewis explained the reason: ""Aimee's fingers and remaining foot will have to be amputated because of dead blood vessels, not because of necrotizing fasciitis,"" he wrote. Surgeons had already amputated a leg and cut out soft tissue from her torso. On a Facebook page dedicated to his daughter's recovery, Andy Copeland described speaking with the surgeons before the latest amputations. ""The hands were endangering Aimee's progress,"" he writes. ""As always, my decision was simple. Do whatever it takes to give us the best chance to save Aimee's life."" He then broke the news to his daughter. ""I took Aimee's hands and held them up to her face. She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,"" he writes. She nodded as he explained the diagnosis given by her doctors. Asked whether she had any questions, his daughter mouthed, ""I'm a little confused, but I'll figure it out,"" he writes. The patient then listened as her father, mother Donna and sister Paige explained how she would eventually be fitted with prosthetic limbs. ""She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them. She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words,"" he writes. "" 'Let's do this.' "" Andy Copeland then pays tribute to the strength of his daughter, who has spent days in intensive care at Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia. ""A tear rolled down my face as I walked out of her room. I wasn't crying because Aimee was going to lose her hands and foot, I was crying because, in all my 53 years of existence, I have never seen such a strong display of courage. Aimee shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady."" Copeland's struggle has been followed by many Americans, as her family has shared the ups and downs of her battle against the ""flesh-eating"" bacteria. She was with friends May 1 near the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, when she grabbed onto a zip line. It snapped, and she fell. The accident left a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room, where doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. She was flown to Augusta for the first of what has turned into a series of surgical procedures. Among them has been a tracheotomy. Her father recounted how her loved ones saw the inevitability of the amputations in the changing color of her hands from day to day. ""Some people may criticize my decision and say we should have prayed over Aimee and asked God to heal her hands. Trust me, this we have done every day,"" he writes. There is uncertainty about how common such infections are, since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence. But Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the United States. The reporting of such cases is not required by law. The infection is fatal in about one in four cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. The bacteria are ""remarkably common in the water and in the environment,"" according to Dr. Buddy Creech, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University. ""When it gets into those deeper tissues, it has a remarkable ability to destroy the tissues that surround it in sort of this hunt for nutrition,"" he said. ""When it does that, those tissues die, and you see the inflammation and the swelling and the destruction that can be very difficult to control."" Meanwhile, a South Carolina woman undergoing treatment for the same condition continues to recover. After seven surgeries, Lana Kuykendall's family realizes she ""still has a long road ahead."" ""We don't know what the next day is going to bring, so we're just trusting the Lord,"" her brother Brian Swaffer said Sunday. ""We're taking it one day at a time."" Kuykendall was healthy when she gave birth to twins on May 7 in Atlanta but went to the hospital near her home in South Carolina a few days later after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg. The twins are healthy, he said.","Aimee Copeland is off a ventilator, her father writes .

"Imagine a lovely trip to the Caribbean, your favorite mountain retreat or even Disneyland without hordes of children around. Even if you have children you adore, it sounds tempting, doesn't it? Admit it. ""I go places during the week when the crowds are smaller, I'm not anti-kid or anti-people,"" writes Matt Hodgetts, who shared his thoughts on CNN's Facebook page. ""I just find it more enjoyable to be at the zoo/museum/shows when there are less people around."" Kudos for thoughtful parents of babies on planes . Rick Swartz, another Facebook commenter, says, ""Kids are great, just not during a vacation. My own kids are grown and gone. I like a little peace and quiet on vacation."" Now's the perfect time for that kid-free trip. Most of the children who would be sharing your view of Yosemite or packing your top three theme park rides have gone back to school. If you don't have kids, here's your chance to enjoy one of the benefits of not having them -- the freedom to grab cheaper airfares and hotel rooms. If you have kids, it could still benefit you to take some time to reconnect with your significant other. That's because the travel industry enters into a so-called shoulder season after Labor Day, when most travelers head back to school or work and airline seats and hotel rooms remain unfilled. While Las Vegas, New York and Chicago were KAYAK's top flight search destinations for Labor Day, users who wait to travel to these destinations until the following weekend could save 8% to 10% on airfares, according to a KAYAK spokeswoman. Travel prices pick up again for Thanksgiving weekend and drop again until the Christmas and New Year's holiday travel period. ""You won't just get peace and quiet, but good weather and low prices,"" says Clem Bason, president of the Hotwire Group. ""Everyone in the U.S. still thinks of summer vacation and that's when you take your vacation. People are sort of resistant to traveling in the fall and winter. They should go.

Ever popular for travelers, Europe tends to go on sale during the fall and winter, and Eastern European destinations such as Montenegro and Croatia are still attracting a lot of interest. In North America, leaf peepers may enjoy rail tours of the Canadian Rockies before winter hits. And California's Napa and Sonoma vineyards are offering specials connected to the fall harvest, says American Express Travel. 'Fun Grandma' makes trips count . Is it really only for adults? Some vacation spots are exclusively for the 18-and-older set, while others simply have fewer children present because most children are attending school. That doesn't mean toddlers, home-schooled children or children with varying school holidays won't be present. If you want a truly adults-only experience, call your hotel to confirm it's really for people ages 18 and older. Within the adults-only category, make sure to do your research to find out what type of ""adult"" resort you're booking, says Travelzoo senior editor Gabe Saglie. ""On some resorts, 'adult' can mean risquÃ© while on others, 'adult' can mean upscale, quiet and private."" 12 fascinating Civil War sites . Adults-only resorts . Adults-only resorts can be found around the world. Some resorts are adults-only all the time, while others block out certain child-free times of year. Some allow teens but not younger children. For people traveling to Mexico who want an all-inclusive experience, Live Aqua Cancun was recently named the No.1 resort in Mexico in Travel + Leisure's reader-driven World's Best awards. Visitors can enjoy celebrity chef-inspired dining, elegant spa treatments, the resort's eight pools and the ocean. For wine lovers, the adults-only Kenwood Inn and Spa in California's Sonoma Valley offers a private wine bar and Italian-influenced cuisine of chef Steven Snook, a Gordon Ramsay transplant from New York. Ranked by U.S. News as a top wine country hotel, the Kenwood Inn has 29 guestrooms and suites, each with a private entrance (but no television). In New York, within an easy drive of Hudson Valley museums and 1Â½ hours from the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, the intimate Glenmere Mansion has just 18 rooms and suites for its guests, some of whom arrive from Manhattan via helicopter. The hotel, which was once a private retreat for the wealthy, offers adults a break from the rigors of city life. Even its two fine dining restaurants, which are open to the public, do not allow anyone under 18 years of age. Adults-only cruising . While some mainstream cruise lines do have adults-only sections, those areas do need to be enforced by ship personnel and would-be cruisers should check to see if passengers report any trouble with ""adult"" areas being overrun by children. If you prefer that question never be raised, Travelzoo's Gabe Saglie recommends checking out truly child-free cruises, including those operated by Carnival UK's P&O Cruises. (Make sure to choose an ""Exclusively for adults"" trip rather than a ""Family friendly"" trip.) ""British-owned P&O Cruises has a fleet of seven ships, three of which are exclusively for adults and offer a smaller-scale, more intimate cruising experience,"" he says, ""Though not readily marketed in the U.S., they feature several exotic itineraries."" Making more room at Disney . It's unlikely that any visit to a Disney theme park will be child-free. Some parents take their children out of school for that visit to Mickey Mouse's empire, hoping for a more affordable and less-crowded experience. Still, there will be fewer when school is in session. Sheryl, a grown-up from San Jose who visits Disneyland about six times per year, advises thinking about what you want from the experience. She and her partner are annual passholders who never visit between Memorial Day and Labor Day or on a holiday weekend. Their passes allow them to book trips up to three months in advance. (Sheryl, who is a child psychologist, didn't want to give her last name and be misconstrued as anti-child.) ""For me it helps to enjoy the experience when I have reasonable expectations,"" she says. ""I had very different desires and expectations when we went to Disneyland for our honeymoon than when we had a family reunion during spring break. Our honeymoon was during an off-season and our experience was more adult focused. ""Our family reunion had to occur during a school holiday for the children in our lives,"" she says. ""I went in knowing there were going to be crowds and families, the occasional meltdown and need for children-appropriate negotiation. Both holidays were fantastic and very different.""","With most children in school, destinations are often less crowded, more affordable .

"Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky routinely had a then-teenage boy perform oral sex on him while the two showered together on the school's campus and elsewhere, the alleged victim testified Monday. ""It would have to be 40 times, at least,"" said the now 28-year-old man, adding that the abuse started when he was 14. Known in court documents as Victim 4, he was the first person to testify at Sandusky's trial in Pennsylvania. The Nittany Lions' longtime defensive coordinator faces 52 charges tied to what prosecutors say was his systemic abuse of at least 10 boys over a span of 15 years. The 68-year-old defendant was under house arrest prior to his trial, which is expected to continue for about three weeks. Like many alleged victims, the man on the stand Monday met Sandusky through Second Mile, the nonprofit group the ex-coach founded. He described growing up without parental oversight before Sandusky took to him -- playings sports with him; paying for uniforms, a snowboard and other items, taking him to Penn State games and doing other special things. Victim 4 said Sandusky also drove him to buy marijuana once when he was 15 or 16, and had bought him cartons of cigarettes. Despite what he described as systemic sexual abuse by Sandusky, the witness said he was ""scared"" and reluctant to tell anyone about it, including peers who admired him for seemingly being well connected with Penn State's football program. ""I didn't want to lose the good things I had,"" he said. ""I kind of looked at Jerry as a father figure, and he was nice to me except for those other instances ... and I feel cool (because) I'm getting nice things out of it."" Victim 4 said he initially refused to talk to police after reports surfaced Sandusky was being investigated, adding the grand jury was the first to hear his full story. ""I've spent so many years burying this in the back of my head ... but then I found out this happened over and over and over again, forever,"" he testified. ""And I feel if I had just said something back then, this wouldn't have happened to (others). So I feel responsible."" While Sandusky said he wanted him to succeed and was nice to him in public, Victim 4 says their relationship was different in private. ""He treated me like a son in front of other people. Outside of that, he's treating me like his girlfriend,"" he said, noting Sandusky's habit of putting his hand on the then-teen's thighs when they drove in a car together. All about the allegations, how case unraveled . Besides the alleged oral sex, Victim 4 detailed other instances of alleged abuse, including Sandusky trying to penetrate him in the shower, caressing him and ""kissing ... my thighs."" This allegedly took place in athletic buildings on Penn State's campus, as well as the Toftrees Golf Resort and hotels -- including on trips to Florida and Texas to watch the Nittany Lions play at the Outback and Alamo Bowl, respectively -- Victim 4 testified. He described staying in a hotel with Sandusky and his wife on the road to attend one such bowl game, and being in the bathroom getting ready to take a shower when Sandusky walked in. ""He came in and was basically doing the caressing on me, ... and then started to push down on me, to motion me to go down there,"" the witness testified. ""And he said, 'You don't want to go back to Snow Shoe, do you?"" referring to the Pennsylvania community where the then-teenager was living. This incident ended, Victim 4 testified, when Sandusky's wife called out, ""Jerry, ... what are you doing in there?"" at which point the alleged victim said he ""jumped in the shower and locked the door."" Jurors were shown excerpts of letters Victim 4 said Sandusky wrote to him. In one, he writes, ""I know that I have made my share of mistakes. ... My wish is that you care and have love in your heart. Love never ends. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things."" Defense attorneys had filed a motion earlier Monday seeking to keep out testimony involving prosecutors' allegations Sandusky exhibited ""grooming behavior,"" including the letters to Victim 4. The lawyers said they intend to offer expert testimony from a psychologist who ""will explain that the words, tones, requests and statements made in the letters are consistent with a person who suffers from a Histrionic Personality Disorder,"" according to documents. According to the National Institutes of Health, those with histrionic personality disorder ""act in a very emotional and dramatic way that draws attention to themselves."" ""The goal of a person suffering from this disorder in writing those letters would not necessarily be to groom or sexually consummate a relationship in a criminal manner, but rather to satisfy the needs of a psyche belabored by the needs of such a disorder,"" the defense lawyers write in their motion. In opening statements, defense lawyer Joe Amendola suggested his client would take the stand. Sandusky would admit, he said, that he routinely ""got showers with kids"" after working out. Sandusky has always maintained his innocence, Amendola said, claiming his client's alleged victims had changed their stories and were questioned until authorities received the answers they wanted. ""A lot of people lied,"" Amendola said. Some of the alleged victims have civil attorneys, he noted, calling that unusual. Others, he said, have a financial interest in the case. ""One of the keys to this case, one of the keys to your perception ... is to wait until all the evidence is in,"" Amendola told jurors. ""Some of it will be graphic ... it's going to be awful. But that doesn't make it true."" However, he said Mike McQueary, a former graduate student who said he saw what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy in a shower in Penn State's athletic facilities in 2002, did not necessarily lie. McQueary has said he assumed sex was occurring even though he did not see the actual act, Amendola said. Tom Kline, an attorney for Victim 5, told reporters later that his client had no financial interest and ""never sought this out,"" but considers it ""an obligation of citizenship"" to testify. And Victim 4 said he's never talked with his lawyer -- whom he said he hasn't paid ""a dime"" -- about being part of any civil lawsuit against Sandusky. Amendola told jurors former Second Mile children will testify that Sandusky affected their lives in a positive way, and he later showed letters to Victim 4 in which the ex-coach wrote ""I'm proud of you and really care."" The defense lawyer also questioned some alleged victims' behavior, like the one who went to a football game with Sandusky prior to his arrest. Victim 4 brought his girlfriend and baby over to meet Sandusky ""like he was bringing his family to meet his father,"" said the lawyer. The alleged victim admitted Monday to visiting Sandusky about two years ago, so his girlfriend -- who was suspicious about the past between the two -- ""could see that everything was normal."" ""But that backfired because the whole time we were there, (Sandusky) only wanted to be with me and was sort of rubbing my shoulders. So (my girlfriend) knew,"" he testified. The prosecution presented its opening statements first, during which childhood pictures of eight of the 10 alleged victims were shown on a projector screen. Prosecutor Joseph McGettigan described the extent of each victim's contact with Sandusky. ""You'll hear about systematic behavior by a serial predator. These were experiences that took place not over days, not over weeks, not over months ... but over years,"" McGettigan said. Feelings of humiliation, shame and fear led to ""years of silence"" on the part of accusers, the prosecutor said. He reminded jurors that Sandusky, not Second Mile or Penn State, was on trial. But, McGettigan said, Second Mile represented ""the perfect environment for a serial predator."" In interviews after his arrest, Sandusky acknowledged showering and ""horsing around"" with boys, but denied being sexually attracted to them. McGettigan referred to those interviews during his opening statement, saying, ""Deny what you can ... and make an excuse."" A jury of five men and seven women, along with four alternates, was selected last week. Half of the 16 jurors and alternates have ties to Penn State, including one retired professor and one current professor, three graduates, two employees and one current student, showing the prominence of the university in the local community. The case has raised questions about Penn State's response to allegations, with some claiming the school put its reputation ahead of protecting potential child victims. University President Graham Spanier and iconic head football coach Joe Paterno lost their jobs soon after Sandusky's arrest amid criticism they didn't handle the matter appropriately. Paterno died of complications from lung cancer in January. Opinion: Jerry's got a jury of his peers -- HLN . McQueary, the former graduate student who became a coach, is considered a key witness. He said he alerted Paterno in 2002 that he'd seen what appeared to be Sandusky sexually assaulting a boy, an allegation authorities didn't learn of until years later. Paterno apparently told Athletic Director Tim Curley, but no one notified police. Curley and Gary Schultz, Penn State's senior vice president for finance and business, are now facing felony charges of perjury and failing to report the allegations to authorities. Both of them pleaded not guilty. On Monday, defense attorneys requested that the grand jury testimony of Curley, Schultz and Spanier be admitted into evidence, saying they anticipate the three would invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called to testify. The defense also asked that if prosecutors attempt to enter portions of Sandusky's autobiography, ""Touched,"" into evidence, the entire text be admitted. Defense attorneys said they fear prosecutors may use ""select snippets"" to mischaracterize Sandusky's ""motivations, purposes and actions.""","Victim 4 says Sandusky treated him ""like his girlfriend"" in private .

"(CNN) -- A United Nations panel investigating alleged war crimes in the Sri Lankan conflict has found credible evidence that the military shelled civilians in no-fire zones and sought to silence critics in brutal fashion, according to the panel's report, leaked to a Sri Lankan newspaper. The report contradicts claims by the Sri Lankan government that it adopted a policy of ""zero civilian casualties"" in the final stages of its bloody 25-year battle with the Tamil rebels. ""The government shelled on a large scale in three consecutive no-fire zones, where it had encouraged the civilian population to concentrate, even after indicating that it would cease the use of heavy weapons,"" according to the report, published last week on the website of the newspaper, The Island. ""It shelled the United Nations hub, food distribution lines and near the International Committee of the Red Cross ships that were coming to pick up the wounded and their relatives from the beaches. It shelled in spite of its knowledge of the impact. ... Most civilian casualties in the final phases of the war were caused by government shelling."" The Sri Lankan government denounced the report as ""fundamentally flawed."" A statement from the Ministry of External Affairs said that ""among other deficiencies, the report is based on patently biased material, which is presented without any verification."" President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said he will turn a planned May Day rally into a protest against the United Nations. U.N. officials would not comment on the leaked report, but spokesman Farhan Haq said the published portions are accurate. ""They are incomplete, they're certainly not the full report, but they are accurate renditions of things that appear in the text,"" he said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed the three-member panel last year to advise him on accountability issues relating to alleged human rights violations during the final stages of the Sri Lankan war, which ended in May 2009. The panel found both sides accountable for serious war crimes. The report says the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who fought fiercely to secure an independent state for minority Tamils, ""refused civilians permission to leave, using them as hostages, at times even using their presence as a strategic human buffer between themselves and the advancing Sri Lanka army. ""All of this was done in a quest to pursue a war that was clearly lost; many civilians were sacrificed on the altar of the LTTE cause and its efforts to preserve its senior leadership,"" the report says. The government, the report says, ""systematically shelled hospitals on the frontlines."" It also ""systematically deprived people in the conflict zone of humanitarian aid, in the form of food and medical supplies, particularly surgical supplies, adding to their suffering. To this end, it purposely underestimated the number of civilians who remained in the conflict zone. Tens of thousands lost their lives from January to May 2009, many of whom died anonymously in the carnage of the final few days."" The report also is critical of government soldiers' screening of civilians in their hunt for rebels. Sometimes, it says, those who were singled out as suspects were summarily executed. ""If proven, those most responsible, including Sri Lanka Army commanders and senior government officials, as well as military and civilian LTTE leaders, would bear criminal liability for international crimes,"" the report says. Sri Lanka's long and bloody conflict devastated nearly two-thirds of the population in its northern and eastern provinces. As many as 70,000 people were killed.","The panel finds that the military shelled civilians in no-fire zones .
The government denounces the report, which was leaked to a newspaper .

"(CNN)For a pop star with millions of frenzied fans, Taylor Swift does a pretty good job keeping tabs on them. She has a history of stalking -- er, ""Tay-lurking"" -- fans on social media, figuring out their likes, dislikes and what's going on in their lives. And she loves to shower super loyal ones with some enormous gifts. But the package that Rebekah Bortniker received may be one of the most complicated presents yet. The giant box, labeled ""SwiftEx"" instead of ""FedEx,"" contained so many meticulously wrapped gifts that it took Bortniker several minutes to open them all. ""Hi you. I was thinking about you today, and how you have been there cheering me on in the most thoughtful and creative ways,"" the singer wrote on a card. ""I'm not a good painter but I think you're so beautiful and positive, even though you're dealing with the stress life brings, so I wanted to make you something."" Yep, the Grammy winner sent a custom-made floral painting to her fan. She even sent a Polaroid of herself doing so as proof. Then there was a necklace. ""Was mine, now yours,"" Swift explained. Finally, a gift to help ease Bortniker's student loan debt. ""Rebekah, now you're $1989 closer to paying off those student loans,"" Swift wrote. 1989, of course, isn't just Swift's birth year -- it's the name of her latest album and world tour. By this point, Bortniker could barely speak from all the emotion. ""I don't even know what to say,"" she managed to say. Fortunately she has time to think of a response before September -- when she'll be at two of Swift's concerts. Taylor Swift's year-end gift video brings all the feels .

"(CNN) -- The parents of a Washington state woman who admitted making up a story about an assailant throwing caustic liquid in her face told reporters Friday that they don't know why their daughter inflicted her own wounds. ""She's obviously dealing with some deep internal, emotional and psychological problems that we had no knowledge of, and we hope that she'll get the help that she needs,"" said Nancy Neuwelt, mother of 28-year-old Bethany Storro. ""She's got a long road ahead of her, but she's on the road, and we're going to walk it with her."" Joe and Nancy Neuwelt said there were no signs of trouble leading up to the August 30 incident, after which Storro originally told police she had been attacked by an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. On Thursday, Storro admitted her injuries were self-inflicted, Vancouver police said. The Neuwelts said they had no reason to doubt their daughter's story -- as ""any good parents would"" -- until Storro confessed on Thursday. ""Now she can begin to heal because the truth has been revealed,"" Nancy Neuwelt said. She decribed her daughter as very sorry for the pain she caused the city -- which is across the Oregon border from Portland --  and those close to her. Police would not speculate on Storro's motives, only saying the incident did not occur as she described and that there were discrepancies in her account, including wearing sunglasses in the evening. ""She is very remorseful. In many ways it got bigger than she expected,"" police Cmdr. Marla Schuman said Thursday. After the incident, Vancouver searched for an assailant. Police spent hundreds of hours on the case, and the community came together to offer donations for Storro's treatment. Joe Neuwelt said all money would be returned. He said he and his wife were ""deeply sorry"" that people had been duped. Storro was released from an Oregon hospital September 5 after undergoing surgery for her injuries. Prosecuters will decide whether or not to charge Storro, police said.","Parents say they were unaware their daughter had 'psychological problems'

"""Live every week like it's Shark Week."" Those immortal words come not from the Discovery Channel's marketing department but from Tracy Morgan on ""30 Rock."" Believe it or not, there once was a time when there was no Shark Week. It wasn't until famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau's 1956 documentary, ""The Silent World,"" that people began to see what the world under the sea was really like. ""Jacques Cousteau changed the way ocean exploration was done,"" said Eric Stackpole, who along with partner David Lang is behind a submersible robotic watercraft -- sort of an underwater drone -- that could open a whole new world of undersea exploration. Cousteau ""invited people to explore along with him, and so for us it's the same thing,"" said Lang. Their invention, called an OpenROV, is a submarine-like robot that you control with your laptop. It gives scientists, explorers and other users a glimpse of what lies below the surface, without them getting wet. ""R-O-V stands for remotely operated vehicle"" Stackpole said. ""It's got a video camera on it, so you can see what it sees live. So I can put this in the water, fly it around and see what it sees."" The OpenROV is about the size of a toaster and is engineered to go to depths of up to 100 meters. Underwater ROVs have been used for research for years. But the biggest difference between the OpenROV and the one, say, James Cameron uses, is the price. The OpenROV sells for $849. It's not what everyone would call cheap, but you don't need a grant to get your hands on one. This affordability is how Stackpole and Lang hope to bring OpenROV to the masses, turning average people into Cousteau-like undersea adventurers. Plan for a new kind of spy plane . ""If you think about ocean exploration right now,  it's something that a lot of people think, 'Oh, well, you know, what that's something that professional scientists do, that National Geographic explorers do. That's not something that I get to do,' "" Lang said, ""I think that's what we're trying to instill back in everyone."" The two met when Stackpole was interning with NASA and Lang was between jobs, and both immediately bonded over the idea of a new way to explore the ocean. ""When we first met almost three years ago ... within 10 minutes Eric told me a story about this underwater cave,"" Lang said. ""Within a half an hour we were talking about, 'Well, what if we could build an underwater robot that could go and roam the ocean and anyone could go on and control it from the Internet?"" The project started in their garage in Cupertino, California -- home to some other famous tech innovators: Apple. But once they turned to Kickstarter last year, they saw how many people were truly interested in taking the plunge. ""We set a goal for $20,000 and ended up raising that in about two hours, which is really exciting,"" Lang said. ""It's fun to watch the kind of dollar amounts go up, but then you quickly realize, 'Oh my God, we have to build all these things.' "" There are over 500 OpenROVs in use now around the globe. Even though the project is growing, Stackpole and Lang are sticking with their do-it-yourself ethos. The OpenROVs are an open-source project, meaning that anyone can hack them to create new features or uses for the devices. Lang and Stackpole sell the ROVs as kits, and customers put them together themselves. Meet your friendly neighborhood drones . It's a process that helps get everyone involved in the production and design aspect. ""We have people from well over 50 countries in our community who can all contribute to how to make the design better and how to use it better,"" Stackpole said. Among those interested in OpenROVs are conservation groups who want to check on invasive fish species and teachers who want to use them in the classroom, Lang said. Building a community of users to provide input is another way the OpenROV is unique. It also explains the first half of the name. ""OpenROV is an open-source community,"" Stackpole said. ""If the ROV is having some sort of a problem and we can't figure out how to handle it, I can go onto the forums and post, 'Hey, this is a problem I'm having,' and as I sleep, the problem is going across Europe and people who are experts are answering it because they find it interesting. ""By the time I wake up, it's going to cross the U.S., and by lunch I can have five or six good solutions."" With a flow of new ideas coming in from all over the world, Stackpole and Lang have decided not to get a patent  for the OpenROV -- at least not yet. This makes it easier for them to upgrade with new tech and designs. ""For us, we want to innovate as quickly as possible. We want to come up with new designs and revolutionize how underwater exploration is done rather than committing to one design,"" said Stackpole. ""We've been designing the ROV around parts that are not even in existence yet, but that we know are emerging."" As the OpenROV evolves and improves, this approach may allow for more exploration in uncharted waters. ""People often ask, 'Is it something that's just kind of a toy that's fun to build and play with, or is it something that you expect to be used by real researchers?' And our answer certainly is, 'both,' "" Stackpole said. Jacques Cousteau would certainly be proud.","A new submersible robot -- sort of an underwater drone -- could open up undersea exploration .

"(CNN) -- BP said it resumed drilling Monday on a relief well, as efforts to  permanently seal the previously leaking Gulf of Mexico oil well appeared  to be entering their final stages. Drilling on the  relief well resumed at 2:40 p.m. ET after a massive sleeve protecting  the well from sudden, large increases in pressure was successfully  installed over the weekend. Installing the device  ""resulted in the necessary conditions to commence the finalization of  the relief well,"" Thad Allen, the government's appointed national  incident commander in charge of overseeing the oil spill response, said  in a statement Monday. Allen said the relief well remains ""the final step that will ensure the well is fully and finally killed."" Drilling  had been stopped since August 10 when a tropical storm threatened  conditions at the site, forcing the oil company to suspend operations.  Since then, weather delays in the storm-prone Gulf as well as scientific  and technical debate on how to proceed have extensively prolonged the  timeline for definitively plugging the well. Before  drilling resumed, the relief well had been at a measured depth of 17,909  feet and was less than 50 feet vertically and four feet horizontally  from the original well. ""Relief well operations will  consist of drilling and ranging runs that will guide the rig's drill bit  to intercept the well's annulus. Following the intercept, heavy  drilling mud and cement will be pumped into the annular space to  complete the isolation of the MC252 well,"" BP said. While  BP successfully stopped the flow of oil on July 15 by embedding a  cement plug near the top of the well, permanently sealing the well has  been a process full of fits and starts. Just last week,  Allen laid out a possible timetable that pushed the ""bottom kill"" -- a  process in which heavy mud and cement are pumped into the bottom part of  the original well via the relief well -- into October. But  with the new sleeve in place, the timetable is expected to be shortened  ""significantly,"" Allen. It could take about four days to finish  drilling and intercept the original well.  BP would then need a few more  days after that to complete the bottom kill. Federal   investigators  and the Department of Justice are now poring over a   device called a blowout  preventer, a piece of equipment that failed on  April 20 when BP's oil platform  exploded, killing 11 people.  The   blowout preventer was designed to stop oil  from spewing by sealing the   well pipe. Instead, it failed, triggering the  world's largest   accidental oil spill and sending 4.1 million barrels of oil into  the   Gulf.","The leak was successfully stopped on July 15 with a cement plug .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating the death of an Amtrak passenger whose body was found by railroad tracks in south Georgia hours after she was reported missing. An autopsy on Barbara Arteta, 63, of New Smryna Beach, Florida, was conducted Friday. The results were not immediately known, said Special Agent Mike McDaniel of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. He termed Arteta's death ""suspicious."" He would not provide details on any interviews or leads. Amtrak spokesman Steve Kulm said the train system is cooperating with authorities and has spoken to crew members and other employees. Amtrak also is providing information about passengers. Investigators were looking into whether an emergency window in the car in which Arteta was traveling was open, McDaniel said. Arteta's husband, Gene, told CNN affiliate WFTV that his wife was incapable of climbing up to a window. The Artetas were returning to Florida after seeing a newborn grandchild, according to WFTV. They were aboard the popular Amtrak Auto Train, which carries vehicles and passengers, and planned to drive home once they arrived in Sanford, Florida. The train left Lorton, Virginia, on Wednesday evening and arrived Thursday morning in Sanford, Kulm said. The only planned stop was for a crew change in Florence, South Carolina. Gene Arteta told WFTV that his wife suffered from Parkinson's disease and began to shake early Thursday, so he moved to another seat to get some sleep. When he woke up, he said, she was gone. ""Why is she dead on an Amtrak train? It was her first time on an Amtrak train. She was so happy and proud. I don't get it,"" Arteta said. ""I don't even see how that could even happen,"" he said. The train passed through the Jesup area between 3 and 3:30 a.m. Thursday, said McDaniel, who heads the GBI office in Kingsland. Gene Arteta said he awoke around 5:45 a.m. to find his wife missing, McDaniel told CNN. He began searching for her and asked for help. The Sanford Police Department was officially notified of a missing person around 9 a.m., McDaniel told CNN. Barbara Arteta's body was spotted by the crew of a CSX train near Jesup around 3:20 p.m. Thursday, the agent said. Gene Arteta told WFTV that about $1,000 was missing from his wife's purse. McDaniel confirmed the purse was found, but would not comment on its location or contents. The investigation involves several states and jurisdictions, McDaniel said. GBI investigators spoke with the Arteta family in Jesup on Friday. ""They are cooperating with us,"" the agent said. Asked if it's possible Barbara Arteta fell, McDaniel said ""anything was possible."" A phone call to the Arteta residence was not immediately returned Friday. The GBI asks passengers or anyone else with information to call its tips line at 1-800-597-8477. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Florida woman found dead near train tracks in Georgia .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Recently, at 48 years of age, I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. For most of my life, I knew that I was ""other,"" not quite like everyone else. I searched for years for answers and found none, until an assignment at work required me to research autism. During that research, I found in the lives of other people with Asperger's threads of similarity that led to the diagnosis. Although having the diagnosis has been cathartic, it does not change the ""otherness."" It only confirms it. When I talk to people about this aspect of myself, they always want to know what it means to be an ""Aspie,"" as opposed to a ""Neurotypical"" (NT). Oh, dear, where to start . ... The one thing people seem to know about Asperger's, if they know anything at all, is the geek factor. Bill Gates is rumored to be an Aspie. We tend to have specialized interests, and we will talk about them, ad infinitum, whether you are interested or not. Recognizing my tendency to soliloquize, I often choose silence, although perhaps not often enough. Due to our extensive vocabularies and uninflected manner of speaking, we are called ""little professors,"" or arrogant. I don't quite understand small talk, and early in my adult life, solecisms were frequent. At meetings, I launch into business without the expected social acknowledgments. It's not that I don't care about people, I am just very focused on task. Do you have to rehearse greeting people to reinforce that you should do it? I do. I am lucky to have a very dear friend who savors my eccentricities. She laughs, lovingly, about one particular evening at a restaurant. Before she could get seated, I asked her what she knew about the golden ratio and began to spew everything I know about it. I re-emphasize how lucky I am to have her as a friend, because this incident occurred long before I was diagnosed. A misconception is that Aspies do not have a sense of humor. It is true that we can be very literal, so we often miss the humor in everyday banter, but we can and do enjoy even subtle humor. Our literal interpretations, however, can be problematic. In first grade, whenever someone made a mess in the classroom, the teacher would ask a student to get the janitor. The student would come back with Mr. Jones (not really his name), who carried a broom and large folding dustpan. When I was asked to get the janitor, I looked all over the school and reported back to the teacher that I could not find it. After all, the person was Mr. Jones, so the janitor must be the object, right? I lack the ability to see emotion in most facial expressions. I compensate for this deficiency by listening to the inflections in people's voices and using logic to determine emotional context. The words people choose, their movements, or even how quickly they exit a meeting can provide clues to emotion. I also have intensified senses -- touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound -- so I am attuned to lights, noise, textures, and smells. In a ""busy"" environment, I will eventually go into sensory overload and my mind will go blank. When this happens, I have to ""go away"" mentally for a brief period to regain focus. When I ""return,"" I have to piece together what occurred while I was ""away."" The additional mental processing I must do to function every day is fatiguing, and I don't handle ""ad hoc"" very well. Being asked to respond quickly in the midst of all this other processing is difficult, sometimes impossible. I am so sensitive to touch that a tickle hurts me. This is the hardest concept for most people to understand. How can a tickle hurt? All I can tell you is that it does, so I avoid being touched except by those who have learned how to touch me. Hugs are dispensed infrequently, but if I do hug someone, I resemble Frankenstein's monster, arms extended to control contact. When my dad (who I suspect is an Aspie, too) and I hug, we both have ""the approach."" We sometimes miss and have to re-approach a couple of times until a brief, awkward hug is achieved. In school, other children noted my differences, and I was bullied (and tickled into fits of despair) for years. Already needing extended periods of time alone, my response was to become even more of a loner. Uh oh. When you are weird, you are a joke. When you are a loner, you frighten people. It's always the quiet ones. ... I am married (wow!), and my brilliant husband is an absolute sweetheart. I don't know any other man who has the self-confidence to be pushed away (sometimes sharply), both physically and mentally, as often as he has been. He has been gentle and patient (and, yes, frequently emotionally depleted) as we both worked through my need for space, tendency to go so deep into my own world that the real world and everyone in it cease to exist, and sensitivity to touch during the 26 (soon to be 27) years of our marriage. I live with anxiety, because the world can be overwhelming and people have expectations that I always, sooner or later, fail to meet. I cannot begin to tell you how many times I have been told that I am rude, inaccessible or cold, yet I have never purposely tried to harm anyone, nor do I mean to be, well, mean. I could tell you so much more, but instead let me share one last insight. Don't pity me or try to cure or change me. If you could live in my head for just one day, you might weep at how much beauty I perceive in the world with my exquisite senses. I would not trade one small bit of that beauty, as overwhelming and powerful as it can be, for ""normalcy.""

"Detectives have video that shows a man shooting former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight and two other people in a West Hollywood nightclub early Sunday, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. The shooter is seen running from the 1 Oak club, along with dozens of  people who fled when they heard the gunshots, Los Angeles County Sheriff Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. The shooter has not been identified and the handgun used to shoot Knight, 49, a 19-year-old woman and a 33-year-old man was not found, she said. All three victims, including Knight, who suffered several gunshot wounds, are expected to survive, a sheriff's spokesman said Sunday. The shooting happened inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. Brown posted a tweet after the incident: ""It's disappointing that we as a society can't have fun or enjoy ourselves without any altercations sometimes. Miss me with the bulls**t!!!"" Brown is still on probation for beating singer and then-girlfriend Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammys. A grainy cell phone video posted on Instagram shows Brown standing on the back of a couch and yelling in the aftermath of the shooting. Brown's bodyguard can be seen trying to get him down. The singer has colored his hair blond and is wearing a white shirt and jeans in the video. Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding Death Row Records in 1991 and signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. This was not Knight's first time being shot at a pre-VMA party. He was shot in the leg at a party hosted by rapper Kanye West at a Miami hotel on the eve of the 2005 VMA show.","Video shows the shooting suspect running from the Sunset Strip club, investigators say .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In a statement read on a syndicated radio show Thursday, Atlanta-based megachurch pastor Eddie Long denied he had coerced young male church members into sex, as alleged in three lawsuits filed against him. ""I have been through storms and my faith has always sustained me,"" Long, pastor of the 25,000-member New Birth Missionary Baptist Church said in the statement, read by attorney Craig Gillen on the ""Tom Joyner Morning Show."" ""I am anxious to respond directly to these false allegations, and I will do so. However, my lawyers counseled patience at this time."" ""Let me be clear: The charges against me and New Birth are false,"" the statement said. ""I have devoted my life to helping others and these false allegations hurt me deeply, but my faith is strong and the truth will emerge."" Long asked for patience ""as we continue to categorically deny each and every one of these ugly charges"" and requested prayers for himself, his family and the church. He said he will respond to his congregation from the pulpit on Sunday. Later Thursday, Long posted a message on Twitter reading, ""Thanks for all your prayers and support! Love you all."" ""These false allegations are an attack on Bishop Long personally,"" Gillen said. ""They are an attack on New Birth, the entire church and all of its 25,000 good people who attend that church, and it's an attack on the mentoring program that has helped thousands of young men. It is deeply, deeply unfortunate that these allegations have been made. They will be met."" Gillen was interviewed by Roland Martin, a syndicated columnist and CNN political analyst, during Martin's segment on the Joyner show. Gillen said he is to blame for Long's failure to appear on the radio show as scheduled. Asked about a Thursday press conference that was also canceled, Gillen said he thought the matter was a misunderstanding, as he had never committed to a press conference. ""That's my call,"" he told Martin regarding the interview and press conferences being canceled. ""In assessing the situation, no lawyer likes to have his client in a situation where ... charges are made and the lawyer doesn't have control."" Attorney B.J. Bernstein, who represents the three men named in the lawsuits, said Long sent two photos of himself wearing tight shirts to a fourth man not named in the litigation. She said it was an example of inappropriate conduct. Gillen defended the photos during an interview with an Atlanta radio station Thursday. ""The photos don't corroborate these charges,"" Gillen said on V-103's ""Frank and Wanda Morning Show."" ""[Long] is a health advocate, he's a weight-lifter. He's a fellow who's gonna go to work and he's gonna have on a muscle shirt. And you know he may show up in church in a muscle shirt. There's nothing really in those photographs that seems to me corroborative of these allegations."" Long's supporters stressed he has been a mentor and guiding force for young men. A YouTube video shot at New Birth shows Long talking with a man who gives a testimonial about turning away from a life of crime. The unidentified man points to Long and said he ""has always been my dad when I didn't have a dad."" Long spokesman Art Franklin said the video shows the kind of spiritual impact Long has had on young men. The third lawsuit joined two that were filed on Tuesday, all of them in DeKalb County, Georgia. It was brought on behalf of Jamal Parris, now 23, who like the others was a teenager when he joined Long's church. The suit, which claims Long encouraged Parris to call him ""Daddy,"" also names the church and Long's LongFellows Youth Academy as defendants. The new lawsuit gives intimate details about Parris and his alleged relationship with Long. Parris joined New Birth in 2001, when he was 14. Long counseled Parris when the latter talked about his strained relationship with his father and got him a job as a summer camp counselor at the church, the suit states. The suit claims Long engaged in sexual acts with Parris. The young man eventually became a church employee and served as personal assistant to Long and traveled with him, the suit says. The pastor continued to engage in sexual activity with Parris and gave him money, trips and gifts, the suit says. It says Parris left the church in late 2009, ""disillusioned, confused and angry about his relationship with Defendant Long."" The bishop manipulated and deceived Parris into thinking that the acts were a ""healthy component of his spiritual life,"" the suit states. The allegations are similar to those contained in the Tuesday suits, filed on behalf of Anthony Flagg, now 21, and Maurice Murray Robinson, now 20. All three contend the LongFellows Youth Academy and New Birth knew or should have known of Long's behavior and that they failed to warn the young men. The lawsuits describe LongFellows as an offshoot of New Birth. Bernstein has alleged Long had a pattern of using his position as a spiritual authority and bishop to coerce young male members and employees of the church into sex. CNN was the first to report on the lawsuits. But ""this church and this bishop have been devoted to giving to the community and giving back to young men,"" Gillen said Thursday. Long is considered one of the nation's top African-American preachers. His church was the site of Coretta Scott King's 2006 funeral, attended by then-President George W. Bush and three former presidents. King was the widow of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The three men claim Long took them on overnight trips to various locations within the United States and beyond, sharing a room and engaging in sexual contact with them, including massaging, masturbation and oral sex. Bernstein, who represents Parris, Flagg and Robinson, said Wednesday that the youths' accounts are ""really strong."" She said she has worked with sexual abuse victims and finds the two believable because of ""the emotion. The intensity. The very strong description of what sexual acts occurred. ... This is not just someone giving a vague thing, 'Oh, yeah, one time he did this,' or a couple of times."" Gillen noted that Robinson was charged in connection with a June burglary of Long's office, and said he is attempting to get tapes that have been turned over to the district attorney's office. Bernstein said Wednesday that about $100,000 worth of items were taken, including black diamonds. She said the theft stemmed from Robinson's anger at Long and was an attempt to retaliate against him. Asked the motive for the suits, Gillen said, ""Let me put it this way. What is the motive of someone putting a ski mask over their face and breaking into your office to steal things? Money."" He said the suits, ""without a single piece of corroborating evidence, (have) ignited a firestorm against this good man."" Long spokesman Franklin told CNN Wednesday the church employs many young people, and numerous people travel with Long. Gillen said the young men are taken on such trips to expose them to cultures and diversity they might not otherwise have the opportunity to experience. Asked how she can prove that sexual contact took place, Bernstein said Wednesday, ""I am ready to put them under oath. Bishop Long can spend money on the best attorneys in this world, and they can question those young men, and then I'll get to question the bishop, and then we'll really see what's going on."" Long frequently denounces homosexual behavior. A 2007 article in the Southern Poverty Law Center's magazine called him ""one of the most virulently homophobic black leaders in the religiously based anti-gay movement."" The suits allege that Long chose the plaintiffs to be his ""Spiritual Sons,"" a program that allegedly includes other young men from the church. ""Spiritual Sons are taken on public and private jets to U.S. and international destinations, housed in luxury hotels and given access to numerous celebrities including entertainment stars and politicians,"" the suit alleges. Flagg's suit says that Long presided over a spiritual ""covenant"" ceremony between the two of them. Bernstein described it as ""essentially a marriage ceremony, with candles, exchange of jewelry and biblical quotes."" The lawsuits are seeking unspecified amounts of punitive damages from Long on various counts, ranging from negligence to breach of fiduciary duty. CNN's John Murgatroyd and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","On Twitter, Eddie Long expresses thanks for prayers, support .

"For the fifth year straight, Washington ranked as the country's most bicycle-friendly state, thanks to policies designed to create alternatives to driving, according to the League of American Bicyclists. The advocacy group's Bicycle Friendly State Program ranks the states each year under a series of criteria, from laws and regulations that govern bicycling to policies for accommodating cyclists and infrastructure funding. In each of the top five states -- Washington, Minnesota, Massachusetts, Colorado and Oregon -- the focus of the respective Departments of Transportation is not only on highways but on accommodating pedestrians, cyclists and transportation on ferries and trains, said Matt Wempe, the league's state and local advocacy coordinator. Arkansas, considered one of the least safe places for cyclists based on fatalities, was at the bottom of the list. The league's top recommendation was to adopt a statewide bicycle plan and to establish an advisory committee to oversee its implementation. Washington is considered a model for all other states on using federal funds for bicycle and pedestrian projects. It also earned points for adopting a safe passing and vulnerable road user law, which carries enhanced penalties for motorists who severely injure or kill a cyclist or pedestrian, Wempe said. It also creates a minimum 3-foot ""safe passing"" distance for cyclists by motorists. Related: Drivers and cyclists square off on sharing the road to work . The state also has a ""complete streets"" policy, which means new roads must be designed with cyclists and pedestrians in mind, Wempe said. ""Every state says bicycles are treated the same as vehicles, but that needs to be clarified,"" he said. ""We're stressing that bicycles have the same rights and responsibilities as motor vehicles, but their needs in terms of infrastructure need to be clarified."" Minnesota, which claimed the No. 2 spot, also has a complete streets policy. The state also earned kudos for its bike-sharing program and plans to expand bike trails along the Mississippi River. Colorado cracked the top 10 for the first time with qualities that make it a model for other states in terms of traffic laws, Wempe said. It has a safe passing law and a Share the Road Campaign; cyclists are allowed to ride side-by-side. It also has bicycle commuter share of more than 1%, more than double the national average. ""We are encouraged to see significant progress in top states like Washington, Minnesota, Colorado and Massachusetts,"" Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists, said in a statement. ""But, as the scores clearly highlight, there's much work to be done in critical areas like infrastructure and funding. Overall, we see states -- and especially state Departments of Transportation and state legislatures -- lagging behind cities and the expectations of local cyclists, despite the many well documented benefits of a more active lifestyle.""","For the fifth year straight, Washington ranks as country's most bicycle-friendly state .

"A 29-year-old computer technician for a U.S. defense contractor leaked details of a top-secret American program that collects vast streams of phone and Internet data, American and British newspapers revealed Sunday. ""My sole motive is to inform the public as to that which is done in their name and that which is done against them,"" the source, Edward Snowden, told Britain's the Guardian, one of the papers that broke stories on the program last week. The Washington Post also disclosed Sunday that Snowden was the source on its stories. Snowden is a former technical assistant for the CIA and has been working at the National Security Agency, the U.S. electronic intelligence service, for the past four years, the newspaper reported. He said he walked away from a six-figure job in Hawaii for the computer consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton and has holed up in a hotel in Hong Kong in preparation for the expected fallout from his disclosures. ""I'm willing to sacrifice all of that because I can't in good conscience allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building,"" he said. Video: What did NSA want with Verizon data? The Guardian reported Wednesday that Verizon Business Network Services had been ordered to hand over telephone records detailing the time, location and telephone numbers involved in domestic calls from April 25 to July 19. An order from a U.S. court that oversees U.S. surveillance efforts backed up the demand, the newspaper reported. Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of customer activities -- including ""audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents"" and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms. Snowden said the NSA's reach poses ""an existential threat to democracy."" He said he had hoped the Obama administration would end the programs once it took office in 2009, but instead, he said, President Barack Obama ""advanced the very policies that I thought would be reined in."" ""I don't see myself as a hero, because what I'm doing is self-interested,"" he said. ""I don't want to live in a world where there's no privacy, and therefore no room for intellectual exploration and creativity."" Will he be extradited? The first call for Snowden's prosecution came shortly after his identity was made public, from Rep. Peter King, the chairman of a House Homeland Security subcommittee and a member of the Intelligence Committee. ""If Edward Snowden did in fact leak the NSA data as he claims, the United States government must prosecute him to the fullest extent of the law and begin extradition proceedings at the earliest date,"" King, R-New York, said in a written statement. ""The United States must make it clear that no country should be granting this individual asylum. This is a matter of extraordinary consequence to American intelligence."" Though Hong Kong is part of communist-ruled China, the former British colony has a free press and tolerates political dissent under a semi-autonomous government. Hong Kong's extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for ""political"" crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the ""defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy"" of either party. James Clapper, director of the Office of National Intelligence, had no direct comment on Snowden's admission, but noted, ""Any person who has a security clearance knows that he or she has an obligation to protect classified information and abide by the law."" A law enforcement official told CNN the United States must charge Snowden before a process to seek his extradition can begin, adding that any talk of such action is ""jumping ahead"" of where things stand in the case. The Justice Department declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the leak. Leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress defended the program Sunday. Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said it helped lead to convictions in two cases: . -- Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York. -- David Headley, who pleaded guilty to conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people. ""These programs are within the law,"" Feinstein, D-California, told ABC's ""This Week."" And Rep. Mike Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC, ""The inflammatory nature of the comments does not fit with what Dianne and I know this program really does."" ""The instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified,"" said Rogers, R-Michigan. ""That's what's so hard about this."" Obama defends NSA program . Clapper: Programs were authorized by Congress . Clapper's office declassified some details of the programs, which it said were ""conducted under authorities widely known and discussed, and fully debated and authorized by Congress."" U.S. officials said earlier that phone-call data isn't looked at unless investigators sense a tie to terrorism, and only then on the authority of a judge. Officials say analysts are forbidden from collecting the Internet activity of American citizens or residents, even when they travel overseas. And Obama tried to reassure Americans about the programs Friday, saying, ""Nobody is listening to your telephone calls."" Clapper's office said PRISM was created in 2008, targets ""foreign targets located outside the United States"" and gets reviewed by the administration, Congress and judges. And Rogers told reporters Sunday that ""there is not a target on Americans."" Some shrug at NSA snooping: Privacy's already dead . But Glenn Greenwald, the lead author of the Guardian pieces, told ABC's ""This Week"" that the articles show the NSA hasn't leveled with members of Congress who have expressed concerns about the scope of electronic surveillance. He said Americans need an ""open, honest debate about whether that's the kind of country that we want to live in."" ""These are things that the American people have a right to know,"" said Greenwald, a lawyer and civil-liberties advocate. ""The only thing being damaged is the credibility of political officials and the way they exercise power in the dark."" Colorado Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, who has long called for greater transparency in how the government collects data on Americans, said the legal authority should be reopened for debate after last week's disclosures. ""Maybe Americans think this is OK, but I think the line has been drawn too far towards 'we're going to invade your privacy,' versus 'we're going to respect your privacy,' "" Udall told CNN's State of the Union. Udall is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, have criticized the scope of the classified programs that allow the collection of Americans' phone records but have been limited in what they could say publicly. Udall told CNN that claims that the monitoring has thwarted terrorist attacks are overblown. ""It's unclear to me we've developed any intelligence through the metadata program that's led to the disruption of plots that could have been attained through other means,"" Udall said, pushing back on assertions by both administration officials and Rogers that a specific plot was stopped using the massive collection of phone records. 'I do not expect to see home again' The Guardian reported that Snowden grew up in North Carolina and Maryland. He joined the Army in 2003 but was discharged after breaking both his legs in a training accident. He never completed a high-school diploma but learned computer skills at a community college in Maryland. He started his career as a security guard for an NSA facility at the University of Maryland, then went to work for the CIA in Internet security. In 2009, he got the first of several jobs with private contractors that worked with the NSA. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Booz Allen said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. Reports that he had leaked American secrets were ""shocking"" and if true, ""represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,"" the company said. Snowden told the Guardian that he left for Hong Kong on May 20 without telling his family or his girlfriend what he planned. ""I do not expect to see home again,"" he told the paper, acknowledging the risk of imprisonment over his actions. ""You can't come up against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and not accept the risk,"" he said. ""If they want to get you, over time they will.""","Sen.

"(CNN) -- A deaf Texas man, who was imprisoned for years for a sexual crime, was released from a Texas jail Tuesday after a judge exonerated him on Monday based on new evidence. Stephen Brodie was convicted of the 1990 sexual assault of a 5-year-old girl largely based on his confession rather than physical evidence, CNN-affiliate KTXA reported. But new evidence emerged -- a fingerprint at the crime scene from a different man who has since been convicted of a sexual crime against an underage teen. On Monday, Brodie was in a Dallas courtroom where Judge Lena Levario ruled that he would be released, the judge's clerk told CNN. Brodie told KTXA that he was harassed by police and confessed to the crime to get them to leave him alone. At some points during the investigation, he was interrogated without a interpreter present, the affiliate reported. ""I felt like I was taken advantage of because I am deaf,"" Brodie told the affiliate in a jailhouse interview where he spoke through a sign language interpreter. A spokesman for Richardson police, the department that arrested Brodie, told KTXA that the department did a thorough and competent investigation.","NEW: Stephen Brodie has been released from prison .

"(CNN) -- The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Catholic Church authorities in Ireland covered up clerical child abuse until the mid-1990s, according to a government-commissioned report released Thursday. The Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation's 720-page report said that it has ""no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up"" from January 1975 to May 2004, the time covered by the report. ""The Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets,"" the report said. ""The welfare of children, which should have been the first priority, was not even a factor to be considered in the early stages,"" it said. ""Instead the focus was on the avoidance of scandal and the preservation of the good name, status and assets of the institution and of what the institution regarded as its most important members -- the priests."" Archbishop Diarmuid Martin apologized Thursday in a news conference. ""No words of apology can ever be sufficient,"" he said. And Dermot Ahern, Ireland's justice minister, said he felt a ""a growing sense of revulsion and anger"" as he read the report. ""Bottom line is this: A collar will protect no villain,"" he said. The commission was set up in March 2006 to look into allegations of child sexual abuse made against clergy in the Irish capital. Its report was completed in July. Although the commission said it was not its place to ""establish whether or not abuse occurred ... it is abundantly clear ... that child sexual abuse by clerics was widespread throughout the period."" One victim, Marie Collins, said those who covered up the abuse were just as guilty as the perpetrators of the crimes. ""How many people accused of abuse are still sitting in parishes today?"" she asked in a Thursday news conference. The commission examined the histories of 46 priests, who were picked as a sample from 102 who had had complaints or suspicions of child abuse raised against them. Complaints from more than 320 children were leveled against the 46, the report said. But it said that the number of children abused likely exceeded that. ""One priest admitted to sexually abusing over 100 children, while another accepted that he had abused on a fortnightly basis during the currency of his ministry which lasted for over 25 years,"" the report said. ""The total number of documented complaints recorded against those two priests is only just over 70."" In its analysis of the 46 priests, the commission said that all four archbishops -- Archbishops John Charles McQuaid, Dermot Ryan, Kevin McNamara, and Desmond Connell -- who served during the time period covered by the report handled the child sexual abuse complaints ""badly."" ""Not one of them reported his knowledge of child sexual abuse to the Gardai (the Irish police force) throughout the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s,"" the report said. The commission did credit Connell, who took over the archdiocese in 1988, with giving Irish authorities in 1995 the names of 17 priests against whom complaints had been made -- although it called the number incomplete, saying that there was ""knowledge within the Archdiocese of at least 28 priests against whom there had been complaints."" They said he was ""slow to recognize the seriousness of the situation."" Connell also gave authorities permission to access the archdiocesan files in 2002. Connell, a cardinal, apologized in a written statement. ""I wish to express without reservation my bitter regret that failures on my part contributed to the suffering of victims in any form,"" he said. ""Although I am all too aware that such apologies and expressions of regret can never be adequate as a response to so much hurt and violation and, in any case, lose their value through repetition, I apologize again now from my heart and ask the forgiveness of those who have been so shamefully harmed."" The report named 11 priests who had pleaded guilty to or were convicted of sexual assaults on children. Of the other 35, it gave pseudonyms to 33 of them and redacted the names of two. The report shot down the notion that church leadership was unaware of the problem. ""The Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities have repeatedly claimed to have been, prior to the late 1990s, 'on a learning curve' in relation to the matter,"" it said. However, it said McNamara, Ryan and McQuaid had information on complaints against at least 17 priests when the Archdiocese took out insurance in 1987 to cover future compensation claims and lawsuits related to sexual abuse allegations. ""The taking out of insurance was an act proving knowledge of child sexual abuse as a potential major cost to the Archdiocese and is inconsistent with the view that Archdiocesan officials were still 'on a learning curve' at a much later date, or were lacking in an appreciation of the phenomenon of clerical child sex abuse,"" it said. The report also said church officials perpetuated the problem by ignoring allegations and in some cases simply moved an alleged abuser on to another parish -- leaving him free to abuse another group of children. Thursday's findings follow a report that came out in May, detailing allegations of child abuse in various institutions across Ireland from the 1940s to the present. Though both reports deal with child abuse, they are not related, having been written by two separate commissions investigating two different subjects. The May report looked at child abuse in lay institutions, including reformatories, hospitals, orphanages, children's homes and industrial schools across the country. Some of those institutions were linked to religious orders, but none were strictly religious schools. Speaking last month after the Irish High Court cleared the way for Thursday's report to be made public, Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern said he was pleased the information would not be kept private. ""I have always made it clear that I have been anxious to put the report into the public domain as quickly as possible, while at the same time not wishing to do anything which would prejudice the chances of any of the people involved in these evil deeds being brought to justice,"" Ahern said in a statement. CNN's Atika Shubert contributed to this report.","New report examines abuse abuse between January 1975 and May 2004 .

"In the United States, a person dies every 19 minutes from a prescription drug overdose. Many of those deaths are attributed to a family of painkillers known as opioids. In an effort to reduce abuse, the Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it ""is invoking its authority to require safety labeling changes and post-market studies to combat the crisis of misuse, abuse, addiction, overdose and death from these potent drugs that have harmed too many patients and devastated too many families and communities,"" according to a press release. The label changes are meant for extended-release or long-acting opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone, among others. FDA Commissioner Dr. Margaret Hamburg told reporters: ""These drugs are at the heart of the abuse epidemic. But we must recognize the medical use they have."" Currently, the labels on the drugs say they are for ""the relief of moderate to severe pain in patients requiring continuous, around-the-clock opioid treatment for an extended period of time."" To discourage over-use and misuse of the drugs, the new labels will say the drugs should be used only when ""alternative treatment options are inadequate.""  While the label changes are something physicians should be aware of, the FDA said it hopes this will result in a larger conversation about pain management between patients and doctors. The FDA expects to finalize the new labeling requirements by the end of this year.","Prescription drugs are common cause of drug overdose deaths .

"From wearable technology to space tourism, 2014 will be a year of significant technological leaps. We take a look through some of the most ground-breaking developments of the year ahead. Electric cars take to the track . As the name suggests, Formula E is all about electric power. The arrival of this new petrol-free motor racing competition is a significant step for both the car and the environment. Two years ago motorsport's international governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), announced its ambitious plan for an electric car race that would mimic the hugely popular F1 series. As the arrival of Formula E looms, experts predict that it could have a big impact on the future of car manufacturing. Initially, the cars in the competition will be powered by enormous battery engines. Each battery weighs 200 kilograms, producing around 200 kilowatts of power. Depending on the speed, the electric engines will last anywhere from a few hours to just 25 minutes and the cars can reach speeds of up to 220 kilometers per hour. ""If you look in the past, a lot of development in the car industry has come from racing,"" said Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag. ""The transfer of technology is potentially very big."" Space tourism blasts off . After a number of false starts and delays, Virgin Galactic is finally poised to lift off in 2014. Billionaire Richard Branson's planned commercial spacecraft underwent a successful test flight last year over California, making a commercial launch this year a distinct possibility. In September 2013, Branson's Virgin Galactic said SpaceShipTwo completed an important test, breaking the sound barrier as it climbed from 42,000 feet to 69,000 feet over the Mojave Desert before descended using its tilt-wing ""feathering"" maneuver. It was the second successful powered flight for SpaceShipTwo -- a craft designed to carry up to six passengers. Initially, Virgin Galactic flights are scheduled to be suborbital, but the hope is to take passengers further into space as the technology is refined. Already, a host of famous names have signed up to head into near orbit including Katy Perry, Stephen Hawking and Ashton Kutcher. ""We couldn't be more delighted to have another major supersonic milestone under our belts as we move toward a 2014 start of commercial service,"" said Branson after the test flight last year. Wind power blows stronger . As scientists look to find alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, a number of major projects, including Cape Wind (in Massachusetts' Nantucket Sound) and Deepwater Wind (near Block Island, Rhode Island), are vying to become the first offshore windfarm in the U.S. Alongside power from volcanoes, waves, biomass and the sun, wind power is set to become a significant alternative energy source in 2014. Are we finally heading to Mars? A new type of engine, called the VASIMR (or Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket) will be tested in space in March. If successful it is estimated that it could reduce the time it takes to get to Mars from nine months to just three months. The technology -- an ""advanced plasma space propulsion system"" -- will be tested by NASA on the International Space Station, taking the prospect of interplanetary exploration one step closer. Synthetic biology begins to grow . Marcus Fairs, the editor of dezeen.com, a highly influential online design magazine, says that in his view 2014's most significant emerging technologies will be in the field of synthetic biology. ""This emerging field started to hit the headlines at the end of last year and will be huge in 2014,"" Fairs say. ""It involves the creation of new types of artificial life forms that perform useful functions. At the smallest scale it could mean man-made microbes that live inside your body and detect illness; at the largest scale it could mean synthetic creatures that are released into the wild to clean up pollution or attack parasitic species."" Wearable technology is on trend . Wearable technology fired some preliminary warning shots in 2013 with the release of the Samsung Galaxy Gear and Pebble smartwatches, but this year will see the arrival of a selection of truly innovative wearable devices. Most notably, Google Glass is expected to launch this year, offering head-mounted computing that could, ultimately, make smartwatches and mobile phones a thing of the past. Alongside Google's new high-tech glasses, Fairs says that in 2014 ""technology will migrate onto the body as digital services are miniaturized and embedded in our clothing or worn against our skin. We already have Google Glass and wearable fitness trackers, but a vast array of services -- from health monitoring to augmented information (telling you what's around you and helping you navigate) will become commonplace."" Fairs points to clothing with in-built solar panels, devices that scan your body for disease, and self-repairing trainers as some of the more exciting wearable technologies on the near horizon. Tim Meyer, Head of Strategic Planning and Communications at TRIUMF, Canada's national laboratory for particle and nuclear physics, agrees. ""This year's Las Vegas CES show is revealing new wearable technology, but what we're going to see this year is the development and test-marketing of smart clothing, not just smart gadgets,"" Meyer says. ""New fibers, new micro-sensors, and new communications protocols will allow your clothes to actually work for you and collect and process information.  I suspect we'll see some fashion statements first: clothes that change shape or color.  Then we'll see clothes that do computing; first step will be storing information.  My socks will store today's to-do list."" Dark matter . Meyer also believes that 2014 will be a significant year for physics, particularly in the search for dark matter: ""Dark matter is being searched for in everyone's sock drawer as well as deep underground and with satellites. The underground experiments are likely to find something before the Large Hadron Collider turns back on to try ""making"" it. We could see a conclusive discovery of weakly interacting, massive dark matter particles this year.  That will blow your mind."" Crowd-funding comes of age . Mid-way through 2014 new laws (known as the JOBS act) will allow anybody to buy equity in start-ups through new online crowd-funding marketplaces. This will make it almost as easy for individuals to fund new technology ventures as it currently is to support a Kickstarter project, bringing a flood of new capital to fledgling tech companies. ""The ability to aggregate a bunch of individuals around a common funding goal is absolutely game changing,"" Vince Molinari, founder and chief executive of GATE Technologies, an online trading company said. With these new laws in place, the rapid technology developments of 2014 may be dwarfed by innovations in 2015 and beyond. Watch this space.","2014 will be a year of enormous technological leaps .

"Dallas (CNN)Oklahoma's first scheduled execution since last April's controversial botched lethal injection is now in the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court to decide. Charles Frederick Warner, who was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter in  summer 1997, is scheduled to be executed Thursday at 6 p.m. CT at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, about 130 miles east of Oklahoma City. Botched execution haunts inmate as death nears . Warner's attorney, Dale Baich, filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday asking for a stay of execution, and is also asking the court to review Oklahoma's lethal injection policies in general, after a federal appeals court rejected his appeal Monday. ""Oklahoma's current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain, needless suffering and a lingering death,"" Baich told CNN. Jerry Massie, public information officer with the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, said Warner is scheduled to be executed using a three-drug combination of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride. Ohio changing execution drugs . Midazolam, a benzodiazepine that is still not FDA approved, is supposed to render the prisoner unconscious.  Vecuronium bromide is a paralytic, which is meant to paralyze all muscle movement and stop respiration.  Potassium chloride's role is to activate nerves and induce cardiac arrest. Baich said the existing Supreme Court protocol and precedent under review, 2008's Baze V. Rees case, is no longer relevant or used in any jurisdiction because different types of drugs are now used.  He argued that the changes that have been made over the years are significant and ""create a significant risk of harm."" ""Of particular concern is the use of midazolam, which has been involved in several extremely problematic executions, including the gruesome and horrific execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma and the two-hour prolonged death of Joseph Wood in Arizona in July 2014,""  Baich said. ""In Baze v. Rees,  the court acknowledged that administering a paralytic and potassium chloride to someone who is not deeply unconscious would inflict an unconstitutional degree of pain and suffering. Midazolam is not capable of producing a deep, unconscious state."" Massie said the Oklahoma Department of Corrections  will have ""no further comments"" until it sees what the Supreme Court decides. Jennifer Moreno, a staff attorney with the Berkeley Law Death Penalty Clinic, said the big issue in front of the Supreme Court is whether midazolam can reliably produce the level of unconsciousness needed to complete an execution. ""It's uncontested that administering those two drugs [vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride] to somebody who is conscious would cause unnecessary pain and suffering,"" Moreno said. ""The real issue is that because there are issues about midazolam's ability to induce the necessary level of unconsciousness, and Oklahoma intends to paralyze the prisoner, that we'll never know if he regained consciousness and experienced the effects of the second and third drugs. In all three executions where medazline has been used without a paralytic, we have seen problems that raised questions about the appropriateness of the drug. Paralyzing them doesn't make the problem go away, it just hides them from us."" Warner was originally scheduled for execution on the same night as Lockett, April 29, 2014, but the execution was called off after the state took 43 minutes to execute Lockett, a controversial event that was witnessed by media and state officials. Witnesses said Lockett was convulsing and writhing on the gurney, as well as struggling to speak, before officials blocked their view.  The execution was halted, but Lockett eventually died. A team of medical examiners ruled that Lockett died from the state's lethal injection. The report, which was released in September by the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, called the manner of death a ""judicially ordered execution."" Lockett's execution was the first time Oklahoma had used midazolam as the first element in its three-drug cocktail,  the same three-drug combination that is scheduled to be used in Warner's execution. Midazolam is generally used for children ""before medical procedures or before anesthesia for surgery to cause drowsiness, relieve anxiety and prevent any memory of the event,"" the U.S. National Library of Medicine said. ""It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow relaxation and sleep."" Stay motions have also been filed with the U.S. Supreme Court for three other Oklahoma death row prisoners scheduled to be executed soon: Richard Glossip, scheduled to be put to death on January 29; John Marion Grant, scheduled to be executed on February 19; and Benjamin R. Cole, scheduled to be put to death on March 5. Chemical mix and human error lead to controversial executions .

"A gruesome snuff video that has garnered more than 180,000 views on YouTube underlines just how grim the Syrian conflict has become. This video appears to document one of the worst kinds of war crimes: The summary executions of wounded men. (Warning: The scenes are extremely graphic.) Several paramilitaries in battle fatigues armed with automatic weapons -- some speaking Arabic in distinctive Lebanese accents -- pull wounded men out of the back of a van and drop them on to the ground, then shoot them in their heads at point-blank range. As they shoot their victims, some of the paramilitaries seem almost giddy with excitement. A man who appears to be their commander admonishes his men, ""Come on guys, we are here to carry out our duties not to seek revenge on our own. This is unacceptable."" One of the paramilitaries smilingly replies, ""But we are killing them in God's cause, only in God's cause."" The wounded men lying on the ground awaiting their deaths repeat religious phrases that are commonly said just before death. They all appear to be civilians. There has been much analysis of the al Qaeda-aligned groups in Syria fighting the Assad regime that have recruited thousands of foreign fighters from around the Arab world and a smaller number from the West, but there has been far less discussion of the Shiite militias in Syria that have recruited foreign fighters from Iraq as well as from Lebanese Hezbollah, all of whom are fighting to support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Barak Barfi, an American journalist who is a fellow at the New America Foundation and who has reported inside Syria for many months, says that one of the executioners in the videotape is wearing a distinctive yellow armband that Hezbollah fighters wear. Barfi says, ""This appears to be a Hezbollah video, though we cannot conclude this with high confidence."" Similarly, Augustus Richard Norton, professor of international relations at Boston University and the author of an authoritative study of Hezbollah, says, ""The only identifying marks on the uniforms are yellow ribbons, which, in theory, would identify them as Hezbollahis."" Randa Slim, also a fellow at the New America Foundation and a scholar at the Middle East Institute who is writing a book about Hezbollah, says that based on the accents of the Arabic-speaking executioners the video shows Syrians as well as fighters from Iraq and Lebanon. Slim cautions, however, that the paramilitaries conducting the executions could well be members of an Alawite militia made up mostly of Syrians who have been trained by Hezbollah, but that are not part of Hezbollah itself. Phillip Smyth, a researcher at the University of Maryland who specializes in Shiite militias operating in Syria, says that the fighters are likely from Hezbollah as they speak in a Lebanese accent and when they perform the executions they mention a religious edict handed down by a key Hezbollah religious guide. Oubai Shahbandar is a Syrian-American who worked at the Pentagon for much of the past decade as a Middle East analyst, including a stint on General David Petraeus' staff during the Iraq War, and is now a vice president at the Syrian Support Group, which supports ""moderate elements of Syria's armed opposition."" Shahbandar has been tracking Hezbollah since 2007 and he asserts that the executioners in the video are definitely from Hezbollah and that the video itself was shot in Homs province in western Syria. An analysis done by CNN's International desk confirms that the dialect spoken by the executioners in the videotape is Lebanese Arabic and they can be heard shouting ""Fi Sabil Allah,"" an Arabic phrase that means ""in God's cause,"" an expression commonly used by Hezbollah fighters on the battlefield. The international desk's analysis points out that the yellow and green ribbons tied to the fighters' uniforms appear to mark them as Hezbollah fighters. As is now well known, many of the players in the Syrian conflict, including most prominently the Assad regime itself, have committed war crimes against civilians. On Friday, Human Rights Watch released a report documenting a massacre on August 4 that was perpetrated by two al Qaeda-aligned Sunni militant groups, the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham and Jabhat al-Nusra. The massacre took place in the coastal region of Latakia in a number of Alawite villages supportive of the Assad regime.  According to the report ""Eight survivors and witnesses described how opposition forces executed residents and opened fire on civilians, sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack, and at other times killing adult male family members, and holding the female relatives and children hostage. "" Human Rights Watch collected the names of 190 civilians who were killed in these attacks, including 57 women and at least 18 children and 14 elderly men. While the world in the past few weeks has been distracted by the U.S. government shutdown and the brutal attack on the mall in Kenya by an al Qaeda affiliate that left at least 67 dead, the Syrian war has ground on. It is a war that has now claimed as many as 120,000 lives. Four of those deaths are documented in the appalling videotape of the Shiite paramilitaries gleefully executing wounded men who appear to be civilians. And the deaths of 190 civilians killed by Sunni militias in August are documented in great detail in the Human Rights Watch report that was released Friday. Just when you thought the Syrian civil war couldn't get any worse, it does.","A video purportedly shot in Syria shows gruesome executions .

"(CNN)For Formula One fanatics it was a thrilling  spectacle  -- the sport's top two drivers going head-to-head for the drivers' championship title. That Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were teammates, from the Mercedes stable, made it all the more enthralling. Not only did they go corner-to-corner on the circuit, they also traded verbal volleys away from the pit lane. For Rosberg, who was ultimately beaten to the world title by the Briton and had to deal with plenty of criticism along the way, it wasn't the first time he'd felt like an outsider. As testing for the 2015 season continues, he says last term provided some trying moments but he insists he can't think of a better teammate than Hamilton. ""Of course there have been clouds,"" he told Formula One's official website. ""Everybody has his own relative worries. ""I was treated pretty badly by the other kids in my early school years. I was traveling a lot with my parents, so I never belonged to a gang -- I was always the outsider. ""Later in life I discovered the beauty of traveling, but as a small kid I hated it -- I wanted to be part [of things]. This might sound like small fry, but a seven-year-old takes that very seriously. ""But also my racing career was cloudy at times: my two Formula Three years when I didn't go anywhere and my Formula One dream almost became elusive. And even in Formula One I had tough periods. ""I wanted to win and had been driving so many years behind, seeing the others having these awesome cars -- Lewis in the early days at McLaren and Vettel at Red Bull -- and I was just driving behind. ""Sure it was not suffering in any way, but for me individually I want to win and if I don't win it sucks. But I am not dwelling on the past. One day after Abu Dhabi my life was back to normal."" Prior to last season's runner-up berth, Rosberg's best finish in an F1 season was sixth back in 2013. But once it became clear 2014's spoils were a straight contest between the German and Hamilton, cracks began to appear in their relationship, which began back in their teenage years. It reached a nadir at the Belgian Grand Prix, when the pair -- who were allowed to develop a fiercely competitive rivalry by their team -- collided early in the race. Hamilton was later forced to retire and told reporters after the race Rosberg had admitted to crashing into him on purpose. The 29-year-old was blamed by Mercedes, fined and made to apologize, Hamilton going on to win six of the last seven races to claim his second F1 crown. But despite the negative press their spat engendered last term, Rosberg thinks its tempestuous nature is likely to continue in 2015. ""We have a relationship that goes up and down and it will continue to go up and down,"" he explained. ""It is an intense battle between us and that will not change any time soon. ""Last year's experience helps. It's that 'been there, done that' kind of thing. All the difficult times have made me stronger. It is the difficult moments where I learn the most. ""Of course with time, and the situation, the skin grows thicker. Yes, there have been challenging times, but from my point of view I always felt comfortable, and it continues like that."" When asked if he could think of a better teammate to have than Hamilton he replied: ""No. It is the challenge that I relish."" Mercedes' decision to permit their two drivers to go hell for leather in pursuit of the F1 title was questioned in some quarters, especially after that flashpoint in Belgium. But according to team principal Toto Wolff, that modus operandi and the tension it brings can help spur his drivers onto greater heights. ""We chose a strategy of 'let them race,'"" he explained. ""For a team it is better to have two equally good drivers trying to beat each other but also sharing data with each other. ""That is when a team is getting pushed forward. The downside -- the intense competition -- we will live with. We have learned from last season. We have matured as a team, including the drivers. ""Yes, I have no illusions that 2015 will be an easier year. There will again be times of discussion, sure. But these are the situations that bring you to the front."" Wolff says everyone at Mercedes is hungry to replicate last season's success, in which it won the drivers' and constructors' championship. And while admitting this season could see greater competition from the likes of Ferrari and Red Bull, he wouldn't be drawn on which of his drivers has the edge going into the new season. ""Before we start that discussion: we have to provide them with a car that gives them the tool to fight for the championship,"" he said. ""They had a very intense battle last year and I have no doubt that if they have a good car they will be fighting for wins and the championship again. ""But honestly I don't see 2015 as a runaway season for one of the two -- so there will be lots of 'excitement' for the team and another sizzling season for the fans."" Wolf also said he had no concerns about Hamilton's contract, which is entering its final season. ""We are having discussions -- very positive ones, which will come to a positive end soon. I have no doubt about that,"" he said. ""We met each other after the break one week ago and had a good discussion. There is no hurry. It's only January and his contract runs for another year. ""So when we discuss, it's still about something that's happening in 12 months. No stress. We want him to stay and he wants to stay, so there are no risks in taking the situation calmly.""","Mercedes' Nico Rosberg admits to dark times during the 2014 F1 season .

"His parents remember Dylan Hockley as such a happy child. He was 6 and full of joy, his mother, Nicole Hockley, says. She said he was always smiling and described his laugh as infectious. When his dad would return to their Newtown, Connecticut, home each day, Dylan would run to his father, Ian, saying,""Daddy!"" It's been exactly a month since Dylan and his teacher, Anne Marie Murphy, and 24 other students and adults were killed by a lone gunman at Sandy Hook Elementary School. As would be expected, coping has been hard. ""It's a strange moment when you wake up in the morning and for that brief second everything is as it was,"" she says. ""And then you realize that nothing is ever as it was -- and never will be again."" On Monday, after putting themselves ""in a little cocoon,"" as she put it, Hockley decided it was time to tell the world about Dylan. ""He was autistic,"" she says, ""but incredibly empathetic."" ""He just wanted to have fun."" Most of all, Dylan loved to bounce on a trampoline in the family's backyard, remembers his father. ""I'd say, 'Go out on the trampoline!' Ian Hockley says. ""And he would always say, 'Are you coming, Daddy?'"" Together, they would vault up on the trampoline and bounce, sometimes joined by Dylan's brother, Jake, who is two years older. ""If I didn't go, Dylan wouldn't go,"" Ian Hockley remembers. ""He just wanted to have so much fun with me."" Just down the street lived Adam Lanza, 20. Authorities said Lanza opened fire inside Sandy Hook Elementary before taking his own life. They said he killed his mother, Nancy, before the school shooting. Asked whether they knew the Lanzas, Nicole Hockley stiffened and said no. But they say the pain has made it impossible to even drive past the Lanza home. So they are moving elsewhere in the community. ""You can't drive up your driveway every day and see the house of a person who took your son's life and who brought so much pain to so many people,"" Nicole said. ""We are leaving that house. We will stay in Newtown, but that's just one thing too much. I can't do that every day."" And they have trouble answering Jake's questions, such as why? And will this happen again? Nicole says these are not things an 8-year-old should have to worry about. But Ian says it's Jake's difficult questions that give them the will to get involved -- to try to make something positive come from the tragedy. ""We're just focusing on getting up each day,"" Nicole said. As she puts it, the family is ""trying to find a way to make sense of this by taking some action and getting involved."" They've started a fund in Dylan's name to raise money to support programs and educational aids for other children with autism and other special needs. They haven't learned all the details of the massacre that happened on December 14. Until now, they haven't felt much like watching TV or interacting with the outside world. But one detail has given the Hockleys comfort. A few days after the tragedy, the Hockleys ran into Mike Murphy. His wife, Anne Marie Murphy, taught their son at Sandy Hook. He revealed to her that -- in the terrible aftermath of the attack -- first responders found Dylan and his teacher together. ""He said that Anne Marie Murphy had been found with her arms wrapped around Dylan ... that is what we had hoped for -- in a very strange sort of way to hope for something."" ""She loved him and he loved her and she would've looked after him no matter what,"" she says, fighting back tears. ""To know that he was with her, and that he wasn't alone, that gives you a huge peace of mind ... to know that he was loved even in those last moments."" Obama says gun lobby stokes fear .

"Berlin (CNN)The horrific twin attacks in Paris last week have sent shockwaves throughout Europe. Political leaders from across the EU joined millions of French mourners on Sunday, and Europeans-at-large continue to pay tribute with public vigils, flowers and candles, and minutes of silence. Yet this outpouring of solidarity must not obscure another response across the continent. Leaders of Europe's far-right have been quick to blame Islam and immigration, mosques have been defaced in France and elsewhere, and a xenophobic movement called ""Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident"" brought tens of thousands to the streets of Germany this week. This extreme strand of European publics and politics will likely receive a boost from the French tragedy. Anti-immigration and anti-Islamic sentiments have been on a steady rise in Europe for years. While a majority of Europeans appreciates mobility and migration within the European Union, they are largely negative about immigration from outside of the EU, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. This opposition is particularly pronounced towards Muslim immigrants. Half and more of all Europeans view Islam as incompatible with the Western world, while Islam is seen as an outright threat by between one-third of all Brits and almost two-thirds of all Spaniards, according to a recent Bertelsmann study. Holders of such views will surely see the Paris attacks as confirmation; many others may now question their hitherto more moderate opinions. It is these sentiments, along with fears over economic prospects, aversion to the political establishment and doubts in the European project, that populist and typically far-right parties have successfully tapped in recent years. Virtually every EU country has seen the rise of such a political force, and their combined representation in the European Parliament has shot up to 20% in last year's elections. For these parties, the Paris attacks truly are a ""told-you-so"" moment. Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party blamed ""a fifth column within our countries,"" while Geert Wilders of the Freedom Party in the Netherlands claimed that it was time to ""de-Islamize our country."" Marine Le Pen of the French Front National urged that ""time's up for denial and hypocrisy,"" and Alexander Gauland of the Alternative for Germany saw all those proven wrong who had ignored the Islamist threat. Sadly, these slogans are more likely than ever before now to resonate with European publics. This combination of a considerable portion of Europeans that are skeptical of, if not outright hostile to, Muslims and migrants, and the ever more aggressive rhetoric of the populist far-right puts a massive pressure on Europe's politics and societies alike. First and foremost, Europe's Muslim communities are likely to suffer. Although in their overwhelming majority, they are integrated and identify with Europe, blanket suspicion against Islam, resentments in day-to-day life, and assaults on their community are bound to increase and deepen fear and alienation among Muslims. This will feed segregation among Muslim and non-Muslim communities, and provide a fertile ground for the radicalization of some young Muslims. In short, European Muslims are at risk of being driven away from mainstream European societies. Secondly, the political climate and culture in Europe will change. Under attack from extremists, whether in parliament or in the streets, mainstream political parties will be tempted to move away from their typically centered, whether somewhat to the left or right, positions. Politics will move to tighten immigration laws, select highly-skilled migrants over refugees from war zones, push for their greater assimilation, and install additional security measures. As a result, further liberties of European citizens are likely to be sacrificed as political establishments try to preempt a further growth of extremist parties. This is a slippery slope, as radicals will quickly produce the next phobia that they demand to be addressed. Thirdly, this changing climate and politics will also impact on migration and migrants broadly, beyond Muslims. Already there have been fierce debates to limit intra-European migration, whether hurdles to Central and Eastern Europeans after their countries joined the European Union, or restrictions on social benefits EU citizens can draw across borders. Much as these debates  are already taking their toll on some of Europe's poorest, such as the Roma, future approaches to immigration to the EU will likely exclude some of the world's most underprivileged, such as asylum-seekers. Fortress Europe will become even more of a reality. Europe can still stem this dangerous trend. Millions of French people, of all origins and faiths, have given a powerful example of unity, openness and inclusiveness last week, as have tens of thousands of pro-tolerance and pro-immigration marchers in Germany this week. It is now also on Europe's political class to resolutely refute the many ""told-you-so's"" on the continent.

"(CNN)An al Qaeda operative who helped radicalize and recruit two of the Paris gunmen was identified by U.S. authorities in July 2001, less than two months before the 9/11 attacks against the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Djamel Beghal, an al Qaeda recruiter in Europe, was tapped in 2001 by senior Osama Bin Laden operative Abu Zubaydah to organize a terror cell to attack the U.S. Embassy in Paris.  He was stopped in Dubai on his way home from Afghanistan and days later on July 24, 2001, former CIA Director George Tenet was briefed on Beghal. Tenet confirms the ""discussion of the pending deportation from the UAE to France of Djamel Beghal, who intended to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris,"" in his biography.  On August 6, 2001, Tenet briefed President George W. Bush in a classified presidential daily brief, entitled ""Bin Ladin Determined to Strike in the U.S."" Terror experts describe Beghal as a key figure linking generations of European terrorists.  They include shoe bomber Richard Reid, 9/11's Zacarias Moussaoui and cleric Abu Hamza al Masri, all of whom Beghal knew from his association with the radical Finsbury Mosque in London. ""He was seen very much as an al Qaeda point man in Europe,"" says terror expert Sajjan Gohel of the Asia Pacific Foundation. Like Reid and Moussaoui, Beghal was inspired and radicalized by Abu Hamza al-Masri and adopted the name Abou Hamza in homage to his mentor, court documents show.  A Western intelligence source says al-Masri may have helped Beghal connect with the right people on his 2000-2001 trip to Afghanistan. Coincidentally, a federal judge in Manhattan gave al-Masri a life sentence on terror charges January 9, the same day the Paris attackers were killed in coordinated sieges by French police. Yet whether or not French authorities knew about his al Qaeda connections, Beghal served only eight years of a 10-year sentence for the U.S. Embassy plot.  He was released under house arrest in 2009. ""He's not the type of person who gets de-radicalized in prison,"" says Gohel, adding, ""He recruits others who he has incubated in prison.  He's a very dangerous person."" Defying the terms of his house arrest, Beghal quickly reconnected with two of his key recruits where he was confined, at the Murat Hotel in Cantal, France. Surveillance photos in 2010 show Beghal meeting two men in a Murat park in the presence of Cherif Kouachi.  Amedy Coulibaly visited Beghal the same year with his girlfriend, and now fugitive, Hayat Boumeddiene, the couple bringing Beghal food and money.   Boumeddiene refered to Beghal as a ""wise man"" who had ""lots of books on religion."" Court records show Kouachi and Coulibaly stayed with Beghal for several days in April. It didn't take long before all three men were once again in the crosshairs of French authorities, this time for a 2010 prison-break plot to free a man convicted of the 1995 bombing of a Paris Metro. Beghal was sentenced to 12 years.  Coulibaly, discovered with a weapons cache, was sentenced to four years and released in 2014.  Kouachi remained free because there was not enough evidence to tie him to the plot. Kouachi and his brother, Said, were killed by police in a gunfight after they attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a French magazine with a history of mocking Mohammed. Twelve people were killed, including several top editors. The brothers said they were avenging the prophet. Coulibaly also was killed January 9, after a shooting at a kosher grocery store in Paris. Police say Boumeddiene escaped the scene of the shooting. How the Kouachi brothers were radicalized .

"(CNN)The majority of AirAsia Flight QZ8501's fuselage has been found in the Java Sea, Indonesian authorities said Wednesday, 17 days after the airliner carrying 162 people went down. Officials have said the fuselage, or the main part of the plane, might contain many of the bodies of those who were aboard the flight. Authorities don't yet know why the plane crashed into the sea December 28 while en route to Singapore from the Indonesian city of Surabaya. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight, the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to avoid bad weather. Minutes later, the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar, Indonesian officials say. Now that the fuselage has been found, here are some of the tasks that are ahead for searchers and authorities: . The fuselage discovery adds to the significant finds elsewhere in the Java Sea. Authorities earlier this week recovered the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders -- which will help investigators determine what happened to the flight -- and lifted the tail section of the craft from the sea on Saturday. The priority now is to locate bodies, and divers are expected to search the fuselage Thursday morning, Indonesia search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo told reporters Wednesday. As of Wednesday night, 50 bodies had been recovered elsewhere, some still strapped into their seats, officials said. Many of the more than 100 remaining bodies might be found in or near the plane's fuselage.  It wasn't clear Wednesday whether the cockpit is attached. Soelistyo didn't reveal the fuselage's depth. But officials have said other debris, such as the recorders -- which were found about a half-mile from the fuselage on Monday and Tuesday -- were generally discovered at a depth of roughly 30 meters (100 feet). If divers have trouble accessing the bodies, officials may decide to ""lift the fuselage out of the water,"" Soelistyo said. It wasn't immediately clear how that would be done. To recover the tail section on Saturday, crews inflated giant balloons underneath, lifting it from the bottom of the sea. A crane then lifted the tail onto a ship. Both the flight data recorder and the cockpit flight recorder are expected to help investigators understand what went wrong. The flight data recorder, which stores a vast amount of information about the aircraft's performance including air speed and cabin pressure, tells investigators what happened on a plane. But the cockpit voice recorder tells them why, said Mardjono Siswosuwarno, a senior official at Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee, which is leading the investigation into the disaster. ""The 'why' is mostly in there,"" he said of the voice recorder, which captures conversations between pilots as well as other sounds in the cockpit. Investigators say they have successfully downloaded the contents of both devices. But Mardjono cautioned that interpreting the information will require a lot of time. Mardjono said he expected a preliminary report to be released within a month of the crash. But it's unclear how much information the initial document will contain beyond what's already been made public. The final report containing investigators' full conclusions will take months, Mardjono said. His agency's final report into Adam Air Flight 574 -- which crashed in Indonesian waters on New Year's Day 2007, killing all 102 people on board -- came out more than a year after that disaster. Meanwhile, Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, told CNN that because the recorders' data had been downloaded, investigators should have ""a pretty good idea within a couple of days"" of what happened aboard the plane. But Schiavo added that she didn't think officials would release any information publicly for a couple of weeks. French aviation experts are helping the Indonesian investigation, which also expected to involve Airbus, the manufacturer of the downed A320-200. Observers have suggested that the locations of the different parts of debris indicate the plane broke apart when it hit the water, not when it was still at a high altitude. AirAsia has said it will pay about $124,000 to the families of each victim -- $100,000 mandated by Indonesia's Transport Ministry's regulations, and $24,000 for what the airline called ""financial hardships"" relating to the initial search period. That is below the amount guaranteed by the Montreal Convention, a treaty that governs compensation for the families of air disaster victims. But Indonesia did not sign the treaty. Families may be able to pursue larger claims through courts, CNNMoney reported. It could be some time before the families to receive AirAsia's payments. In the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which vanished in March, families received some initial payments but final amounts haven't been settled, according to CNNMoney. CNN's Jethro Mullen, Kocha Olarn, Elizabeth Joseph, Andrew Stevens, Mitra Mobasherat, Gary Tuchman, Brian Walker, Catherine E. Shoichet, Josh Levs and Deborah E.

"Amazon released its newly curated list of 100 Books to Read in a Lifetime on Tuesday. Books on the list include Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" (1813), F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""The Great Gatsby"" (1925) and Kate Atkinson's ""Life After Life"" (2013). The list spans 200 years of literature, along with a wide range of genres and intended audiences; authors include David Sedaris, Salman Rushdie, J.D. Salinger, Michael Pollan and Shel Silverstein. Sara Nelson, editorial director of print and Kindle books at Amazon.com, said the list was created through taxing months of deliberation among her team, though no mathematical algorithms were used. ""One of our tasks was to have books that don't feel like homework: 'eat your vegetables' books,"" Nelson said. ""There was nothing in there except 'I loved this book when I was 12 for this reason.' We lobbied each other."" The books are not ranked but rather are listed alphabetically to represent that ""no book is more important than another,"" she added. Some books that unanimously made the cut are children's books like ""Charlotte's Web"" by E.B. White and ""Unbroken,"" a nonfiction book about World War II by ""Seabiscuit"" author Laura Hillenbrand. Fan favorites like the first installments of the ""Harry Potter,"" ""Hunger Games"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" series made the cut. The list also features just one of the No. 1 Amazon Best Books of the Year, Rebecca Skloot's ""The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks."" ""We tried to make sure that we had a pretty good balance of fiction and nonfiction,"" Nelson said. ""In terms of the demographic of the writers, we never sat down and said 'we need more women' or 'we need more books from different cultural groups or countries.' But overall, when I eyeball that list, it seems to have a lot of variation."" The book most hotly debated by the editorial team was George Orwell's dystopian novel ""1984. "" ""It wasn't so much 'Is ""1984"" a great book?' but 'Should we put ""1984"" or ""Brave New World""? Should we put ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Hobbit""?' On a 100 book list, you probably can't put both,"" Nelson said. ""We tried to find books that were iconic and that would lead to other books."" The list leaves off classics like ""Les MisÃ©rables"" and ""Moby Dick,"" though some editors argued for their inclusion. You can vote for which selections you like and suggest new ones at Goodreads.

"Two young women, both in their teens, were shot in a small south Texas town over the weekend. The police chief of the town said the incident -- which left one victim dead and the other clinging to life -- did not appear to be a random attack. ""This particular case, it does have some of the earmarks of a targeted attack,"" Chief Randy Wright of Portland told local station KZTV. Wright told CNN on Monday night the two friends were ""found by two visitors to the park Saturday morning."" Murders are not common in the town of about 16,000, just north of Corpus Christi. The last took place two years ago, Wright said. In the latest incident, the young women were found in an observation platform of an overlook at a park, the police chief said. Authorities believe they were shot sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning. One of the victims, 19-year-old Mollie Olgin, was pronounced dead after the shooting. The second, Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, was in serious condition at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the head. ""We have not been able to take a formal statement from Chapa as she is receiving medical care,"" Wright said. One of Chapa's former teachers is helping to organize a blood drive on her behalf. ""We are a very close-knit community and when news of the shooting spread through our town, everyone wanted to help,"" said Mary Lankford, who taught Chapa at Sinton High School. Witnesses told police they saw a dark-colored vehicle leaving the scene. But beyond that, detectives have little to go on. The FBI is assisting in the case, according to Shauna Dunlap, special agent and spokeswoman for the FBI in Houston. ""I've been trying to think of anybody I know that would try and hurt them for any reason,""  Samantha Garrett, Olgin's roommate, told KZTV. ""And not one person has ever come to mind.""

"The death toll from a landslide that buried three villages in eastern Uganda stood at 18 Tuesday, and rescue officials fear the figure will rise. Another nine were injured and countless more may be missing, the Red Cross said. Heavy rains sent rocks and mud crashing down on the villages in the mountainous district of Bududa on Monday, about 275 kilometers (170 miles) northeast of the capital Kampala. At least 15 homes were destroyed, said Catherine Ntabadde of the Uganda Red Cross Society. ""Last night district authorities requested all people in high risk places to move to a school that we are using as a primary camp,""  Ntabadde said Tuesday. No bodies have been recovered due to the heavy debris that has buried some of the victims 100 meters deep, Ntabadde said. Additional equipment is expected to arrive in the remote area Wednesday to assist in the excavation. Landslide kills 25 on Philippine island ravaged by rain . The Red Cross is working alongside members of the Ugandan army to relocate more than 1,000 people. ""People are a bit reluctant to move until an incident like this happens. People want to stay near their homes and find out what happened to their loved ones and their belongings,"" Ntabadde said. Torrential downpours regularly cause landslides in the eastern part of the country, particularly in areas where heavy logging has left the land stripped of vegetation. Last August, at least 23 people died when a massive landslide swallowed homes in the Bulambuli district, about 300 kilometers (186 miles) from Kampala.

"Inside a safe room of the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, Ambassador Chris Stevens took cover with two other foreign service officers. Just minutes earlier, a group of heavily armed militants launched an attack on the complex, pelting it with gunfire and rocket-propelled grenades. The attackers ignited a fire in the building and the safe room was filling with smoke. Six things to know about the attack . Stevens, Foreign Service information management officer Sean Smith and a U.S. regional security officer would soon be forced to leave their temporary refuge from the assault. Senior administration officials called the conditions inside ""awful,"" describing ""incredibly thick smoke and fire."" The officials, while still trying to piece together the details of how the Tuesday night consulate attack unfolded, began Wednesday to give a clearer picture of events. The violence began around 10 p.m. Tuesday amid a protest by the radical Islamist group Ansar Al-Sharia against a film mocking Islam's prophet. Four hours later, the consulate was destroyed, its walls blackened by shooting flames. Four Americans, including Stevens and Smith, were dead. Within 15 minutes of the first gunshots, the attackers were able to enter the main compound of the consulate complex and set it ablaze. Stevens, Smith and a regional security officer were the only people inside the building at the time. Photos taken Tuesday night show flames shooting from every orifice of the building as militants wielding weapons walk through the compound. The heavy, black smoke added to the confusion of the situation and the three diplomatic officers became separated as they evacuated the safe room, the administration officials said. Blog: Pentagon reviews attack video . Meanwhile, American and Libyan security personnel, forced to fend off an attack on the outside and the raging fire within, were grappling with how to handle the increasingly complicated scene, U.S. officials said. The regional security officer with Stevens and Smith managed to escape the building and returned with others to try to rescue the men. For Smith, the rescue came too late. He had already succumbed to smoke inhalation by the time they arrived. Stevens, in Benghazi on a short trip from the capital Tripoli, was missing, apparently able to make his way out unnoticed in the chaos. About 45 minutes after the first gunshots rang out, security personnel attempted to retake the main compound, but were repelled by heavy gunfire and retreated to an annex in the complex. Libya, West react to killings, film controversy . They made a second attempt at 11:20 p.m. -- more than an hour after the attack began -- and successfully regained control of the main building. But the incident was far from over. The gunbattle continued and the attack moved from the main compound to the complex's annex. ""It was during that time that two additional U.S. personnel were killed and two others were wounded,"" one of the senior administration officials said. Finally, around 2:30 a.m., four and a half hours into the attack, U.S. security personnel, assisted by Libyan forces, took back control of the entire consulate complex. Still unknown at that time, however, was Stevens' whereabouts. Stevens warned in '08 about extremists near Benghazi . Libyans said bystanders had helped carry an unconscious Stevens to a hospital. However, U.S. officials could not confirm that account. ""We are not clear on the circumstances between the time he got separated from the rest of the group inside the burning building to the time we were notified that he was in a Benghazi hospital,"" the senior administration official said. ""We were not able to see him until his body was returned to us at the airport."" Also unclear Wednesday was the significance of the timing of the attack, which fell on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington and coincided with a violent protest at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, Egypt. State Department officials said the two incidents at the diplomatic missions were not related and said they believe the Benghazi violence was a ""clearly planned attack."" Why Muslims are sensitive on prophet . ""It was not an innocent mob,"" one senior official said. ""The video or 9/11 made a handy excuse and could be fortuitous from their perspective but this was a clearly planned military-type attack."" U.S. President Barack Obama, however, said it was too early to say whether the attack was pre-planned. As dawn broke Wednesday, the magnitude of the previous night's events were felt by both Americans and Libyans. Charred debris and ash littered the floor of the burned-out consulate. A small American flag lay amid the rubble. And both the governments of the United States and Libya, on this ""very, very difficult day,"" mourned the loss of Stevens, who had helped save Benghazi during last year's revolution. ""He risked his life to stop a tyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said. Witnessing protests in Libya or Egypt?

"After just three doses of an experimental drug, Josh Hardy -- whose parents had to launch a media campaign to get him the medicine -- is sitting up, doing homework and playing board games with his brothers, his mother said. Just last week, Josh was so sick he could barely get out even a few words. He was in heart and kidney failure, and vomited blood several times an hour as his family held a vigil in the intensive care unit of a Memphis hospital. Josh received doses of the drug brincidofovir Wednesday, Saturday, and Tuesday, and tests showed the level of adenovirus in his blood went down from 250,000 copies per milliliter to 367 copies per milliliter. ""We expect it will be out of his system by Tuesday,"" his mother, Aimee Hardy, said Friday. ""I'm beside myself with how effective this drug was so quickly."" Already they're seeing results of the waning virus in Josh's system. He no longer has bleeding in his stomach and intestines. Before receiving brincidofovir, Josh was fighting for his life. The adenovirus was ravaging his immune system, left vulnerable by treatment for cancer, and the only available antiviral drug to treat it wasn't working. In early February, Chimerix, the company that makes brincidofovir, refused to give Josh its experimental drug. But after reports by CNN and intense pressure from social media, Chimerix and the Food and Drug Administration came up with a plan to get the medicine to Josh and other patients who request it. Drug company will give ailing 7-year-old medicine that could save him . Traditionally, drug companies have not been allowed to use so-called ""compassionate use"" patients like Josh as study subjects, so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company. But the FDA allowed Chimerix to use data from Josh and others as part of its application to the FDA, helping to get the drug on the market faster. Seven other adenovirus patients have inquired about being the next in line to get the drug, according to Kenneth Moch, the president of Chimerix, and several of those patients have already received doses. Even though the virus seems to be leaving Josh's body, his mother says his kidneys are still in danger. In February, his kidneys were just starting to recover from the damage of powerful chemotherapy. But then the adenovirus struck, and his doctors had no choice but to give him an antiviral drug that further damaged his kidneys. Now that Josh is taking brincidofovir, he's no longer taking the other drug that hurt his kidneys, but the damage was done: His kidneys still aren't working and he has to undergo dialysis three times a week. His mother worries he might be on dialysis the rest of his life. ""What if he has to be on dialysis long-term? If he could have gotten the brincidofovir earlier, it could have been avoided. That will always bother me,"" she said. Josh Hardy's father says son faces 'long road to recovery' She's also worried about something else -- Josh's state of mind. As recently as last month, Josh had a ""go get 'em"" attitude about fighting his illness, his mother says. But now, even though he's getting better, she says he seems to be exhausted after months of being sick and lacks motivation. ""I haven't seen him smile lately,"" she said. ""I try to get him to chant every day, 'I'm as good as new.' ""","Josh Hardy has received three doses of an experimental drug .

"Crucial talks on ending Syrian control of its chemical weapons began Thursday in Geneva with the top negotiators -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov -- offering similar goals but different ideas on how to reach them. ""This is not a game,"" Kerry said, making clear that a U.S. threat to attack Syria for allegedly gassing its own people remained an option if the negotiations failed to prove Syria and its ally Russia were serious about the Syrian regime handing over its chemical weapons stockpiles. Any agreement reached must be ""comprehensive,"" ""verifiable,"" ""credible"" and ""able to be implemented in a timely fashion,"" Kerry said, adding that ""there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place."" Lavrov, speaking in Russian, called for following established rules and protocols in the process for Syria to join the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and said that a solution ""will make unnecessary"" a military strike on Syria. Also Thursday, Syrian U.N. Ambassdor Bashar Ja'afari said his country formally asked to join the chemical weapons convention that bans such arms. However, the challenge facing negotiators was made clear by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who told Russian TV that his country would only agree to turn over its chemical weapons when the United States drops its threat to attack. ""This does not mean that Syria will sign these documents, carry out the conditions and that's it,"" al-Assad said, referring to the global convention against chemical weapons. ""This bilateral process is based, first of all, on the United States stopping its policy of threatening Syria."" In the interview, al-Assad said joining the convention gives Syria a standard 30 days to provide information on its stockpiles to the international community. Kerry appeared to reject that in his opening remarks for the talks with Lavrov. Referring to al-Assad's comment, Kerry said: ""We believe there is nothing standard about this process"" because of  the August 21 chemical weapons attack in suburban Damascus that the United States estimates killed more than 1,400 people. Reiterating the U.S. contention that al-Assad's regime was responsible, Kerry said ""we have in no uncertain terms made it clear that we cannot allow that to happen again."" The planned two days of meetings in Geneva by full diplomatic teams, including weapons experts, were considered a litmus test by President Barack Obama's administration for whether Russia is serious in pushing its ally Syria to give up hundreds of tons of chemical arms. Otherwise, Obama argues for targeted military strikes intended to inhibit Syria's ability to use its chemical weapons and deter it from considering doing so. Key developments in Syria crisis . Skepticism that Russia plan may be stall tactic . Kerry first publicly broached the idea of Syria turning over control of its chemical weapons, responding to a journalist's question Monday that such a move would prevent a U.S. attack. In a move that appeared to catch the Obama administration by surprise, Russia then formally proposed putting the Syrian chemical arsenal under international control and al-Assad's regime said it agreed. The ongoing U.S.-Russia negotiations in Geneva aimed to work out details on taking control of Syria's chemical weapons, setting the stage for a related U.N. Security Council resolution. However, Russia's steadfast opposition to any U.N. action on Syria raises questions about whether the talks in Geneva are merely a stall tactic to put off the U.S. attack Obama is threatening. As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia has so far blocked U.N. action sought by the United States and European allies against al-Assad's regime over chemical weapons. That track record fuels questions in the United States about the sincerity of the new Russian proposal for Syria to turn over control of its chemical weapons, with concerns it is a stall tactic to put off a U.S. attack or some other form of international response. Kerry told Syrian opposition leaders Thursday that he entered the talks with Lavrov ""from a position of skepticism,"" said a senior State Department official on condition of not being identified. That sentiment was echoed by House Speaker John Boehner in Washington. ""I have doubts about the motives of the Russians and Assad,"" Boehner said. U.N. report on Syria coming . Obama had tried to put together a NATO coalition to attack Syria. But he ran into roadblocks, like the vote by Britain's parliament -- a normally reliable party -- opting not to participate. He then asked Congress to authorize a military response in Syria, but appeared in danger of losing that vote until the Russian proposal emerged Monday to provide a diplomatic opening. While Kerry was in Geneva, Obama met with the rest of his Cabinet on Thursday and wished his absent secretary well. ""I am hopeful that the discussions that Secretary Kerry has with Foreign Minister Lavrov as well as some of the other players in this can yield a concrete result,"" Obama told reporters. ""And I know that he is going to working very hard over the next several days to see what the possibilities are there."" Former U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told CNN on Thursday that Kerry will have his hands full with Lavrov, whom Cohen described as ""very, very skilled,"" ""bright,"" ""articulate"" and ""a very tough negotiator."" Thursday's initial session revealed some of the dynamic between Kerry and Lavrov. In their opening statements, Lavrov spoke first with mostly technical comments and then Kerry followed with longer and more forceful remarks. When he finished, Lavrov asked to respond and said he hadn't come ""prepared with the extended political statement,"" adding that ""diplomacy likes silence."" Kerry then asked the translator to repeat Lavrov's final comment, but when that didn't happen, Lavrov tried to assure Kerry there was no problem. ""You want me to take your word for it? It's a little early for that,"" Kerry said, smiling, as the two men shook hands for the cameras. In some potential good news for Obama, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Thursday that a U.N. report on the August attack in Syria will ""probably"" be published on Monday, and that there will ""certainly be indications"" pointing to the origin of the attack. France and other U.S. allies have said they want any international response on Syria to come under U.N. auspices, and the report by inspectors who traveled to the site of the attack would be a first step toward generating support for a Security Council resolution. Obama makes case for action . The president insists he has the authority to attack Syria without congressional approval, but says he decided to seek the support of legislators for the sake of national unity. In a speech Tuesday night, Obama made moral and strategic arguments for taking action on Syria, challenging Congress and the American public to look at video footage of victims and saying that letting al-Assad get away with it would harm the security of the United States and its allies. Analysis: Obama a winner or loser on Syria? Opponents of a U.S. military strike argue that it could lead to another quagmire in someone else's civil war, and that Obama's proposal for limited strikes would fail to achieve the objective of eliminating the threat of Syria's chemical weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin injected himself into the American debate with an opinion piece first published late Wednesday on the New York Times website that argued against U.S. military intervention in Syria and implicitly criticized Obama. The White House shrugged off Putin's jabs at Obama as ""irrelevant,"" arguing that Russia's diplomatic intervention over Syria's chemical weapons meant that Putin now was ""fully invested"" in removing them from al-Assad's control. Meanwhile, a U.S. official told CNN that CIA-funded weapons have begun flowing to Syrian rebels, as pledged by the administration in June. The artillery described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition are not American-made, but are funded and organized by the CIA. They started to reach rebels about two weeks ago, the official said. Gen. Salim Idriss, the head of the Free Syrian Army, told CNN's Christian Amanpour on Thursday that U.S. aid was reaching the rebels, though he didn't detail whether that support includes weapons. ""We are getting now a lot of support from our American friends, but I can't talk in detail about all kinds of the support,"" Idriss said. Congress approved supplying weapons to the rebels after the administration asserted earlier this year that the al-Assad regime had used chemical weapons on a small scale. Before that, Obama had rejected calls by his national security team and members of Congress to increase direct military aid to the rebels. Those pushing for arming the rebels argue such a step would counter Russian weapons supplied to al-Assad's forces and strengthen the hand of moderate members of the Syrian opposition, making them less reliant on well-armed Islamic extremist elements within their ranks. But a senior U.S. military official has said, ""we do not see a clear division between moderates and extremists,"" making it hard to back the opposition without supporting extremist elements as well. While one U.S. official says ""only a minority are extremist"" -- a reference to rebel fighters tied to the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front -- U.S. officials familiar with intelligence assessments say many more rebel fighters than belong to that group may want to establish an Islamic state in Syria. On the other side of the bloody war, al-Assad's forces are getting support from at least 2,000 members of Hezbollah -- a pro-Syrian group based in Lebanon that the United States has designed as a terrorist organization -- U.S. officials estimate.","Many rebel fighters want to establish an Islamist state in Syria, U.S. officials say .

"In an effort to purge its national police force of corruption, the Honduran Congress voted to empower its military to carry out most police duties for at least 18 months. Tuesday night's vote gives the military a broad mandate over day-to-day crime fighting in the country, and gives the armed forces additional powers against organized crime in the country. ""We cannot have an armed forces only for foreign threats when there are so many deaths in the country because of violence,"" Juan Orlando Hernandez, president of the Congress, said before the vote. ""We are making this decision to support the Honduran people."" Honduras has the world's highest murder rate, with 82.1 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. According to a recent report by the country's own human rights commission, that rate could increase to 86 per 100,000 this year. The military's expanded powers would be in effect for at least 18 months, during which a purging process of the police will take place. The decree gives the military the power to make arrests, searches, and execute warrants in police matters. But the military is not displacing the police, armed forces spokesman Col. Alcides Flores told CNN. ""We are just augmenting the capacity of the police,"" he said. ""At no time are we replacing the police."" The approval of the decree is a sign that the country has admitted that the police force alone does not have the resources to reduce crime, he said. But there is also a high level of distrust of the police among the public. Earlier this month, the country placed 176 officers under investigation for a range of alleged crimes, from corruption to murder. The Honduran military had already been involved in operations against Mexican drug cartels operating in the country, but the new rules will give them more powers. Before, the military could only go on operations together with police, and served simply as a force multiplier. They were not allowed to make arrests or collect evidence. Only the police had these powers, and they were the only agency that could send a case to prosecutors. As a result, there were cases in which the military had to let suspected drug traffickers or other criminals escape because there was not a police officer available to make an arrest, Flores said. ""The new decree authorizes the armed forces to make captures without a police presence,"" Flores said. The military's new policing powers draw comparisons to Mexico's criticized military offensive against the drug cartels, but Flores said that isn't the case. ""We are not following the Mexican model. We are making a Honduran model,"" he said. In Mexico, the military has been accused of abuses and corruption in its policing duties, but Flores insisted that there will be much more supervision of the Honduran forces. The military will only flex its new muscle with the specific approval of the president at the request of the ministry of security, and the preference will be for joint operations with the police. The locations for domestic military operations and their size will depend on what the president authorizes, but Flores estimated the initial force will involve between 1,000 and 1,500 troops.","The Honduran Congress passed a decree giving the military more power .

"The man who jumped the White House fence earlier this month and breached the mansion's doors actually made it farther than originally thought, officials said Monday. White House fence jumper has PTSD, former stepson says . Omar Gonzalez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who had a knife in his pocket, overcame one Secret Service officer and ran into the East Room of the White House, where he was then subdued, a federal law enforcement said. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who was provided the information by whistleblowers during his congressional investigation into the incident, also confirmed the details of what now appears to be a wild chase through the main floor of the White House, first reported by the Washington Post. The Secret Service had previously stated that Gonzalez was stopped after entering the front door of the North Portico. Gonzalez ran through much of the main floor, past a stairway that leads up to the first family's residence, and was ultimately stopped at the far southern end of the East Room. He also reached the doorway to the Green Room, an area that looks out on the South Lawn. No shots were fired inside the White House, the federal law official said. Official: Secret Service twice interviewed, released would-be White House intruder . The Secret Service has not yet commented on the new details. ""I could not be more proud of the individual agents, but I worry that Director (Julia) Pierson and the leadership there at the Secret Service is failing them,"" Chaffetz said Monday on ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" Pierson will face tough questions at an already-scheduled hearing on Tuesday before the House Oversight Committee. A Republican from Utah who sits on the committee, said he wants to know why an audible alarm in the White House had been muted after ushers said it was making too many noises. White House encourages 'perspective' after Secret Service . And shortly after the incident earlier this month, the Secret Service issued a statement saying officers ""showed tremendous restraint and discipline in dealing with"" Gonzalez. Chaffetz said he has a problem with that, too. ""I don't want tremendous restraint,"" he said. ""I want to see overwhelming force to deter somebody. When you have the situation where you have the apparent lax security, you're unfortunately going to invite more attacks. And that's the concern."" Pierson sent a letter to committee chairman Darrell Issa last Friday raising concerns about an holding open discussion on security issues and urged the chairman to allow some of her testimony to take place in a classified setting. ""Simply put, publicly airing the very security measures employed by the Secret Service and the various challenges we confront at the White House complex will arm those who desire to cause injury - or worse - to the President and First Family with critical information, and doing so would be beyond reckless,"" Pierson wrote. How the Secret Service could beef up White House security . CNN has learned from a Democratic source on the Oversight Committee that Issa has agreed to Pierson's request, and will hold a separate, classified session on Tuesday. The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, praised the decision to protect the agency's mission. ""This is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue, but an American issue, and the last thing we should do is give people like Gonzalez a road map for how to attack the President or other officials,"" Cummings said in a written statement to CNN.","Rep.

"The sound of metal hitting the floor echoed through the hallways of the childless elementary school. It was an empty clip from a gun, fallen to the ground. ""That sound should be imprinted in your brain,"" Zach Hudson, co-founder of Defensive Tactics Solutions, told the educators in the audience. ""That is the sound of survival. That is the sound of opportunity."" That, Hudson said, is the best time to attack a shooter if one enters the school or classroom. On a recent Saturday in Lake Mary, Florida, Hudson and his partner, Mike Friedman, conducted a free active shooter self-defense workshop for teachers and school staff members. Since the deadly school shootings in Newtown, Connecticut, last year, school security plans have included arming teachers, adding police officers and armed security guards, changing how schools are designed and adding bulletproof backpacks and whiteboards to schools. In the new school year, some educators are taking it upon themselves to be prepared for the unthinkable. What really makes schools safer? The self-defense trainers, both parents, believe that workshops like this one should be mandatory for educators. ""You got to make sure you get those fire drills in every year,"" said Hudson, who was a CNN Hero in 2012 for his work with senior citizens. ""Fire drills are important, don't get me wrong, but guess what, kids aren't dying in fires. They're dying because they are being shot. That's the truth, and that's the threat."" They passed out a pocket-sized active shooter reference guide published by the FBI (PDF) that says people have three options when an active shooter enters a location: run, hide or fight. ""Fight as a last resort and only when your life is in imminent danger,"" it says. This course offered guidance on how to escape or take cover but focused most of its four hours on how to fight and disarm an attacker -- something few educators have ever considered how to do. ""It's very sad that we have to go through this kind of training to know how to protect our kids,"" said Marsha Taylor, a teacher of 25 years who works with young children. The protection exercises started with a fake gun pointed at the educators. ""It takes the fear out of it,"" Hudson said. Participants were taught how to grab the barrel and point it away while holding the slide so the handgun cannot fire. Parts of the workshop were similar to a self-defense classes, where participants learned how and where to hit and the best position to stand when approaching an attacker. ""You have eight weapons,"" Friedman told the class. ""Two hands, two elbows, two knees, two feet."" The educators of all ages practiced how to use those body parts on pads held by the instructors; they were encouraged to make every strike fueled with aggression and anger. ""We don't need to be armed with a weapon -- a gun per se,"" said Frank Taylor, a day-care owner who took the class. ""But if we have knowledge of how to use our bodies and our surroundings, than that in itself is the best form of arming ourselves."" The tactics and strategies were tailored toward a school setting, instructors said, and part of the workshop focused on the school and classroom setup. Teachers were told which ordinary items found in a classroom might be used as weapons -- for example, throwing a stapler at the shooter or using it to hit an attacker in the temple. If scissors were available, educators were told to aim for the eyes. ""Who cares how you incapacitate?"" Friedman said. ""Just attack the attacker. That's the mind set."" Teachers lessons' in heroism and healing . In the school's hallway, educators got a detailed lesson in how to run from the sound of bullets. "" 'Cover' means that whatever you are behind will stop a bullet,"" Hudson explained, urging them to run from cover to cover. When told to hide, Hudson reminded the group that if they aren't seen, they're less likely to be shot. The workshop ended with a ""bad guy"" with a gun entering the classroom. The educators were taught how to find the room's ""blind spot"": a  place where they won't be seen when the shooter entered the room. It was also the best position, the trainer said, to use the element of surprise if they needed to disarm the shooter. A shooter, of course, that these educators wanted to prepare for but never hope to encounter. ""In addition to us providing exceptional education for the students, first and foremost, they have to be protected,"" Taylor said. ""If they're not safe, then it doesn't matter what we do from an educational standpoint.""","Some Florida educators recently took self-defense training in case of a school shooting .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Marilyn Monroe's white ""subway"" dress sold for more than $5.6 million in a Beverly Hills, California auction Saturday night in which bidders paid another $2.7 million for three other Monroe movie outfits. It was the first in a series of auctions to sell the massive Hollywood history collection that singer, dancer and actress Debbie Reynolds accumulated over the past 50 years. Collector Keya Morgan said Saturday's bids were ""totally crazy, especially in this recession."" Bidding for the iconic ivory pleated dress Monroe wore in ""The Seven Year Itch"" was ""totally magical,"" Morgan said. Reynolds was in tears when, after 20 minutes of drama, the gavel sounded an end to bidding with the price at $4.6 million. With the auction company getting a $1 million commission, the buyer will pay $5.6 million. It had been expected to sell for $2 million, the auction house, Profiles in History, said. The buyer, who was relaying his bids over a telephone, was not immediately identified. The red-sequined showgirl gown and a feathered hat Monroe wore in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" sold for $1.47 million. The expected price was $300,000. Monroe's costumes from ""There's No Business Like Show Business"" and ""River of No Return"" brought another $1.2 million Saturday. The previous record price for a Monroe dress was $1.26 million paid in 1999 for the sheer white dress the actress wore in May 1962 when she sang ""Happy Birthday"" to President John F. Kennedy. Morgan, who is writing a book about Monroe's death, said the actress would have been shocked to know her dresses would sell for so much. She only had $2,000 in her bank account at the time of her death, he said. Reynolds accumulated 3,500 movie costumes and thousands of props over the past 50 years with the hope of housing them in a museum. Taking care of the treasures became a financial burden on the 79-year-old entertainer, leading to her decision to sell, she said. Other high-priced items included a blue cotton dress and a pair of ruby slippers made for Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz."" Although both items were only test costumes never worn in camera, they brought a combined price of nearly $1.75 million. A matador outfit worn by Rudolph Valentino for the 1922 film ""Blood and Sand"" sold for $258,000. The auction house predicted before the sale it would go for about $80,000. One of Charlie Chaplin's signature bowler hats, worn in several films, sold for $135,300. The World War I military uniform worn by Gary Cooper in the 1941 movie ""Sergeant York"" was purchased for $67,650. A bidder paid $73,800 for the velvet brown racing silks and riding pants worn by a young Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet.""","Four Marilyn Monroe movie outfits sell at a Beverly Hills auction Saturday .

"A recent Treasury Department report of misconduct by a banking regulator is giving watchdogs some ammunition to argue that financial regulators are too cozy with the banks they are tasked with overseeing. The report, part of a small batch just released by the department's inspector-general, says that a government employee in Florida who served as a bank examiner accepted ""gratuities (golf fees and/or food) on at least four occasions"" from a bank he was reviewing. The report, conducted in 2010, called the situation a ""conflict of interest"" for the employee, who worked at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ""You have a government employee, during a time when he has a special responsibility to oversee this bank, actually taking time from work and going to play golf with these folks,"" said Michael Smallberg, a researcher with the Project on Government Oversight. ""It was a pretty striking example of a government employee actually cozying up to the folks he's supposed to be regulating."" But Inspector-General Eric Thorson, who polices the Treasury Department and released the files, defended the agency. ""These investigative reports are good examples of the fact that the department has been successful in demonstrating that there is little toleration for individual misconduct."" ""My opinion is that Treasury has an institutional highly ethical culture,"" he added. But Smallberg is still critical. ""When folks wonder why regulators didn't do a better job of stopping the financial crisis, or they're wondering why OCC didn't spot the huge trading loss at JP Morgan earlier this year, I think part of the issue is just that the examiners were just too close to the folks they were supposed to be examining,"" he said. Smallberg wrote about the case last week, after the Treasury inspector-general's report was posted online by the disclosure organization GovernmentAttic.org. The website obtained it through a Freedom of Information Act request. Five other reports from the last few years, in which allegations of misconduct were substantiated, were also made public. In one case, an employee was found to have used his work computer to solicit prostitutes via the online classified site Craigslist and arrange trysts on three occasions. In another, an employee was found to have emailed internal information about Treasury contracting to her husband, who worked for a contractor. The rest involved disorderly conduct at a stadium; running up a $240 FedEx bill on the government's dime; and banking with a bank that was also regulated by the agency. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency responded that it attaches great importance to ethical conduct, and any alleged misconduct is investigated. ""These are isolated incidences, and do not diminish the highly ethical behavior of thousands of other OCC employees,"" the agency said in a written statement. And Christian A. Weideman, the Treasury Department's deputy general counsel, said there is ""absolutely no evidence of any pattern or trend."" ""Unfortunately, in all institutions of every size, there are some employees who act inappropriately,"" Weideman said. ""Although any misconduct is unacceptable, this is a small number that does not fairly reflect a Department with tens of thousands of employees."" While employees are disciplined for any misconduct, the overwhelming majority of them ""serve the American people with professionalism, diligence, and integrity,"" he added. The disciplinary outcomes for the six employees were not listed -- except for the prostitution case, where the employee retired. Treasury officials referred five of the six cases to criminal prosecutors, although charges were not ultimately filed. ""They did refer them out for prosecution, and I can't see taking more aggressive action than that,"" said Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""No question that it's all embarrassing, and that it's all unacceptable; but I think Treasury can also be credited for taking it on, doing something about it, not trying to sweep any of this under the rug.""","A Treasury report documents several incidents of misconduct by employees .

"The mystery congressman responsible for the inclusion of language in the $1.1 trillion dollar spending bill that caused a progressive outcry is coming forward to defend the provision. The measure weakens banking regulations designed to prevent another financial crisis. Critics of the language, such as Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, claim the provision could invite another fiscal meltdown and was essentially written by the U.S. banking giant, Citigroup. In a statement to CNN, Rep. Kevin Yoder, R-Kansas, insisted the provision included in the spending bill would not lead to a collapse on Wall Street, followed by a bailout from taxpayers. ""The amendment does not address the riskier derivatives associated with the mortgage crisis,"" Yoder said in the statement. ""Other backstops exist in Dodd-Frank to prevent a bailout based on those instruments."" As the spending bill, dubbed the CRomnibus by Capitol Hill insiders, was debated in Congress last week, Warren blasted the banking provision as a ""loophole"" that would allow Wall Street to gamble with taxpayer money. ""This giveaway that was drafted by Citigroup lobbyists has no place in a critical government funding bill,"" Warren said in a speech on the Senate floor that once again stirred speculation the Massachusetts Democrat may run for the presidency. A spokesman for Yoder acknowledged the wording of the amendment essentially came from a stand-alone bill that passed the House last year. ""We got the language from HR 992,"" a Yoder aide told CNN. That legislation, HR 992, was partially written by lobbyists for Citigroup, according to emails obtained by The New York Times. The bill, which was never voted on in the Senate, sought to loosen Dodd-Frank Act regulations aimed at limiting banking and investment industry practices that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Asked about the provision, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama plans to sign the spending legislation to prevent a government shutdown.  But Earnest said the President remains opposed to Yoder's language. ""The White House, regardless of who wrote the provision, strongly opposes it and doesn't think it's a good idea, because it does water down one element of Wall Street reform,"" Earnest told reporters Tuesday. Earnest said the White House was ""in the loop"" in the drafting of the spending bill but could not account for every provision in the legislation. ""This is a bill that was written by Congress, and whether one element of that bill was plagiarized by a member of Congress from a Citibank lobbyist is something that you'd have to ask a member of Congress,"" Earnest said. In his statement, Yoder touted his provision as needed protection for smaller financial institutions, rather than a boon to Wall Street. ""Without this fix, smaller regional banks would be in danger of not being able to meet the lending needs of their customers. Ultimately, farmers, manufacturers and other Main Street businesses would be harmed the most,"" Yoder added. Yoder is perhaps best-known for skinny dipping in the Sea of Galilee during a trip with other congressional leaders to Israel in 2011.  The Kansas Republican later apologized for the incident.","GOP Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas says he's responsible for a controversial banking language included in the spending measure .

"If you think the more than weeklong controversy over a new book about the first couple had died down, well, you'd be wrong. ""Daily Show"" host Jon Stewart joined the fray on his program Monday night. ""She seems nice,"" was Stewart's assessment of the first lady after reading ""The Obamas,"" he told the book's author, New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor.  ""I'm surprised at the controversy,"" Stewart said, ""because the book seems to portray Michelle Obama as a complex yet human individual struggling with this unbelievable situation yet remaining the moral compass and center of an administration trying to find its footing."" Later in the sit-down, Stewart tells Kantor ""But I only read it because I thought there was crazy sh-t in there. You really disappointed me."" In a telephone interview with CNN on Monday, Kantor tried to explain the controversy: ""The headlines in those [initial reports] did not reflect the book that I wrote,"" the Times' Washington correspondent said. And Kantor responded to criticism from one of her principal subjects. ""The book does not call [the first lady] an angry black woman. Those words are never in the book,"" Kantor said of the soundbite that set off a second round of media coverage, ""Nor is it insinuated."" ""The Obamas"" has come under criticism because the president and first lady were not interviewed for the book, and because passages in the book portray Michelle Obama as concerned about the support and advice the president was getting from some of his top aides. The controversy began before Kantor's book was even formally released.  When some media outlets got their hands on copies of the book early, the resulting coverage focused on what political observers call ""palace intrigue"" -- a moment when Press Secretary Robert Gibbs blew up and cursed the first lady and top Obama aide Valerie Jarrett, a moment when then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel offered to resign (an offer that the president refused at the time), and the first lady's concerns about some of the president's top aides. The White House hit back hard. The book is ""the author's take, reflecting her own opinions, on a remarkably strong relationship between the President and First Lady -- both of whom share an unwavering commitment to each other, and to improving the lives of Americans,"" White House Associate Communications Director Eric Schultz wrote in a January 9 post on the White House blog that bore the headline ""Gossip in Wonderland."" Schultz continued: ""The book is about a relationship between two people whom the author has not spoken to in years. In fact, the author did not interview the Obamas for the book so the emotions and private moments described in the book, though often seemingly ascribed to the President and First Lady, reflect little more than the author's own thoughts.  These second-hand accounts are staples of every Administration in modern political history and are often exaggerated."" And as for parts of the book that portrayed moments of palace intrigue, the White House was equally harsh. ""And as those who have worked in this Administration will tell you, the scenes depicted in the book do not accurately portray how well the East and West Wings work together,"" Schultz also wrote on the White House blog. In a rare move, the first lady also personally responded to the book. While admitting she had not read it, Michelle Obama told CBS News that she wasn't surprised by moments in the book that portrayed her husband as telling his staff about her concerns. But the first lady rejected any suggestion that she was directly involved in the business of the West Wing, that she was unhappy in her role as first spouse, or that there was any tension between her and any of the president's top aides. ""I guess it's more interesting to imagine this conflicted situation here [in the White House], a strong woman, and, you know -- but that's been an image that people have tried to paint of me since the day Barack announced [his presidential bid]. That I'm some angry black woman."" The first lady also took issue with a distinctive storytelling choice made by Kantor in ""The Obamas"" -- the decision to give her reporting a kind of interior narrative quality that sometimes feels like you are reading a personal diary. ""Who can write about how I feel?"" the first lady asked rhetorically during the CBS news interview. ""Who? What third person can tell me how I feel?"" Kantor told CNN she requested an interview with the president and first lady but didn't let not getting one stop her from writing the book. ""A really strong principle of mine is that, as a New York Times reporter, I don't practice access journalism,"" Kantor said ""At the Times we don't enter into reporting projects saying [for example], I'm only going to write about Mitt Romney's years at Bain Capital if he gives us an interview about it."" Kantor added that she has ""years of covering [the first couple] under my belt"" and that she did previously interview the president and first lady for a November 2009 portrait of their marriage that appeared in the New York Times Magazine. Kantor, who said she interviewed more than 200 people for the book, including current and former aides in the Obama White House, top Obama advisers, and close friends of the first couple, also said that her reporting process confirmed for her that she was learning information about the Obamas that had not been reported before. ""I worked to get an interview with [the president and first lady] up until the day the book went to the printer.  And I felt that was what -- you know, that's my job. But I also felt that the stories that were coming from staff and aides were fresh, revealing stories that told as much or more as an interview might have."" And as for the book's tone, the New York Times -- Kantor's own newspaper -- took issue with her storytelling style.  ""Cue the groans,"" reads the Times' review of ""The Obamas"" after conveying a particularly diary-like moment in the book, ""What kind of journalist presumes to know Michelle Obama's mind?"" the review asks before quickly pivoting to declare that ""In lesser hands 'The Obamas' would be an act of astonishing overreach but Ms. Kantor [through years of covering the Obamas] has earned the voice of authority."" Kantor told CNN the book's style resulted from how she approached interviewing people close to the Obamas. ""What I did do is really push in interviews to get friends and aides to describe how the Obamas were reacting to things."" And as for reporting about the book that played up the first lady's concerns about the advice the president was getting from some of his top aides, including Emanuel, Kantor told CNN her interviews revealed Michelle Obama and Emanuel ""were philosophical foils."" ""They had a distant relationship,"" Kantor continued, ""and the relationship did have tension. .. The tensions are so indirect. There are all these messages passed back and forth between aides. And they also represent such different visions of where the presidency can go."" In the end, the controversy surrounding ""The Obamas"" may be the result of Kantor's frame of reference. Rather than taking the point of view of the president, Kantor chose to focus on the first lady and her partnership with him. ""I felt this was giving us a window into what this life [in the White House] was really like,"" Kantor said Monday, singling out a vignette in her book about how the first lady reacted to news of a minor security incident. The window of a first lady's view on the White House and the presidency is a telling metaphor -- one that Kantor sought to convey early on in ""The Obamas."" Soon after Barack Obama was elected in 2008, the Obamas visited the Bushes at the White House.  While their husbands talked about economic stimulus, Laura Bush showed her successor around the private residence situated between the West and East Wings. According to the book, Laura Bush showed Michelle Obama a window in a sitting room used by past first ladies that looked out over the Rose Garden and toward the Oval Office. ""During her husband's critical meetings and long days at work, Laura Bush would stare out the window of her hideaway and feel somehow more connected to him,"" Kantor wrote. Laura Bush told Michelle Obama that Hillary Clinton had shown the window to her and that Barbara Bush had shown it to Clinton beforehand, and Michelle Obama should, in turn, show it to her successor as well. Then Kantor writes in ""The Obamas,"" ""It was hard to think of a better symbol of the true duties of first ladyhood than that window: Keep a close eye on your husband. Do it quietly. There will be things about the presidency that only you will be able to see. on't expect to be at the heart of the action.""","Jon Stewart after reading controversial book: First lady ""seems nice""

"I have an uncle who has always been a robust and healthy guy. He drank a glass of skim milk every day, bragged about how many pull-ups he was doing and fit into pants he was wearing 20 years before. He didn't take a single medication and retired early. Given that he had no medical problems and ran his own business, he opted to go several years without health insurance. Eventually, when he turned 65, he picked up Medicare. What happened next was a little strange. He fell off the wagon. He exercised only sporadically, and paid hardly any attention to what he was eating. One day, I saw him eat an entire bag of potato chips. He bemoaned the fact that he was forced to buy new, bigger pants, and he stopped drinking his milk. For him, becoming newly insured had nearly the opposite effect on him of what we doctors hope to achieve. He'd become unhealthier. In many ways, my uncle was demonstrating a concept known as the moral hazard. Two economists wrote about this exact scenario  in 2006 . They found that many men, at the time they obtained Medicare, started behaving badly. Moral, or morale, hazard is a term largely used by economists to describe the actions of people more willing to take risks because they are insulated from the cost of their actions, in this case because of their recently obtained health insurance. In the case of these men, when they got Medicare, they took worse care of themselves; they actually exercised less. Among those who didn't visit the doctor after getting insurance, the effect was dramatic: Their overall physical activity dropped by 40%; they were 16% more likely to smoke cigarettes and 32% more likely to drink alcohol. Even if that seems extreme, it's still worth asking: Does health insurance make us healthier? The past five years have seen a tumultuous battle over Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act, culminating in the bitter recriminations this fall over lost policies and the disastrous launch of the HealthCare.gov website. When I interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at the end of October, she downplayed the concerns and seemed certain the site would be up and running by the end of November. The website may be working better now, but to me that's not the most important issue. In my mind, the real suspense comes from whether Obamacare will really make us a healthier America, even if it succeeds in its ambitions to dramatically expand coverage. A healthier America: That is the goal we should share as Americans, but access alone won't get us anywhere close. This past spring, the New England Journal of Medicine followed up on an important experiment in Oregon. The state created a remarkable strategy to do a minimal expansion of Medicaid. It decided to conduct random lottery drawings to allocate the limited spots. While it was controversial in its implementation, the situation was a goldmine for researchers. It offered something very rare in these types of studies: a unique opportunity for researchers to compare the newly insured to their highly similar counterparts, who remained uninsured. The results were surprising, and mostly disappointing. The newly insured Medicaid population did go to the doctor more often, used more preventive health services and received more medications. Problem was, in nearly every area, they weren't any healthier. The scientists sat down with more than 12,000 people and compared some of the most important health indicators. They found having insurance did not improve measures of blood pressure, cholesterol or how well diabetics controlled their blood sugar. Furthermore, the 10-year risk of having a heart attack didn't change in those who had Medicaid. It wasn't at all what the proponents of universal access to health insurance hoped they would see. The results remind me of a column I wrote a few years ago, shortly after my own marriage. It seemed like a good time to explore the question of whether marriage was in fact good for one's health. I spent a fair amount of time researching the topic and one of the experts I interviewed gave me an answer I have never forgotten: Marriage is good for your health (long pause) ... as long as it's a good marriage. It was a terrific answer, and a metaphor for so many aspects of our lives. As you might imagine, I had quite a bit of fun with that article on marriage, but it taught an important lesson. There is almost always a second beat to any story. Being married all by itself isn't necessarily good or bad for your health. It was the effort required to make it a good or bad marriage that made up the entire difference. The same can be said about health insurance. In this case, I don't mean that ""good"" or ""bad"" insurance is the critical factor, but that health insurance alone doesn't lead to better health. None of this works unless we all take personal responsibility, and hold ourselves accountable. To be clear, there will always be some baseline benefit to being insured versus not being insured, even if you account for the moral hazard. A major Institute of Medicine report in 2009 found that uninsured adults are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of cancer, more likely to die from a heart attack and less likely to recover from a serious injury. Even in Oregon, the newly insured enjoyed some benefits. For example, they were nearly a third less likely to suffer from depression, perhaps because they had more peace of mind from being insured. And there were significant benefits in nonmedical areas: Whereas more than 5% of the uninsured faced ""catastrophic"" medical expenses in a year -- defined as greater than 30% of their income -- those catastrophic expenses were virtually eliminated in the group on Medicaid. But strictly in terms of health, insurance, like marriage, doesn't guarantee good health. After all, I am sure you can think of people right now who have terrific health insurance and terrible health. It seems the benefits pale in comparison to what we can gain with a few simple personal decisions about our health. A good example comes from a study in the journal Circulation. Researchers estimated that if all Americans exercised 30 minutes a day, we would reduce the number of cardiovascular events -- heart attacks and strokes -- by a third. A third!  Just 30 minutes a day, and suddenly we are starting to get serious about a more healthy America. You can break up the exercise into 10-minute chunks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and you don't even have to knock yourself out. Just go hard enough that your breathing is slightly labored, enough that it would keep you from singing if you suddenly got the urge. Problem is that as things stand now, only half of us, at most, exercise that much. While we are fond of comparing ourselves to France, a place that was ranked as having the best overall health care system in 2000, according to the World Health Organization, there's a huge difference between the United States and France that has little to do with the health care safety net. We Americans are three times as likely to be obese as the average French person -- and obesity is related to just about every chronic disease imaginable. I think about this all the time, and here is what I tell my own patients. It is time to stop merely playing defense when it comes to your health, and time to start optimizing yourself. Yes, of course we are desperate to stamp out disease when it occurs, but we are more desperate for those diseases to never occur in the first place. I say that as a neurosurgeon, someone who is often called in to extinguish the brightest of fires. I also say this, however, as a 44-year-old dad who wants to be around for a long time. I have been fortunate to have always had health insurance, but a few years ago, I decided to strive for something more. I wanted to optimize myself. I wanted to be the best that I could possibly be, instead of waiting around for the seemingly inevitable diagnosis of heart disease or diabetes. I found that it wasn't that hard. I became diligent about breaking a sweat every day. I made it as important as a meeting with my boss or a dinner date with my wife. Also, as a student of neuroscience, I know the brain isn't particularly good at distinguishing thirst and hunger; so most people eat when they should drink. As a result we walk around overstuffed and dehydrated. Drinking fluids all day long has cut my calorie consumption by a third. Studies of the mind-body connection also remind us that it takes about 15-20 minutes for the brain to know the stomach is full. Stop eating when you are 80% full, and you will likely take in the right number of calories. The Japanese call it hara hachi bu. To help, we use smaller plates in our home to trick the brain into believing we are eating more. We eat meat occasionally, but no longer serve it in our home. I eat seven different colored foods a day, and try to buy locally grown vegetables whenever I can. These are simple strategies that have made me biologically younger than I was nearly five years ago. At 44, I have the biological age of someone in his mid-30s. It is true that the American Medical Association supports the aspects of Obamacare that expand insurance coverage, as do many others in the medical community, even if they aren't convinced that it will reliably lead to better health. It appeals to a sense of justice, and a desire to prevent the awful situation of people being turned away when they need help the most. But, as we follow the story of Obamacare over the coming years, it's important to understand and agree on the true measure of success. As a doctor, I think a healthier America is the rallying cry we can all get behind. We have had a rocky, yet still vitally important start, but the point is that access to health care insurance is not nearly enough. If we are serious about a more healthy America, the real change starts in each and every one of us, and it's not that hard to do.","Sanjay Gupta: Moral hazard causes some to neglect health when they get health insurance .

As Israeli newspaper Haaretz noted, political parties that represent the ultra-Orthodox sector ban women from running for office. But some feel changing the photo of the Paris march went way too far. It was downright ""embarrassing,"" wrote Haaretz's Allison Kaplan Sommer. The message HaMevaser sent, Kaplan Sommer said, was tantamount to ""denying the fact that in the wider world, beyond the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, women do stand on the world stage and shape events."" In addition to Merkel missing from HaMevaser, other women leaders who disappeared from the photo are European Union security and foreign affairs chief Frederica Mogherini and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Some took to Twitter to criticize the decision and to share the original and altered pictures. A satirical Irish publication, Waterford Whispers, had a little fun with the story and published the photo from the Paris march showing only the three women and cutting out all the men. It's not the first time an ultra-Orthodox publication attempted to erase a female politician. In 2011, New York-based newspaper Di Tzeitung altered a picture to remove then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton out of a famous shot of White House leaders watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.","HaMevaser cut women, including Germany's Angela Merkel, from front-page pic .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- About 20 years ago, 9-year-old Cameron Kocher fired a rifle out of a window of his home in upstate Pennsylvania and hit his 7-year-old neighbor, who was riding on a snowmobile, and killed her. The prosecutor decided to try the 9-year-old as an adult. When the charge is murder, Pennsylvania is one of a handful of states that has no lower age limit for trying children as adults. The district attorney argued that Cameron had lied when asked about the shooting -- and lying is something that adults do. The trial judge subsequently agreed to keep Cameron's case in adult court. The boy had seemed normal, the judge said, so there was nothing for the juvenile justice system to treat. Cameron had also dozed during pretrial motions, which showed ""a lack of remorse."" Cameron stayed home on bail -- which is available to ""adults"" -- while his case was argued in appellate courts. He eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and was placed on probation. He received no treatment and had no further involvement with the justice system. Jump ahead 20 years, to the Western Pennsylvania prosecution of Jordan Brown, who was 11 when he was charged as an adult with shooting to death his father's pregnant fiancÃ©e. Jordan's attorneys have asked the trial judge to remand his case to juvenile court. The judge has taken the motion under advisement. It should be an easy decision. There are common-sense reasons to keep Jordan in the juvenile system. Ask any parents of an 11-year-old if they think their child is really just a small adult! If Jordan is adjudicated delinquent, the juvenile justice system can keep him until his 21st birthday. That is an extraordinary amount of time for an 11-year-old. It is certainly long enough to serve the needs of public protection, and enough time to rehabilitate a child. Indeed, studies routinely show that in these cases, the juvenile justice system protects the public better than the criminal justice system. If common sense isn't enough, examine the recent science on adolescent development. In the early part of the decade, researchers for the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice found that teenagers are less blameworthy than adults, and that their capacities change significantly over the course of adolescence. The researchers found what many of us were trying to say years earlier about Cameron Kocher: that at the age of 9, he simply couldn't process information and plan a crime like an adult. The MacArthur Foundation Research Network recognized that legal sanctions for misbehavior should not be based only on the harm a youth causes, but on the youth's culpability. Most people would agree. Every day, different defendants receive different sentences even if they caused the same harm. This is because defendants differ in culpability, or blameworthiness. At no other time are these differences more pronounced than during adolescence, when youths struggle with their immaturity, undeveloped decision-making abilities, impulsiveness, lack of future orientation and susceptibility to negative peer pressure. Recent brain imaging technology reinforces the adolescent development literature. From the prefrontal cortex to the limbic area, the teenage brain is undergoing dramatic changes during adolescence in ways that affect teens' ability to reason, to weigh consequences for their decisions and to delay gratification long enough to make careful short- and long-term choices. In their 2008 book ""Rethinking Juvenile Justice,"" MacArthur researchers Dr. Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott concluded that young people under age 15 should never be tried as adults. Steinberg and Scott make clear that mitigation because of youth -- the fact that teens are less blameworthy than adults -- is not the same as an excuse. That is, trying youths in juvenile court is not the same as absolving them of responsibility. Ten years under juvenile court supervision, for an 11-year-old, is a very long time. The point is that while youths should be punished for their crimes, it should be done in a developmentally appropriate way. Any parent would know that it makes little sense to punish a 10-year-old the same as a 17-year-old. Another finding of the MacArthur Research Network was that young adolescents are not competent enough to be defendants. Young teens lack the skills to consult with their lawyers and shape trial strategy. Think of Cameron Kocher, who couldn't even stay awake for his pretrial motions. Imagine Jordan Brown, now all of 12 years old, advising his lawyer on approaches to cross-examining witnesses, or discussing the pros and cons of pleading guilty. It is in society's enlightened self-interest to keep young teens in the juvenile justice system, where public safety concerns can be addressed and young offenders can be held accountable and be rehabilitated. This is common sense. An 11-year-old is not an adult and should never be treated like one. The opinions in the commentary are solely those of Robert Schwartz. The Juvenile Law Center, which he heads, filed a friend of the court brief in Cameron Kocher's case in 1989 and is not involved in the Jordan Brown case.","Robert Schwartz tells of 9-year-old tried as adult; he was put on probation, received no treatment .

"(CNN) -- The International Committee of the Red Cross called on Israel to allow it immediate access to Gaza, saying a trip into Gaza City revealed weak children laying with their dead mothers and other ""shocking"" scenes. Israeli artillery fires a shell toward Gaza from the Israel-Gaza border on Wednesday. Red Cross workers and four ambulances from the Palestine Red Crescent Society managed to enter the Zaytun neighborhood of Gaza City on Wednesday, according to a written release. The crew found four children, too weak to stand, next to their dead mothers in a house containing 12 corpses, the statement says. Other houses revealed more wounded and three more corpses, the release said. It said Israeli soldiers posted near the houses ordered the rescue team to leave the area -- an order the team refused. ""This is a shocking incident,"" said Pierre Wettach, the ICRC's chief official for Israel and the Palestinian territories. ""The Israeli military must have been aware of the situation but did not assist the wounded. Neither did they make it possible for us or the Palestine Red Crescent to assist the wounded."" A spokesman for Israel's military said early Thursday that the Red Cross's news release was the first he had heard of the alleged incident. Speaking after midnight, the spokesman said he was unsure if Israel has received a formal request to investigate. ""We do make every effort and our soldiers do put themselves at risk"" to help wounded civilians, the spokesman told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The Red Cross release said the children and other wounded were taken to ambulances in a donkey cart because earth walls erected by Israeli soldiers made it impossible for the ambulances to reach their neighborhood.  Watch psychologist describe how war affects children Â» . It said the group was told more wounded people were in the neighborhood, and demanded that Israel grant it and the Red Crescent immediate access and safe passage to search for them. The Israeli spokesman said the military has established a 24-hour liaison to maintain contacts with humanitarian organizations.  The Israeli military operation in Gaza has killed at least 680 people and injured more than 3,000 since it launched December 27, Palestinian medical sources said Wednesday. Thirty percent of the deaths are women and children, according to the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, citing statistics released Tuesday by the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Seven Israeli soldiers and three civilians have been killed since the operation, the Israeli military reported. Israel says the purpose of the operation is to stop Hamas militants from firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.","Red Cross: Workers found weak kids with dead mothers during trip into Gaza City .

"Walnut Creek, California (CNN)  -- On a beautiful morning in my hometown of Walnut Creek, California, I sat watching my daughter playing in the park. There she was, along with many other kids, swinging, sliding, and running with the kind of pure joy you see only in children. Behind us lay a green soccer field, filled with two teams of kids competing for nothing but bragging rights and team spirit. Their parents along the sidelines were enjoying the action. My daughter is just 2 years old, but I looked forward to the day I would be one of those parents, cheering her on to victory. If it were 60 years ago, many children on this playground and soccer field might have been crippled or died from childhood diseases for which we now have vaccines. Children growing up in that era were at risk for infections like polio, measles, whooping cough, meningitis, and many other diseases that infect, maim and kill without prejudice or warning. All of this changed when some dedicated, hardworking doctors and scientists discovered a way to protect children from these scourges: vaccines. Like a suit of armor, vaccines shielded children against these infections. Even better, as more children got vaccinated, that protection extended to kids who couldn't be vaccinated, like those who were too young to get shots. In the time before vaccines, there were years where measles infected, maimed or killed half a million people; polio paralyzed nearly 16,000; whooping cough infected nearly 150,000 people. The victims of these illnesses were mostly children like mine, yours, and those at the park. But as children everywhere got vaccinated, communities banished these diseases into medical history. By 2001, there was a 99.99 percent reduction in measles compared with the pre-vaccine era; the reductions in whooping cough and meningitis were 96 percent and 99 percent, respectively. No child gets polio anymore. It's easy to give the credit for that success to doctors and vaccine makers, but it's really parents and communities who deserve praise. They did the hard work of making sure their children and their neighbors' children got vaccinated. For all that success, however, the reputation of vaccines got a black eye about a decade ago, when a doctor in England called a news conference and dramatically announced that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine caused autism. The shock of that discovery sent ripples of fear through parents and communities in Britain. Like a contagion, that fear soon spread to America. Many parents began refusing to get their kids shots because of a growing anti-vaccination movement. That movement, though small, is well-funded, vocal -- even violent at times -- and supported by some prominent people: politicians, doctors, celebrities and media leaders. These folks took a claim against one vaccine and, by twisting rumors and innuendo into ""evidence,"" advanced a conspiracy theory that all childhood vaccines caused autism. What nobody knew was that the British doctor who claimed vaccines caused autism, Andrew Wakefield, had his own secrets. Among them, that he had performed some very risky, invasive experiments on children without approval from the hospital he worked at; that he had accepted nearly a million dollars from legal firms suing vaccine manufacturers; and that he had applied for a patent for a replacement vaccine to the one he claimed caused autism, which would have made him a very rich man. More important was the fact that anybody who tried to reproduce Wakefield's research couldn't get the same results. Further, study after study on the MMR and other vaccines showed no link between any of them and autism. But by the time the truth about Wakefield came out in 2004, it was too late. The notion that vaccines cause autism became conventional wisdom in many places. As a result, in pockets of our country, vaccination rates have dropped precipitously. And, to nobody's surprise, that choice has resurrected long-gone diseases. In 2008, a San Diego, California, child, whose parents had refused to vaccinate him, returned from vacation with measles, exposing children too young to be vaccinated to the disease. Any child who had been exposed had to be quarantined for several weeks at home. No school. No park. No sports. In early 2009, a child in rural Minnesota died from meningitis caused by the bacteria Haemophilus influenzae. His parents had refused to vaccinate him against the disease. Four other children were hospitalized with the exact same disease. Two of those were also children of parents who had refused vaccines. The fourth was a 5-month-old baby who was just too young to have been completely immunized. The fifth was a child who has an immune deficiency. This year, in my home state of California, more than 900 cases of whooping cough have been recorded so far, up from around 200 last year. Five children have died. Three months ago, the Lancet, the journal which first published Andrew Wakefield's work, formally retracted his original research paper, expunging its existence from the canon of medical research. Shortly afterward, he was banned from practicing medicine in the United Kingdom. Doctors and scientists may be satisfied with that outcome, but what happens next isn't up to us. Rather, and just like 60 years ago, it's up to you. You're going to have to decide whether to vaccinate your children. And if you decide, as I hope you do, to protect your children against these deadly diseases, then you'll be choosing health. You'll be choosing health for your child and family. You'll be choosing health for your community, because every child who's vaccinated helps to create an ecosystem of protection for those too young to get shots. You'll be choosing to keep your kids out of my doctor's office and keep them on that playground, in school, on that soccer field, which is right where they belong. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rahul Parikh.","Rahul Parikh: Before vaccines, polio, measles, whooping cough, meningitis afflicted children .

"Amazon wants you to buy its first smartphone, the Fire, which it unveiled Wednesday. But it also wants you to use that phone to buy more stuff ... from Amazon. And one of the device's most distinctive features is designed to make it as easy as possible do just that. It's called Firefly, and it contains image-, text- and audio-recognition technology to help you scan and identify books, songs, movies and other items. Amazon wants you to use Firefly so much that the feature has its own dedicated button on the side of the phone for one-stop shopping. ""The Firefly button lets you identify printed Web and email addresses, phone numbers, QR and bar codes, artwork, and over 100 million items, including songs, movies, TV shows, and products -- and take action in seconds,"" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in announcing the phone, which will run Amazon's Fire operating system. For example, you could use the phone's cameras and sensors to identify an exotic fruit or vegetable, figure out who sings a song on the radio or help send an e-mail to a new contact after scanning their business card. But forget all that. Well, except for maybe the song. Once you've identified the tune, Amazon wants you to download it. From Amazon. Bezos demonstrated the feature onstage Wednesday by using the phone to instantly identify items arrayed on a table, including a book, a CD and a jar of Nutella. As with products like its Kindle e-readers, Kindle Fire tablets and Amazon Fire TV, the Fire Phone is designed to pull you into Amazon's growing universe of products and services and then keep you there. So with Firefly, the Amazon Music Store will pop up as the default source to buy that song. And that's also where those QR and bar codes come in. Firefly will make it even easier to pursue a habit that has proliferated in the smartphone age and driven brick-and-mortar stores crazy. A user will presumably be able to walk into a store, pick out a product they like, zap it with Firefly and, within a second or two, find out whether it's available on Amazon for less money. (And then maybe even order it right there from their phone.) According to Amazon, the Firefly feature will recognize 70 million products, 35 million songs, 245,000 movies and TV episodes, and 160 live TV channels. That's a lot of chances to spend money. The Fire also boasts a 3-D screen. It ships July 25, although you can pre-order it now. The phone is available only on AT&T's network. If there's one difference between the Firefly-loaded Fire Phone and other Amazon hardware, it's the price. At $199 for a 32GB model and $299 for the 64GB -- with an AT&T contract -- its cost is comparable with that of other high-end smartphones. By comparison, the Kindle Fire tablet debuted in 2011 at $199, a full $300 less than the cheapest iPad 2 at the time. The first Kindle e-reader debuted about $400 but quickly dropped in price. There are Kindles that can now be purchased for about $70. Under Bezos, the company's strategy has been to sell hardware for less than its competitors, sometimes even at a loss, to get customers using other Amazon products. As such, customers who buy the Fire soon will get a free year's subscription (normally $99) to Amazon Prime, which offers two-day shipping, free streaming on Prime Instant Video and access to the Kindle book-lending library. Whether the Fire Phone will be an instant hit remains to be seen. Shoppers may be hesitant to buy a phone online if they can't test it out in stores. But if Amazon can carve out a decent piece of the smartphone market, which moved more than 1 billion phones last year, Firefly may help make sure those Amazon purchases just keep on coming.","Firefly is Amazon's recognition tool for the new Fire Phone .

"Paris, France (CNN)Joy Monroe, a tourist from Montana, has come to Paris's Pont des Arts bridge on a mission of love. To celebrate her marriage of 28 years, she attaches a padlock to the bridge's rail then throws the key into the river below. ""Our love is locked forever,"" she says. It's an act that's been repeated thousands of times, barnacling the Pont des Arts with a dense mass of ""love locks."" But its popularity is now straining both the bridge and Paris's relationship with its romantic visitors, prompting a campaign that seeks to outlaw the trend. American Lisa Anselmo and French-American Lisa Taylor Huff say they co-founded No Love Locks because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety. 'Vandalism' ""I understand that this is a modern expression of love and it's cool, but history should not be compromised,"" says Anselmo. ""It's almost painful to watch this vandalism."" She and Taylor Huff say the Pont des Arts, built in the 1800s under Napoleon and damaged in a 1979 barge collision, might not survive much longer unless authorities act. The bridge currently carries about 700,000 locks with an estimated combined weight of 93 metric tons -- roughly the same as 20 elephants standing on a bridge designed for pedestrian traffic. Sections of fencing have already fallen out under the weight only to be replaced by unsightly wooden panels. No Love Locks has created a petition that's collected more than 2,200 signatures. ""We just want to give back to the city we love and protect its heritage and beauty,"" says Anselmo. ""One lock is a poem; hundreds of thousands are a conundrum."" Pollution concerns . According to the official Paris website, the padlock trend started in 2008 and was initially seen as charming. But the practice quickly got out of hand, with padlocks spreading to other bridges and reappearing as quickly as authorities removed them. There are concerns that the keys thrown in the Seine will add to the river's existing pollution. Graffiti, pickpockets and vendors selling cheap padlocks have also become a problem, prompting many locals to avoid the once picturesque promenade. ""Parisians feel helpless because we don't want to appear unwelcoming to tourists,"" Anselmo says. ""But people need to understand that what you're doing is impacting the residents of the city you love."" She points out that a lock is an inappropriate symbol for love in France, a country where the main annual holiday celebrates an historic assault on a prison -- the storming of the Bastille. Olivier Passelecq, the deputy mayor of the Parisian neighborhood that includes the Pont des Arts, agrees that the locks have become invasive. ""The public has to know that a public monument is not there just for lovers,"" he says. ""[The bridge] has an historical perspective as one of the most beautiful spots in Paris between the French Institute and the Louvre."" Both Passelecq and No Love Locks want to find another place for the locks, mirroring similar schemes in Moscow and Rome. ""Travelers want to leave their mark on Paris -- it's touching and we understand that,"" Anselmo says. ""But show love to the history, to the beauty first, and maybe not putting a lock is the most loving thing you can do.""","The No Love Locks campaign seeks to outlaw the practice of affixing padlocks to Paris's historic bridges .

"MUMBAI, India (CNN) -- The phrase ""war on terror"" is misleading and may have done more harm than good as countries around the world fight extremism, British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Thursday. Use of ""war on terror"" also implied a fight against a shared single enemy, David Miliband said. Miliband said in a speech in Mumbai, India, that the phrase joined nations against a common enemy rather than together with common ideals. ""Ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken,"" Miliband said. ""Historians will judge whether it has done more harm than good."" The foreign secretary spoke at the Taj Hotel, the historic building set ablaze during the terrorist attacks in the coastal city in November, on the last day of his three-day trip to India. He praised the response of the Indian people after the attacks and expressed Britain's sympathy and support. He said the British government has refrained from using ""war on terror"" recently because it does not accurately describe the threat that the UK, India, or other countries now face. ""The notion of a war on terror gave the impression of a unified, transnational enemy, embodied in the figure of Osama bin Laden and the organization of al Qaeda,"" Miliband said. ""In fact, as India has long known, the forces of violent extremism remain diverse. Terrorism is a deadly tactic, not an institution or an ideology."" The phrase also implies that the best response to terrorism is a military one, tracking down and killing hardcore extremists, Miliband said. He pointed to the U.S.-led coalition's challenge in Iraq, where ""the coalition there could not kill its way out of the problems of insurgency and civil strife."" Use of ""war on terror"" also implied a fight against a shared single enemy, Miliband said. It aimed for solidarity among nations based on who they are against instead of what they are for. ""Democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it,"" he said. ""If we want to promote the politics of consent instead of terror and of democratic opportunity rather than fear and oppression, we must uphold our commitments to human rights and civil liberties both at home and abroad."" He added that it was a lesson learned from the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and he said Britain welcomed President-elect Barack Obama's commitment to close it.","Phrase ""war on terror"" may have done more harm than good, UK minister says .

"PHUKET, Thailand (CNN) -- Experts investigating the Thai plane crash have recovered the plane's flight data recorders, officials said Monday as survivors of the disaster recalled how their holiday jet careered off the runway and was engulfed in fire. Rescue workers examine the scene of the One-Two-GO Airlines plane crash Monday in Phuket. Sunday's crash left 88 people dead and investigators trying to determine just what caused the smash at the airport at Phuket in southern Thailand. Thailand's Deputy Transportation Minister Sansern Wongchaum said that results from the recorders would take around a week to come back. ""Then we will analyze and then we will ... see what the real reason is of the situation here,"" he said. American crash investigators are likely to aid enquiries. The aircraft that crashed was a U.S.-made McDonnell Douglas MD-82, and the National Transportation Safety Board will assist the Thai government in the investigation, according to a statement on the NTSB's Web site. Only 40 of the 130 passengers onboard the flight survived as the plane skidded off the rain-soaked, wind-swept runway and smashed into a hillside in flames. As fire spread through the wreckage of the One-Two-GO jet, those who were able scrambled for the exits.  Watch a survivor recall the fiery horror Â» . Erik Nihlen, a Swedish tourist who helped open an emergency exit door, told his mother that he and other passengers had feared the aircraft might crash as strong winds buffeted the plane during its second attempt at landing on Sunday. ""When they were up in the air, they thought something was not right,"" Maria Nihlen said. ""Before the second (landing attempt), they knew that they were going to crash and they formed into position for an emergency landing and, well, then it happened."" She said her son -- who suffered minor bruises -- was stuck in his seat belt as passengers climbed over him to get to the exit door, which was still closed. ""People were falling over him ... and then the shelf fell over him from above,"" she said. ""But he and his friend managed to actually push hard away the people to be able to open the emergency exit door."" John Gerard O'Donnell, an Irishman who spoke to the reporters from his hospital bed, said he escaped by climbing out an exit door onto the plane's wing. ""I just can't get my head around what happened,"" said O'Donnell, whose face and arms were bandaged. ""As the plane was landing, you could tell it was in trouble 'cause it kind of landed and came up again,"" he said. ""Then the second time, it just smashed."" He said the exit door was ""kind of crushed, but we got to squeeze through and onto the wing."" ""My friend was outside, I seen him, he got out before me, and next thing it really caught fire then,"" O'Donnell said. ""I just got badly burnt -- my face, my legs, my arms."" He said he had arrived Saturday in Bangkok and intended to spend the week in Phuket with his friend, who underwent surgery for his injuries. William Harding, who witnessed the crash from another One-Two-GO aircraft that had landed just five minutes before, said he saw flames engulf the plane. ""After about five minutes of burning, there was a small explosion that blew off the top of the plane,"" he said. ""My friend (who also witnessed the crash) ... was saying that in that flight some of the crew jumped at the last minute and the plane kind of burst into flames."" Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok at 2:30 p.m. (7:30 a.m. GMT), a spokesman for the Thai discount airliner said. It crashed shortly after landing in the resort town of Phuket at approximately 3:50 p.m. (8:50 a.m. GMT), he said. Nationalities of the injured include British, Swedish, Iranian, Austrian, Australian, Thai, German, Irish, Italian, Israeli and Dutch, authorities said. Israel's Ambassador to Thailand, Yael Rubinstein, said at least two of the 10 Israeli citizens who were on board the flight are alive and were only lightly injured. The other eight Israelis are missing at this time, the ambassador said. The death toll climbed to 88 Monday as diplomats and investigators converged on the scene of Sunday's deadly crash. ""At this time, the death toll is at 88, and salvaging of the plane is still going on and we expect that this will finish today,"" said Thai Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont. ""Now, the deputy director of the Airports of Thailand and the Minister of Transport are trying to find more dead bodies that may still be within the plane's debris."" At least four Americans were killed in the crash, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said. Piriya Khempon with Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs said there are 40 known survivors, with two people unaccounted for. ""We are trying our best to cope with the situation,"" he said, adding officials from the German, British, French, Israeli and Australia embassies had arrived on a ministry flight overnight. Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Canberra was ready to help. ""We are offering the Thai government the assistance of an Australian Federal Police disaster victim identification team,"" Howard said. ""We have five police victim identification experts ready to go to Thailand straight away."" Flights from Phuket International Airport were canceled following the crash and remained closed on Monday. Phuket International Airport is the second-busiest airport in Thailand, according to the airport's Web site. The airport is about 20 miles (32 km) from downtown Phuket. One-Two-GO's Web site says the four-year-old company had 13 aircraft and operated 168 flights per week in Thailand.

"The recent deluge of Facebook changes -- both those that have already happened and those that are on the way -- have people talking. OK ... that's an understatement. They have people shouting (with either glee or fury). And fuming. And, sometimes, freaking out. When a site has roughly 800 million users, and each of those users has a quick and easy way to share their thoughts with others, interest is high and info starts flying fast in the face of what looks like a pretty radical overhaul. Inevitably, that leads to things getting a bit confused sometimes. So, here's a look at some of the rumors that we've seen flying around about Facebook's big changes, along with our best effort to sort them out. 1. Facebook is going to start charging you . Do we actually have to address this one? Apparently, yes. Every once in a while, this rumor starts cropping up in status updates -- often in all caps. Some people can't seem to get their brains around the fact that a useful service like Facebook is going to remain free. So people begin copying and pasting messages announcing the date the site is going to a pay model. A quick glimpse and you'll find multiple ""We Won't Pay For Facebook"" groups. On Facebook. So, of course, when all the new changes rolled out, the planets were aligned perfectly for the rumor to spring back up. This time, it apparently got so prevalent that Facebook addressed it. ""A rumor on the Internet caught our attention. We have no plans to charge for Facebook. It's free and always will be,"" the site posted on its own Facebook page. Here's the deal: Facebook will never really have a reason to start charging you for using it. To oversimplify the situation, you aren't Facebook's customer. You're its product. The site's business model is based on advertising and it wants as many users as possible to dangle in front of the click-hungry advertisers. Charging for Facebook would inevitably decrease the number of users. And that would decrease advertising revenue. It's not going to happen. Verdict: False. Very false. 2. Friends will see the websites I visit, even when I'm not on Facebook . This one is partially true, with one big ""if."" With what Zuckerberg called ""frictionless sharing,"" Facebook users can have the stories they're reading on certain other websites pushed straight to their News Feed for friends to share. But this will only happen on sites with the Facebook ""like"" button -- and only when the user has given the site permission to share the info. That addresses one big privacy complaint Facebook has been hit with in the past, when new features started automatically, requiring users to opt out instead of opting in. But there's always the possibility for confusion. Some people might not realize that they're authorizing the feature or may simply forget they've enabled it. In that case, best not to make a habit of reading a bunch of articles about how to find a new job if you're FB friends with your boss. Verdict: Partially True (If you enable it) 3. The Timeline is going to show all my photos and info (whether I want it to or not) One of the biggest changes Facebook is making is switching users' profile pages into what's being called a Timeline. It will, in effect, make your profile look more like a blog, with a chronological stream of photos and posts from the entire time you've been on Facebook and even before. People viewing your profile will be able to scroll through, year by year, and see what you were up to far more easily than they can now. Reports of that have led some users to freak out, or even say they planned to delete all their photos before the feature rolls out. Here's the deal: The Timeline will definitely make it easier for your friends to see your photos and posts, particularly older ones. A single click could take them from your recent and respectable photos from office parties and play dates to those infamous college keggers from days of yore (you know ... if you're young enough to have been on Facebook in college). But you'll be able to curate your own timeline. You can remove photos or posts you don't want on it and resize images to emphasize (or de-emphasize) chapters of your life. At the end of the day, there will be nothing there that's not already available to prying eyes -- but the eyes just won't have to pry as hard. Verdict: Mostly False . 4. Facebook monitors my activity when I'm not logged in . This one isn't directly linked to the changes, but has cropped up as they're about to roll out. And, in truth, as more off-site sharing is introduced, it could become more prevalent. Earlier this week, an Australian blogger posted data that he said shows information being sent to Facebook by users even when they're not logged into the site. Facebook acknowledges that it uses ""cookies"" when you visit the site that then transmit data from other sites that are connected to it. Facebook engineering director Arturo Bejar told the Wall Street Journal that the system is used to prevent phishing attacks and spam and to make it easier for users to log in on the sites they've connected to the social network. Facebook deletes the data immediately, he said, and it's never used to target advertising or the like. ""The onus is on us is to take all the data and scrub it,"" Bejar told the Journal. ""What really matters is what we say as a company and back it up."" Verdict: True (But in a limited way) 5. I can't use Spotify unless it's linked to Facebook . This one depends: Are you already on Spotify? If so, you're in the clear. If not, or if you already signed up through your Facebook account, the two services are pretty much married, 'til digital death do they part. To Spotify, the emerging music-streaming service, and Facebook, it's a seamless and convenient way to listen to music and share songs with your friends. To people who might want to listen privately, or those elusive few who don't have Facebook accounts, it's a hassle. Users will still be able to use their Spotify settings to control what information gets sent to Facebook, though. So don't worry -- if you're secretly listening to lots of Bieber and Gaga on Spotify, you can still do it on the down-low. Verdict: True (If you didn't already sign up)","Massive changes to Facebook are spawning lots of rumors -- some more true than others .
No, Facebook is not going to start charging you to use it. Probably never will .
""Frictionless sharing"" will send info about articles you're reading to Facebook if you allow it .
Popular music service Spotify is now Facebook-only ."
"In an op-ed on CNN.com, Robert Goyer suggested that it is easy to accidentally land an airplane at the wrong airport.  And he is correct. The problem is that it shouldn't be, especially not with the profusion of technology at a pilot's fingertips designed to help prevent just these kinds of mistakes. No doubt Southwest's landing at the wrong Missouri airport this week will be categorized as pilot error, as it was when a 747 crew landed at the wrong airport in Kansas in November. But labeling this all as an easy mistake or as pilot error is too simplistic. In doing so, we risk ignoring a growing threat to this nation's and the world's aviation safety, a growing disconnect between the technology created by our smartest engineers and technicians and the pilots who use it.  Indeed, pilots sometimes ignore the technology, as Goyer and others have speculated could have been the case in the Southwest landing, while others are overwhelmed when the technology unexpectedly fails, like it did aboard the doomed Air France Flight 447 that crashed in the ocean in 2009. America is good at fixing problems, though. When an airliner flying in the clouds on approach to Washington  struck the top of a hill after descending too low, U.S. industry developed a fix: a ground proximity warning system, a talking cockpit box that alerts pilots to approaching hazards they couldn't easily see. But in 2012, a Russian airline crew demonstrating a new jet received a terrain warning -- an aural cockpit signal warning the crew they were too close to the ground -- flying around Indonesia, but ignored it, believing it was a computer error. All 44 people aboard that aircraft died when the airplane struck the side of a mountain. The computer's warning had been real. In February 2009, the captain of a Continental Airlines turboprop became confused when the autopilot of his airplane turned itself off while the airplane was slowing for the approach to Buffalo, New York. The pilot was so startled by the computer shutdown that he made a fatal flying mistake. He also believed the computer's messages were a mistake. Forty-nine people in that airplane died because the pilot was wrong. All these aircraft were equipped with the latest technologies available to make flight as safe as humanly possible. And yet each time, the crew managed to figure out a way not to heed the warnings. The Southwest and the Atlas Air pilots -- and their passengers, of course -- were just lucky no one was hurt. But what about the next time? The Southwest crew only averted disaster by a few hundred feet, narrowly missing a drop-off at the end of the runway that would surely have broken the airplane into many pieces. All these problems point to this newest threat: Pilot's confusion about what their computers are telling them, when they look at them, that is. This speaks to complacency to some extent. It's also well known that humans don't handle monitoring duties very well for very long.  We grow bored rather easily. But even labeling this a ""human factors"" problem is too easy. Like everything in our society these days, this complacency, this disconnect between operator and computer, is not a simple black and white problem that we can fix with another electronic box or an enthusiastic chat from the boss. There's another overriding problem preventing us from digging deeply enough into the implications of this problem: The airline industry has become a victim of its own success, with an impressive air safety record. Before last year's crashes in San Francisco and Birmingham, Alabama, there had been not a single fatality between 2010 and 2012. Because our record has been so good, many people inside and outside the industry, as well as legislators, regulators and certainly airline passengers may mistakenly believe that we've solved the aviation safety problem. But just as hospital administrators would never tell patients that losing a few people now and again to infection should be considered an acceptable loss, we can't ignore the instances when something has come between our professional pilots and these technologies created to help save us from ourselves. And we in the industry are only now coming to believe this threat is real ourselves. A recent study delivered to the FAA about automation confusion highlights some of these problems, but offered no timeline to solve them. Passengers also need to advocate for their own safety by writing to their legislators, airline CEOs and regulators demanding that the automation confusion issue be put on the front burner now. Like our pilots, aviation safety's threats are sending us warning messages. But right now we don't seem to be listening.","Robert Mark: Writer suggested it's easy to land jet at wrong airport. True, with a caveat .
Southwest landing joins similar cases from recent years. These should raise alarm, he says .
He says pilots often failed to heed what computer was telling them. Complacency a threat .
Mark: Fliers should demand ""automation confusion"" be put on regulators' front-burner ."
"The SAT college exam will undergo sweeping changes on what's tested, how it's scored and how students can prepare, College Board President and CEO David Coleman said Wednesday. Standardized tests have become ""far too disconnected from the work of our high schools,"" Coleman said at an event in Austin, Texas. They're too stressful for students, too filled with mystery and ""tricks"" to raise scores and aren't necessarily creating more college-ready students, he said. The SAT to be released in spring 2016 is designed to change that, he said. The test will include three sections -- evidence-based reading and writing, math and an optional essay -- each retooled to stop students from simply filling a bubble on the test sheet. ""No longer will it be good enough to focus on tricks and trying to eliminate answer choices,"" Coleman said. ""We are not interested in students just picking an answer, but justifying their answers."" The test will shift from its current score scale of 2400 back to 1600, with a separate score for the essay. No longer will test takers be penalized for choosing incorrect answers. To prepare students for the test, the College Board will partner for the first time with Khan Academy to provide free test preparation materials, starting in spring 2015. Afterward, income-eligible students will receive fee waivers to apply to four colleges for free. Why the test is changing . The last major changes to the SAT came in 2005, when it altered some question formats, added a written essay and changed its score scale from 1600 to 2400. For this change, Coleman cited the need to create more opportunities for students, rather than obstructing them with test questions that felt detached from their educations and the preparation colleges needed. Coleman, who joined the College Board in 2012, has spoken critically of his organization's test and discussed how it could be improved. ""Admissions officers and counselors have said they find the data from admissions exams useful, but are concerned that these exams have become disconnected from the work of high school classrooms and surrounded by costly test preparation,"" Coleman said. In recent years, another exam, the ACT, has gained popularity as several states adopted it as part of their standardized testing programs. And while the majority of four-year colleges require an exam score for admission, hundreds of schools have shifted to test-optional policies that allow students to decide what to submit -- or whether to share a test score at all. Indeed, students' grades and the academic rigor of their courses weighs more heavily in college admissions decision than standardized test scores, class rank or professed interest in a particular school, according to the National Association for College Admission Counseling's 2013 ""State of College Admission"" report released in January. The report was based on surveys sent to public and private high schools, postsecondary institutions and data from the College Board, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Census Bureau. ""I'd like to be optimistic and believe some of this is going to be good,"" said Steve Syverson, a member of the NACAC board and dean of admissions emeritus for Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin -- a test-optional school. ""I just don't know how it will work out."" Syverson was part of NACAC's Commission on Standardized Testing that in 2008 urged standardized test makers to adhere more closely to school curricula, colleges to consider more about applicants than seductively simple test scores and society to stop rating schools based on standardized test scores. Syverson was intrigued by the Khan Academy partnership, he said, and pleased with the direction Coleman seemed to be taking the test. He wonders whether fee waivers and others changes are meant to draw back students and schools that have turned away from the SAT or testing in general. Until he sees the passages students will be reading, the questions they're answering and the way colleges react, he has to remain skeptical. ""Some of this is just words. They had a lot of great language around the last change,"" in 2005, Syverson said. ""The angst about the exams has just continued to grow."" How the test will change . Sections of the redesigned SAT might sound similar to the current test, but the changes are significant, Coleman said. The reading and writing sections will include questions that require students to cite evidence for their answer choices, and will include reading passages from a broader range of disciplines, including science, history, social studies and literature. Test takers will no longer be asked to complete sentences with obscure words they might have memorized from flash cards. Instead, students will have to consider the context of how words like ""synthesis"" and ""empirical"" are used. They're not ""SAT words"" as they've come to be known, Coleman said, but words students are likely to encounter again. ""We must do all we can to foster this daily work that prepares students,"" Coleman said. The math section will no longer allow calculators to be used on every portion. It will focus on data analysis and real world problem-solving, algebra and some more advanced math concepts -- areas that most prepare students for college and career, Coleman said. ""It is not that helpful to tell students, 'To get ready, they should study all of math,'"" Coleman said. The essay, which the SAT added in 2005, will now be optional. SAT essays have faced criticism over the years from educators who said they focused too much on what test takers wrote, not whether their statements were true, or their arguments reasonable. Coleman said the College Board would now take responsibility for ""unintended consequences"" of how the essay test was designed. Essays will be scored separately from the rest of the test, and the prompt will remain basically the same in every test: It will ask students to consider a passage and write an essay that analyzes how the author made an argument, used evidence and styled ideas. The redesigned test will take about three hours, with an additional 50 minutes for the essay, and will be administered by print and computer; the current test is available on paper only. How students can prepare . Last year, when Coleman announced plans to redesign the SAT, he said it would launch in 2015. Toward the end of 2013, he delayed the launch to 2016 in order to allow partners more time to prepare. That means more time for students, educators and guidance and admissions counselors to understand the changes -- and more time for the College Board's Khan Academy test prep program to gear up. Partnering with the free, online resource is intended to make the SAT more transparent, and cut back on perceptions of inequality around expensive test preparation services, Coleman explained Wednesday. ""If there are no more secrets,"" Coleman said, ""it's very hard to pay for them."" Students' classrooms are meant to be the best preparation for the redesigned SAT. The College Board's Khan Academy tools will supplement that learning. ""It's going to meet students where they are,"" said Salman Khan, the Khan Academy creator. ""We'll take you as far back as you need to go or as far forward as you need to go."" Khan emphasized that he is planning to challenge the existing test prep industry by offering high quality, easily accessible tools. ""This isn't just a 'Hey, since it's free, it's better than nothing,"" he said. ""Our intention in this partnership is this will be the best thing out there, and it happens to be free."" On April 16, the College Board will release more detailed specifications about the test and sample test questions. Some Khan Academy tools will be available to help students taking the SAT before the redesigned exam launches, Coleman said. For students, Coleman said, ""we hope you breathe a sigh of relief that this exam will be focused, useful, open, clear, and aligned with the work you will do throughout high school.""

"An internal government memo written just days before the start of open enrollment for Obamacare warned of a ""high"" security risk because of a lack of testing of the HealthCare.gov website. Related: Administration warned about site a month before launch . ""Due to system readiness issues, the SCA (security control assessment) was only partly completed,"" said the internal memo from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""This constitutes a risk that must be accepted and mitigated to support the Marketplace Day 1 operations."" The memo, which was provided in response to a request from the House Oversight Committee, goes on to explain that CMS would create a ""dedicated security team"" to monitor the risk, conduct weekly scans and within 60 to 90 days after the website went live, ""conduct a full-scale SCA test."" Read the memo . The memo did not detail the security concerns. It was written by IT officials at CMS, and was sent to and signed by the agency's director, Marilyn Tavenner, who testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that she thought the website was ready to go when it began its crash-riddled rollout on October 1. ""We had tested the website and we were comfortable with its performance,"" Tavenner told lawmakers, although she added the caveat, ""we knew all along there would be, as with any new website, some individual glitches we would have to work out."" Republican lawmakers referred to the document Wednesday as they raised concerns at a House Energy and Commerce Committee grilling of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Tavenner's boss. Sebelius also testified that she thought the website, which has been prone to crashing, was ready to be rolled out on October 1. She compared the early rollout to a sort of early beta test and said the system was secure because data is stored in the same systems used by the Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security. Contractors blame government for Obamacare website woes . But lawmakers said the system should have been more thoroughly vetted, since it asks purchasers of health insurance to provide personal information. ""You accepted a risk on behalf of every person that used this computer that put their personal and financial information at risk because you did not even have the most basic 'end-to-end' test on security of this system,"" Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, told Sebelius. ""Amazon would never do this. ProFlowers would never do this. Kayak would never do this,"" he said. CNNMoney had earlier in the week profiled an Arizona software tester who said the system was vulnerable and could be hacked. He was able to reset users' passwords without much difficulty. But the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN that particular issue had been addressed.","Security control assessment ""was only partly completed,"" it says .

"Mitt Romney is in a bind over binders. The Republican presidential nominee is being challenged about the details of hiring women for top government positions when he won election as governor of Massachusetts in 2002, giving a possible late boost to efforts by President Barack Obama's campaign to strengthen its support among female voters. Less than three weeks before Election Day, the battle for the women's vote -- a demographic Obama won easily in 2008 and needs again this year to secure re-election -- appeared to be tightening. Then comments by Romney in Tuesday's second of three presidential debates raised questions about what actually happened when he was governor and provided an opening for Obama's team to challenge whether he understands the role of women in the workplace and the economy. Did Romney lose ground with women? ""I had the chance to pull together a cabinet and all the applicants seemed to be men,"" Romney said at the debate in answer to a question about equal pay for women. ""And I went to my staff, and I said, 'How come all the people for these jobs are all men?' They said, 'Well, these are the people that have the qualifications.' And I said, 'Well, gosh, can't we find some women that are also qualified?'"" That led to a ""concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members"" of his cabinet, he continued, saying: ""I went to a number of women's groups and said, 'Can you help us find folks?' And they brought us whole binders full of women."" Romney added that a university study later concluded that Massachusetts under his leadership ""had more women in senior leadership positions than any other state in America."" The ""binders full of women"" reference prompted a huge response on social media, becoming the third-fastest rising Google search during the debate and getting a Twitter hashtag, a series of memes on Tumblr and a Facebook page with more than 8,000 members by Thursday morning. With the attention came attempts by Obama and other Democrats to gain political advantage. ""We don't have to order up some binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women who can learn and excel,"" Obama told a campaign event Thursday in New Hampshire. He quickly pivoted to the first bill he signed into law -- the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act -- by saying he wanted new women graduates ""to receive equal pay for equal work."" On Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden characterized Romney's perspective on women as a ""1950s time warp"" in keeping with the Obama campaign's efforts to focus the debate on women's issues to topics involving personal choice, such as abortion and contraceptives, as well as equal opportunity. At a campaign stop on Thursday in Nevada, Biden repeated his warning that a Romney presidency was certain to bring more conservative Supreme Court justices who would overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion. A USA Today/Gallup poll of registered voters in 12 swing states found that more women considered abortion the most important election issue over jobs and the economy. Romney's team frames its pitch to women voters as an economic choice, arguing that high unemployment and sluggish growth under Obama particularly hurt women and families. ""This president has failed America's women,"" Romney told a campaign event Wednesday in Virginia. ""As I go across the country and ask women what can I do to help, what they speak about day in and day out is help me find a good job, or a good job for my spouse. And help my kid, make sure my children have a bright future, better schools and better job opportunities. That's what the women of America are concerned about and the answers are coming from us and not from Barack Obama."" Asked Thursday about boosting jobs for women, Romney's running mate -- conservative House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin -- launched a lengthy response with a succinct summation: ""Get the economy growing."" Obama ""took his eye off the ball of growing the economy, and as a result, the poverty rate among women is at a 17-year high,"" Ryan told a campaign event in Florida. ""Over 5 million women have just left the work force.  Fewer women are working today than when he took office. And so of the people who have been hit the hardest, it's women."" Hillary Clinton says no to another run . Meanwhile, disputes arose about Romney's account of what he did in Massachusetts. Jesse Mermell, a Democratic local official in Brookline, Massachusetts, who was executive director of the Massachusetts Women's Political Caucus from 2004 to 2008, took exception to Romney's statement that he initiated the search for qualified women for his cabinet. A program her group oversaw provided Romney's transition team in 2002 with resumes of qualified women, Mermell told a conference call with reporters Wednesday. ""Mitt Romney did not request those,"" Mermell said, explaining that the program called MassGAP approached Romney and his Democratic opponent before the election to get their commitment for hiring women to state positions in proportion to the female population. ""Then after the election, our group approached the Romney transition team with the resumes, or the so-called binders full of women."" She also cited a study that showed Romney initially hired 14 women among 33 appointments to his cabinet -- 42% of the total -- but by the end of his four-year term, the number of women in his administration was 25%, lower than the previous or subsequent governors. ""At the time Romney paid lip service to the public about hiring more women in senior positions, and treated it like a quota,"" Mermell said. ""But like with so many other things that are Mitt Romney, the facts did not match the rhetoric."" Mermell and Ledbetter, the woman for whom the equal pay legislation was named, told reporters that Ryan voted against the measure and Romney also opposes it. Romney has yet to clearly state his position on the law that strengthens the ability of women to sue employers over unequal pay. David S. Bernstein, a staff writer for the Phoenix in Boston, told CNN on Wednesday that Romney also had issues involving judicial appointees, noting 17 of the first 19 judges he appointed were men. ""After some unfavorable press about that, he began appointing more women,"" Bernstein said. By comparison, the Obama White House had women holding just under 40% of jobs paying $75,000 or more in 2011. Obama also chose women for his two Supreme Court justice appointments -- Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- and made the fair pay act named for Ledbetter his administration's first new law. Ledbetter said the law bearing her name ""has caused a lot of employers, a lot of large employers, to look at their procedures and their process, and to look at all employees and their staffers to see if everybody's being treated equitably and fairly."" Republican surrogates for Romney sought to play down the magnitude of the flap over his debate comments. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told CNN on Thursday that the ""binders full of women"" response was good for ""a laugh or two,"" but wasn't the main issue of what he called ""a serious campaign."" ""Despite all the rhetoric and all the attempts of the Obama administration to separate men from women over social issues -- largely contrived, I think -- what men and women care about in this election is the economy, getting us back to work and getting us out of debt,"" McDonnell said. ""Mitt Romney's point was that he actually affirmatively went out to make sure that he had great, competent, qualified women in his cabinet."" Citing a Gallup poll that showed Romney catching up with Obama among women voters in an aberration from other polling so far, McDonnell said: ""I'm glad the Obama administration is having fun with it, but the point is that this race is now clearly going in the way of Mitt Romney because he's a serious candidate.""","Questions arise over Mitt Romney's account of hiring women in Massachusetts .

The minimum pay for adjunct faculty at Duquesne used to be $2500 per course. After an ongoing effort by the United Steelworkers to unionize adjuncts there, the university paid $3,500 per course. Vojtko's situation was not unusual for adjuncts in academia. That is why many have taken the hashtag #iamMargaretMary to tweet their indignation at her working conditions, lack of support and lack of respect. The dirty little secret is that higher education is staffed with an insufficiently resourced, egregiously exploited, contingent ""new faculty majority."" In addition to the 49.3% of faculty in part-time positions (70% in community colleges), another 19% are full-time, nontenure-track. (These numbers do not include graduate assistants or postdocs.) Adjunct professors, like many hard-working Americans, are the working poor. They are one step away from ""We don't need your services anymore"" or one medical emergency away from being destitute, like Vojtko. If Vojtko was good enough to be entrusted with teaching Duquesne undergraduates, how can the university justify not providing her (and her adjunct colleagues) with health care and other basic benefits? If American higher education says to students and society that a college education is the path to the middle class, how can we justify such treatment of these professionals, with advanced degrees, who are teaching the students? We are living a lie that cheats these professors and the students they teach, particularly in access universities and community colleges where adjunct faculty numbers, like percentages of lower-income students, are highest and instructional spending per student is lowest. The story is not just about Duquesne. Certainly, the institution's wealth ($171 million endowment, tuition over $28,000) and Catholic status (Catholic social doctrine supports collective bargaining rights) make the situation -- and Duquesne's refusal to recognize a union that adjunct faculty voted for overwhelmingly -- particularly indefensible. Duquesne University's administration has provided a response to the situation, suggesting that there were caring responses by people within the institution to Vojtko's circumstances. However, acts of charity are not conditions-of-employment justice for hard-working adjunct professors. The larger issues are not about individual responsibility or culpability for actions toward Vojtko, but rather, about collective responsibility for the structural conditions of work that contributed to her circumstances, and that leave significant segments of the academic workforce with no benefits and low pay. So Duquesne should recognize the adjunct union, bargain in good faith, grant benefits and set up a professional development fund in Vojtko's name. But this story speaks more broadly about a horrible reality in higher education. Adjunct professors, as part of a growing army of working poor, are at the center of the academic labor movement, just as fast-food workers are now at the center of the larger labor movement. We are in the midst of deciding the extent to which we are an inclusive society that will live up to our nation's promise that hard work pays off. The question is: How will we treat working people?  Will we, the richest nation on earth, continue to structure employment in ways that reduce large segments of society to near Dickensian conditions of existence? Or can we muster the collective will to appropriately remunerate and honor the work of all working Americans? In academia, that means tenure stream faculty, staff, students, administrators, and communities must recognize in Vojtko's fate the ugly and diminished future of higher education and choose, in big ways and small ways, a more equitable path. Adjunct professors have taken initiatives to change the status quo. Some have joined advocacy groups, such as the New Faculty Majority. Some are involved with caucuses within unions and professional associations where they gather data about pay and working conditions, define best practices, and work to ensure that adjunct faculty are not discriminated against. Adjuncts are organizing for benefits, a living wage, and conditions that will benefit their students and their schools. In Pittsburgh, as in Boston, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Washington, there are union campaigns for adjunct unions in private (often wealthy) universities. There is also much organizing in public institutions, and in units that combine adjunct with full-time and tenure track faculty. No one deserves the treatment and fate experienced by Margaret Mary Vojtko, who escaped the 21st century equivalent of Victorian poorhouses in a cardboard casket. American higher education can and should do better for those who teach our students.","Margaret Mary Vojtko, who taught at a university for 25 years, died in poverty .

"Myanmar's military leaders have nominated a former general considered fiercely loyal to former dictator Senior General Than Shwe to be the country's next vice president. Myint Swe's expected promotion from chief minister of Rangoon Region to the second highest post in the country has disappointed observers who hoped for a more reform-friendly candidate. ""The military chose someone who they can count on,"" said Aung Zaw, editor of Thailand-based Irrawaddy magazine which covers Myanmar news. Describing Myint as a prodigy of the former dictator, Aung Zaw said that his selection was not surprising given that the post had to be filled by the military. ""I think they chose someone who would protect the vested interests of the military and the former dictator. So the choice doesn't seem surprising but it doesn't make anything promising to this reform process,"" he said. ""He's not noted as a reformer,"" said Sean Turnell, an associate professor at Macquarie University in Sydney, of the 61-year-old candidate. ""I think that fact alone will disappoint many people who watch and are closely involved in Burma."" Since becoming president in March 2011, Thein Sein has steered Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, away from its repressive military past, towards what many hope is a truly democratic future. The release of lauded democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest and her subsequent election to parliament is the clearest signal yet of Thein's commitment to reform. Aung San Suu Kyi attends first session of parliament since taking oath . However, military men still dominate parliament and any step forward must be navigated with their approval, which has made Myanmar's democratic reform a delicate and difficult process. The resignation of the ""hardliner"" Vice President Tin Aung Mying Oo early this month handed the military a clear opportunity to convey its view on the direction the country is taking. Will vice president's exit boost Myanmar reform efforts? ""I think by appointing someone who is not an overt reformer they're sort of signaling I think what we understand to be their current situation; that they're much more cautious, much more reluctant reformers than some of the reformist groups in the government,"" Turnell said. According to Irrawaddy, Myint graduated from the Defense Services Academy in 1971 before rising through the ranks to become commander of the Light Infantry Division 11, responsible for security in Rangoon, also known as Yangon. He later served in the War Office before returning to Rangoon as head of the Rangoon Division where he was thought to have participated in the violent crackdown on protesters during the 2007 ""Saffron Revolution."" As least a dozen people were killed, several dozens wounded and more than 2,000 arrested, according to a U.N. Security Council report, which added that the toll could be much higher. ""(Myint) was responsible for security affairs in Yangon, Rangoon and when the shooting took place the order probably came from the top and he had to take care of all the things on the ground, meaning the troops and killing and detaining,"" Aung Zaw said. However, Turnell said Myint was also considered someone who ""gets along,"" that is, someone who can navigate a path between military loyalists and people within the government more receptive to change. ""In that context he's not altogether that different from the current President Thein Sein who of course is also someone who seems to be able to get along with both the previous regime and some of the reformers,"" he said. Turnell described former Vice President Tin Aung Mying Oo as a ""very rough character with rough edges who aggravated a lot of people, particularly in the reformist camp."" ""I think (Myint) won't be as overtly oppositional to reform. I think the remaining question is to what extent will he support it?""","Myanmar military nominates former general Myint Swe as vice president .

"Students at the University of South Florida will be soaring to new academic heights, with drones. College students will be getting their hands on more than just books at USF come the fall semester. The Tampa campus plans to offer remote-controlled drones for students to check out for school-related projects. It's a bold move considering that more places are starting to limit the access of drones, including the National Park Service, which announced a temporary ban on the use of drones on Friday. The NPS announcement basically bars the access of unmanned devices to 84 million acres of land in the U.S. Yet, USF is taking a different approach to drones, making the technology more accessible to its students. The library purchased two drones with some leftover money from a grant to remodel its facility with new technology. These drones are capable of taking aerial video and photography. The library's hope is to integrate new technology to its services. In the past year, the library has worked to expand its ""Digital Media Commons"" in an effort to promote digital learning. Now, USF's library is taking it a step further by giving students the opportunity to operate the drones, which are valued at $1,500 apiece. Learn how to shoot amazing videos with drones . Dean of USF Libraries Bill Garrison says the drones could be a great resource for students working on multimedia projects, and sees the program working in conjunction with other departments at the university. ""We have a global sustainability program, and they are mapping out the campus to see energy usage, so they can use the drones to help map out the campus,"" he explained. ""There are a lot of opportunities for research and learning by using drones. And the faculty can use it, too."" Flying these drones will not be as simple as swiping a library card, though. Students will need to enroll in a training course before they can check out the equipment. They'll also be required to provide an explanation on how the drone will be utilized in a school project, and they must be supervised by a faculty member while operating it around the campus. As of now, the program aims to keep the drones on USF's campus unless a professor makes the case for an exception, and students will be liable for any damages to the equipment. Garrison says the move to introduce drones to the school's library service is part of a larger effort to stay relevant on campus by providing more digital learning tools. ""One of the things many libraries have struggled with is how do you become a real part of the campus and not be viewed as a book warehouse,"" he said. ""I find it very exciting that we are able to do this, and I think the students will appreciate it.""","University of South Florida will let students checkout drones at its library.

"(CNN) -- A Saudi court sentenced a female journalist Saturday to 60 lashes for her work on a controversial Arabic-language TV show that aired an episode in which a man bragged about his sex life, two sources told CNN. The court in Jeddah also imposed a two-year travel ban on Rosanna Al-Yami, according to a Saudi Information Ministry official, who could not be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. The ban prevents her from traveling outside Saudi Arabia. This official identified Al-Yami as a fixer, who helps journalists obtain stories, and a coordinator for Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., the network that aired ""A Thick Red Line,"" a popular show on social taboos. On one episode, a Saudi man, Mazen Abdul Jawad, bragged about sex and got into trouble with Saudi authorities for his boasts. Abdul Jawad was put on trial and sentenced to five years in prison and 1,000 lashes. Suleiman Al-Jumeii, the attorney who represents Abdul Jawad, also confirmed the sentence against Al-Yami, saying he believes she is the first Saudi journalist ever to be sentenced to lashes. While the charges include involvement in preparing the program, she was not involved in setting up the episode in which Abdul Jawad appeared, the lawyer said. Al-Jumeii doesn't represent Al-Yami, but he said he is keeping tabs on all aspects of cases dealing with ""A Thick Red Line."" The lawyer is attempting to pursue an appeal for his client and get his case heard in a special court that deals only with media matters. CNN has attempted to get comments from Al-Yami and her attorney. Abdul Jawad, a 32-year-old airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14 on ""A Thick Red Line."" That episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where Shariah, or Islamic law, is practiced. Premarital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle. Saudi authorities shut down the Lebanese network's offices in Jeddah and Riyadh after the interview aired a few months ago. Abdul Jawad was arrested shortly after the program aired and charged with violating Saudi Arabia's crime of publicizing vice.","Journalist Rosanna Al-Yami works for network that aired show on taboos .

"(CNN)Two of my eldest son's first words were ""Dada"" and ""Batman."" (Or ""Batmah,"" at least.) That should have clued me in that Gilbert was following in his Dad's footsteps; he was a superhero fan in the making. From dancing and singing to the ""Batman"" theme song at age 1 to creating his own super-characters from everyday items around him, he's been completely enthralled with superheroes. As he grows up, his superheroes are shaping the person he's becoming. A fascination with superheroes can benefit a child in many ways, including boosting his self-confidence and making him feel powerful. (And what better day than National Superhero Day, April 28, to celebrate that?) Gilbert isn't the only example of the positive powers of superhero worship. In some cases, superheroes can teach children how to be strong. Cynthia Falardeau of Vero Beach, Florida, has also encouraged her son, Wyatt, to explore superheroes for years, because of the way they changed her childhood for the better. Before she admired Wonder Woman and Princess Leia, Falardeau was bullied by other kids for her first heroic inspiration, Mary Poppins. ""My two oldest brothers and their neighborhood friends squelched my dreams,"" she said. ""Their mockery drove me to find comfort in the arms of my mother."" Her mother encouraged her to pursue a more ""daring"" character, and soon she discovered Wonder Woman and TV's Bionic Woman. Wonder Woman gave her confidence: ""She was powerful, beautiful and never broke a sweat!"" Even today, she credits these heroes with some of the things she has accomplished in life. ""I have completed four half-ironman races (70.3 miles) in the past two years,"" she said. ""Each time I envision my success, I think of the Bionic Woman or Wonder Woman, and I feel invincible.  When I take that first stroke and glide across the water I am energized."" Now she sees 11-year-old Wyatt finding strength to deal with his problems at school. ""Sometimes Wyatt says that he gets bullied and superheroes give him the confidence to stand up, and tell the teacher,"" she said. ""One of his favorites is the Incredible Hulk,"" she said. "" 'I like that Hulk gets angry at the bad guys and he uses kung-fu!' "" he told his mother. The recent ""Captain America"" movie has made the patriotic hero one of Wyatt's favorites, as well. When asked by his mother why he likes superheroes so much, he said, ""They have super powers, strength, and they are brave. They always do the right things.  They battle against evil. Superheroes give you strength!"" Jeff Greenberg, social psychology professor at the University of Arizona, sees this -- superheroes giving strength and power -- as the key to why kids love superheroes. ""We adults forget how vulnerable we all were as young children,"" he said. ""We were little and lacked the physical size and strength and knowledge to protect ourselves and function effectively on our own,"" he said. Children first depend on their parents for love and protection. But as they grow up, they start looking to role models who embody the same power and positivity, Greenberg said. ""By identifying with the culture's heroes and superheroes, children can begin to feel like they are aligning with what is good and can develop their own agency, power, and value in the world,"" he said. Of course, there are always the classic arguments against kids having an interest in superheroes. They're marketing ploys. They take children out of reality. Superheroes come with a heaping helping of violence (even if it's usually ""cartoon violence""). And there are also concerns that boys are getting the wrong idea, seeing their future selves as either heroes or victims. Greenberg said these are valid concerns, but he still sees superheroes as the good guys when it comes to their influence on children. The answer isn't to try to control your child's preferences. Greenberg encourages parents to ""be a guiding force by sharing their enjoyment of superheroes, and in age appropriate ways."" Once children understand that these are fictional characters, they can begin to distinguish between how things work in superhero land and how they work in the real world, he said. Falardeau said superheroes teach her son good lessons on a smaller scale: ""I think he is learning that everyone is capable of being extraordinary."" As my son Gilbert's superhero playtime has evolved, not only has he developed a sense of morality, his inner positivity has also come out. He sees the villains as capable of turning over a new leaf. He describes them as turning good at times. Gilbert's fascination has not gone without some encouragement on my part. I have been a fan of superheroes ever since Spider-Man taught me how to read on ""The Electric Company."" It really never left me, from the Batmania of the late '80s and early '90s to the resurgence of superhero cinema with ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man,"" and I've been a comics collector off and on for decades. As far as I'm concerned, I hope superheroes continue to take Gilbert's imagination up, up and away!","CNN producer sees superheroes as a positive influence on his three year old son's development .

"Therapy aimed at turning gay kids straight will soon be illegal in California, with the state's governor declaring he hopes a new law will relegate such efforts ""to the dustbin of quackery."" The legislation -- which the state Senate passed in May, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law this weekend and will take effect January 1 -- prohibits attempts to change the sexual orientation of patients under age 18. ""This bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide,"" Brown tweeted. ""These practices have no basis in science or medicine."" But practitioners of so-called ""reparative therapy"" say the assertions of the governor and gay rights advocates ""just are not true,"" according to David Pickup, a spokesman for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality. Joined by ""individual therapists and individual minor clients,"" his group will file a ""major lawsuit"" this week to challenge the law,"" Pickup said. The Pacific Justice Institute separately told CNN it will file its own lawsuit Monday, alleging the law violates the First Amendment. ""We do competent therapy, therapy that truly works,"" Pickup, who himself underwent such therapy and now administers it to others, said Monday on CNN. ""For them to have a bill that says, 'No, we can't even talk about these issues, we can't do anything to help these children resolve their homosexual feelings and maximize their heterosexual potential' -- that's the height of political and therapeutic irresponsibility."" Pickup alluded to a report by the American Psychiatric Association that, he says, doesn't find any ""proof that (the therapy) causes harm."" But the psychiatric organization -- which is the world's largest of its kind, with more than 36,000 members -- determined, in fact, that reparative therapy poses a great risk, including increasing the likelihood or severity of depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior for those undergoing therapy. Therapists' alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already felt by patients, the association says. CNN.com blogs: Gay in America . ""The longstanding consensus of the behavioral and social sciences and the health and mental health professions is that homosexuality per se is a normal and positive variation of human sexual orientation,"" the association says. After the bill passed the state Senate, Equality California spokeswoman Rebekah Orr praised the ""right first step in making sure that young people are protected from these unscrupulous therapists who are really engaging in therapeutic deception that is based on junk science."" ""This law will ensure that state-licensed therapists can no longer abuse their power to harm LGBT youth and propagate the dangerous and deadly lie that sexual orientation is an illness or disorder that can be 'cured,'"" said Orr's organization, which describes itself as the largest statewide advocacy group in California working for ""full equality"" for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Peter Drake, who once participated in reparative therapy, said the bill protects youths from ""a very, very dangerous therapy that doesn't work and leaves a lot of people feeling despair and hopelessness."" Yet Pickup insists that the ""children who walk into my office ... crying, depressed, lonely, gender-identity confused and sexually confused"" ask for help voluntarily, because they are ""distressed."" Thousands believe, he claims, ""believe there's a cause-and-effect nature of homosexuality"" that can be brought about by instances of abuse and issues like ""gender identity inferiority,"" ""un-met needs from ... usually the same-sex parent"" and other ""inner wounds that we discover in therapy."" ""When those wounds get healed, the homosexual feelings -- we don't force them away, they naturally, spontaneously dissipate,"" said Pickup, who credits the therapy with having ""helped save my life,"" by decreasing his depression and raising his self-esteem. The debate could now move to court, thanks to promised lawsuits by Pickup's group and the Pacific Justice Institute that describes itself as a network of more than 1,000 attorneys ""defending religious, parental, and other constitutional rights."" ""Of all the freedom-killing bills we have seen in our legislature the last several years, this is among the worst,"" said Brad Dacus, the institute's president and founder, in a written statement.

Read more: Denied divorce, some same-sex couples 'wed-locked' Ryan Kendall, who went through this type of therapy when he was 13, told CNN it began after his mother read his diary and discovered he was gay.  In the therapy, he was consistently told his sexuality was a choice and could ""be fixed,"" he said. ""I never believed that. I know I'm gay just like I know I'm short and I'm half Hispanic. I've never thought that those facts would change. It's part of my core fundamental identity. So the parallel would be sending me to tall camp and saying, 'If you try very hard, one day you can be 6-foot-1.'"" Kendall said psychologist Joseph Nicolosi treated him. His parents provided CNN with copies of bills from Nicolosi's office, but Nicolosi said he did not remember treating someone by that name. He told CNN he views the therapy he provides as ""trying to bring out the heterosexuality"" in someone. Yet Nicolosi insisted the therapy is not harmful, and he treats only people who want to change. A leading psychologist in the field of reparative therapy, George Rekers, treated a boy named Kirk Murphy, whose story was told in a 2011 CNN report. Rekers considered Kirk a success story, writing that ""his feminine behavior was gone"" -- proof, Rekers said, that homosexuality can be prevented. But Murphy's family said he never stopped being gay. He hanged himself at the age of 38. Despite allegations by the family that Rekers' therapy decades earlier ultimately led to the suicide , Rekers told CNN that scientifically, it ""would be inaccurate to assume that it was the therapy,"" and that he grieves for the parents. ""Two independent psychologists with me had evaluated him and said he was better adjusted after treatment,"" Rekers said. ""I only meant to help, do the best I could with the parents,"" he added. Rekers' days as a prominent anti-gay champion came to an end after he hired a male escort to accompany him on a trip to Europe. He denied any sexual contact or awareness at the time that the escort offered sexual favors. Earlier this year, psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy, which suggested that it could help gays and lesbians become straight. He said it was deeply flawed. ""I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy,"" Spitzer said in a letter to the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. ""I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some 'highly motivated' individuals."" Kendall said the therapy he underwent ""led me to periods of homelessness, to drug abuse, to spending a decade of my life wanting to kill myself. It led to so much pain and struggle. And I want them to know that what they do hurts people. ""It hurts children. It has no basis in fact. And they need to stop.""","Two groups say they're filing lawsuits challenging the newly signed California law .

"(CNN) -- The lights were back on at Cleveland, Ohio's largest airport Sunday afternoon after a transformer explosion cut power at terminals for more than seven hours, an airport spokeswoman told CNN. About 800 travelers were stranded Sunday morning when Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport lost power at 6:50 a.m. ET, spokeswoman Jacqueline Mayo said. Terminals went dark and air traffic ground to a halt, but the control tower, runways and taxiways remained lit by backup generators, Mayo said. The lack of power at terminals made it impossible to check in or screen passengers. Travelers remained calm and waited for some time, Mayo said. But then many gave up and left, not knowing when operations would resume.

All power was restored by 2:30 p.m., and crews were checking that no cold-sensitive equipment was damaged and that all systems were running smoothly, Mayo said. The transformer exploded after road salt swept into the air gradually corroded power lines, Mayo said. While the problem was resolved, travelers were still experiencing delays.

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN)  -- Former South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun committed suicide Saturday by leaping to his death from a hill behind his house, the government announced. Former South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun served from 2003-2008. He was 62. Roh, who was president from 2003 to 2008, had gone hiking near his home with an aide about 6:30 a.m. Saturday (5:30 p.m. ET on Friday), the state-run Yonhap news agency said. He was found later with head injuries, and died at 9:30 a.m. after being taken to a hospital in Busan, police said. A hospital spokesman declined to comment. Roh left a suicide note for his family that family lawyer Moon Jae-in handed out to South Korean media. News reports said Roh wrote it on his computer about half an hour before he left the house. ""I am in debt to too many people,"" the note reads. ""Too many people have suffered because of me. And I cannot imagine the suffering they will go through in the future."" Roh's death came amid an investigation into a bribery scandal that had tarnished his reputation. Prosecutors were investigating the former president for allegedly receiving $6 million in bribes from a South Korean businessman while in office. Roh's wife was scheduled to be questioned by prosecutors Saturday, and Roh was planning to answer a second round of questions next week. With Roh's death, prosecutors said, the case against him has been suspended. Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal. In the first round of questioning, he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters.  Watch more about his death Â» . The former president said he learned about the payments only after he left office and that some of them were legitimate investments, Yonhap reported. Roh wrote about his thoughts on a blog that he maintained, which also attracted supporters and tourists to his hometown, Yonhap said.  Watch Roh's political rise and fall remembered Â» . Roh's suicide note said his health was poor and that ""nothing is left in my life but to be a burden to others."" ""Don't be too sad. Aren't life and death both a piece of nature? Don't be sorry. Don't blame anyone. It is fate,"" he wrote. The note asks that his body be cremated and for a small headstone to be left near his house. ""It's what I have thought about for a long time,"" he writes at the end. Although Roh had not made a formal guilty plea, many were disappointed that a man who came to power vowing an end to corruption would face such allegations. U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement he was ""saddened"" by news of Roh's death. ""During his tenure, President Roh contributed to the strong and vital relationship between the United States and the Republic of Korea,"" Obama said in the statement issued by the White House. ""On behalf of the government of the United States, I offer my condolences to his family and to the Korean people."" Roh hoped to leave a legacy of improved relations with North Korea. Just before he left the presidency, Roh became the first South Korean leader to cross the demilitarized zone and meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Roh believed in the ""sunshine policy"" of his predecessor, Kim Dae-Jung, that sought to engage the north, and Roh also promised aid. Roh spoke to CNN correspondent Sohn Jie-ae just after that trip and said he thought his legacy would be to ensure that many others crossed the demilitarized zone after him. The current South Korean president, Lee Myung-Bak, however, takes a harder line on the north and has so far not continued Roh's efforts.

"North Korea has no athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games, and skiing is not the first thing that springs to mind when thinking about the isolated nation. That's why tour operators are billing North Korea's luxury new Masik Pass as ""the most exotic ski resort on Earth."" Located in Kangwon province, the hotel and resort -- the only one of its kind in the country -- opened January 1 after a series of reported setbacks. Earlier this year, CNN Travel reported on the experience of one of the first visitors to the resort, Simon Cockerell, from Beijing-based Koryo Tours. More recently we spoke to another visitor, snowboarding journalist Jean Lee, whose video of her Masik trip is shown above. Surprised by the caliber of the equipment at the resort, Lee also notes that she got to chat to ordinary North Koreans -- because her government minders couldn't ski. Pyongyang made a failed bid to co-host the Summer Olympics when Seoul held the games in 1988. Who knows? Maybe Masik signals North Korea's intent to try again when its southern neighbor hosts the winter games in 2018. What follows is an edited version of our story on Simon Cockerell's visit to Masik earlier this year. Koryo Tours is one of the few foreign tour companies operating in North Korea. 'Fancy and comfortable' Cockerell found Masik Pass to be ""fancy and comfortable."" Along with 11 ski runs, there are 120 hotel rooms housed in two buildings, a swimming pool, bars, cafÃ©s, billiard tables, a karaoke room, a steam room and a dry sauna. Local tour guides speak English but don't tend to ski; for the large number of ski instructors, you'd need a translator. The resort is ""clearly built for locals,"" Cockerell said, although it was expected to draw some foreigners coming with tour operators such as his own. ""The number of local Korean skiers was a surprise, considering that [before Masik opened] there was just one ski slope in the country -- and in a very remote and hard to reach area,"" Cockerell said. At the time of writing, foreigners couldn't book at Masik Pass directly but would have to come with a group tour. Controversial construction . ""We're aware of the controversies surrounding [Masik],"" wrote Cockerell on the Koryo Tours blog. ""It's a highly expensive construction project that many see as economically doubtful.""

"Venezuela's Supreme Court rejected a ruling from an international human rights court Monday, all but assuring opposition candidate Leopoldo Lopez will not challenge President Hugo Chavez in next year's election. The country's top court ruled against the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which in September came out in support of Lopez's fight to run for office. Chavez's government accused Lopez of corruption during his tenure as the mayor of the municipality of Chacao, and through an administrative procedure barred him in 2008 from running for public office for six years. Lopez argued he had been unjustly banned, and the international court agreed. Venezuela, however, will not abide by the ruling. The Supreme Court released a statement Monday calling it ""unfeasible."" Curiously, the court also stressed that the ban against Lopez is ""administrative,"" and ""not political."" So in theory he could still compete in elections, though he would not be allowed to hold office. Lopez had been considered one of the top contenders to challenge Chavez in next year's presidential election. At issue are two accusations made against him -- one in 1998 when he was an analyst for the state-run PDVSA oil company, and another in 2002 for alleged budgetary modifications while he was mayor. Lopez was never convicted of any crimes. He isn't the only one barred from competing in Venezuelan elections. In the run-up to the pivotal 2008 elections, hundreds of politicians were prevented from running, the vast majority from parties opposed to Chavez. Lopez, in 2008, was running for mayor of Caracas, the South American nation's capital. Chavez has ruled Venezuela for more than 12 years. Despite his ongoing battle with cancer, the charismatic president has said he plans to seek re-election.","Country's Supreme Court rejects international ruling .

"Can God be found on the Appalachian Trail? Long before the Puritans of the Plymouth Colony laid a lasting religious claim to the Appalachian peaks, Eastern Woodland Indians claimed those heights as the first residences of the supernatural beings of their religious traditions. Then the Puritans arrived. Colonists seeking religious independence from established churches and the religious mainstream moved into mountain valleys at the margins of the frontier. Certain sites along the trail route became associated with the story of Exodus from the Bible. And in this version, America was the new ""Promised Land."" 12 things you may not have known about the Appalachian Trail . The American Romantics, including the Transcendentalist writers and the Hudson River Valley painters, visited the Appalachian peaks seeking both a deeper spiritual experience and subjects for their work. Benton MacKaye, a Harvard-trained planner, proposed the trail as a respite from the physical and mental impacts of industrialization and urbanization in 1921. Walking the entire length of the trail, between Springer Mountain, Georgia and Mount Katahdin, Maine, has become a distinctly American pilgrimage, weaving through the religious roots of the nation, and providing stunning views of Eastern terrains ranging from isolated valleys to lines of blue-tinted mountains. Mount Katahdin, Maine . The 5,268-foot-high Mount Katahdin (which means greatest mountain in Penobscot) is the home of Thunders, giants with eyebrows and cheeks of stone, who sometimes invite hunters into their home within the mountain to instruct them about nature, according to some Native American beliefs. In the Passamamaquoddy and Penobscot versions, the Thunders, while powerful, are not malicious and mean no harm. But European immigrants turned the spirit of the mountain solely into Pamola (or Pomola), a demonic being, with a moose head, eagles' wings and feet and a human body.  Henry David Thoreau, on a failed attempt to bushwhack all the way to the summit, declared that Pomola  is ""always angry with those who climb to the summit of Ktaadn."" Hudson River painter Frederic Edwin Church, having a more positive attitude, bathed Katahdin in the divine light of the Calvinist creator God in his colorful depictions of the Maine wilderness. Hit the trail: 7 gorgeous hikes . Today, Katahdin is the northern terminus of the trail. It's celebrated in hundreds of photographs of end-to-end hikers finishing their backcountry pilgrimage by the sign at the top. Mount Washington, New Hampshire . Originally named Agiocochook, which means ""home of the Great Spirit"" or ""home of the spirit of the forest"" in the Abenaki language, Mount Washington in New Hampshire is the highest peak in New England at 6,288 feet. Native Americans identified Agiocochook as the place where a Native American family fled to the top of the mountain to avoid a great flood, analogous to Noah's landing on Mount Ararat.  Plymouth Colony leader John Winthrop reported that the Abenaki were afraid to climb the peak because it was where Manitou lived. Manitou is a universal spirit which, according to Native American belief, permeates all living creatures and natural objects. A federalist survey expedition circa 1784 renamed the peak after George Washington, the new republic's Moses, who led the people to freedom from royal oppression. That reference associated the peak with the Biblical Pisgah where Moses had his vision of Canaan. The Hudson River painters produced multiple canvasses of the ethereal mountain, where an inscrutable God ruled the heights, and divine providence flowed down the slopes and watered the pastures and farmsteads of the Promised Land below. The trail traverses Mount Washington along the crest, through alpine meadows above the timberline. (It's a short side hike to the summit.) It offers panoramic views and some of the most unpredictable and dangerous weather in the Eastern United States, including dense fog and hypothermia-inducing summer sleet. Mount Greylock, Massachusetts . The Berkshires have long been the terrain of philosophical innovators and religious nonconformists. Transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau climbed to the top of Mount Greylock in 1844 to meet the sunrise, and view ""an undulating country of clouds...as we might see in dreams, with all the delights of paradise.""  Herman Melville's home Arrowhead (open for visitors), looks out on Mount Greylock. The humpback outline of the mountain reputedly inspired his description of the inscrutable and God-like Moby Dick. Today's trail hiker can walk up to the summit of Mount Greylock and also appreciate Mount Greylock from the Cobbles, a quartzite outcrop on the trail. Then the trail goes through the classic New England town of Cheshire. Also at the base of Greylock is the Adams Friends Meeting House (circa 1782). That's about a three-mile hike from the trail or five miles by car from Cheshire. In nearby Williamstown, Transcendentalist appreciation of natural form influenced the design of the Williams College campus. Williams College students cleared the first hiking trail to the spruce-covered summit of Mount Greylock in 1830. Shaker Farm: Tyringham, Massachusetts . The trail crosses the remains of one of the Shakers' former utopian colonies at Tyringham, Massachusetts. Shaker founder Mother Ann Lee brought her followers from England to America in 1774, 10 years before she died. More formally known as the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing, the Shakers established one of their first colonies in Tyringham in 1792. In Tyringham, the celibate members lived in dormitories. They were known as Shakers because of their vigorous religious dances. The Tyringham Shakers selected a bald-topped mountain as their Mount Horeb, and marched to its summit following their celebratory religious feasts. The trail skirts well-crafted stone walls, provides views out over the patchwork of fields in the Tyringham valley, and crosses Jerusalem Street, where the remaining Shaker buildings and Shaker Pond, now in private hands, may be observed from the road (not open to the public). Potomac River crossing at Harpers Ferry, Virginia/West Virginia . Approaching Harpers Ferry from Virginia, hikers cross over the Shenandoah River using a vehicle bridge. As they leave town and head for Maryland, they cross the Potomac River beside an active track on a railroad bridge. In the days of the Underground Railroad, escaped slaves had to cross the Potomac (this dangerous ""Jordan"") during their Exodus to freedom. They waded and swam from island to island or slipped across hidden in a boat by a sympathetic ferryman. On the northern bank, the trail passes the location of John Brown's 1859 abolitionist raid on the federal armory, and the fire house which served as his ""fort."" North of Harpers Ferry, the trail looks down on the peaceful agricultural valley surrounding Antietam, where the National Park Service has reconstructed the meeting house of the German Baptists, known as  Dunkers, on the Civil War battlefield. Dunkers, who were baptized three times in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, resisted slavery. The house served as a hospital during the battle of Antietam, one of the bloodiest battles in American history, when 23,000 were killed, wounded or went missing. Clingmans Dome, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina . The highest point on the entire trail at 6,643 feet, Clingmans Dome (Kuwo-i or Mulberry Place in Cherokee)  is the home of the White Bear, chief of the bears, according to Cherokee tradition. The Cherokee treated animals as members of neighboring tribes, who celebrated seasonal dances in their townhouses, just as the Cherokee did. Hikers can enjoy the southern-most Appalachian spruce fir forest, and have the chance to view, not just numerous black bears, but endemic species such as the red-cheeked salamander and Fraser fir. Heading south from Clingmans Dome, it's nearly 30 miles by trails or road to visit Native American museums. There is a replica of a Cherokee council house (the central religious building) at the Oconaluftee Indian Village (open May to October), and visitors can learn more about Cherokee religious traditions at the Museum of the Cherokee (year round) in the town of Cherokee, North Carolina. Blood Mountain, Georgia . Nearly 30 miles north of the southern terminus of the trail at Springer Mountain, Georgia, Blood Mountain is known in Cherokee tradition as a townhouse of the Nunne'hi, a race of immortals. They are friendly to humans, assist lost hunters and support the Cherokee in battle. These gentle inhabitants of the heights love music, and local residents still report hearing the sounds of their drums and dances. Several bald mountains or peaks with distinctive rock formations along the southern stretch of the trail are also associated with the Cherokee monster slayer tale of the giant horned lizard, the Utenka. A Shawnee medicine man pursued the ferocious beast, from nearby Brasstown Bald, Georgia, through Indian Gap and the Chimneys in the Smokies, in Tennessee to its home on Big Bald on the Tennessee/North Carolina border. The open summits offer spectacular seasonal flora displays, including blooms of Catawba rhododendrons, azaleas and mountain laurels. Since a hiker can still stretch out on the grass or ascend above the trees on outcrops, the summits are among the best places to enjoy the ridges turning blue at sunset or to experience the August Perseid meteor shower, without the background lighting of civilization.","The Appalachian Trail weaves through the religious roots of the nation .

"Shailene Woodley and Theo James weren't expecting a frenzied mass of ""Divergent"" fans to greet them at a premiere in early March. Well, they'd better get used to it. The two stars of the new film, set for release Friday, were the focus of a swarm of at least 200 fans, mostly female, who screeched and cheered for their heroes at a special Atlanta screening. Woodley wore Alexander McQueen; James, an affable Brit, signed autographs. Both answered questions. The fans ate it up. And why not? ""Divergent"" is being touted as the new ""Hunger Games."" That's no surprise, given its action-oriented female heroine, youthful cast and post-apocalyptic setting. The film is based on the first book in a best-selling trilogy by Veronica Roth, a series that also earned comparisons to Suzanne Collins' ""Hunger Games"" works. If ""Divergent"" does half as well as the ""Hunger Games"" films -- the most recent of which, ""Catching Fire,"" topped the 2013 box office and made $865 million worldwide -- its backers will be very happy. Which is why Woodley -- perhaps best known for performances in the film ""The Descendants"" and the TV series ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"" -- is receiving Jennifer Lawrence-type attention. She's on the current cover of Marie Claire, has been the subject of press releases noting her choice of designer clothing, and is being mentioned in gossip-style headlines mentioning the age of her first kiss (15, incidentally) and her love of ""Descendants"" co-star George Clooney. Woodley, 22, says she's a little surprised by the response. ""I don't know much about that world. None of us really engage in social media,"" she said at a CNN Center interview the day after the Atlanta screening. ""So last night was sort of a shock. 'Oh, other people know about this movie, too.' "" James, 29, hasn't escaped the microscope. The actor is also the subject of publicists' e-mail blasts and has been romantically linked to Woodley in British tabloid headlines. Though Woodley told Teen Vogue that she hasn't had a boyfriend in five years, the two do have an easy rapport. James said he welcomes the fans' passion. ""It's good to be involved in something that has a bunch of people invested in the material already,"" he said. 'You have to make bold decisions' Ah, passion. It certainly doesn't hurt ticket sales -- and neither does the tittle-tattle. ""Divergent"" has been a hot property ever since author Roth sold the rights to the trilogy before she even graduated college. The story is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago in which the culture has been divided into five factions: Abnegation, who believe in altruism; Amity, the peaceful ones; Erudite, the intellectuals; Candor, the bluntly honest; and Dauntless, the fearless warrior class. Beatrice ""Tris"" Prior -- the character played by Woodley -- is the daughter of two Abnegation parents. At 16, like everyone else, she takes an aptitude test to find the most appropriate faction for her personality. She finds out she's ""Divergent,"" with equal aptitude for more than one faction. However, since such a classification is considered threatening to society, she's told to keep the information to herself. She ends up joining Dauntless, much to the disappointment of her parents -- ""faction before blood,"" goes one of the culture's mottoes -- and undergoes a boot camp at which she meets Four (James), one of the camp leaders. From there the plot concerns Tris' attempts to fit in -- or not -- Four's secrets (there's a connection with a political leader) and run-ins with the Erudite chief, Jeanine Matthews, played by a chilling Kate Winslet. The book series, which also includes the sequels ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant,"" has sold more than 10 million copies. More importantly, it's got that powerful fan base. There are several fan sites devoted to the series on the Internet, and Roth has more than 200,000 Twitter followers. Such a following can both help and hurt a movie. Certainly there will be huge crowds awaiting ""Divergent's"" midnight showing, but if Tris and Four (and the ruins of Chicago, which are their own character in the movie) don't live up to their vision, the backlash could be fierce. James, however, says that comes with the territory. ""You have to make your own decisions based on what you perceive the character to be,"" said James. ""You have to make bold decisions, stick with them, and whatever will be, will be."" Your guide to film adaptations in 2014 . 'Everyone is multi-dimensional' The two had plenty of help getting into character. They had their own boot camp to get into physical shape, and did some of their own stunts -- though stuntpeople stood in for the big falls, and special effects helped with certain details, like a zip-line run off Chicago's John Hancock Center. They did go up in the big Ferris wheel on the Navy Pier, which Woodley remembers as a special night. ""It was a full moon, so we got to watch the moon go across the sky and go up and down this crazy 75-foot ladder. It was just magic,"" she said. ""It's one of those moments where you wonder how you got this life."" Indeed, Woodley continues enjoying ""this life."" She says she's had good mentors in actors such as Clooney, Laura Dern and Winslet, people who ""show up early, show up prepared."" ""They all have in common the fact that they love the art of acting, still. They love being on a movie set,"" she said. As ""Divergent's"" release nears, the two -- along with youthful co-stars including Miles Teller, Jai Courtney and Ansel Elgort -- will see if they can hold on to their love of acting in the midst of a celebrity culture that would like to reduce them to gossip fodder as superficial as members of ""Divergent's"" single-minded factions. History offers mixed lessons: The shrewd and award-winning Lawrence and the ""Harry Potter"" kids have apparently succeeded. Other young actors burn out as quickly as they rise. James -- a veteran of several British TV series, including an episode of ""Downton Abbey"" -- seems intent on making the most of the opportunity to widen his horizons. As pre-production begins on ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant,"" he's already done two other films: A version of Martin Amis' novel ""London Fields"" and a film called ""Franny"" from indie director Andrew Renzi. He may be living by one of the lessons of the film. ""One of the key messages of the film is that no one can be categorized,"" he said. ""Everyone is multidimensional."" And Woodley? She's taking it easy for now. But, like the quietly astute Tris, she understands that you don't present all that you are. ""I think it's important to have your own secrets, preserve your own personal space,"" she said. ""You don't give all of yourself away.""

"Republican Rep. Tom Cotton has defeated Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor in Arkansas, according to a CNN projection. The win is one of six seats Republicans need to pick up to regain control of the Senate. Like other Democrats in contentious Senate races this cycle, Pryor has struggled to distance himself from President Barack Obama, who is hugely unpopular in the state -- only 34% of voters in Arkansas approved of Obama, according to a CNN/ORC poll. Even Arkansas' favorite son couldn't give Pryor enough of a boost. President Bill Clinton had swung through the state more than a half-dozen times this cycle, again stumping with Pryor in the state this weekend. But Pryor's struggles seemed to go beyond what any surrogate could fix, with the two-term Arkansas senator stumbling on a softball question on the president's handling of the Ebola disease. ""Um ... I would say that ... it's hard to know, uh, because I haven't heard the latest briefing on that to know all the details -- I mean, I read the paper and all but,"" Pryor said in an interview last month. And that came just over a month after his campaign ran an ad attacking his opponent for voting ""against preparing America for pandemics like Ebola,"" which was widely panned as misleading. Cotton faced his most stinging criticism over his opposition to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. Pryor slammed Cotton for voting against the bill in a brutal campaign and that claimed Cotton doesn't want ""to protect women and children."" Cotton defended his vote against the bill, calling the law ""too broad"" in scope. But while 138 Republicans also joined Cotton in voting against the final version of the bill, Cotton also voted against an earlier Republican proposal -- the only Arkansas Republican to do so.","After just one term in the House, Republican Tom Cotton is headed for the Senate .

"Expect your Thanksgiving flight to be packed. Nearly 24 million passengers are expected to fly this Thanksgiving travel season, an increase of about 150,000 passengers over last year, industry trade group Airlines for America predicted. With fewer planes flying, airplanes could be close to 90% full on the busiest travel days between Friday, November 16, and Tuesday, November 27, the trade group predicted. The busiest days are likely to be Wednesday, November 21 (2.3 million travelers), Sunday, November 25 (2.4 million travelers) and Monday, November 26 (2.3 million travelers). Despite reports that planes are going to be nearly full during the Thanksgiving holiday, some 78% of travelers have not booked their airline, hotel or car rentals yet, according to a Hotwire survey released Wednesday. Don't wait to book your flights . ""Thanksgiving airfare and hotel prices are up compared to last year, and they're likely to increase even more as we get closer to the holiday,"" Clem Bason, president of the Hotwire Group, said in a statement. Book now, advises Hotwire, because fares are only likely to increase. Travelers who haven't yet bought their plane tickets might consider flying on Thanksgiving Day, November 22, when only 1.3 million people are expected to fly, and returning home on Friday, November 23, with only 1.6 million other passengers, according to Airlines for America estimates. Procrastinators take note: Holiday airfares are up . Also consider booking at alternate airports that may offer lower fares. While travelers continue to complain about airlines charging for everything from more leg room to window seats to snacks, airlines would have lost money this year without those fees, according to Airlines for America vice president and chief economist John Heimlich. Jet fuel prices continue to rise . Although airlines have seen a 5.6% increase in revenues in the third quarter of 2012 compared with the same time last year, Heimlich said that the 10 largest Unites States airlines have also faced costs that are 6.2% higher, reducing profits to a margin of 0.2% -- or about 50 cents per passenger. Without passengers paying an average of $8 each in ancillary fees on domestic, round-trip tickets, airlines would have been losing money, Heimlich said in a morning conference call. The price of jet fuel is a key factor in higher costs, he said. It has averaged $3.08 per gallon, more than last year's record high of $3 per gallon. Airlines have cut the number of flights and grounded some aircraft to reduce expenses. Those cuts in domestic service are likely to continue into the new year, with Airlines for America predicting a 2.4% cut in the number of domestic airline flights and a 1.3% cut in the number of domestic airline seats for the first quarter of 2013, compared with the first quarter of 2012.

"(CNN)A federal judge on Wednesday denied a request to push back the trial of alleged Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who'd requested a delay after last week's terrorist attacks in France. In his order, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole wrote that his ""detailed review of juror questionnaires ... has so far confirmed, rather than undermined, my judgment that a fair and impartial jury can and will be chosen to determine the issues in this case."" Tsarnaev is accused of plotting with his brother and carrying out an attack near the finish line of the Boston Marathon that killed three people, wounded more than 260 and spurred a massive manhunt that terrorized the city for days in 2013. Jury selection, which began last week, will resume Thursday. 13 things to keep in mind as the trial starts . Tsarnaev's attorneys asked Tuesday for the court to push back this process for at least one month, citing the Charlie Hebdo massacre and two other attacks in France last week that left 17 people dead, not including the three slain men purportedly behind the violence. ""This measure would allow some time for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events -- and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case -- to diminish,"" the lawyers wrote, noting how media outlets such as CNN, USA Today and the Boston Herald tied these attacks to the Boston Marathon bombings. The attorneys talked about the ""supposed parallels"" between what happened in France and years ago around Boston, including ""the fact that the suspects were brothers, that they reportedly were influenced by the lectures and writings of Anwar al-Awlaki, that they were 'home-grown' terrorists, and that they attacked civilians in a Western city."" ""It will take time for Boston-area residents ... to come to a reasoned evaluation of what, if anything, the events in Paris signify about the surviving alleged perpetrator of the Boston Marathon bombing,"" Tsarnaev's defense team argued. ""That process of reflection should come before -- not after -- the court has had its only opportunity to question potential jurors about possible bias and prejudgment of the defendant in this case."" The Boston case has drawn a great deal of international attention, though that spotlight is particularly intense in Massachusetts. The Boston Marathon is a venerated institution there, one that was shaken badly after two bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other on  April 15, 2013, near the race's finish line. A dramatic manhunt ensued that culminated four days later with the death of suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, and the capture hours later of his brother Dzhokhar, who's now 21. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later charged with 30 federal counts, including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. He pleaded not guilty in July 2013. CNN's Dana Ford contributed to this report.","A judge says an impartial jury can be seated in the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .

"After beating former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open, rising tennis star Eugenie Bouchard is one step closer to making her dreams come true.

"(CNN)The Department of Homeland Security is increasing security checks at American airports because of concerns over new bomb-making instructions released by al Qaeda in Yemen (AQAP), the terrorist group which U.S. intelligence agencies believe may have been behind the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, U.S. officials tell CNN. They say the new measures will feature additional random checks after passengers make it through security and will include passenger pat-downs, bag checks and hand swabs for traces of explosives. The new issue of AQAP's Inspire magazine, released on December 24, featured instructions on how to build what AQAP called a ""hidden bomb"" from easily purchasable materials. It also included directions on how would-be lone wolves worldwide can evade airport security scanners and sniffer dogs. In recent months, AQAP's leadership has repeatedly stated hitting the United States is a priority. The new issue of Inspire made clear it viewed lone wolf attacks by its supporters in the West as an increasingly important part of these efforts. The magazine claimed the recipe was for a simplified version of the device used in an attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger jet over Detroit five years ago. On Christmas Day 2009, Omar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called ""underwear bomber,"" attempted to detonate an explosive device built by Ibrahim al Asiri, AQAP's master bomb-maker, on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The main charge -- a white powdery explosive called PETN which airport security scanners at Amsterdam airport did not detect -- failed to detonate as the plane approached Detroit. The new recipe does not involve the manufacture of PETN, a substance difficult for extremists to manufacture or obtain in the West. Instead, it contains similarities to a bomb formula put out by the group in the first issue of Inspire in 2010 called ""Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom."" That recipe was downloaded and used by the Boston bombers and several other extremists in plots on both sides of the Atlantic. In the new issue, AQAP suggested its external operation division had greenlighted sharing the recipe because al Asiri and his team had developed a new generation of more sophisticated devices. What is AQAP? In 2012 Saudi and Western intelligence foiled a plot by AQAP to bomb a U.S. plane with an updated version of the underwear device. It is not clear if the recipe is viable or if it would have enough explosive power to endanger an aircraft. Nor is it clear if the device would have any chance of getting through explosive scanners at airport security. U.S. officials and explosive detection experts tell CNN that advanced detection equipment, including body scanners, should catch even previously hard-to-detect explosives like PETN, even if detection experts say they don't provide a 100% guarantee.  But U.S. officials say advanced body-scanning technology is not available in some smaller U.S. airports. The authors of the latest issue of Inspire magazine claimed that if enough lone wolves launch attempts with their suggested device, some would get through. The magazine stated that even if the devices were detected or malfunctioned they would bring terror to the West. The key aim, the group stated, was to undermine the American economy. It listed several American airline companies, as well as British and French carriers as targets. It said that lone wolves should claim responsibility by writing emails timed to be distributed after their operations.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has launched a terrorism crackdown one day after a series of explosions in an open-air market killed dozens in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, the country's state news agency, Xinhua said Friday. Without any details, the report said authorities had undertaken a ""one-year crackdown on violent terrorist activities"" in the volatile region after blasts in the heavily policed city of Urumqi killed at least 39 people and wounded more than 90, according to state media. The number of dead does not include the attackers. The state news agency reported Friday that five attackers were responsible for the blasts; four were killed in the explosions, and a fifth was arrested Thursday. They were identified through DNA testing, Xinhua said. In Urumqi, authorities tightened security checks at entry ports in an attempt to curb weapons smuggling, including inspections of individuals, luggage, transport facilities and postal deliveries at land border crossings, Xinhua reported Friday. After visiting the injured and the scene of the explosions, Guo Shengkun, minister of public security, called for severe punishment for those responsible, state media said. President Xi Jinping also called for the terrorists behind it to be ""severely"" punished. Two SUVs slammed into shoppers gathered at the market in Urumqi at 7:50 a.m. Thursday, and explosives were flung out of the vehicles, Xinhua said. The vehicles then exploded, according to the news agency. Some of the photos circulating on social media suggested a hellish scene, with bodies strewn on the ground amid burning wreckage. Others showed flames and smoke billowing out of the end of a tree-lined street guarded by police. 'An enormous sound' ""I heard an enormous sound, then I looked out from my balcony,"" said a resident of a building near the explosion who would only give his surname, Shan. He told CNN that trees obscured much of his view of the scene, but that he ""could see there was chaos, with people injured."" Many of the victims caught in the blasts were elderly people who regularly visited the morning market, Xinhua reported. ""It's mainly people coming to trade vegetables, especially the elderly who get up early and buy vegetables to cook,"" Shan said. The U.S. government condemned the attack. ""This is a despicable and outrageous act of violence against innocent civilians, and the United States resolutely opposes all forms of terrorism,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement. String of recent attacks . Chinese authorities have stepped up security measures in Xinjiang in recent months amid a series of attacks within the region and in other major Chinese cities. On Wednesday, Xinhua reported that 39 people had been sentenced to prison in the past two months for ""inciting violence"" in Xinjiang. But Thursday's devastating blasts suggest the government is facing a foe determined to wreak havoc. The market attack comes less than a month after an explosion hit a train station in Urumqi, killing three people and wounding 79 others. The April 30 blast occurred just after Xi had wrapped up a visit to the region. Ethnic tensions . Chinese officials have linked a mass knife attack in March that killed 29 people at a train station in the southwestern city of Kunming to Islamic separatists from Xinjiang. They have also blamed separatists for an October attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in which a car rammed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames, killing two tourists and the three occupants of the vehicle. The knife-wielding assailants in the Kunming attack and the people in the car that hit Tiananmen were identified as Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group from Xinjiang. Ethnic tensions between Uyghurs and Han Chinese people, millions of whom have migrated to resource-rich Xinjiang in recent decades, have repeatedly boiled over into deadly riots and clashes with authorities in recent years. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment over harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. The Han are the predominant ethnic group in China, making up more than 90% of the overall population. Shift in targets . The pattern of ethnic violence in the region goes back decades, according to James Leibold, an expert in ethnic relations in China at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia. ""But what's new, and what I think is significant, is that we have a shift in target,"" Leibold said. ""We have a targeting of innocent civilians, places where innocent civilians gather -- an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers."" The other change is that the violence has ""seeped outside"" the borders of Xinjiang into other parts of China, he said. It remains unclear who is behind the recent high-profile attacks. Chinese officials have pointed to a murky separatist group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, which they have blamed for violent acts in the past. East Turkestan is the name used by many Uyghur groups to refer to Xinjiang. But analysts are divided about the extent of the that group's activities and its links to global terrorist networks such as al Qaeda. ""Generally, the government response is to blame terrorists without providing many details,"" Leibold said. ""So I suspect it's going to be very difficult to get to the bottom of this incident like previous ones.""

"Days after Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo disintegrated above California, killing one of its co-pilots, Virgin founder Richard Branson says making commercial space travel a reality is worth the risks involved. The accident killed co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injured co-pilot Peter Siebold, who managed to parachute to the ground. Branson paid tribute to Alsbury in an interview with CNN's Poppy Harlow on Monday. ""He was an extremely brave man -- as all test pilots are, extremely brave people. He had a young family, he was married and his family loved him enormously,"" Branson said. ""But he was a test pilot, and test pilots are trying to discover things that 400 engineers and technicians on the ground can't necessarily see on the ground. And the test pilots push the aircraft to the limit before, finally, members of the traveling public are allowed on it."" Asked if, in light of Friday's accident, he stood by his comment  to Harlow on the space program last year that ""unless you risk something, the world stands still,"" Branson told her that he did. ""Yes, the risk is worth it,"" he said. ""Mike would have been the first to say that. I'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that, but test pilots would say that, because the risk they're taking, they know the importance of what they're doing,"" he said. ""We've got to go through the difficult testing stage of creating a space line in order to make it safe for travelers who want to travel on that space line in the years ahead, and we will persevere and we will succeed."" What caused the crash? SpaceShipTwo disintegrated just two minutes after separating from the jet-powered aircraft that carried it aloft Friday. At the time, the space plane was about 45,000 feet above the ground and about 20 miles northeast of Mojave, California. A team of 13 to 15 investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board will be in the Mojave Desert for about a week. But analyzing the data from the test aircraft will take much longer, and the investigation may take up to a year. Opinion: The truth about launching spaceships . Branson warned against speculating before the board releases its findings. ""The British press have, I think rather irresponsibly, speculated that it might've been rockets exploding, it might have been fuel tanks exploding, in fact there might have been an explosion. ""The NTSB have firmly ruled all that out and have made it clear that they're coming down to one particular thing that they think might have happened. But if you don't mind, I'm going to leave it to the NTSB to let you know exactly what it is they think happened, and then we'll wait for their definitive decision,"" he told Harlow. Friday's flight was the first to use a new plastic-based fuel, something that CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien has said could have affected the plane's stability, despite the fuel tanks being found intact. O'Brien said that Virgin Galactic had ""consistently underestimated the risk involved."" Branson denied this, saying that 400 ""of the best engineers in the world"" were working on the project and that the risks were similar to those taken by people flying across the Atlantic in the 1920s and '30s. 'Feathering' On Sunday, the NTSB revealed two clues about what went wrong, both involving the spacecraft's ""feathering,"" a process used to stabilize and slow the spacecraft down toward Earth. During feathering, two pieces on the back of the vehicle -- the ""feathers"" -- lift up perpendicular to the spaceship, making the vehicle look like it's arching its back as it descends. But on Friday, ""the feather lock-unlock lever was moved by the co-pilot from the locked position to the unlocked position"" prematurely, the NTSB said. On top of that, the feathers aren't supposed to move until a separate feathering handle is activated. No one adjusted that handle; yet the feathers were still deployed, NTSB acting Chairman Christopher Hart said. But Hart stressed that it was unclear whether pilot error, mechanical problems or another possibility caused the spacecraft to break apart in the air. ""We are still a long way from finding a cause,"" Hart said. ""We are months and months away."" Despite a debris field spanning 5 miles, investigators have found almost all the parts of the spacecraft needed for the investigation, Hart said. Investigation may take up to a year . Veteran pilot killed . A memorial fund has been set up for Alsbury's family. He worked at Scaled Composites, the company that partnered with Virgin on the test flight program, and logged more than 1,600 hours as a test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft. Analysis: Will space accidents deter pioneer tourists? Scaled Composites said Sunday that co-pilot Siebold -- the company's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors. ""We remain focused on supporting the families of the two pilots and all of our employees, as well as the agencies investigating the accident,"" Scaled Composites said. NTSB investigators have yet to interview Siebold. ""We have not because doctors did not recommend we do an interview at this stage,"" Hart said. SpaceShipTwo helmed by experienced pilots when flight failed . Future of the program . For years, Virgin Galactic had planned to sell trips in which SpaceShipTwo would transport passengers about 62 miles above Earth -- the beginning of outer space -- and let them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to the ground. Virgin Galactic planned to send paying customers on SpaceShipTwo as early as next year and has sold more than 700 tickets, each costing more than $250,000, for future flights. Deadly day for space tourism -- but future 'rests' on such days, official says . Several celebrities have already signed up, including Justin Bieber, Ashton Kutcher, Leonardo DiCaprio and Stephen Hawking. Friday's tragedy was not the first fatal accident to hit the Virgin Galactic space program. In 2007, three employees of Scaled Composites were killed during testing in the Mojave Desert. Sources told CNN that they had been testing components of a new rocket motor for SpaceShipTwo.","Virgin Galactic founder lauds test pilot killed as an ""extremely brave man""

"San Diego (CNN)As parents, we want to be careful to protect our children from the wrong influences. Just because someone is famous and has a following among a certain segment of society doesn't mean they're a good role model for youth. One group in particular comes to mind. They're essentially minimally talented narcissists who are starved for public attention, and they will say and do shocking and inappropriate things to get it. Truth be known, many of them are not the best people in the world. I speak, of course, of politicians â and, in particular, of Mike Huckabee. The former Arkansas governor and GOP presidential candidate is rumored to be interested â along with about 14 other Republican hopefuls â in making a White House bid in 2016. It will be a long, hard slog for Huckabee, a second-tier candidate, who â if he enters the race â is likely to find himself battling former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for the votes of evangelical Christians. Republicans believe that President Obama is in over his head, and they want to restore adult supervision to the White House. Huckabee, who until recently hosted a cable television show, has a juvenile habit of shooting from the lip with commentary that is unplugged and unfiltered. In the process of making the press rounds for his new book, ""God, Guns, Grits and Gravy,"" Huckabee has already said a few things â about the first family and pop star Beyonce Knowles â that are hostile, hurtful, hateful and harmful. In fact, in a recent interview for People magazine, he didn't just step on one minefield but a whole lot of them. Concerning the Obamas, Huckabee is shocked that the President and first lady Michelle Obama allow their daughters, Malia and Sasha, to be part of Beyonce's fan base. As an ordained Baptist minister, Huckabee doesn't approve of some of the performer's songs and on-stage behavior. Politician. Talk show host. Minister. And now, music critic. Huckabee does get around. The Republican sees a conflict between how conscientious the Obamas are about most things concerning their daughters, and this one area where the girls have the freedom to idolize one of their favorite entertainers. LZ: Beyonce, what have you done? ""I don't understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything â how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school, and making sure they're kind of sheltered and shielded from so many things,"" Huckabee told the magazine. ""And yet they don't see anything that might not be suitable for either a preteen or a teen in some of the lyrical content and choreography of Beyonce."" Huckabee was just getting warmed up. His next target: Jay Z, music mogul and Beyonce's husband. About Jay Z, Huckabee wonders: ""Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?"" No. He did not just go there. What a tin ear. For someone who communicates for a living, you would think that Huckabee would know enough to avoid taking one of the most successful African-American businessmen in the country and comparing him to â of all things â a pimp. Really? While Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky talk about the importance of reaching out to African-Americans, Huckabee may have reached a new low in terms of offending them. So where did Huckabee go wrong? First, if you have a problem with the President, take it to him but leave his kids out of it. Second, if you want to come across to the rest of America as a serious candidate, try talking about serious things and avoid these Dan Quayle-Murphy Brown moments where you try to score points off something in popular culture. Third, if you don't see the problem with comparing a prominent and successful African-American businessman with a pimp, you had better check your common sense tank but you're running low. Fourth, leave the music reviews to the professionals, and, the next time you decide to attack a performer, try choosing an outlier and not someone so embedded in the mainstream that she has sold more than 75 million records â just as a solo artist. And fifth, you can critique the other side's policies all day long but you should really skip the parenting advice since it's one thing to accuse someone of being a bad president, and quite another to say they're a bad parent. You just don't go there. Even in the brass-knuckled world of politics, there are rules to be followed and lines that should not be crossed. Huckabee crossed one. For that, he ought to be ashamed. And he ought to be apologetic. Then he ought to be quiet.","Mike Huckabee is rumored to be interested in running for president in 2016 .
So why is he criticizing President Obama's parenting style, Beyonce and Jay Z?"
"(CNN) -- She tackled one of the toughest jobs any nurse could take on -- treating a highly contagious Ebola patient. And somehow along the way, she contracted the deadly virus herself. Now, Nina Pham tries to recover in the same Dallas hospital where she works. Here's what we know about the 26-year-old Texan: . 'I'm doing well' On Tuesday, Pham said she was ""doing well"" in a statement released by her employer, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas. ""I'm doing well and want to thank everyone for their kind wishes and prayers,"" she said, according to the hospital. ""I am blessed by the support of family and friends and am blessed to be cared for by the best team of doctors and nurses in the world."" Pham was in good condition, said Wendell Watson, spokesman for Texas Health Resources. She's Vietnamese-American . Pham grew up in a Vietnamese family in Fort Worth, Texas. She didn't go far away for college, attending Texas Christian University in the same city. Pham graduated with a nursing degree in 2010. And just two months ago, she received certification in critical care nursing, which deals specifically with life-threatening problems. She's very religious . ""She is a very devoted Catholic, and always puts the other people's interests ahead of her own,"" said family friend Tom Ha, who has known Pham since she was in eighth grade. Ha taught Pham in Bible class at his church. ""She comes from a family that is (of) a very strong faith,"" he said. So he wasn't surprised ""that she (did) more than her duty called for in order to make sure the patient had a chance to survive."" When Pham called the church to let members know she had contracted Ebola, ""everybody at the church"" began crying, he said. How did she contract Ebola? She loves her job . Ha, the family friend, said nursing isn't just a job for Pham -- it's a calling. ""I think that she takes it (as) more than a career. I think it's a vocation, because her family, from the time that we met, they always serve other people,"" he said. When she was accepted into nursing school, she was really excited, a family friend told The Dallas Morning News. ""Her mom would tell her how it's really hard and a bunch of her friends quit doing it because it was so stressful,"" the friend told the paper. ""But she was like, 'This is what I want to do.' "" What's a hospital supposed to do if an Ebola patient shows up? She's a good teacher . Not only is Pham skilled in proper nursing techniques, she was a scrupulous teacher, too. Jennifer Joseph trained under Pham at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Though she now works at another hospital, she remembers the guidance she received from Pham. ""Knowing Nina, she's one of the most meticulous, thorough, effective nurses,"" Joseph told CNN affiliate KTVT. ""She taught me infection control and hand hygiene and protocol. I learned so much of that from her."" Joseph said she also has faith that those taking care of her now will help their colleague recover. ""I have full confidence they'll be able to get her through this."" She has a sense of humor . Among the boards she set up on her Pinterest account are two filled with funny e-cards: ""Laughter is the best medicine"" and ""Nurse things."" ""I hate the questions that start with, 'So you're a nurse, let me ask you ...' "" read one of the pins she posted. She adores her dog . Many of Pham's photos on social media feature her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, Bentley. After Spanish authorities euthanized an Ebola patient's dog last week, many in Dallas feared Pham's dog might face the same fate. Can pets get or spread Ebola? But Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed said Bentley is safe and being cared for in quarantine. ""That dog was very important to her,"" said Mayor Mike Rawlings. ""We want to make sure that dog is as healthy as can be at this point and being taken care of."" Officials emailed a video of Bentley to Pham on Monday night, he said, hoping that it might boost her spirits. Complete coverage on Ebola .

"Phillips Andover Academy, one of the most elite and selective boarding high schools in the country, failed again to elect a girl to its top student position -- the school presidency. Since the school went co-ed in 1973, only three girls have held this office. In a letter that launched a fiery debate across its campus, senior girls implored their peers to look hard at the school's ""staggering gender imbalance"" in student leadership. Headmaster John Palfrey responded by telling The New York Times, ""Girls have not had equal access to top leadership positions."" Yet, access for girls is rarely the problem when it comes to pursuing leadership. Feeling authorized to take leadership roles is the problem. It starts early. From childhood to adolescence, girls face mixed messages about displaying power and authority. The girls at Andover and elsewhere are socialized to be likeable, to please others, to not tout their own successes and to speak softly like proper girls. As a result, they face powerful psychological barriers to attaining leadership roles. The impact of what I call the ""curse of the good girl"" effect first appears in friendships, when young girls take pains to avoid direct conflict with peers. ""I want to tell her how I feel,"" a typical girl would say in my research interviews, ""but what if she hates me or turns other people against me?"" These girls often resorted to gossip and other forms of indirect communication, or they internalize their feelings in unhealthy ways. Over time, pretending not to be angry with a friend when you are, or turning to a text messages instead of having an honest conversation, becomes a formative habit of communication. Meanwhile, the muscles that girls need to assert their strongest feelings and opinions atrophy. By the time girls join sports teams and school organizations, many have imported these social habits into student leadership contexts. In a study by the Girl Scouts, girls from 8 to 17 worried that leadership positions would make them seem ""bossy"" and lead to negative attention from peers. By college, a skills and confidence gap becomes apparent. On the nearly 40 college campuses that run Elect Her, a program that trains women to run for student government, female students comprise over half of the student body but only hold about a third of the executive positions in student government. A study by Jennifer Lawless and Richard Fox, co-authors of ""It Still Takes a Candidate: Why Women Don't Run for Office,"" found that self-doubt plagues young women ages 18 to 25 who are considering a run for public office. In contrast, their male peers were 60% more likely to view themselves as ""very qualified."" Parents, too, play a role. The same study shows that parents are key influencers in a girl's decision to run for office. Not only did the data show that many more boys than girls are encouraged by a parent to run for office, but half of the students whose mothers suggested they run said they would like to in the future, compared with only 3% of those who got no nudge. Everyone -- women and men -- need to be more aware of the social cost of punishing girls for being too assertive. Just as a woman becomes instantly less likeable when she asks for a raise -- as research indicates -- a teenage girl can lose social standing when she seems too opinionated. The penalties are different, but the message is the same: Be too ""bossy"" or say too much, and you will pay the price. The potential for a girl to become a leader seems over before it even begins. We can help girls feel more confident as leaders by teaching them the right skills early on, such as talking to a person you don't know or negotiating a compromise. Organizations such as the Girls Leadership Institute teach girls as young as 5 to express their feelings with friends and how to be assertive. Our educators should consider integrating leadership skill instructions into lesson plans. The White House recently convened a conference on girls' leadership to address the public leadership gender gap. As the father of two girls, President Barack Obama must understand how important it is to educate girls so that they can grow up and become leaders -- if they so choose. It is time for all of us to help close that gap.","At prestigious Phillips Andover Academy, only three girls have been school president .

"The day ended with two slain New York police officers. But it started, investigators say, when Ismaaiyl Brinsley found a way to slip into his ex-girlfriend's apartment building. A fight over the status of their relationship quickly erupted around 5:30 a.m. Saturday after Brinsley unexpectedly knocked on the door of the apartment in the Baltimore suburb of Owings Mills, Maryland, police said. During the dispute, Brinsley pointed a gun at his own head, New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce told reporters. Shaneka Nicole Thompson, a 29-year-old who'd known Brinsley for about a year and was once romantically involved with him, persuaded him not to shoot himself. But just 20 minutes after Brinsley arrived, calls of a shot fired there came into 911. Thompson had been shot in the stomach with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. By the time police arrived, police said, Brinsley had fled -- stealing Thompson's cell phone and carrying it with him as he headed north on the highway. Minutes later, he called her mother and apologized, telling her he'd shot Thompson ""by accident and that he hopes she lives,"" Boyce said. She was seriously injured, police said, but her condition is improving and she's expected to survive. After the shooting, police scrambled to search for the gunman. ""The victim says the subject does not have a driver's license. He's currently homeless. He has no friends of family in the area,"" a police dispatcher says in calls after the shooting obtained by CNN affiliate WJZ. ""New York,"" the dispatcher continues. ""His family's in New York."" Social media messages spur warning . Baltimore County Police said it was one of Thompson's friends who alerted them Saturday afternoon to troubling Instagram posts. The friend believed they came from Brinsley. ""These posts included overt threats to kill police officers,"" police said, and they appeared to be posted in Brooklyn, New York. ""I'm putting wings on pigs today ... they take one of ours, let's take two of theirs,"" one Instagram post said. Around 2:10 p.m., 40 minutes after speaking with the friend, Baltimore County Police said they called a New York Police Department precinct to warn them. Then they faxed a ""wanted"" poster with Brinsley's picture. ""Suspect is armed with a 9mm handgun and has posted pictures on Instagram saying that he will shoot a police officer today,"" a description on the flier says. ""PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION,"" it says in large red letters. ""THREATS ON POLICE,"" it continues. ""ARMED SUBJECT."" But the message to be on alert apparently came too late. While New York Police Department notifications about the warning were going out, Boyce said, Brinsley ambushed two officers in their patrol car, shooting them dead. New York police praised their Baltimore counterparts for their efforts. ""All things were done exactly the way they were supposed to. ... There was no lapse on anybody's part,"" Boyce said. Ex-girlfriend to detectives: He never mentioned police . Speaking to police detectives from her hospital bed Sunday night, Thompson -- a member of the Air Force reserves -- told them Brinsley didn't say he wanted to kill police or mentioned anything about officers when they fought Saturday morning. ""The argument on Saturday morning was about them and their relationship,"" Baltimore County police spokeswoman Elise Armacost told WJZ. Boyce described Thompson as a ""very courageous young woman"" who tried to persuade her ex-boyfriend not to take his own life. ""He put the gun to his own head when he broke into her apartment. Then she talked him out of that, and he later shot her before he left,"" Boyce said. Before that day, Boyce said, ""she said she'd never seen him with a gun."" Lengthy criminal history . Long before Saturday's shootings, Brinsley was no stranger to police. He had an extensive criminal record, including at least 19 arrests, a two-year prison term and several stints in Georgia jails, Boyce said. Brinsley's mother told detectives she hadn't seen her son in a month. He ""had a very troubled childhood,"" ""was often violent"" and had tried to commit suicide, she told them, according to Boyce. ""This has nothing to do with police retaliation,"" Jalaa'a Brinsley, the gunman's older sister, told CNN affiliate WCBS. ""This was a troubled, emotionally troubled, kid. He needed help. He didn't get it."" When they were children, she said, she was ""best friends"" with her brother. ""But when he turned to a life of crime,"" she said, ""I had to separate myself from him."" It wasn't immediately clear, Boyce said, how Brinsley got the gun he used to shoot his ex-girlfriend and two police officers before turning the weapon on himself. A man bought the handgun at a Georgia pawn shop in 1996, when Brinsley was just 9. Detectives are working with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Boyce said, ""to find out where (the gun) could have fallen into his hands."" In a 2011 hearing in Cobb County, Georgia, Brinsley pleaded guilty to theft, property damage, possession of a firearm by a felon and discharging a gun near a public street after he used a stolen .25 caliber semiautomatic handgun to fire into a gold Chevy Malibu. When asked by a judge at the hearing whether he'd ever been a patient in a mental institution or under the care of a psychologist or psychiatrist, he answered yes, according to court documents. His aunt and sister told WCBS that his family struggled to understand why he was set free after so many run-ins with the law. ""They kept releasing him into the streets,"" Jalaa'a Brinsley said, ""so isn't that a problem that the justice system should be asking, not us."" Detectives comb social media posts . On social media, Brinsley also had a history, posting numerous rants on Instagram, Boyce said. Detectives are investigating his past posts on Facebook and Instagram, and looking through his e-mails and phone records. ""What we're seeing from this right now is anger against the government, anger at the police,"" Boyce said. Some posts mentioned Michael Brown and Eric Garner, whose killings by police have sparked protests across the country. ""I always wanted to be known for doing something right,"" one of his last posts on social media said. ""But my past is stalking me and my present is haunting me."" And it's not just his posts that detectives are looking into. They're also looking at social media to investigate anyone who posted responses to Brinsley's posts that could lead to violence, New York Police Department sources said. Shortly before he shot the officers in New York, Boyce said, Brinsley spoke with two people and asked them three things. ""He asked for their gang affiliation,"" Boyce said. ""He asked them to follow him on Instagram. And then he says, 'Watch what I'm going to do.' ""","Police say Shaneka Thompson's condition is improving .
Her ex-boyfriend shot her, then killed two New York Police officers .
Baltimore County Police sent a warning to the New York Police Department about him .
While a notification was going out, police say, Brinsley ambushed two officers ."
"Being famous must mean never having to say you're sorry. Now that Shia LaBeouf isn't ""famous"" anymore, he can't seem to stop apologizing. The actor -- whose behavior has taken a turn for the bizarre over the past several weeks -- is now performing in a Los Angeles-based art installation called ""#IAmSorry."" The former ""Transformers"" star tweeted the hashtag from his Twitter account around 2 p.m. ET on Tuesday. (It was a change of pace from his usual tweet, ""I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE,"" which he'd been posting daily since January 20.) According to a press release, LaBeouf collaborated with artists Nastja SÃ¤de RÃ¶nkkÃ¶ and Luke Turner to create the exhibit, which is showing at the Stephen Cohen Gallery from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. What's going on with Shia? ""Shia LaBeouf is sorry,"" the press releases states. ""Sincerely sorry. He will be in situ ... for the duration. Implements will be provided."" Visitors to the art show are invited to observe LaBeouf's performance one at a time. Before viewing the actor, the visitor stops at a table that bears ""implements"" -- some of which appear to correspond with LaBeouf's career. There are things like a ""Transformers"" toy, a whip (he starred in 2008's ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull""), Hershey's kisses, a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey, a bottle of cologne, pliers, a ukelele and a copy of Daniel Clowes' book, ""The Death-Ray."" The last item is an interesting choice, given that LaBeouf was accused of plagiarizing Clowes' work in December. The actor at first said that he'd been so absorbed in the creative process he neglected to give Clowes proper accreditation, but then he was also accused of plagiarizing his apologies. So is this whole exhibit supposed to be a grand apology both for his use of Clowes' art as well as his own career? Visitors don't find out. They're instructed to select one item from the table of ""implements,"" which also includes a bowl of comments about LaBeouf. Time magazine's Ryan Sandoval took the bowl of messages into LaBeouf's performance space, which he describes as a room about the size of a closet, outfitted with a table and two chairs. Behind the table was LaBeouf, wearing a tux and his now ever-present paper bag mask with the words ""I AM NOT FAMOUS"" written on it. After sitting down across from the actor, Sandoval described reading ""messages (that were) mostly negative, some positive, declaring LaBeouf either a 'baby,' an 'idiot,' or a 'genius.' Things about having to 'move on,' or suggestions of 'death.' They felt like tweets; they probably were tweets. I read about thirteen notes in measured tones, opting out of the ones that were too harsh or too praiseworthy; I thought about reading the whole bowl, but then got self-conscious saying so many hurtful things to LaBeouf, who in that moment, just seemed like a mixed-up kid. (Frankly, I hope no one whips him, or worse, spritzes him with cologne.)"" The Daily Beast's Andrew Romano did in fact choose the cologne, and tried to offer it to the actor but didn't get a response. LaBeouf was just as silent when Romano peppered with him questions such as, ""What are you sorry for?"" and ""If you're not famous, why am I here?"" ""It was just me and a guy in formal wear with a paper bag over his head sitting there silently,"" Romano described. ""Through his eyeholes, I could see LaBeouf's eyes moving around -- staring at me."" But after asking LaBeouf if it was really him, Romano did get a response. ""The bag moved. I thought he was smiling. Then I looked at his eyes. They were red and watery."" ""'Can you give me a sign that you're really Shia LaBeouf?'"" Romano asked. ""And that's when it happened: LaBeouf reached up and took the bag off his head. He looked miserable. I'm pretty sure he had been crying."" The location of the exhibit, which is free to view, just so happens to be located across the street from the offices of viral content giant BuzzFeed, and some have wondered if it was intentional. There's also the question of what the whole point of the exhibit could be. Is Shia LaBeouf trying to sincerely apologize, or is he making a larger commentary on celebrity? Is it more about our ""copy-and-paste culture,"" as he's said before? That last theory appears to hold at least a little bit of water. Some attendees to ""#IAmSorry"" have noted the project's strong resemblance to the work of Marina Abramovic, in addition to other artists.","Shia LaBeouf has opened an art exhibit in Los Angeles .
The project is called ""#IAmSorry""
Visitors sit in a room with the actor after choosing an ""implement""
He doesn't say what he's actually sorry for ."
"A woman's chances of becoming pregnant are the same after rape as they are after consensual sex, according to medical experts and published studies. Their conclusion contradicts a statement made last weekend by Rep. Todd Akin, R-Missouri, who suggested in an interview with CNN affiliate KTVI that rape rarely results in pregnancy. ""From what I understand from doctors, that's really rare,"" said the U.S. Senate candidate in response to a question about whether abortion should be legal in cases of rape. ""If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down."" Akin defies mounting calls to withdraw from Senate race . Akin's supporters say he was given misinformation that appears to stem from a 1999 article by Dr. John C. Willke, the former president of the National Right to Life Committee. Willke wrote that rape pregnancies are ""extremely rare"" and that the stress of rape helps prevent pregnancy. ""To get and stay pregnant a woman's body must produce a very sophisticated mix of hormones,"" Willke wrote in a 1999 article published in ""Life Issues Connector,"" an anti-abortion newsletter. ""Hormone production is controlled by a part of the brain that is easily influenced by emotions. There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape. This can radically upset her possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy."" Willke, who is in his late 80s and lives in Cincinnati, did not return a call from CNN. But scientific data support neither Willke's assertion nor Akin's statements, according to experts. ""What we know is that chronic stress can decrease fertility,"" said Dr. Sharon Phelan, a fellow at the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of New Mexico, in a telephone interview with CNN. Phelan cites emotional, medical or nutritional stress as forms of chronic stress. ""The acute stress does not have the same impact,"" she added, referring to the act of rape. A 1996 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology estimated 32,101 pregnancies in the United States each year result from rape. Opinion: Rape can make you pregnant. Period. Generally, a single act of a rape has about a 5% chance of resulting in pregnancy among victims aged 12 to 45 who are not on birth control, according to ACOG figures. But experts say that percentage fluctuates greatly, depending on a woman's ovulation cycle at the time of intercourse. Three days prior to ovulation, a woman has a 15% chance of pregnancy after a sexual encounter; one to two days prior to ovulation, the odds double to 30%; they plummet to 12% on the day of ovulation, Phelan said. ""Since a rape would likely happen at any point in the cycle, the overall risk -- without considering day of cycle -- would be close to a 16% chance of occurring on a fertile day and then there is, at maximum, a 30% chance of conception,"" Phelan said. While the stress associated with rape may not lower a victim's risk of becoming pregnant, rapists often do not ejaculate, thereby decreasing their victims' risk of pregnancy, said Phelan. Akin has apologized for his remarks. ""I had heard one time a medical report that it's hard to get, it's harder for somebody to get pregnant under those conditions,"" he told radio host Sean Hannity on Monday. ""I don't believe that's true now. In fact, I've checked the facts and that's wrong. I was just wrong in that statement."" Akin asks for 'forgiveness' in new TV ad . Dr. David Grimes, a clinical professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said he was shocked when he heard Akin's original remarks. ""That's part of the broad theme here of misogyny -- that women are responsible for being raped; they brought it on themselves through their provocative behavior or clothing,"" Grimes told ""AC360"" on Tuesday night. ""Then, on top of that, should they be raped -- and if they get pregnant -- that, too, is their fault. It's a double whammy. It's cruel beyond words."" Grimes rejected the authority of Willke, a general practitioner, to make such statements. ""He has no scientific credentials,"" said Grimes, who serves on the editorial boards of several publications, including Obstetrics and Gynecology, Obstetrical and Gynecological Survey and the journal Contraception. ""In medicine, opinions count only to the extent that they're borne out or supported by evidence. No evidence at all supports Dr. Willke's bizarre theories."" Opinion: Wake up -- It's not just Akin . Surviving sexual assault: Share your testimony on CNN iReport.","""If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down,"" Akin says .
Experts dispute the GOP Senate candidate's view .
Chronic stress can decrease fertility, but not the acute stress of rape, says professor ."
"Manila, Philippines (CNN)This week Pope Francis will set foot on Philippine soil. His pastoral visit is the fourth time our country will be graced by the presence of the Successor of Peter. In 1970 Blessed Pope Paul VI included the Philippines in his apostolic pilgrimage to Asia and Oceania. Saint Pope John Paul II came to the Philippines twice -- in 1981 and in 1995 for the World Youth Day. Twenty years later, we welcome Pope Francis. Every papal visit is unique, bearing the influence of the unique personalities of the popes and the changing circumstances in the country, the Church and the world. Preparing the nation . In one conversation I had with Pope Francis he expressed a wish, ""I am not supposed to be the focus of the apostolic trip to the Philippines. Jesus should be the focus."" I have tried my best to communicate this expectation of the Holy Father to the Filipino nation and to those involved in the preparation for the visit. His sentiment should be our sentiment too. His Christ-centered understanding of his pilgrimage should provide us with the pivotal point of the many events that would occur. The theme of the apostolic visit -- ""mercy and compassion"" -- should be qualified as the mercy and compassion of Jesus manifested in the Gospels. In the light of this desire of the Pope I would like to emphasize a few expectations of the visit. Year of the Laity . First, Pope Francis comes after the celebration of the Year of the Laity in the Philippines, which was observed in 2014. We await the impetus and encouragement that the Successor of Peter would give to our lay faithful in deepening their personal encounter with Jesus, and in bringing the Gospel of Jesus to all aspects of life -- conscience, family, culture, politics, finance, science, arts, sports, migration, labor, ecumenism, inter-religious dialogue, and social communications. We await the Pope's word to the ordained and consecrated men and women on how to foster communion with the lay faithful.  We await the Pope to send us again as missionaries wherever we are, especially in Asia. We eagerly await Pope Francis to strengthen us as Jesus once told Peter, ""I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail, and you, when once you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."" (Luke 22:32) Hearing the message . But we must listen to Pope Francis. It is not enough that we see him, come close to him or even touch him. We have been begging the Filipino people to listen to the Gospel of Jesus that would reach us through the Holy Father. The apostolic visit will make a difference to the Philippine Church and society only if we listen and act on what we have heard. Secondly, Pope Francis comes after a series of natural and human-caused disasters that the Filipino people experienced in 2013 and 2014: earthquakes, typhoons (the strongest of which was Haiyan) and armed conflicts. But let us not forget the daily disaster of poverty and inequality as seen in children and families living on the streets, homeless people, human trafficking, unemployment and underemployment, forced migration, prostitution, illegal drugs, corruption, missing persons and environmental degradation. Mercy and compassion . Pope Francis will bring the mercy and compassion of Jesus to the tired, weary and those who find life burdensome. They await the assurance that Jesus remains the shepherd who has compassion for the hungry crowds. We await the renewed challenge for the ordained and religious to embody the love, patience and healing of the Jesus as they bring the good news to the poor. We await the call of the Pope to the shapers of government, culture and the economy to return to love as the supreme law that must shape their policies and programs. We await the Holy Father to encourage all efforts to forge peace, especially in parts of Mindanao and to promote good will among peoples of different religions. We eagerly await in Pope Francis the love that Peter once professed to Jesus who asked him, ""Simon, Son of John, do you love me more than these?"" (John 21:15) Love for Jesus . This love for Jesus made Peter a shepherd with the mission of feeding and tending the sheep of Jesus. We will see Pope Francis' love for Jesus in his pastoral charity towards us. Finally, Pope Francis comes to us as one like us, or in his own words ""as a regular human being,"" a sinner who has experienced God's mercy. His simple words and gestures will make Jesus and the Church more accessible to Filipinos. We await the Successor of Peter: a brother, a father and a friend. The Filipino people are filled with joy. Pope Francis gets huge Philippines welcome amid calls for change .","Pope Francis' trip to the Philippines will be the fourth Papal visit and first in 20 years .
Pope has expressed a desire that the visit should be not focus on him: ""Jesus should be the focus""
Visit should be an opportunity for Filipinos to bring the Gospel of Jesus to all aspects of life ."
"A series of revelations about the National Security Agency's surveillance programs sparked outrage among many this week, including the expected privacy activists and civil libertarians. But there seems to be a gap between the roiling anger online and the attitudes of other people, especially younger ones, who think it's just not that big a deal. It's the rare issue that crosses party lines in terms of outrage, apathy and even ignorance. When interviewing people about the topic in downtown San Francisco, we found a number of people of all ages who had not heard the news, and more than one who asked what the NSA was. The rest had various reasons for not being terribly concerned. Official: Damage assessment over U.S. intelligence-gathering leaks . Privacy is already dead . When the news broke on Wednesday, a number of people responded online by saying an extensive government surveillance program wasn't surprising and just confirmed what they already knew. The lack of shock wasn't limited to savvy technologists who have been following reports from organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, or EFF, that cover possible monitoring going back to 2007. Many people already assumed that information online was easily accessible by corporations and the government. A survey conducted by the Allstate/National Journal Heartland Monitor just days before the NSA news broke found that 85% of Americans already believed their phone calls, e-mails and online activity were being monitored. Allen Trember from San Luis Obispo, California, said he knew when he started using the Internet that his information wasn't going to be private, but still lamented that privacy no longer exists. ""I don't like it, but what can I do about it?"" he said. ""I'm just glad that we have as much freedom as we do."" Internet laughs about being spied on . OK sacrificing privacy for security . A national joint survey conducted in April by CNN, Time and ORC International found that 40% of respondents were willing to give up some of their civil liberties for increased security. That survey was conducted after the Boston Marathon bombing and before news of the NSA programs was public. ""Out of sight, out of mind,"" is how Will, 28, responded to the news. The Nevada resident said he would rather not know about the program, and thought its being public would make it easier for criminals to circumvent the government's security programs. A Twitter account @_nothingtohide quickly sprung up and started retweeting one of the more common reactions: People  aren't worried about the NSA monitoring their calls or online activity because they believe they have no crimes or information to hide from the government. ""If the government wants to look at my phone records to keep me safe ... so be it. I don't have anything to hide,"" tweeted Cayla Marie. ""Terror war only fought by intelligence gathering. We criticize those entrusted to keep us safe & scream when they fail to do so,"" reads a tweet from Lucy Rose. Nearly half of Americans say the government would never abuse such an extensive trove of data. The Heartland Monitor poll found that 48% of Americans trust the government ""some"" or a ""great deal"" with their private data. Leslie Harris, president of the civil liberties group Center for Democracy and Technology, thinks the all or nothing view is flawed. ""In a constitutional democracy like the United States, the goal is to find the balance between security and liberty, not to sacrifice liberty for security,"" she said. ""I think that simply giving up on our privacy throws off the balance in a democracy between a government and its citizens."" How does it affect me? Nothing I can do . Recent surveys have shown that Americans in their teens and twenties share more of their lives online and are less concerned about digital privacy than older Web users. For people who are not worried about the government seeing their personal communications, the revelations lack an immediate impact on their lives and there's no urgent push to take action. ""I think that at the moment, people may not feel the impact, but the fact that we have a secret agency that can access most of our digital lives -- I think that the loss will be felt over time,"" Harris said. Even people who disagree with the program might not think they can do anything about it. Users still don't know how the government is getting the information and what role the major Internet companies played in the snooping. There have been vehement, similar denials from the CEOs of Facebook and Google. These companies rightfully fear the accusations could damage their businesses, as people move to other Web services that might be more secure. Harris recommended people who are concerned start by contacting their representatives in Congress. ""We are citizens in a democracy,"" she said. ""We can demand from our elected officials greater transparency."" Opinion: The great privacy debate .","Some people are reacting to NSA news with resignation and lack of concern .
Many consider the monitoring by the government a necessary trade-off for increased security .
For those who are upset and want to act, civil liberties activists recommend contacting Congress ."
"Cecelia Owens just couldn't bear to get rid of the photo of her and the young man whose heart she broke a few months after junior prom. She kept their prom picture in a box in a closet and rarely looked at it. She disliked her date's ""horrible"" suit and the fact that the photographer made her look ""like a china doll,"" as she sat while he stood. Still, she couldn't part with the young man in that ugly suit. ""Several times over the years, I moved and packed up and ran across the picture and thought 'I can't get rid of it,'"" said Owens, 47. ""I thought maybe I'll see him again one day and we can share that memory."" Corsages and tokens from prom night eventually fade, but images are indelible snapshots of the way we were, one of the few keepsakes mostly unchanged in generations. In an era when the average prom night costs north of $1,000 and dress codes complicate the perfect outfit, the power of the prom photo remains timeless. Beyond projecting personal style, they reflect socioeconomic and cultural values from an American rite of passage, documentary photographer Mary Ellen Mark said. ""The photograph becomes an object,"" said Mark, whose new book, ""Prom"" is a collection of portraits from high school proms across the country. ""The pictures are about detail and looking at the subject matter and who they are, what they're wearing and economic status."" Beneath the surface lie deeply personal stories of love, heartbreak and the moments before bigger steps. Janie Lambert and her fiance had other things on their minds when they attended her senior prom in March 1970 in Knoxville, Tennessee. They were to be married in May and her husband, a high school graduate who was in the Air Force, was set to ship out in June. Earlier that day, they'd been searching for an apartment. ""We decided at the last minute to go, I don't why, because we had been apartment-hunting all day. I guess because our friends were there,"" said Lambert, who shared her story on iReport. ""I did not have a new prom dress, so I took the same one I wore for his senior prom and put a blue velvet band on the empire waist. I did not want a corsage, so he gave me a single red rose."" When the time came for their daughter to attend prom in the 1990s, Lambert, who will celebrate her 42nd wedding anniversary this year, couldn't help but compare the differences. ""Looking at our prom photos, for us, they were just a fill-in moment,"" she said. ""My daughter had the limo, the dress, all that. I suppose it meant something more to her."" There are always people who see the prom as preparation for life's next big event. Persephone Taylor Gary and her boyfriend went fabric shopping so his tie and pocket square would match her long, white dress. But then his mother grounded him ""for life"" for breaking curfew, preventing him from attending the Miami Northwestern Senior High School prom. ""I was like, 'Really? My prom is in two weeks,'"" she said. ""I was scrambling."" Luckily, she had someone in mind, a junior who had struck up a conversation with her while she kept stats for the baseball team. She told him she had a boyfriend but they still hit it off and exchanged numbers. ""I called him up and said I have no date. He pounced on that opportunity to take me,"" she said. Her boyfriend didn't see the stand-in as a threat, but little did he know that after that night, his girlfriend and her new date would be ""inseparable,"" said Taylor, who shared her story on iReport. She broke up with her boyfriend a week later and started dating Britt Taylor. The two parted ways when she went to college, but reconnected seven years later and married soon after. The theme of their wedding? A starry decor to match the theme of their prom. ""I think that the way that Britt and I met and the way things transpired was kind of magical and I thought it was worth recreating,"" she said. ""Everything was kinda serendipitous ... after four years of passing each other in school and nothing and then that one day sitting on the bench, and then my boyfriend getting grounded, it really just happened very magically."" For many couples, prom is the first major milestone in the relationship, and the image from that night is a marker of their growing dedication to one another. Katherine Steele and her boyfriend, Tom, attended his senior prom in 1995 at Renton High School in Seattle; the next year, the Marine Corps reservist was wearing a uniform in the picture from her senior prom. She keeps the images in a cedar chest that has accompanied the family on each of their 12 moves since they married in 1997. The chest and all the keepsakes it contains are a testament to their devotion to each other, said Steele, who shared her story on iReport. ""It's like a snapshot of who we were at that time in our lives,"" she said. ""The first one is when we started dating and with each one you can see how much he changed and I changed. And, despite all the changes in work or military moves or 9/11, you change together and make it work."" For nearly 29 years, Cecelia Owens regarded her prom picture with the boy in the homely suit as a symbol of love lost. No matter who Owens was with, and even when she was married, she always compared her partner to the person in that photo. ""I guess I hoped that maybe one day we'd get back together, so I never let that go,"" she said. ""I kept that part of him inside me."" Her dream came true last year, when she reconnected with him in their hometown of Opp, Alabama, 29 years after she broke up with him for someone else. ""I said I could just be seeing an old friend or sparking up an old flame,"" she said. ""We spent eight hours talking that day and have been together ever since."" The pair married in January in Panama City, Florida, where Owens lives. Now, she's getting ready to move back to Alabama to be with him. That old photo became a symbol of what's possible. ""We both feel that if we had not gone through the experiences we went through, we might not have stayed together. We now know the mistakes we made with other people and we're not going make them with each other. We're committed to making this work for the rest of our lives,"" said Owens, who shared her story on iReport. ""To end up with your prom date and know that the end of my life will be as good as the beginning is more than I could have ever dreamed of.""","This prom season, expect dresses, limos, dinners -- and, like always, photos.

"New York (CNN)When model Anna Cleveland twirled down a New York Fashion Week runway this week in a navy Zac Posen gown with triangular waist cutouts, it was hard to mistake her famous fashion-family lineage. For five decades now, another woman has sashayed down fashion-show runways around the globe with a similar theatrical flair: her mother. Pat Cleveland became a catwalk enigma during the Age of Aquarius of the 1960s and '70s. With her mixed ethnic heritage -- white, black and Native American -- she danced the lines of race just as she danced down the runways of Paris and New York with a finesse akin to Josephine Baker. Pat jump-started her career as a model for the Ebony Fashion Fair when she was just 15 years old. Her curly, free-flowing black hair and her signature runway twirls quickly set her apart. Soon, she was not only posing for Ebony but for the covers of Vogue and Vanity Fair. She was painted by Salvador Dali, partied with Andy Warhol and modeled for Halston alongside of-the-moment beauty icons like Anjelica Huston and Shelley Hack. ""Girls wanted to be boys. We had cigarettes; we had the pill,"" Pat Cleveland, whose full name is Patricia, said of her androgynous stage name and free-spirited approach. Though she is credited with revolutionizing both the runway and perceptions of beauty of that era, she said she had more than a fair share of doors slammed in her face. Now, as her daughter navigates the same high-fashion industry, CNN sat down with the mother-daughter duo to talk about beauty. The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity. CNN: Anna, what was your first memory of fashion? Anna Cleveland: I remember my first pair of shoes that my mom got me, and they were these pink, little plastic shoes. And I remember putting them on and that sound of, like, ""Tic, tic, tic, tic"" -- there was something about that sound. ... It made me feel really good: empowered, confident somehow. CNN: What did you mother teach you about beauty? Anna Cleveland: One thing that I think was interesting growing up as a kid, I got made fun of a lot because I was different. I was a flagpole, and all the girls had beautiful breasts, and I had no breasts! She told me you don't have to fit into a category. Pat Cleveland: First of all, look at the goddesses. Throughout history, there have been different types of beauty. There are so many forms of the feminine, and just take that and say, ""Here I am, this divine, feminine creature."" Anna Cleveland: I think it's finding one feature of yourself, one feature that really makes you happy. Pat Cleveland: And it's always your flaw that is your best feature. CNN: What's that feature for you? Pat Cleveland: I know I have (had) very curly hair. It was always a problem for me, but it kind of became my flying carpet. I kind of have a crookedy nose, and my nose is one of my (distinctive) features. You grow into it. Anna Cleveland: My longness, my nose. I have very long features. I learned to love that looking back at Modigliani paintings. I found that ""Oh, this person resembled me a little bit."" And I started to realize this long feature is who I am, and I better accept and roll with it. Pat Cleveland: Truly. New looks rock the boat, and they break the mold. That's what you got to do: You got to rock the boat a little bit. CNN: And you certainly did that, Pat. Pat Cleveland: In the 1960s, it was really difficult in America because it was black and white, and I was standing on the fence like, 'Oh, do I need to tip this way or that way?' Anna Cleveland: It's so beautiful to be a mixture of everything. You feel like you can fit in wherever you go. CNN: The fashion industry is often criticized for the opposite -- for unrealistic body image. Pat Cleveland: What I want to say about body image is that every beautiful woman is beautiful first -- like a flower -- from the inside. But you have to recognize that beauty. And now we have all sorts of images -- thank God  -- and everything is eclectic and just so individual. Beauty is finding your own individual state of being. So, you can either water yourself with love or hate yourself. CNN: So why this? Why fashion? Anna Cleveland: Life is about creating something that you love and finding what you love. Being my mother's daughter, I went through a phase where I thought, is it really my thing, or is it her thing? At a certain point, I kind of rejected it. And in that time, I found how much fashion brought me to life and it was something that inspired me. CNN: Both of you have been described as ""muses"" for various designers. Anna Cleveland: I never thought that. Being a muse is being amusing.  It's taking a vision and creating reality. I think for me it becomes not of myself, it becomes for them. You're an extension of them. I like to call it chameleon-izing. I like to play different characters; this dress makes me feel like a catwoman; this dress makes me feel like a princess, etc. CNN: What does it take? Pat Cleveland: It's an attitude, and it depends on society.

"Washington (CNN) -- When a U.S. Air Force fighter jet crashed Monday during a mission over Libya, it quickly set off a chain of events on four continents involving at least nine aircraft and a platoon of Marines. The F-15E Strike Eagle, which is normally based in Britain, had taken off with another F-15E from the U.S. air base in Aviano, Italy. The aircraft were on a mission to attack Libyan air defense systems. According to timelines released by the U.S. Marines and the White House, at about 11:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) Monday, one of the F-15s crashed east of Benghazi, in the heart of rebel-held territory. Adm. Samuel Locklear III, commander of the Operation Odyssey Dawn Joint Task Force, said the crash was the result of equipment malfunction, and early reports indicated that hostile fire was not involved. Both the pilot and the weapons systems officer ejected safely from the plane and suffered only minor injuries, according to Locklear. But they were separated as they parachuted. The two crew members remained in communications with the other fighter jet crew, who in turn communicated back to coalition commanders. By 12:50 a.m. Tuesday, two Marine Corps AV-8B Harriers took off from the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship about 100 miles away in the Mediterranean Sea, to assist in the rescue. Five minutes later the commander overseeing the Joint Task Force air operations approved a Marine Corps Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TARP) mission from the USS Kearsarge. As the unit prepared to launch from the ship, at about 1:20 a.m., two Marine Harrier jets arrived over the crash site and established communications through the crew of an F-16 fighter jet that also is in contact with the downed crew. At about the same time, a KC-130 tanker took off from an air base at Sigonella, Sicily, in case the Harriers or other aircraft needed to refuel in midair during the rescue mission. An hour after the crash (6:30 p.m. ET Monday), Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington informs the National Security Adviser Tom Donilon. Fifteen minutes later, President Barack Obama, who was in Chile, was told. At 1:33 a.m. Tuesday (Libya time), 13 minutes after the Harriers arrived over the crash scene -- the F15E pilot saw a crowd moving toward him. The Harriers dropped two 500-pound laser-guided bombs between the pilot and the crowd. At least five Libyans in the crowd were injured by shrapnel. Back on the USS Kearsarge, two MV-22 Ospreys took off. The tilt-rotor planes take off and land like helicopters but fly as fast as airplanes. At about 1:51 a.m., two CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters launch carrying a quick-reaction force, a platoon of Marines ready to hit the ground and help rescue the pilot if needed. It took the Ospreys nearly 45 minutes to fly to the crash site. At 2:38 a.m., one of the Ospreys landed and the pilot was rescued. The Osprey landed back on the USS Kearsarge at 3 a.m. and the pilot walked off the aircraft. The platoon of Marines wasn't needed. As the pilot was being rescued, the weapons systems officer was found by Libyan anti-Gadhafi rebels. They took him to a safe place in a hotel. At 9 p.m. EST, Obama was told that both crew members were safe. However, it would be 20 hours before sources in the Department of Defense confirmed that the weapons systems officer was out of Libya and somewhere in Europe. There still is no word on where he was hidden, who got him out of Libya or where in Europe he is. As of 7 p.m. ET Tuesday, the Department of Defense had not released the name of either airman or the exact cause of the crash. All told, at least nine U.S. aircraft, not counting whatever plane flew the WSO to Europe, were involved in the rescue. Meanwhile, U.S. and coalition airstrikes continue in Libya. So far, 336 air missions have been flown, including 108 strikes against Libyan military targets, since Friday.","At least nine aircraft, platoon of Marines sprang into action after jet fighter went down .

"(CNN) -- After Michael Brown's August 9 shooting death, DeRay Mckesson could not believe what he was seeing on social media as he scrolled through posts tagged #Ferguson and #MikeBrown . The hashtags accompanied scenes of the dead teen lying in the street and videos of distressed community members up against police in riot gear. Mckesson was compelled to make the nine-hour drive from Minneapolis to Missouri on August 16. The next evening he was chased and tear gassed by police on West Florissant Avenue along with other activists, protesters and concerned citizens, he said. ""I thought, 'this is not an America I know,'"" the 29-year-old school administrator said in a phone interview. ""This is not what America should be."" Since August 9, Ferguson the place has come to represent what many see as the ugly side of American racial politics, making #Ferguson the hashtag a social media shorthand for racial inequality, police misconduct and ""the value of black life,"" Mckesson said. People have used the hashtag to call out what they see as instances of police misconduct and racist double standards beyond the context of the day Officer Darren Wilson shot the 18-year-old to death. These conversations happen every day across America amid tension between law enforcement and black communities, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of civil rights group ColorOfChange. Ferguson became a national conversation thanks to social media, creating an opening for broader discussions about ""inequality in the criminal justice system,"" he said. Ferguson has always been about justice for Michael Brown first and foremost, Robinson said. It has also become a signifier of ""a bigger problem in our country where for some of us justice doesn't seem like it will ever be delivered,"" he said. ""We're talking about the larger issue of police misconduct in Ferguson and around the country that happens everyday,"" he said. ""Ferguson is the flashpoint that amplified the need for greater accountability."" 'Righteous rage' and hope . The hashtag also has become a rallying cry for the social justice movement that has grown out of Michael Brown's death. Between August 9 and August 25, the hashtag #Ferguson was used on Twitter 11.6 million with retweets and 1.9 million without retweets, according to Sysomos. Mckesson was among those boosting the hashtag as he pounded the pavement in Ferguson. He tweeted images of protests, news about rallies and demonstrations and tips for out-of-towners looking for food and places to stay. ""There was a lot of righteous rage, but also a deep sense of community and joy that outlined that anger,"" he said. ""It turned me into being a committed protester."" He also began building relationships to form the infrastructure of an organized, peaceful movement. Through a newsletter and frequent social media updates, he shares news about campaigns, demonstrations, petitions and updates on Darren Wilson's court proceedings. He also shares passionate affirmations of the movement's mission and biting digs toward detractors and Darren Wilson supporters. But, he is quick to add that he is ""just one voice"" in a leaderless movement. ""On social media we have all been exposed to voices we might not have heard otherwise,"" he said. ""There are many of us who are voices in this and that is our power."" Turning a moment into a movement . Hashtags like #Ferguson are a means to an end for advocacy groups trying to create movements out of moments like Michael Brown's shooting, said Robinson with ColorOfChange. ""Our role is to translate what's happening in Ferguson to everyday people who want to do something on a systemic level that will lead to lasting change,"" he said. ""What we're doing is trying to capture that energy and push for national change in terms of policies that incentivize better policing and hold media and Hollywood accountable in terms of the images and implicit biases they put out in the world."" The hashtag creates a space for people to see what's happening on the ground not only in Ferguson but in places around country, he said. Hopefully, what they see engages and catalyzes them into activism in real life. ""A hashtag provides a meeting space, a virtual meeting space where you can be virtually tapped into one strand of what's happening,"" he said. ""But it's a mistake to believe you're fully educated.""","The hashtag #Ferguson is often used as a symbol of American racial politics .
People use hashtag to call out racist behavior unrelated to Michael Brown's shooting .
Protesters and activists use #Ferguson as a social media rallying call ."
"In honor of National Lighthouse Day, we invited you to share your best lighthouse photos with CNN iReport. As dozens of images started pouring in, we were reminded of a near-universal fact: People love lighthouses. The beacons of light are popular travel destinations across the world. Here are 10 other lesser-known lighthouse facts: . 1. The first lighthouse was Egypt's Pharos of Alexandria, built in the third century BC. The lighthouse of Alexandria was made from a fire on a platform to signal the port entrance. 2. The United States is home to more lighthouses than any other country. 3. The first keeper in America, George Worthylake, met an untimely death: He drowned, along with his wife and daughter, when returning to the Little Brewster Island lighthouse in 1718. 4. With more than 115 lighthouses along the Great Lakes, Michigan boasts the most lighthouses of any U.S. state. 5. Many enthusiasts yearn to experience the life of a lighthouse keeper. Ohio woman Sheila Consaul paid $71,010 for Lake Erie's Fairport Harbor West Breakwall Lighthouse in 2011 and has been fixing it up ever since. If you're not looking to buy, there are lots of opportunities to stay in a lighthouse for a night or two. 6. The world's oldest existing lighthouse is considered to be Tower of Hercules, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that marks the entrance of Spain's La CoruÃ±a harbor. The lighthouse, which was erected in the first century, is still operational. 7. The most expensive lighthouse built in America is St. George Reef, near Crescent City, California. It took 10 years to construct and cost $715,000. 8. Lighthouse keeping was one of the first U.S. government jobs available to women, going back to the 19th century. 9. Despite advances in technology, lighthouses are still considered aids to navigation by the U.S. Coast Guard. 10. Towers are given different colors and patterns -- diamonds, spirals and stripes, for example -- to distinguish them from each other. Got any lighthouse trivia?

"Guatemala's new anti-impunity commissioner, Ivan Velasquez, arrived to the Central American nation in October with an ambitious agenda, promising to probe links between drug traffickers and political parties. ""We're going to investigate if organized crime has permeated political campaigns with their financing,"" he told CNN en EspaÃ±ol in an exclusive interview. The announcement sent shock waves across a country that faces one of the highest murder rates in Latin America. Widespread institutional corruption and societal violence related to drug trafficking continue to be a concern, according to a recent U.S. State Department report. Previous commissioners have had successes exposing networks that colluded with the government. But Velasquez envisions an investigation that could expose the very apparatuses of criminal activity leaving no stone unturned. For Velasquez, it's a question of transparency. ""We need to consolidate the activities of political parties so in return they can be more coherent, stronger and permanent,"" he said. The 58-year-old Colombian magistrate was tapped in September by the United Nations to take the helm of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, a special independent body of prosecutors known by its Spanish acronym CICIG. A special treaty-level agreement between Guatemala and the U.N. signed in 2006, gives the commission special power to investigate a limited number of sensitive cases. Investigating political parties is sure to ruffle feathers, but it's something Velasquez done before. And he's asking Guatemalans to take part. ""In this investigation in particular we need the biggest citizen involvement possible,"" Velasquez said. ""We will vet all of the information they are willing to give us."" From Colombia to Central America . Velasquez rose through the judicial ranks exploring the links between congressmen and paramilitary groups in Colombia in the 2000s. This ended with several members of Colombian congress behind bars. During its worst period, Colombia overrun by organized crime before order was restored, Velasquez said. Guatemala can still prevent falling into those same depths that other countries have faced. ""By what I have seen in Guatemala over the course of these last two months, we're in the beginning stages,"" he said. Guatemalan Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz is confident the commissioner's experience in Colombia will allow him to tackle such high-caliber investigations. After all, Paz said, ""there are similarities in how organized crime has permeated different sectors of society both within and outside of the state apparatus."" According to international observers, Paz's leadership of the public ministry in conjunction with the commission has been instrumental in quashing organized crime gangs. For Eduardo Stein, a former Guatemalan vice president who was one of the key negotiators to bring the CICIG to Guatemala, it could be a determining moment for this nation's democracy. ""This is emblematic. Finally, we could have some sort if transparency in how we do politics in this country,"" Stein said. But other segments of society, including President Otto Perez Molina himself, appear less supportive of Velasquez's quest. Velasquez ""doesn't have enough time"" to investigate political parties and should only focus on finishing the commission's mandate, Perez told local media. Perez's office did not return CNN's multiple requests for comment. In the past, CICIG has successfully prosecuted several high-profile cases, including the death of lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg, which nearly brought down the government of former President Alvaro Colom. Rosenberg had taped a video claiming that if he was killed it had been at the hands of the president. The commission's investigation revealed it was Rosenberg who had order the hit on his own life. The members of the hired eight-person gang were later convicted for the murder. Its long-term mission, however, is strengthening state institutions before the commission leaves in Guatemala, expected in 2015. The commission's mandate could also be renewed. But, since its inception, some Guatemalan legislators and other officials have lobbied unsuccessfully to have the U.N.-backed entity expelled. Velasquez isn't going quietly into the night over a little hostility. ""Just because some segment of society opposes the investigation, it doesn't mean it will fail or be truncated,"" he said. Testing democracy . Despite the opposition that CICIG faces, however, there are many observers at home and abroad who support its mandate. An investigation into the nexus between political parties and organized crime has been a long way coming for both the CICIG and Guatemala, said Anita Isaacs, a longtime Guatemala scholar and professor of political science at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. ""It's the next step that had to be taken,"" Isaacs said. ""The landscape in Guatemala has shifted ever so slightly. It's been biting at the edges and it's finally gotten to the core."" Prior to the commission's creation, Guatemala had a 97& impunity rate. Only 3 percent of homicides ended in a conviction. CICIG oversaw the hiring of hundreds of new prosecutors, the creation of new units and the purging of the country's public ministry.  Under Paz's tenure, the attorney general's office slashed the impunity rate by more than a quarter. In a recent report of the public ministry's results for 2013, Paz's office convicted a record 7,122 people in 2013âan increase of 20 percent as compared to 5,941 in 2012. Michael Frulhling, Swedish ambassador to Guatemala, says the future lies in the hands of Guatemalans themselves. Sweden has donated  more than $25 million to the commission. ""In the end,"" he says, ""the fight against impunity completely depends on the country's authorities.""","Ivan Velasquez is the new commissioner for a U.N.-backed anti-impunity commission .

"Guatemala City (CNN)It took 19 months for the new genocide trial for former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt to get under way, but just hours for it to be suspended. The high-profile prosecution of Rios Montt, who is accused of allowing the massacres of more than 1,700 indigenous Ixil Mayans in the early 1980s, dates back to 2012. He was convicted in May 2013, a verdict that was overturned 10 days later on procedural grounds. After genocide trial, has justice been done? A retrial, which opened Monday, was characterized by the twists and delays that marked earlier proceedings. The accused did not show up in court. Lawyers for Rios Montt argued that the 88-year-old was too sick to attend the trial. Rios Montt has maintained since the beginning that he did not order the massacres. The three-judge panel rejected the motion to delay the trial because of Rios Montt's health, and ordered him to appear. Rios Montt eventually made his entrance, strapped on a gurney, covered with a blanket and wearing sunglasses. The presiding judge, Irma Valdez, called Rios Montt's absence ""unjustifiable,"" according to the state-run AGN news agency. Then she herself became the object of further complications. The former dictator's defense demanded that Valdez recuse herself because of a thesis she wrote for a master's degree 10 years ago. The topic of the paper? A legal analysis of the crime of genocide as it relates to the atrocities committed during the period Rios Montt was in power. The defense argued that Valdez had formed an opinion -- namely, that genocide did occur in Guatemala -- and therefore she could not be impartial. The judges agreed that Valdez must recuse herself, and now the trial is suspended until an appeals court can name a new judge. It's not controversial that a judge steps aside because of a conflict of interest, but it may have been a legal strategy by Rios Montt's lawyers to wait until the first day of the trial to make their motion. Valdez's thesis was no secret -- the thesis had been written about in the local press as early as 2003. For observers, the legal process against Rios Montt has been both historic and confounding at times. A long and winding road . The indictment of Rios Montt by then-Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz was hailed by human rights groups. In Guatemala, like other Latin American countries who lived through periods of violence and human rights violations at the hands of the government, there were amnesty laws to protect those in power. The first trial against Rios Montt represented the first time that a former head of state was tried for genocide by his own nation's judicial system. Guatemala confronts a dark chapter . The first trial was almost derailed several times. Lawyers for Rios Montt lodged more than 70 motions and appeals, many seeking to end the process on technical or procedural grounds. In the end, the trial was completed and the guilty verdict came down. In a nation where the powerful and the political elite have historically been able to act with impunity, the moment was big. Ten days later, however, a higher court annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial, a move critics considered politically motivated. Some observers say they saw the invisible hand of the political elite at work when a court ordered Paz y Paz -- the attorney general who indicted Rios Montt -- to step down seven months before her term was to expire. Shortly afterward, the judge who handed down the guilty verdict against Rios Montt, Yassmin Barrios, was suspended by the Guatemalan Bar Association for alleged ethics violations. There's no conclusive evidence that the actions against Paz y Paz and Barrios are retaliation for their role in prosecuting Guatemala's one-time dictator, but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened. The first trial unearthed Guatemala's complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the courtroom last year. Rios Montt came to power in a March 1982 coup, only to be overthrown 18 months later. During the trial, prosecutors argued that Rios Montt's junta government oversaw the bloodiest period of the country's 1960-1996 civil war that left more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million refugees, according to various truth commission reports. CNN's Mariano Castillo reported and wrote from Atlanta. Journalist Patzy Vazquez reported from Guatemala City.","The retrial of Efrain Rios Montt on charges of genocide started this week .

"Just days away from the beginning of the busiest climbing season of the year at Mount Everest, expeditions are unsure whether climbs on the world's highest peak will go ahead. On Friday, 13 people were killed in an avalanche. Three days later, three people are still missing and feared dead after the single deadliest accident on Mount Everest. Alpine Ascents International has decided to abandon its expedition on that peak in the wake of the accident. The Seattle-based company lost five sherpas in the avalanche. ""Making the decision was hard. We felt this was right for us. Not everyone is going to be happy with our decision,"" said Gordon Janow, a founding member of Alpine Ascents. ""I'm not looking to profit from this season."" Ang Tshering Sherpa of Asian Trekking, which has about two dozen foreign climbers at Everest Base Camp, said his company is still weighing what to do. ""There is a lot of sadness at the moment, and it could be up to a week before a decision is made,"" he said. A meeting of Nepali expedition organizers Sunday decided to leave it to the discretion of the individual expeditions whether to abandon the climbs or to go ahead. The meeting also decided not to put any ""pressure"" on expeditions to make a decision. ""We cannot force the expeditions to make any decision,"" said Madhu Sudan Burlakoti, chief of the Tourism Industry Division of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture and Civil Aviation. The avalanche took place just above base camp in the Khumbu Ice Fall. Climbers and guides had been setting the ropes for the route, acclimating and preparing the camps along the route when the avalanche hit. The path on the glacier has been destroyed by the avalanche and a new path will have to be made, Sherpa said. The operators have decided to let the ""icefall doctors"" decide whether to carve another path on Khumbu Ice Fall -- and have promised to not penalize them if they refuse. Discovery calls off coverage of Everest wingsuit jump . A question of finance . Ultimately, the guides may decide to forge ahead. For many, the guides are the only breadwinners of the family. Ngima Sherpa, 26,  for example, supported his three younger siblings and mother from the money he made taking foreign nationals around the mountain. He was among the 13 dead whose bodies were taken around Kathmandu in a funeral procession Monday. Sherpas make up to US$6,000 per season. They also usually get a summit bonus if their clients reach the top of the 8,848-meter (29,000-feet) mountain. Paid in full . About 334 foreign climbers have been given permission to climb Everest over the next couple of months, with an estimated 400 guides helping them. On Sunday, the sherpas decided they want to be paid in full even if the climbs are abandoned. Foreign climbers spend between $40,000 and $90,000 each in their attempt to scale the mountain. It will be up to the climbers whether they want to pay the sherpas for abandoned climbs, said Dambar Parajuli, president of the Expedition Organizers Association. ""We cannot compel the foreigners, but they also have their own humanity,"" he said. So far, the government has paid Rs. 40,000 ($662) to the families of each of the 13 dead for funeral expenses. The expedition operators want Rs. 1 million each from the government. The government makes about $3 million from royalties on Everest each spring season.

"The family of slain American hostage Steven Sotloff believes ISIS paid as much as $50,000 to rebels who alerted the militant group that the journalist had entered Syria, a spokesman told CNN. The family had learned from ""sources on the ground"" that a member of a moderate rebel group reached out to ISIS, Barak Barfi told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" on Monday. ""Somebody at the border crossing made a phone call to ISIS, and they set up a fake checkpoint with many people,"" Barfi said. ""Steve and his people that he went in with could not escape."" Barfi said the tipster was one of ""the so-called moderate rebels that people want our administration to support."" So how much was the tip worth? Sotloff's whereabouts were sold for ""something between"" $25,000 and $50,000, Barfi said. 'False' accusations . Sotloff, a 31-year-old freelance journalist, disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013. Barfi said he last spoke to his friend the day he disappeared. ""Minutes before he was kidnapped, he called me from inside Syria to tell me that he was in,"" Barfi said. Sotloff was supposedly turned over because his name was on a list of people responsible for a hospital bombing, his friend said. ""This was false. Activists spread his name around,"" Barfi told Cooper. In fact, ""Steve loved the Arab and Islamic world, and he wanted to bring their suffering to the world stage,"" Barfi said. ""He believed that everybody was created equal, and the people in the Arab and Islamic world weren't terrorists, they were just people like you and me."" Who might have sold Sotloff out? A senior administration official said there is no evidence to support the notion that Sotloff was in the custody of the moderate Syrian opposition at any time. Syrian opposition officials, after consulting with their sources and activists on the ground, also deny the story. But the Syrian opposition is made up of some 12 different rebel groups -- some moderate, some extreme, and some in between -- a key reason why U.S. President Barack Obama has resisted arming rebels in any significant way. Was the beheading preventable? The gruesome video of an ISIS militant decapitating Sotloff spurred international outrage at ISIS, the Islamist terror group that refers to itself as the Islamic State. The group is trying to establish strict Islamist rule over swaths of Syria and Iraq and has captured cities in both countries. But that video wasn't the first time Sotloff was featured in an ISIS message. Sotloff appeared in the earlier decapitation video of James Foley, another American journalist who was beheaded by an ISIS militant. In that video, which was released August 19, a militant said Sotloff's life depended on what Obama did next. ""Once Steve appeared in that video, the Sotloff family made one simple request of the administration -- and they were rebuffed on that,"" Barfi told CNN. He declined to elaborate on the request, citing the safety of those who are still being held hostage. He said the relationship between the Sotloff family and the White House was ""very strained."" ""We do not believe they gave us the cooperation (the family needed),"" he said. A senior administration official said U.S. policy is to use ""all of our military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic capabilities to bring Americans home safely. ""While we were not able to bring Steven home to his family, that is what we did in his case and what we continue to do in the case of those still being held by (ISIS) and by other groups around the world,"" the source said. The official said among its efforts, the administration reached out to more than two dozens countries asking for help ""from anyone who may have the influence or information that could assist in securing the release of American citizens behind held hostage in Syria."" But Barfi also criticized the release of information about an unsuccessful U.S. commando raid this summer that attempted to free Foley, Sotloff and others. ""We know that the intelligence community and the White House are enmeshed in a larger game of bureaucratic infighting, and Jim and Steve are pawns in that game. And that's not fair,"" Barfi said. ""If there continues to be leaks, the Sotloff family will have to speak out to set the record straight."" National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said the administration is still committed to the cases of Sotloff and Foley. ""We understand the very real pain the Sotloff family is feeling at this time. Our thoughts and prayers are with them as they grieve Steven's loss,"" Hayden said. ""We condemn the murders of Steven and Jim Foley and we remain committed to bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice."" Up to $10 million reward . A group of bipartisan senators introduced a bill Monday that would authorize up to $10 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in the Foley and Sotloff abductions and beheadings. ""James Foley and Steven Sotloff nobly risked their lives in the pursuit of truth, and the United States will not stand idly by after two of its own were brutally murdered at the hands of fundamentally evil and freedom-hating extremists,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said in a statement. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, echoed that sentiment. ""James and Steven contributed greatly to the world through their reporting, and we must vigorously pursue those responsible for their murders.""","Syrian opposition officials say the moderate opposition didn't have Sotloff .

"When he joined his large family for the first Iftar (evening meal) of Ramadan in July,  filmmaker and photographer Mohamed Radwan did not expect to find himself explaining to a hostile group why he had helped organize the sit-in at the Culture Ministry in Cairo and had marched on June 30 to oust Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. Indeed, the conflict within Radwan's own family is playing out in homes across Egypt. It represents a secular vs. Islamist confrontation of beliefs and visions for Egypt and is a microcosm of the clashes and violence rocking the nation as followers of ousted President Morsy fight the army and its secular supporters. As the death toll from Wednesday's crackdown on Rabaa al-Adawiya and Nahda camps, and Friday's ""Day of Rage,"" approaches 600, much more is at stake than the presidency.  Egypt's very identity is being contested. Radwan's grandfather is a founder of the radical Islamist Salafi movement, and his uncle and cousins are dedicated members of the Rabaa camp of Morsy supporters; the filmmaker found himself outnumbered at his family's gathering.  But still he took the floor to explain his actions. He and other cultural leaders had occupied the Ministry of Culture in the runup to June 30 protests, he said, to defend Egyptian culture for future generations, and to show that music, dance and theater were not haram (sinful), as Islamists had claimed, but part of the Egyptian lifeblood. Radwan and other artists joined with the Tamarod rebellion movement for the sake of a better future for the youth, he said. ""The next generation has the right to lead a good life and to have better conditions than we have,"" he explained to his family. Radwan's mother also seeks a better future for Egypt, but through different means. She says she believes that an Islamist state, such as that reflected in the Wahhabi fundamentalism of her one-time home of Saudi Arabia, offers the best hope for Egypt. To her, supporting the Muslim Brotherhood means following Islam, and she cannot imagine a better path. These deep divisions mirror those in families throughout Egypt, and led to the 2012 protests outside the presidential palace. This is more than a dispute about political systems; it is an emotional debate that cuts to the core of being Egyptian. ""They (the Muslim Brotherhood) tried to change our identity"" is an accusation made by Egyptians of all walks of life-- including cab drivers, actors such as Mahmoud Awad, and veteran politicians such as Mona Makram-Ebeid. Political scientist Riham Bahi described feeling like an ""alien in my own country"" when it was under Muslim Brotherhood control. One aspect of the Egyptian identity has been peaceful coexistence with Coptic Christians, who are now  under attack.  A violent assault on churches and Christian businesses was launched on Thursday, and in news reports was portrayed as a Muslim Brotherhood-led reaction to the crackdown on the Rabaa and Al-Nada protest camps in Cairo. When I went to the Al-Nada camp earlier this week, one of the occupiers delivered this summary message in Arabic, ""Anti-coup; restore Morsy; down with Christians."" Not surprisingly for the media savvy Muslim Brotherhood, the huge banners in English above the entrance to the camp proclaimed the first two items, but not the third. At the same time, supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, like Radwan's mother, say they feel betrayed by democracy. ""Where is my voice?"" she asked her son, when he indicated that the legitimately elected President Morsy would not return to power. The Egyptian media's slanted reports in the weeks since Morsy's arrest have deepened the rift between the secularists and the Islamists. State and non-Islamist private channels demonize the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone who supports it. Liberal politicians such as Amr Hamzawy and Mohamed ElBaradei, who urged restraint in dealing with the camps in Rabaa and Al-Nada, have been pilloried in the media. This steady drumbeat of media attacks on both the ""terrorist"" Muslim Brotherhood camps and on anyone who questions their eradication has produced a climate of dehumanization, reflected in the widespread acceptance of the military regime's violent attack. In a shrewd move, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, Egypt's military ruler,  called citizens into the street weeks ago to support his fight against ""potential  terrorism."" Hundreds of thousands or people, including revolutionaries and liberals, heeded his call, making Tahrir square -- bizarrely -- the locus of an anti-Morsy, pro-military love fest. The outpouring of support insulated Sisi from domestic criticism of the brutal crackdown that followed. Government officials and ordinary Egyptians dismiss international condemnations of the violence. A member of the current  government who  asked not to be named, given the volatile climate,  told me that the military tried every option to bring the Muslim Brotherhood to the table before attacking the camps. While ""any form of violence is regrettable,"" he believes that, with Muslim Brotherhood  strongholds  disbanded,  Egypt will have reached a ""new phase"" and will be able to move forward positively in the future. Whether this is possible remains an open question. One ray of hope can be found in the generation gap that exists within families, within the Muslim Brotherhood, and within the secularists. Back to Radwan's family and the politicized Iftar.  After Radwan had defended his beliefs before his Islamist elders, his younger-generation cousins took him aside to confess that they agreed with him. In fact, they told him they all had signed the Tamarod petition, and some had marched on June 30. But none dared confront the senior members of the family with this information. Within the Muslim Brotherhood, a similar divide between generations exists. Attempts to innovate and open Muslim Brotherhood media and communications have met with approval from the under-40 generation as well as growing audiences, but have been censured by elders, according to a  source familiar with the situation, who asked not to be named. So far, the elders have won. If and when the next generation takes over, and positions are moderated, the deep rift between the Islamists and secularists may be healed. Then perhaps the project of the revolution will be renewed. But, for now, the seniors are in charge. To quote the Egyptian scholar Hazem Azmy, ""there is a rewind of the Nasser narrative"" --referring to the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, who seized power in a coup and cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood decades ago. He added: ""the people have chosen security over liberty.""","Cynthia Schneider: The Islamist vs. secular conflict is playing out in Egyption families .

"After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Elena, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. The siblings arrived earlier in the day at the Wild Animal Sanctuary, about 30 miles northeast of Denver, officials said. The lionesses had spent their entire lives in a fairgrounds zoo in La Chorrera, outside Panama City. The sanctuary helped rescue the lionesses at the behest of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. The lionesses, at 200 to 225 pounds, weigh about half of what they should. ""Nobody really took care of them,"" Craig said. ""They got no medical attention."" Non-governmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The lions usually were housed in a 6-foot-by-8-foot concrete and steel cage in a zoo at the fairgrounds. ""These three girls didn't have a family structure,"" Craig said. ""It was more or less that they were isolated for (nearly) 15 years."" Wednesday afternoon, they were in a 1,500-square-foot temporary area at the sanctuary. ""They are in their enclosure, and they are resting comfortably,"" according to Craig. ""They are enjoying the space."" He expects that the lionesses will eventually join a pride of African lions that were rescued in Bolivia. ""African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together,"" Craig said. One of the big cats, Elena, is named for Elena Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescues in Panama. On several visits to the zoo, Castejon noticed the animals had to depend on rain or leftover cleaning water to quench their thirst. The carnivores, she said, largely depended on scraps from a slaughterhouse for sustenance. Zoo visitors often bothered the animals and rattled their cages in the wee hours of the night. ""It was horrible,"" she said. Castejon credits ANAM with getting the large cats removed from the fairgrounds. The zoo also featured gnus, deer, crocodiles and turtles. After a protracted legal battle, the zoo was closed, with a mountain lion, two jaguars and an ocelot being temporarily cared for at Summit Zoo in Panama City. Jorge Garcia, a biologist and wildlife technician with ANAM, said the animals were being kept without proper permits. Over two weeks, La Chorrera hosts one of the biggest fairs in Panama, Garcia said, with school groups visiting the zoo the remainder of the year. Because groups that sponsored the fair and zoo changed every two years, he said, it was difficult for the government to force organizers to make improvements. It's important for government and animal rights groups to work together, Garcia said. ""We need to make alliances."" In February, 25 lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in Bolivia were flown to the Colorado sanctuary, where they live uncaged. The flight, part of an Animal Defenders International operation, followed the passage of a Bolivia 2009 law that bans the use of any animals in circuses. The sanctuary built an 80-acre fenced site for the Bolivian lions, which are split into four prides, Craig said. ""They all have practically doubled their weight"" in the past seven months. The 720-acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands, split into habitats, houses about 300 large carnivores, including bears, tigers and other big cats. Most of the lions have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years, double their expected longevity in the wild. That's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population. Lionesses receive estrogen implants so they won't go into heat. That also reduces the competition and fighting among males. FedEx carried the felines from Panama to Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday and then to Denver early Wednesday.","Three sister lions are rescued from zoo at fairgrounds in Panama .

"(The Frisky) -- Have you seen that Target commercial where the guy gives his date a beautiful necklace, only to have the woman look kind of uncomfortable and announce that she didn't think they were quite ""there"" yet? After a flash of hurt crosses his face, he zings back that he bought it at Target so it was super cheap. I always high-five that guy in my head, but truth is, I've been an ungrateful giftee in the past. However, it's also the truth that I've received a lot of crappy gifts. Some were heartfelt, others were just dumb. So in light of the fact that we're in primo gift-exchange season, I put together some guidelines for how to handle the gifts you get that you really wish you hadn't... Too utilitarian . I thought only married ladies woke up to things like vacuum cleaners or shower squeegees under their tree. Not so. A yoga instructor I know received a Dustbuster from her live-in boyfriend, while singer/songwriter Peg had a beau who gifted her with an oven mitt. ""I should've yelled,"" she recalls. ""I think I just had a stunned, very disappointed look on my face. Not sure what he was trying to say, but clearly we were nearing an end."" How to handle: Generally, I'm of the mind that you should try to smile and eke out a thank you, no matter what. But when someone -- particularly a live-in partner -- gives you something designed to make cooking for or cleaning up after them a little easier . . . well, no. Just no. The Frisky: When a bad gift reveals an even worse relationship . Wrong size . You have to have a little sympathy for the dude brave (or foolhardy) enough to buy you clothes. Even if he has your style down, most men are clueless with women's sizes. Searching your closet isn't much help either as one designer's ""M"" is another's ""XL,"" so he's screwed either way. If he buys something too small, then you have a gift that doesn't fit and makes you feel fat. If he buys something too large, you'll be convinced he thinks you're a chubster. How to handle: Don't take it personally. Politely tell him that while you love the dress/sweater/chaps, it's not your size and you're going to exchange it for something that'll allow you to exhale. The Frisky: My boyfriend doesn't like my hairy legs! Utterly clueless . ""Our first Christmas together, my ex bought me all action figures, from sports and horror movies,"" shares my friend, Jennifer. ""One was a bobblehead!"" Jennifer's now-ex had never been in a serious relationship before, so he wasn't being cruel with the bobblehead, just clueless. How to handle: Jennifer knew better the next year. ""Develop specific lists of things you want on Etsy, Amazon, wherever,"" she advises. ""And let him choose from a list of things you already know you like. Because sorry -- if you want to be surprised, you most surely will be."" And not in a good way. The Frisky: The 5 lies women tell themselves . I'm not her . I still remember the unspeakably ugly, donut-shaped, skull-adorned, pleather purse my man bought me one year. It was so off. So utterly not me. But perfect for his ex -- a much younger goth chick. With a forced smile I told him it seemed that he was shopping for the ghost of relationships past. How to handle: Calmly explain that while she was Kmart, you are Bloomingdale's and he has to shop accordingly. Men tend to think women all want the same things, so if he spent years getting used to gifting a one way, there might be a period of adjustment while he resets. The message . You can learn a lot about a relationship from the gifts you exchange. ""The last Christmas we were together I gave him a suitcase, and he gave me a set of knives,"" says an editor I interviewed. The two split up by mid-January. My message gift was a cheapo, faux turquoise, Santa Fe-style, silver-plated bracelet that an ex picked out with help from the girl he was cheating on me with. Ouchie. How to handle: You got the gift, don't wait for the engraved announcement -- get out. The Frisky: 9 inexcusable excuses for breaking up .

"Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon on Saturday declared a state of emergency and implemented a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew in Ferguson, where the police shooting of an unarmed black teenager sparked a week of protests and sporadic looting. ""I'm committed to making sure the forces of peace and justice prevail,"" Nixon said at a community meeting. ""If we're going to achieve justice, we first must have and maintain peace."" But the meeting at a local church at times was tumultuous. People repeatedly interrupted Nixon, shouting, ""You need to charge the police with murder!"" and ""We want justice!"" And some residents said law enforcement officers had instigated the violence with their military-like tactics. State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, in charge of security for the town, praised local citizens who tried to stop the looting of several businesses early Saturday. He said law enforcement would not be heavy-handed in enforcing the curfew. ""We won't enforce it with trucks, we won't enforce it with tear gas,"" he said. But at least one resident was skeptical about whether the curfew would work. ""It's an intimidation thing. And you're basically suppressing people who still have questions that need answers,"" said Carissa McGraw, who has joined protests throughout the week. ""You have people who -- at this point -- do not care what authorities say right now."" Michael Brown killed a week ago . Ferguson, a town of about 22,000 people near St. Louis, entered the national consciousness on August 9 when a white police officer, identified as Darren Wilson, shot and killed and Michael Brown, 18, on a city street during the middle of the day. Accounts of what happened vary widely. Police said Brown struggled with the officer and reached for his weapon. Several witnesses said Brown raised his hands and was not attacking the officer. Since then, Ferguson has become a tinder box, with regular street protests, an influx of heavily armed law enforcement officers and intense media coverage. A new development in the investigation popped up Saturday when a Brown family lawyer, Anthony Gray, said that Michael Baden will conduct a second autopsy on the the teenager's body. Baden is a high-profile pathologist who testified in the O.J. Simpson, Phil Spector and Drew Peterson trials. Early Saturday morning, before sunrise, a fragile peace was shattered when looters again targeted neighborhood businesses while law enforcement in riot gear largely looked on without intervening. Some protesters tried to stop the looting, at times standing in front of one convenience store and preventing others from doing more damage. Police, criticized days earlier for being too aggressive with protesters, now drew the ire of merchants who told CNN they weren't doing enough. ""You still have a job to do now, and now you're not doing your job,"" Tanya Littleton said of police after thieves broke into her beauty supply shop in the St. Louis suburb and made off with bags of hair extensions worth hundreds of dollars. At noon Saturday -- the hour that police say Wilson shot Brown a week earlier -- protesters outside the police station silently raised their arms into the air, mimicking Brown's purported actions right before he died. Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson joined loud but peaceful crowds that marched in the street carrying signs saying ""Mike Brown is our son"" and ""The whole world is watching Ferguson."" They chanted ""Hands up, don't shoot""  and ""Hey hey, ho ho, killer cops have got to go."" Looting earlier in the day . The looting began at the Ferguson Market and Liquor store, which has become part of the case. Minutes before Brown was shot, police say, a man fitting his description allegedly stole cigars and roughed up a store clerk as surveillance cameras recorded. Ferguson police released surveillance video of that robbery on Friday, but then emphasized that Wilson stopped Brown not because of the theft, but because Brown and a friend were ""walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic."" Release of the video on Friday angered some, who say police were using it to distract from Brown's killing and make him look bad. As protesters took to the streets early Saturday, more than two dozen people blocked off the convenience store with cars. Police with riot gear, tactical rifles and armored vehicles were nearby, commanding them through loudspeakers to free it up. Instead, bottles flew, mayhem erupted, and looters ransacked the store, which the owner had boarded up. It was the first of at least three stores raided. 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Complete coverage of the Ferguson shooting .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- White House hopeful Hillary Clinton has raked in several high profile endorsements as she campaigns for president, but the latest may not be greeted with open arms. Former ""Hollywood Madam"" Heidi Lynne Fleiss . Heidi Lynne Fleiss, the former ""Hollywood Madam"" who was convicted on charges connected to a prostitution ring in 1995, is a big supporter of the New York Democrat's White House bid, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. ""I'm a big fan of Hillary's. Any woman who's smart, how can you not be?"" Fleiss told the paper. ""Even if you're a Republican, if you're a woman and you're smart, you have to respect her."" Fleiss currently resides in Nevada -- now a early primary state -- and runs a laundromat, called ""Dirty Laundry."" The paper reports Fleiss actually tried to attend a Clinton campaign rally in Pahrump, Nevada, last week, but was turned away because the building was filled to capacity. According to Las Vegas' KLAS, Fleiss is trying to make it to the White House herself or at least a replica of it. She's currently seeking to open a brothel in Nevada that is an exact recreation of the first family's home. Fleiss isn't the first former madam to express support for Clinton's White House Bid.

"Israeli  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not a subtle man. When he has an objective in mind, he is not above resorting to hyperbole, exaggeration, or apocalyptic scenarios to make his point. He has been crying wolf nearly as long as he has been in politics. For a very good reason: It works. And it works. And it works. Unlike the boy in the story who lost credibility when he sounded the alarm one time too many, each new iteration by Mr. Netanyahu is greeted with nods of grave concern. The latest edition of this long-running show was his appearance on ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday. More than 20 years ago, Mr. Netanyahu solemnly informed us that, unless someone intervened, Iran would have a nuclear weapon within five years. That was one of the origins of the ""three to five year"" mantra. Almost every year since the early 1990s, senior political figures, intelligence specialists and respected commentators have assured us that Iran would surely have a nuclear weapon in three to five years, sometimes less, unless Iran were forced to stop its mad dash for the bomb. It is not hard to understand the logic of this assertion. Israel itself managed to develop a nuclear weapons capability in absolute secrecy in only a few years. It was not alone. South Africa, India, even poor Pakistan with virtually no heavy industrial base, managed to develop nuclear weapons in secret within a decade or so of the decision to launch a determined program. By most accounts, Iran decided to restart its nuclear program -- started under the shah and interrupted by the Iranian revolution --  in the mid-1980s, nearly 30 years ago. This anomaly is almost never mentioned. Iran, endowed with a robust industrial base, exceptional engineering universities, a well-educated population, and a core of Western-trained nuclear scientists, has spent nearly three times as long on its nuclear program as other countries that were far less endowed. It still has no nuclear weapon. Why? One answer may be the consensus of all U.S. intelligence services that the leaders of Iran have not taken a decision to build a bomb. They have openly constructed the nuclear infrastructure that would permit them to do so, but they have not taken a decision. Mr. Netanyahu did not mention that  in his TV appearance. Instead, he was digging up his talking points from another crisis point in the past. Last Sunday, referring to Iran, he commented in his usual understated fashion that ""all the problems that we have (in the Middle East) will be dwarfed by this messianic, apocalyptic, extreme regime that would have atomic bombs. It would make -- a terrible, catastrophic -- change for the world and for the United States."" His prescription: The U.S. ""should ratchet up the sanctions and make it clear to Iran that they won't get away with it. And if sanctions don't work and they have to know that you'll be prepared to take military action, that's the only thing that will get their attention."" Some 10 years ago, Mr. Netanyahu was invited to testify before the House Government Reform Committee concerning the prospective threat from Saddam Hussein's Iraq and how to deal with it. At that time he assured the U.S. Congress that ""every indication we have is that (Saddam Hussein) is pursuing, pursuing with abandon, pursuing with every ounce of effort, the establishment of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. ""If anyone makes an opposite assumption or cannot draw the lines connecting the dots, that is simply not an objective assessment of what has happened,"" he said. ""Saddam is hell-bent on achieving atomic bombs, atomic capabilities, as soon as he can."" He went on to advise: ""If you take out Saddam, Saddam's regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region."" Mr. Netanyahu badly needs a new set of talking points. At about the same time that he was appearing on ""Face the Nation,"" a group of 29 former U.S. officials sent a letter to President Obama offering an alternative vision of the situation in Iran today and how to deal with it. I was one of the signatories. It reads: ""The election of Hassan Rouhani to be Iran's next president presents a major potential opportunity to reinvigorate diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff over Iran's nuclear program. We strongly encourage your administration to seize the moment to pursue new multilateral and bilateral negotiations with Iran once Rouhani takes office and to avoid any provocative action that could narrow the window of opportunity for a more moderate policy out of Tehran ... ""Diplomacy will only succeed if we are prepared to leverage existing sanctions and other incentives in exchange for reciprocal Iranian concessions. Further, in the leadup to Rouhani's inauguration, it is critical that all parties abstain from provocative actions that could imperil this diplomatic opportunity."" Another letter to President Obama, sponsored by Rep. Charles Dent, R-Pennsylvania,  and Rep. David Price, D-North Carolina, urges him to ""pursue the potential opportunity presented by Iran's recent presidential election by reinvigorating U.S. efforts to secure a negotiated nuclear agreement."" It has attracted support from more than 90 members of the House of Representatives, including many Republicans. This is a crucial moment. A new president of Iran will be inaugurated in less than three weeks. We have a choice between the frayed talking points of the past, which point only toward a third U.S. war in the Middle East, or toward a newly energized diplomatic initiative that offers the Iranian leadership a way out of the strategic dead-ends of the past. There is no certainty that diplomacy will work. But the failure to try would be the true policy defeat.","Gary Sick: Israeli leader Netanyahu has been crying wolf on Iran nukes  for 20 years .

"You eat too much sugar. I know you don't think so, but you do. Look at your daily ritual: Coffee with two packets of sugar in the morning, maybe with a bagel or doughnut or yogurt. A soda with your salad for lunch and maybe a cookie for dessert. We're not even to dinner yet and already you've already had more sugar than you need. Sugar not only makes you fat, it may make you sick . We're talking about added sugar here, the sugar in processed and manufactured foods -- sugary drinks, sodas and juices, cakes and cookies, candy, processed cereals, salad dressings and breads. This is different from naturally occurring sugar, the stuff you find in an apple or orange or ear of corn. Added sugar is often what manufacturers put in to make  food taste better. But a new study says that extra sugar could be killing you. America is eating way too much added sugar and a new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine shows it. Researchers set out to evaluate how much sugar participants consume and look at the association between added sugar consumption and cardiovascular mortality. Most adults in the study, which looked at average adult sugar consumption between 2005 and 2010, ate or drank more than 10% of their total calories in added sugar. About one in 10 adults took in 25% or more of calories from added sugar. Not good. The Institute of Medicine says that our daily sugar intake should not be more than 25% of total calories consumed. The World Health Organization says this number should be no more than 10%. The American Heart Association recommends no more than 6 teaspoons or 24 grams (100 calories a day) of sugar for women and no more than 9 teaspoons or 36 grams (150 calories day) for men. Using this model, let's go back and take a look at your daily food intake. Breakfast:Coffee w/2 packets of sugar = 8 grams of sugarBagel / Doughnut = 6 grams / 10 grams of sugar Lunch:Salad w/4T Caesar dressing  = 2 grams of sugarSoda (12 oz) = 35 grams of sugarChocolate chip cookie = 5 grams of sugarTotal = 56-60 grams of sugar . AHA recommendation= 24 grams/day (women), 36 grams/day (men) According to this recommendation you would have exceeded your sugar allotment by noon. That's before your afternoon snack or big dinner. As a doctor, I see the consequences of excessive sugar intake every day. I have adult obese patients -- those with a body mass index of 30 or higher. For a man 5-feet-9-inches tall, that's about 40 pounds or more over his ideal weight for his height, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But even more frightening are the morbidly obese children I see. They are starting too early down the wrong, deadly path. Obesity is a multifactorial condition and can't be blamed solely on excessive sugar intake,  but it certainly plays a pretty major factor. Then there are patients with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Many studies have shown a direct association between excess sugar and these conditions. This particular study takes this one step further by suggesting that increased added sugar causes increased cardiovascular mortality. In the study, those who consumed approximately 17% to 21% of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of cardiovascular disease mortality  -- that means death because of heart or blood vessel failure -- than those who consumed approximately 8% of calories from added sugar. But studies are one thing. Real life is another. When you see a grandmother who has lost her foot because of poor circulation as a result of diabetes, it is sad. When she comes in with her grandson who is 50 pounds overweight and needs medicine to treat his hypertension, it is a downright tragedy. This is a wake-up call. America, it's time to cut back on added sugars. Limit your intake of soda and other sugary drinks such as fruit juices. Look at the labels on that bottle of green tea or so-called energy bar, there is likely sugar there, too. Minimize the intake of processed foods. Eat fresh fruits. Look for yourself to see how much sugar is in the foods that you are eating. What you find may surprise you, and may be killing you.","Dr. Jennifer Caudle looks at how our daily rituals are putting way too much sugar into our bodies .

"Flanked by police officers with assault rifles, and riding down a highway in the back of a police pickup, police commissioner Julian Hernandez explains the difficult task of fighting crime. ""The United Nations recommends that a city of this size have 4,000 officers,"" he says. ""But I only have 1,000."" Overrun by drug violence, San Pedro Sula is the second-largest and most violent city in Honduras -- a country that's the current murder capital of the world. At the end of the first day of shooting for CNN's ""Narco Wars"" report, we had arranged to meet the commissioner, expecting a quick interview. Instead, Hernandez jumped into the back of the police truck, taking correspondent Kaj Larsen and the rest of the CNN team onto the streets of San Pedro Sula, a manufacturing city with relatively good infrastructure. A convoy of other police vehicles joined us as we set off into the city. But instead of a tour, we began following a beat-up maroon truck. A chase ensued. Finally, on the outskirts of the city, we surrounded the vehicle. Its three occupants were pulled out at gunpoint and forced to lie on the highway. We were amazed to capture this all on camera, given how most serious crimes here go unsolved. In the next moment, the three were standing up, smiling. It turned out the police had staged the takedown to show us their tactics. A minute later, a call came in, and we were back in a police pickup, heading to the scene of a real crime: another body dumped, another group of neighbors who hadn't seen anything or heard anything, another killing where there wasn't going to be a dramatic chase ending with arrests. Welcome to the most violent region on earth. Getting away with murder . Americans are well aware of Mexico's drug war and the horrific violence that takes place a stone's throw away from the United States. But narco-trafficking and violence aren't just confined to Mexico. In fact, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala and Panama all had higher per-capita murder rates than Mexico in 2010. CNN's ""Narco Wars"" focuses on Honduras and Guatemala because these two countries have become the key corridor for cocaine coming to the United States from South America. This has coincided with a dramatic spike in homicide rates, according to the United Nations. In Honduras, homicides have more than doubled between 2005 and 2010, the United Nations reports. As a result, the U.S. Peace Corps last weekend pulled more than 150 of its volunteers out of Honduras while it reviews the security situation there. Almost every murder in these Central American countries goes unsolved. The impunity rate -- the rate of serious crimes that go unsolved -- is extremely high, estimated by the United Nations to be 98% in Guatemala. Here, the odds are overwhelming that someone can literally get away with murder. True, there are other places where the impunity rate is high, such as parts of Mexico where its drug war rages. But in Mexico, the casualties are the result of a drug war that began with known, organized cartels fighting each other. In Central America, officials estimate that drug dealing is a factor in 60% of the killings, but it's not always clear who's killing whom and why. Perhaps a murder is related to a big shipment of cocaine.  Or maybe it's over a $50 drug sale on the sidewalk. Origins of a drug war . It started 30 years ago when hundreds of thousands of Central Americans began immigrating to the United States, many of them illegally. Some ended up in Los Angeles, then the street gang capital of the United States, if not the world. Some of the immigrants' children grew up and became gang members. They formed two large gangs, Mara Salvatrucha, also known as MS-13, and 18th Street.  The neighborhoods where these gangs were based became active areas for the Los Angeles Police Department's homicide division in the 1990s. It was as if Central America's civil wars in the 1980s had moved north. So the United States deported many of these gang members back to Central America. As a result, Mara Salvatrucha and 18th Street, originally from Los Angeles, became Central American gangs. The region began to suffer an explosion of robberies, extortion cases and murders perpetrated by gang members. The threat was so serious that in 2004, the FBI set up a task force to fight these transnational street gangs across the United States, Mexico and Central America. By 2005, homicides in Honduras had risen to nearly 2,500 a year. With the United States working hard to stop trafficking in the Caribbean and South America, Central America -- with its disruptive violence and high rate of impunity -- became an attractive alternative route. How Colombia is busting its cartels . Former Cali drug cartel member speaks out . By 2011, the DEA estimated that 25 tons of cocaine a month were moving through Honduras. And there were close to 7,000 homicides there, a 250% increase in half a dozen years. Homicides in neighboring El Salvador reportedly rose to the highest level since that country's civil war of the 1980s. Of course, those are just numbers. On the ground, the increasing level of violence has created a kind of prison. When the sun goes down in San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, people retreat to their homes as if it were 4 a.m. Large sections of city become deserted, and armed guards are everywhere. Forget ideology: It's all about dollars . It's easy to say the increase in drug trafficking in Central America caused the spike in violence. But it's not entirely clear. Some analysts say they believe the instability and violence created by the deported gang members paved the way for drug traffickers. What is clear is that in the 1980s, the region suffered from civil wars that were ideological in nature. In Guatemala and El Salvador, Marxist guerrillas were fighting governments that were allies of the United States. Honduras was relatively more peaceful -- but not entirely as government forces battled Marxist insurgents to a smaller extent.  These were classic Cold War conflicts as the West and the Soviet bloc squared off. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and the acceleration of globalization, a new symmetry has seemed to shape the violence in Honduras and Guatemala. Now combatants are fighting over dollars from the lucrative drug trade, which could make it more difficult to establish a long-lasting peace. If we look at Mexico's more clear-cut narco war, consider the situation in Tijuana. In the fall of 2008, Tijuana was a city under siege, a ghostly place. Its public areas were largely deserted after dark. Two years later, the city was bustling again, with new restaurants open, people out and about, and civic life restored.  While there are still travel advisories -- including from the United States -- warning visitors to exercise caution in Tijuana, there is a relative peace that authorities publicly credit to their efforts to defeat the cartels. The authorities publicly credited the relative peace in Tijuana to their efforts to defeat the cartels. People whispered that either the warring cartels had made a truce, or that ""one entity has prevailed,"" the Sinaloa Cartel, Mexico's largest and most dominant, reclaiming its hegemony. The violence in Guatemala and Honduras seems less organized, so the path to peace appears less clear. Guatemala has seen some success with pilot programs designed to fight official corruption and to convince citizens to cooperate with authorities. Honduras, with a relatively weak government, so far seems to have little in the way of effective programs to end the violence. Back in San Pedro Sula, on our first morning there, we visited a violence reduction center supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development. Half a dozen or so police officers carrying assault rifles trailed behind for security as the people at the center walked us a quarter mile down a dusty road to a soccer field that represented their greatest triumph. The field used to be deserted because of gang violence in the neighborhood. After negotiating with the gangs, they reached an agreement allowing youth soccer leagues to use the field during the day.  This fragile coexistence -- sharing a soccer field with drug gangs -- could be a small step toward what Honduras and its neighbors must do to create peace in Central America.","Honduras and Guatemala are key corridors for drugs coming to the U.S. from South America .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton got to work on health care reform within days of her arrival at the White House as first lady in 1993, newly released documents show. The National Archives on Wednesday released 11,000 pages of Hillary Clinton's schedule as first lady. Her first meeting on the subject came on January 23, 1993, only three days after her husband Bill Clinton's inauguration as president, and dozens of related events followed. Despite her efforts, the Clinton health care reform foundered in Congress. The National Archives on Wednesday released more than 11,000 pages of Sen. Hillary Clinton's schedule when she was first lady. Sen. Barack Obama's campaign pushed for the documents' release, arguing that their review is necessary to make a full evaluation of Clinton's experience as first lady. The documents cover nearly 2,900 days. An additional 27 days will be posted in the near future, the archives said. The documents are among those at the center of a legal battle between the archives and Judicial Watch, a conservative public interest group that has long urged a speedier release of files from the Clinton White House years. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said the trove of documents ""shows she was a co-president,"" revealing an ""extraordinary extent of meetings for an unelected official to be meeting with cabinet officials."" In a court motion this month, the archives promised to release the schedules by the end of the month but said it will need ""one to two years"" to process remaining documents, including more than 20,000 pages of call logs -- well after the November 4 presidential election. According to the archives statement, 4,746 of the schedules have redactions, information removed before being released, that largely relate to privacy concerns including Social Security and telephone numbers and home addresses. ""We'll look them over, and may ask the court for relief if it looks like something important is missing,"" Fitton said of the redacted information. He said Judicial Watch continues to demand phone logs from Clinton's time in the White House. The papers show Hillary Clinton had no public schedule on the day independent counsel Kenneth Starr was appointed to investigate Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, or on the day Bill Clinton was deposed in the case. On the day the affair began, Hillary Clinton had a private meeting and a meet-and-greet with then-Vice-President Al Gore and Nobel Prize winners. She kept up a busy schedule as the affair spiraled into impeachment. Some events on the schedule might prompt a chuckle, such as a note on the day when the House of Representatives voted to impeach Clinton over the Lewinsky affair that a holiday party dance between the president and first lady was ""optional."" The documents are from the files of Patti Solis Doyle, director of Clinton's scheduling as first lady, the archives said in a statement. Doyle stepped down as Clinton's presidential campaign manager in February after a string of poor showings in primaries. ""Arranged chronologically, these records document in detail the activities of the first lady, including meetings, trips, speaking engagements and social activities for the eight years of the Clinton administration,"" the archives said. The records were simultaneously released on CD-ROM at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, and at the archives in Washington. The documents will be available for view on the Clinton Library's Web site. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Alexander Mooney and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen.

"(CNN) -- Robyn Lawley, an Australian plus-size model, is getting a cyber-standing ovation for posting unretouched and makeup-free photos of herself on Facebook in protest against the pathological airbrushing we've grown accustomed to in professional photography. It's a bold move for the 25-year-old, who was also a vocal critic of the recent Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue. Her message to women everywhere is clear: Beauty comes in many sizes. The problem is, Lawley is not what average people would call plus-size. In fact, when I initially saw her unretouched photos, I kept scrolling through the gallery looking for her unretouched photos. Her natural beauty is undeniable, but if her body is what the fashion industry is calling plus size, that world is more screwed up than we know. Like, seriously, what kind of hallucinogen do you have to take in order to look at Lawley and think she's on the heavier side? At worst she looks like a fitness instructor at one of those gyms where the women show up in full makeup. I've been to Australia. There are plus-size women there. Lawley, for all of her bravery, should not be considered among them. It's the body image distortion that crammed her into that category, which, for actual plus-size women, can't be a good thing. If a size 6, or even 8, 9, or 10, is the industry's idea of a plus-size woman, then how should the average American woman -- who weighs roughly 165 pounds and wears size 12 or 14 -- describe herself? Morbidly obese? Of course not, which is why size designations have been massaged over time. Many women apparently don't want to know their true size, so what was a size 14 or 16 in the 1950s is an 8 today. Vanity sizing, they call it. This ridiculous shell game is how Lawley, who is a size 12, can be both a plus-size role model and on the thin side of average at the same time. And while this sickeningly unrealistic idea of what we should look like is something mainly inflicted on women, men are not immune. The receding hairline of England's Prince William was infamously resurrected as an issue on a 2010 cover of Hello magazine. Tennis great Andy Roddick's arm grew by 10 inches for his 2007 Men's Fitness cover. Cosmopolitan compiled a hilarious gallery of Photoshopped male celebrities like Jon Hamm next to pictures of how they actually look. Earlier this year male model CJ Richards, talking about photo enhancement, said, ""Why would you watch a movie without special effects? You understand that this isn't real. There's Photoshop in magazines and special effects in movies. I mean, it happens. So accept it and know that this is actually a real person underneath all of the computerized effects that they're adding in."" Are we really ready to take a look at 'real women'? Fair enough. But then recall the fat-shaming of Prince Fielder after he posed nude in ESPN the Magazine's Body Issue. Or notice such things as the increase in steroid use among young men; global sales of male toiletries other than shaving products surpassing purchase of shaving products for the first time; and popularity of the painful sounding ""Brozilian"" waxes. That's when you see it's not just women who are spending money and risking their health to try to look like a picture in a magazine. So, while it's puzzling that Lawley is considered plus-size, I guess we can say good for her for putting herself out there a bit. In an industry with such crazy ideas about what's fat, it's brave, I suppose, to put on a bikini and publish an unedited photo. Hopefully the attention she draws will shed light on how stupid it is to listen an industry that labeled her plus-size/fat in the first place.","LZ Granderson: ""Plus-size"" model gets cyberapplause for posting unretouched pix .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian sports doctor has been charged in Toronto with selling what some athletes consider to be a performance-enhancing drug, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said Wednesday. Anthony Michael Galea, 51, of Oakville, Ontario, was charged with selling an unapproved drug, conspiracy to import the drug; conspiracy to export and smuggling goods into Canada. The investigation got under way last September, when Galea's assistant was taken into custody departing Canada with Actovegin, the RCMP said in a statement that alleged Galea was planning to administer the drug to some of his patients outside Canada. Actovegin, a derivative of calf's liver blood, is approved for use in some European countries. A report in Clinicaltrials.gov shows that it has been investigated as a possible treatment for nerve damage in diabetics, though it has not been approved for use in the United States. The RCMP investigators also allege that Galea administered the drugs to patients and conspired to export them to the United States. On October 15, Canadian officials executed a search warrant on Galea's medical facilities, the Institute of Sports Medicine Health and Wellness Center, resulting in the seizure of unapproved drugs, believed to be Actovegin, from the doctor's office, the RCMP statement said. Galea is to appear Friday morning at Old City Hall Court in Toronto. One of Galea's patients was Tiger Woods, whom he treated last year after the golfer underwent knee surgery. In a written statement, Woods' agent Mark Steinberg at IMG said his client received a ""widely accepted therapy"" from Galea. Steinberg disputed a New York Times report in which Galea claimed IMG referred Woods to him for treatment. ""Despite totally false press speculation, no one at IMG has ever met or recommended Dr. Galea, nor were we worried about the progress of Tiger's recovery,"" Steinberg said. ""The treatment Tiger received is a widely accepted therapy and to suggest some connection with illegality is recklessly irresponsible. That rehabilitation did not involve human growth hormone, a substance that Tiger has never taken."" Galea has also worked with Olympic athletes and professional baseball, football and hockey players. Brian H. Greenspan, Galea's lawyer, denied his client ever supplied any star athletes with performance-enhancing drugs and said his client would prove his innocence of all charges. ""Tiger Woods happened to be a patient he [Galea] assisted in his rehabilitation program after his surgery,"" Greenspan told reporters Tuesday. ""According to all reports, he was very successful in assisting Tiger Woods to return to golf earlier than was anticipated,"" he added.","Four drug-related charges brought against Canadian sports Dr. Anthony Galea .

"As he watched the presidential debates, Bretton Holmes was irritated. But it wasn't the candidates who were getting to him, it was hearing independent voters and undecided voters lumped into the same group. The 35-year-old from Phoenix has registered as an independent since he was 18. He has voted for Democrats and Republicans over the years. The biggest misconception he hears is this: ""If you're registered as an independent, that must mean you're undecided,"" he said. ""That's just an opinion that happens to be very incorrect,"" he said. ""Being independent has nothing to do with being undecided."" Living in a two-party country can be tough for this group of voters, but there are more independents these days than ever. Thirty-eight percent of Americans identify themselves as independents, according to a 2012 study on party identification by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press. ""The proportion of independents now equals its highest level in 70 years,"" said a different Pew study from 2009. ""Owing to defections from the Republican Party, independents are more conservative on several key issues than in the past."" Being called an undecided voter irks ""independent thinker"" Holmes, as he already has made his decision. ""In my case, it was already clear who I wanted to vote for,"" he said. He cast an early ballot for President Barack Obama. CNN asked independents why they refuse to align with a party and heard from more than 100 people. A variety of themes arose, from not wanting to be labeled to disgust with political rancor to feeling that being independent is the ""spirit of America."" 'I don't like being labeled' Omekongo Dibinga of Washington has consistently voted Democrat but explains that he's always identified himself as an independent. He's never voted for a Republican because ""I haven't agreed with any of the candidates' values, but I reserve the right to vote for a Republican if their values match mine,"" he said. Growing up in an impoverished neighborhood in Boston where ""violence was a problem,"" Dibinga faced stereotypes that he has worked to overcome as a diversity consultant and motivational speaker. ""I don't like being labeled. I've been labeled a lot of things in my life,"" he said. Jennifer Cummins, a moderate independent, has a similar problem with siding with just one party. ""It's mostly the label,"" she said. ""If you say you're a Democrat, that must mean you are a left-wing liberal with no personal responsibility. If you say you are a Republican, you must be a right-wing millionaire who doesn't care about others."" The Frankfort, Kentucky, voter feels a ""lack of respect"" toward independents like her and wishes there was more air time given to independent candidates. ""I think it's a travesty that the only 'limelight' that exists is with either Republican or Democratic when there are other options on the ballot with better opinions, much better track records, and a real solution,"" she said. Voting for the 'lesser of two evils' Roger Cantillo, 37, identified more with the Democratic Party when he was younger, but he started considering himself an independent in 2008. ""The 2008 presidential race is when I really started getting involved in politics and trying to understand what's going on in Washington. It's just unfortunate that there's a lot of gridlock, and people are playing both sides,"" he said. In the last few elections, he voted for Republican George W. Bush, Democrat John Kerry and, most recently, Obama. While Cantillo's ""progressive values"" indicate he leans more to the left, Cantillo said he finds faults with both parties. He will be voting for Obama on Election Day, but he's not enthusiastic about it. ""I'm picking the lesser of two evils come this election."" It's the 'spirit of America' Raised as a Southern Democrat who switched to voting Republican in 1999, Mary Helen Yarborough has voted for presidential candidates from both parties equally. She has identified as a ""confused"" independent for 10 years, she said. GOP presidential candidates Rick Perry and Newt Gingrich excited the right-leaning independent in the primaries, and she ""flirted"" with the idea of voting for Obama back in July. Ultimately, she says, her vote will go to Mitt Romney next week. But the opinionated South Carolinian doesn't want to be tied down to a party. ""I don't want to be controlled,"" she said. ""I feel better as an independent. I feel like it's a more honest position."" Voting independent just feels ""more American,"" she said. ""America was born on the theme of independence, and I find that being a committed independent is therefore truer to our national pride."" Betty Faller-Pearson, 66, voted for Obama in 2008 and Bush in 2004. She agrees with Yarborough's line of thinking. ""I don't vote party lines because I don't always agree with either party, Democrats or Republicans,"" she said. ""I'm not liberal, I'm not conservative. I'm independent and can make my own decisions."" For the Las Vegas resident, being an independent goes back to America's roots. ""I am an independent voter because I believe in the spirit of America and how and why it was founded,"" she said. Raised Republican in Texas and now married to a Democrat from New Jersey, Jim Mitchem's flavor of independence stems from a similar tree. ""I've never been one for dogma and don't feel like any 'side' could represent my free will well enough to go straight ticket,"" he said. The 44-year-old has voted for Ronald Reagan, Bush, Ross Perot (twice), Al Gore and Obama. He said it's ""too restricting"" to affiliate with one party. ""In the spirit of independence by Americans who broke away from political dogma in the 1700s, I'm proud to be unaffiliated."" Lost between parties . Brian Pigg confesses he feels ""lost"" politically. Growing up in the Reagan era, the 44-year-old holds the Republican beliefs of smaller government and fiscal responsibility, he said. As a veteran, he supports having a strong military. But his concerns with the increasing U.S. debt and George W. Bush's presidency made him reconsider the way he voted, he said. ""Years ago, I began to feel disowned by my party, as this debt didn't start in '08 (not that it isn't getting worse),"" he wrote on CNN iReport. The ""rise of the religious right"" was the final straw. What's a man without a party to do? At first he thought about abstaining from voting. ""I haven't heard a single candidate worth voting for, not in local, state, or federal elections,"" he said. ""They all seem to say whatever they think will get them votes without actually being nailed to anything."" The Grandview, Missouri, resident admits he wasn't going to vote at all this year until controversy arose around U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin's comments on rape. ""Now I'm going just to vote against him. How sad is that,"" he asked. Be 'free thinkers' But Holmes, the voter who emphasized the difference between independents and undecideds, asserts that voting as ""free thinkers"" is the answer. ""Everyone has the ability to think for themselves and question what other people are saying if they don't think it's right,"" he said. ""Speak up!""","38% of Americans identify themselves as independents, according to a 2012 study .

"A principal was killed and eight other people were injured in a grenade and gun attack on a school in the Pakistani city of Karachi, a police spokesman said Saturday. An unidentified motorcyclist hurled the hand grenade at the private middle school in the Baldia Town area of Karachi before letting off a volley of shots, police spokesman Asif Nawaz Sheikh told CNN. The school principal, named as Abdul Rasheed, was badly hurt and later died of his injuries in the hospital, the spokesman said. The eight others injured included a teacher and students at the school, he said. They were transferred to the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center and the Civil Hospital. Caretaker Prime Minister Mir Hazar Khan Khoso condemned what he called a cowardly attack on innocent children, the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) news agency reported. The targeting of school children, including girls, reflected the brutality of the terrorists, he said, according to APP. Khoso, the former chief justice who was sworn in as interim prime minister less than a week ago, directed the local administration to give all the help needed to the families affected. The attack is only the latest to target educators in Pakistan. Another teacher, Shahnaz Nazli, recently died in the country's northwestern Khyber tribal district in recent days after she was shot by two men on a motorcycle as she made her way to the girls' school where she taught . In January, five teachers were killed near the town of Swabi in the volatile northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the United Nations says. In the wake of Nazli's death, an online petition has been set up calling for Pakistan's government to take a greater role in protecting girls and teachers to safely attend school. First to sign it was Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was herself the subject of a vicious attack last October. The 14-year-old was riding home in a school van in the Swat Valley, a Taliban stronghold, when masked men stopped the vehicle and shot her in the head and neck. Malala, whose campaigning for girls' education in Pakistan gained international attention in 2009, has made a good recovery since but is still receiving treatment for her injuries in Britain. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement Thursday through his spokesman condemning the recent attacks on teachers in Pakistan. ""In addition to the tragic loss of life, violence against teachers undermines confidence in education systems, traumatizes students, and discourages parents from sending children to school,"" the statement said. ""Attacks on women teachers are particularly heinous because they disproportionately affect the girl students for whom they serve as role models."" Former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who serves as the United Nations Special Envoy for Global Education, has championed education issues in Pakistan, especially after the shooting of Malala. In a piece written for CNN, he asked, ""Can the world agree that 2013 will be the year when a girl's right to education will finally be won -- even in the most remote and once lawless corners of the globe?""","An unidentified motorcyclist hurls a grenade at a school before firing shots, police say .

"(CNN) -- ""Do the right thing; don't be evil . Honesty and integrity in all we do . Our business practices are beyond reproach . We make money by doing good things"" So goes the sixth point in Google's official statement of core values years ago, often condensed to the informal company motto, ""Don't be evil."" It's supposed to make us feel better about trying new technologies from Chrome notebooks to Google Glass. Don't worry -- we're not going to screw with you. So when it comes time someday to inject our brains with nanobots that give us the ability to speak new languages, we can rest assured that Google won't change the user agreement on us after the fact and plant advertisements into our dreams while we're asleep. That is, if the company judges such practices to be truly evil. Well, some of Google's recent forays are waking people up to the fact that evil is in the eyes of the beholder. The company just acquired military robot maker Boston Dynamics, leading to great consternation in the Twitterverse. As @BrentButt put it this week in a tweet that caught fire: . Truth be told, the robots Boston Dynamics makes are pretty cool. Based on animal physiology, they can run, jump, balance and even chase stuff. As something of a technogeek myself, I can see why a bunch of engineers would want to play with this technology. What we have to ask, and keep asking at every turn, is: To what end? What real purpose are we serving? Not doing evil is actually a pretty low bar to begin with. Is this really a high aspiration? To avoid embodying Satan in silicon? Even if we accept avoiding evil as the mantra of the digital age, the presumption here is that evil is like a line of code that can simply be excluded from the overall program. Oops! Line 45 of that app has some evil in it. Better change it. We can't employ an entirely programmatic approach to human affairs. However well we think we might be embedding our technologies with the values we hope to express, more often than not we also get unexpected consequences. Cars lead to pollution and oil to wars. Smartphones lead to distraction and car accidents. Big data leads to coercive marketing and government to massive surveillance. Something awfully close to evil is quite a common side effect. Google seems aware of this, at least from a public relations perspective. Likely concerned about what it looks like for the company to be developing military hardware, the company recently donated $5 million to the World Wildlife Federation for drones to track down rhinoceros poachers in Africa. It's as if they're out to prove that drones are not necessarily evil. Still, we can't help but do a bit of evil when we build technology upon technology, without taking a pause to ask what it's all for. New technologies give us the opportunity to reevaluate the systems we have been using up until now, and consider doing things differently. But the stock-market-fueled culture of Silicon Valley too often focuses on efficiency of execution rather than clarity of purpose. The result is that our best Stanford computer science graduates end up writing algorithms that better extract money from the stock market, rather than exploring whether capital is even serving its original purpose of getting funds to new businesses. Or the engineers behind Bitcoin develop a brilliant new digital currency without evaluating the purpose of money in our society. The problem to be addressed is that too much cash has ended up stuck in the coffers of the speculators. Instead of thinking about how to encourage peer-to-peer transaction, Bitcoin's developers simply built another speculative currency, only this time on digital steroids. Likewise, war is not a great approach to conflict resolution. Adding robot soldiers to the mix merely improves the efficiency of killing. How might robots be used to reduce conflict instead of enact it? When we develop technology in a vacuum, disconnected from the reality in which people really live, we are too likely to spend our energy designing some abstract vision of a future life rather than addressing the pains and injustices around us right now. Technology becomes a way of escaping the world's problems, whether through virtual reality or massive Silicon Valley stock options packages, rather than engaging with them. But the don't-do-evil mandate doesn't even ask Google's programmers to evaluate the purpose of a technology -- only to perform a basic ""checksum,"" or error correction, for evil itself. How pathetically binary. This is not enough for a company that appears dedicated to uploading human consciousness to the cloud, no matter how many robot warriors we have protecting our virtual reality servers from the people we leave behind. I'm not arguing against technology or that we do less with it. Quite the contrary. I'm arguing we do more. It's not enough to computerize and digitize the society we have, and exacerbate its problems by new means. We must transcend the mere avoidance of the patently evil and instead seek to do good. That may involve actually overturning and remaking some institutions and processes from the ground up. That's the real potential of digital technology. To retrieve the values and ideas that may have seemed impossible before and see whether we can realize them today in this very new world. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Douglas Rushkoff.","Google recently acquired military robot maker Boston Dynamics .

"The French city of Montpellier witnessed history Wednesday when its mayor officiated the nation's first same-sex wedding in front of hundreds of guests. Vincent Autin and Bruno Boileau exchanged vows at a ceremony in the southern city, watched by some 500 guests seated on brightly colored chairs. Autin, 40, is the head of the region's Lesbian and Gay Pride association, and he says his wedding to Boileau, 30, marks a big step forward for same-sex equality. ""When French children are born into this world, they are born with the same rights as everyone else -- but from the moment you said you were a homosexual, society deprived you of some of those rights,"" Autin told CNN in the couple's only interview on their wedding day. French couple: Why we tied the knot . ""Today the French Republic has given these rights back to us, the ones they had taken away, and it has put an end to an institutional discrimination."" While France has allowed civil partnerships for some years, controversial legislation allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt was signed into law by President Francois Hollande 10 days ago. Boileau said he and Autin plan to build a family together. ""We want children, we want to pass down values that are important to us, that we hold dear, that are right. And we want grandchildren and great-grandchildren, a real family,"" he said. Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, minister of women's rights and a government spokeswoman, was among those attending the landmark ceremony, reflecting the governing Socialist Party's support for same-sex marriage. Montpellier's mayor, Helene Mandroux, also belongs to the party. Protest marches . However, the move has prompted fierce opposition from many social conservatives and the Catholic Church, with hundreds of thousands of people joining protest marches in Paris and other cities over recent months. While no official demonstrations were planned, there were concerns protesters would gather in Montpellier on Wednesday. About 200 police officers were mobilized around the city in case of trouble, Montpellier police said. On Sunday, a march against same-sex marriage in Paris attracted big crowds. Police put the turnout at 150,000, while the organizers estimated that a million people had turned out to fill the Esplanade des Invalides, a central plaza. Opposition lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to have the new law blocked by France's highest court after it cleared the National Assembly and Senate. Some 200 journalists were accredited to cover the wedding, many from overseas, signaling the global interest in the social landmark represented by the marriage. Same-sex marriage: Who will legalize it next? Guillaume Bonnet, senior campaign manager in France for the equality group All Out, said he was honored to be a guest at the wedding on what he described as a historic day for his country. ""We have shown that if we all work together anything is possible,"" he said. ""Now couples like Vincent and Bruno can create life full of love and family just like any other loving and committed couple."" Internationally divisive . France is the ninth country in Europe to allow same-sex marriage. If pending legislation in New Zealand and Uruguay is enacted as expected this year, the worldwide total of countries with legalized same-sex marriage will rise to 14. Many countries remain split over the issue. A Brazilian court issued a directive this month removing a barrier that had limited same-sex marriage, but no bill has made it through Congress. Legislators in the United Kingdom are also weighing proposals to legalize same-sex marriage. Lawmakers in Australia voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. A poll for the advocacy group Australian Marriage Equality indicated that 64% of those surveyed ""support marriage equality."" In the United States, the question went before the Supreme Court and justices are deliberating over the matter. Twelve U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriages. On the other side, many states have specific laws blocking same-sex couples from legally marrying.","""We want children, we want to pass down values,"" says Bruno Boileau .

"Charles Smith insisted Sunday that the former NBA players who went to North Korea for a basketball diplomacy trip, led by Dennis Rodman, weren't paid by the repressive regime. ""Absolutely not. I think I am astute enough to understand the dynamics, especially collecting monetary dollars from North Korea. No, we did not get paid from North Korea at all,"" he told CNN in a lengthy exclusive interview on ""New Day Sunday."" Smith, who retired from the NBA in 1997 after nine seasons, said an Irish online betting company and a documentary film crew paid expenses for the ex-players turned hoops ambassadors. Last month the Irish company, Paddy Power, said it had removed its name from Rodman's project after the execution of Kim's uncle and top aide, Jang Song Thaek. But it said it would honor its ""contractual commitments"" to the team. Speaking by satellite from Beijing, Smith said it wasn't about the money. He saw it as an opportunity to go to a reclusive country and exchange cultural information with other athletes and citizens. But he didn't see it as a birthday present for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. ""That's the date that was set. I didn't know it was his birthday,"" he said in the half-hour interview. ""And it didn't matter to me once I found out that it was his birthday."" Smith said he felt for Rodman, who asked for his help organizing the trip and who really seemed to want to pull off a big event. ""I saw the pressure mount. I saw him change, and it was very difficult keeping him and everyone together (once controversy began over traveling to North Korea),"" he said. Rodman arrived at Beijing airport on a flight from Pyongyang on Monday morning, the last of the team's players to leave North Korea. The players' trip also met with criticism because North Korea still holds Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen who was arrested in November 2012, convicted last spring by Pyonyang of ""hostile acts"" intended to topple the government, and sentenced to 15 years in a labor camp. Some questioned whether the players would advocate for his release, but they didn't -- at least not publicly. ""We didn't go there for that. We went there to do what we normally do, and that's to be cross-cultural ambassadors and use the game of basketball as a bridge for exchange,"" he said. Smith said the difference between this trip and other sports exchanges was that the players weren't sent as representatives of the United States. ""We're athletes doing it ourselves,"" he said. When celebrity meets brutality . Smith said he has no regrets about going. He said he was able to meet some North Korean citizens and even came across one man who winced before shaking the hand of the first African-American he had ever met. Smith said the man told him they didn't have a very good view of African-Americans. The man rubbed his hand as if the color would come off, Smith said. Rodman appears to bow, sings 'Happy Birthday' to North Korea's Kim . ""Then the next day after we talked for a while, he came up to me and said he was sorry,"" Smith said. The former NBA player, who now travels frequently as a basketball ambassador, said he didn't go to any areas where people are hungry. Smith also swapped sports stories with North Korea's sports minister and basketball players from the national team. He thinks that will be a positive outcome from the trip. ""We accomplished a relationship on the sports side in North Korea,"" he said. ""Where it goes from there, I do not know at this point in time. But we established a relationship. They've asked us to come back. Whether we go back or not, I'm not sure. I don't know. But there was a relationship established between a group of individuals in two different countries that don't communicate.""

"Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker, has given a wide-ranging interview to The Washington Post about the effects of the startling information he shared this year with journalists, shedding light on the U.S. surveillance apparatus. The revelations from Snowden, a former NSA contractor, about the American government's surveillance of its citizens and allies have generated fierce debate over intelligence-gathering practices. Here are five key takeaways from the interview, the first Snowden has given in person since he arrived in Russia in June. Snowden says ... 1. His mission is 'already accomplished' ""For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished. I already won,"" Snowden told The Washington Post's Barton Gellman in Moscow. ""As soon as the journalists were able to work, everything that I had been trying to do was validated. Because, remember, I didn't want to change society. I wanted to give society a chance to determine if it should change itself."" Snowden left his job in Hawaii with the NSA contract firm Booz Allen Hamilton and fled to Hong Kong in May, taking with him a hoard of secret information about intelligence programs. He shared the files with Gellman and journalists from The Guardian, a British newspaper. The ensuing articles about how the NSA hoovers up vast amounts of phone and Internet data about American citizens sparked an uproar, with Snowden described as a hero by some and a traitor by others. Many more articles about other controversial aspects of U.S. surveillance have followed, and Snowden has said there's plenty more information still to be revealed. His actions have had clear consequences. A review of NSA surveillance practices ordered by the White House has recommended changes to the program, including greater judicial oversight and more public transparency in the collection of data. Key American allies, like Germany and Brazil, have publicly condemned U.S. surveillance of their leaders. ""All I wanted was for the public to be able to have a say in how they are governed,"" Snowden said. ""That is a milestone we left a long time ago. Right now, all we are looking at are stretch goals."" Gellman told CNN that his impression was not that Snowden was gloating, but that his goal to strip some of the secrecy off the NSA's activities had been achieved. 2. He's become 'an indoor cat' Snowden has so far managed to dodge the U.S. government's attempts to bring him back to America to face charges of espionage and theft of government property. And he's not taking any chances as he lives in asylum in Russia. Gellman reported that during more than 14 hours of conversations in Moscow, Snowden didn't once ""part the curtains or step outside."" Snowden, 30, described his life as that of an ""indoor cat."" He said he doesn't drink alcohol and lives on ramen noodles and chips. ""It has always been really difficult to get me to leave the house,"" he told Gellman. ""I just don't have a lot of needs. ... Occasionally there's things to go do, things to go see, people to meet, tasks to accomplish. But it's really got to be goal-oriented, you know. Otherwise, as long as I can sit down and think and write and talk to somebody, that's more meaningful to me than going out and looking at landmarks."" Gellman said Snowden is the kind of person who usually keeps to himself indoors anyway. He said Snowden does not want to continuing being part of the story, but wants to see his cause advance. Snowden has had continuous access to the Internet and talks to journalists and his lawyers on a daily basis, the Post reported. People who visit him bring him books, but he doesn't read them, preferring to get his information from the Internet. Gellman reported that it was unclear to what degree Snowden was under surveillance by Russian authorities, saying that ""no retinue"" accompanied Snowden and that he didn't see anybody else nearby. 3. He raised flags before going public . Snowden said some other people who worked for the NSA's surveillance system also had misgivings about the activities. He told Gellman that he raised concerns with colleagues and with superiors in the NSA's Technology Directorate and the NSA Threat Operations Center's regional base in Hawaii. His co-workers were often ""astonished to learn we are collecting more in the United States on Americans than we are on Russians in Russia,"" Snowden told the Post. A lot of his colleagues were disturbed by what they heard, Snowden said, and several asked him not to tell them any more. ""I asked these people, 'What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?'â"" he said, according to the Post. ""How is that not reporting it? How is that not raising it?"" he said in response to criticism that he circumvented the NSA's internal channels for disagreement. The NSA said in a statement to the Post that it had ""not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden's contention that he brought these matters to anyone's attention."" 4. The intelligence community's overseers 'elected' him . Snowden has faced widespread criticism over his actions from Obama administration officials and members of Congress. But he told Gellman that the U.S. government left him little choice. Asked why he felt entitled to bring the NSA's intrusive activities to public attention, Snowden told the Post: ""That whole question -- who elected you? -- inverts the model. They elected me. The overseers."" He singled out the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Rogers, both of whom have voiced criticism of his leaks. ""It wasn't that they put it on me as an individual -- that I'm uniquely qualified, an angel descending from the heavens -- as that they put it on someone, somewhere,"" he said. ""You have the capability, and you realize every other (person) sitting around the table has the same capability but they don't do it. So somebody has to be the first."" He said his aim was not to bring down the NSA, but to improve it. ""I am still working for the NSA right now,"" he said. ""They are the only ones who don't realize it."" 5. Personal attacks don't faze him . Ever since he stepped into the public eye, Snowden has insisted that he should not be at the center of the story. The real issue, he says, is the NSA's far-reaching surveillance programs. He maintained that stance with Gellman, saying that he's shrugged off personal attacks against him with the intent of keeping the focus on the NSA. ""Let them say what they want,"" he said. ""It's not about me."" He dismissed suggestions that he's made any deals with the governments of the countries where he's taken refuge from U.S. authorities. ""There is no evidence at all for the claim that I have loyalties to Russia or China or any country other than the United States,"" Snowden told Gellman. ""I have no relationship with the Russian government. I have not entered into any agreements with them."" ""If I defected at all,"" Snowden said, ""I defected from the government to the public.""","Edward Snowden gives an interview in person to The Washington Post .

"In China, bribery is known colloquially as ""tea money"" and nearly everyone from local businesses to foreign multinationals has usually had a brush with it. The practice is so widespread that in Yangjiang -- a steel town in Guangdong Province -- a group of artists even made a cheeky exhibition of the official receipts they received for bribes they paid to build their preposterous iceberg-shaped headquarters in town. Kick-backs in China are often demanded through semi-official means and getting paperwork for overly rigorous fire safety regulations, for instance, is typically one way of oiling the wheels of officialdom. News this month that China has slipped from 80th position to 100, tied with Suriname and Algeria, in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index of 174 countries may come as no surprise to those who live with bribery and graft on a daily basis. 'Tigers and flies' Yet, the result has thrown a question mark Chinese President Xi Jinping's ""tigers and flies"" campaign. When Xi took office in 2012, he promised to root out endemic corruption and used a slogan made famous by former dictator Mao Zedong to show that not even high officials would be safe from his anti-corruption drive. Read more: The best and worst countries tackling corruption . Since 2013, more than 70,000 cadres have been probed in a widespread crackdown on corruption that has been so far reaching that international luxury brands have reported a downturn. Luxury goods maker LVMH said in July that its sales of cognac, handbags and watches had all taken a hit amid challenging business conditions following China's anti-corruption drive. Nevertheless, according to Transparency International, China's poor score this year may be a sign that deep-rooted and systemic problems are finally being addressed. ""When countries start trying to address corruption they lift up the stone to see what's underneath and it often looks an awful lot worse than you thought it was,"" executive director of Transparency International Robert Barrington told CNN. Perceptions of graft . He said that because corruption was often difficult to measure, the index surveyed perceptions among country experts such as businesspeople, diplomats and journalists. ""What happens is that when countries begin to address corruption, actually the perceptions get worse before they get better."" He said for many countries trying to roll back corruption, the starting place is getting more transparency and accountability in the system. ""But what China seems to be doing is having an anti-corruption drive without introducing transparency and accountability which means you can't really tell what's happening."" Without a free press or social media, he said it was quite hard for Chinese citizens to know how widespread the crackdown was or how seriously the authorities were prosecuting it. ""It may be that China is very vigorously pursuing an anti-corruption campaign, but it won't get the credit for that success if it does not have greater transparency."" Gifts and hospitality . While graft may often be standard practice in China, where it is usually disguised as gifts and hospitality, the victims of corruption are often those who can least afford it. Barrington said that one of the essential tests was whether the money that was being paid ended up with the state or with the individual it was paid to. ""In general, people around the world do become very accepting of corruption, not because they like it but because it seems so monolithic,"" he said. ""This is where we feel social media has had such a transformative effect in many countries because it encourages people to band together by putting information out. ""And that is one of the issues with China -- the mechanisms that have worked elsewhere are not going to work there because the state control of information is so very strong."" 'Biggest fall' China's slump in the index was one of the ""biggest falls"" of 2014, Transparency said. Other countries whose rankings dropped were Turkey, which dropped five points, and Angola, Malawi and Rwanda, which all dropped four. North Korea and Somalia ranked equal-worst of 174 countries, with a score of just eight. Denmark and New Zealand ranked least corrupt, with scores of 92 and 91, respectively. ""The Transparency International report is inconsistent with China's well-known achievements in the anticorruption campaign,"" Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying told CNN when the report was released earlier this month. ""The public will judge the achievement that the government has obtained and it will not be affected by the index."" Barrington said that despite China's official line on corruption, many people were taking their discontent to the streets and protesting about graft. ""If you're not very rich in the first place and to get a state service you should be entitled to for free like healthcare or education and you have to pay a bribe in addition to the fact you're also very poor, then clearly people feel it.""

"The world will have seen nothing like it. It is being hailed as the holy grail for power, the biggest hydroelectric project ever built that would harness sub-Saharan Africa's greatest river and light up half of the continent. But will the ambitious plan to tame the mighty Congo River, a mega-project first conceived in the 1970s, finally get going and what will be its actual impact? Last month, the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo announced in Paris that the construction of the first phase of a new set of energy projects at the country's Inga Falls would begin in October 2015. The new $12 billion development, dubbed Inga 3, is expected to have a power output of nearly 4,800 megawatts (MW), with South Africa agreeing to buy half of the electricity generated. But the DRC government's bold vision ultimately involves five further stages that would complete the ""Grand Inga"" mega-project, giving it an astonishing capacity of 40,000 MW -- that's twice as much as the Three Gorges dam in China, currently the world's largest hydro project. When completed, Grand Inga could provide more than 500 million people with renewable energy, say its proponents. ""A myth dreamed of for 40 years, Grand Inga is becoming a reality with an action plan spread over several plants which will be added in stages,"" the DRC government said in a statement after the Paris meeting. Powerful river . With a length of 4,700 kilometers, the Congo is Africa's second biggest river, after the Nile, and the world's second largest river in terms of flow, after the Amazon. At the Grand Inga site, some 1.5 million cubic feet of water flow steadily through a network of cataracts every second, dropping about 100 meters to form the world's biggest waterfall by volume. Yet the power potential from the river's rapids has largely gone unexploited in a country plagued by violence and corruption for decades -- just 11.1% of the DRC's population has access to electricity, according to the World Bank. Read this: Africa's new skyscraper cities . So far, the only two projects built to tap Congo's potential are two smaller dams -- Inga 1, commissioned in 1972, and Inga 2, a decade later. Both of them are almost exclusively used to provide energy for the mining companies in the southern DRC's copper belt but are currently undergoing extensive rehabilitation as they perform far below capacity. Seeking funds . The DRC government hasn't yet decided on the developer of Inga 3, but three consortia from China, Spain and Korea/Canada are the frontrunners in the competitive selection process. The financing will come from both public and private sources: the Africa Development Bank, the World Bank, the French Development Agency, the European Investment Bank and the Development Bank of Southern Africa have all been named as potential contributors. But will the DRC, a country with a risky investor profile, be able to raise enough money to build the mammoth project? Some say that with $12 billion required just for Inga 3 -- the entire project has an estimated cost of $80 billion -- it's going to be an extremely tough and complex task to find the huge sums needed. ""It almost defies imagination that this kind of money is going to be available,"" says James Leigland, technical adviser to the Private Infrastructure Development Group. He notes that several different players will ""have to come to the party with equity,"" from multilaterals, commercial and national development banks to the DRC government and the developer of the project. ""It is hard to imagine how all of this is going to fall into place,"" says Leigland. ""They've started, they've made a commitment to proceed on the basis that South Africa will take a huge amount of the power, but getting from here to there it's just a very long road,"" he adds. Transferring power . Indeed, the pledge by energy-hungry South Africa to purchase about half of Inga 3's future power production is essential for the project to attract finance and get going. The two countries are currently negotiating a treaty to finalize the details of a power purchasing agreement, including the construction of transmission lines to transfer 2,500 MW of Inga 3's production to South Africa. The exact routing of the energy corridor is not yet defined, but it is expected to be over land, through different countries in the southern part of the continent. Read this:  'Wind of change blowing through Africa' A World Bank spokesperson told CNN that such power exports could potentially raise considerable revenues for the DRC. ""With energy resources on this scale, DRC can play a pivotal role in meeting not only its future domestic energy needs for poverty reduction and economic development, but also the energy needs at regional and continental levels,"" said the spokesperson. ""With only one in 10 Congolese households having access to electricity, development of projects like Inga 3 and subsequent Grand Inga is essential for growth, more jobs and improved well-being in Africa."" Power to the people? Yet, not everyone agrees. With half of Inga 3's power traveling south, and nearly all of Inga 1 and 2's energy bypassing the DRC's rural communities to be consumed by the mining industry, critics say the country's poor will see no benefits from the project. ""All the electricity that will be generated from Inga 3 is for commercial purposes and nothing is going to supply the communities,"" says Rudo Sanyanga of International Rivers, an NGO working against destructive riverside projects. ""The assumption being promoted is that by developing Grand Inga and exporting, or supplying the mines, will then create jobs in the mining industry and it will trickle down to the community -- but it has never worked,"" adds Sanyanga. Read this: 'Solar sisters' spreading light in Africa . Instead of pouring billions into mega-schemes, the group argues there are less costly and more effective solutions that can be deployed to tackle the continent's energy poverty, especially wind, solar and micro hydropower projects. ""They should prioritize decentralized energy and have a combination of grid and off-grid planning,"" says Sanyanga. ""If they really want to get electricity to the people, not only in the rural areas but as well as in the cities, they have to have another plan which is cheaper than grid development.""","DR Congo moving ahead with plans to build the world's biggest hydroelectric project .

"The afeared nasty weather didn't show up for the Super Bowl on Sunday. Neither did the Denver Broncos. But Madison Avenue, with its hundreds of millions of dollars worth of commercials, was there. And it looks like the ad men and women have caught on to this whole social media thing. For the first time, more than half of all commercials aired during the big game included a social hashtag. From Chevy's #SilveradoStrong to Coke's #AmericaIsBeautiful, 57% of the ads featured hashtags, those searchable terms that have spread from Twitter to Instagram, Facebook and other platforms. That's up from 50% last year and 7% the year before -- a remarkable ascent, considering that Audi made news just three years ago when it became the first Super Bowl advertiser to push to Twitter. Despite Twitter's buzz factor, 1.2 billion-user-strong Facebook may still be Madison Avenue's platform of choice. Facebook got five specific mentions in ads, compared to Twitter's four. ""Several large trends are converging to fuel this phenomenon,"" wrote Kevin Bobowski for AdWeek. ""Television's power is waning, making must-see TV that consumers choose to watch live ... more valuable to advertisers than ever before. But as the price tags for these live TV spots rise, brands want something more than 30 seconds of TV exposure for their $4 million. They are finding that extra value on social media."" There was plenty of action for them to court. Twitter reported that a record 24.9 million tweets about the game were sent during the telecast. That topped the 24.1 million from last year's game. And while that increase can be attributed, at least in part, to the growth of social media use as a whole, it further establishes Twitter as a Super Bowl party within a party, where people expect to share, and be entertained, during big live events. The biggest Twitter moment came when Seattle's Percy Harvin ran a kickoff back 87 yards to open the second half and, essentially, seal the Broncos' fate. That generated a whopping 381,605 tweets per minute. That was much higher than Twitter's peak during last year's Super Bowl, which reached 231,500 tweets per minute during the Superdome blackout of the third quarter. ""Not only do consumers watch the game and the ads on their televisions, but they keep their devices at the ready to engage with that content,"" said Scott Allan, of social-marketing firm AddThis. Cars led the way, according to AddThis. Maserati, Kia and Jaguar saw the biggest increases in the amount of social engagement after their commercials aired, according to the company's analysis. Coca-Cola also generated lots of social chatter with an ad featuring citizens singing ""America the Beautiful"" in a range of languages, from English to Spanish to Arabic. Some took to Twitter to complain that the song should be sung in English, which prompted others to defend the ad and cry racism. Even folks who didn't fork over the millions of bucks needed to get airtime during the game were doing their best to get noticed. JC Penney made a splash with tweets like this: ""Toughdown Seadawks!! Is sSeattle going toa runaway wit h this???"" Users and some media outlets speculated aloud that a tipsy or illiterate employee had commandeered the JC Penney account before the retailer revealed that it was all a promotion for mittens. And, believe it or not, there were even some social media moments from the game that didn't involve anyone trying to make money. From Broadway Joe Namath's throwback fur coat to Hillary Clinton's swipe at Fox News, social media followed, and amplified, every moment (that Hillary post had been retweeted more than 55,000 times by midday Monday). On  Monday morning, 9 of the 10 top-trending terms on Facebook were Super Bowl-related, from Bill O'Reilly's interview with President Barack Obama before the game to the touching text received by Broncos player Shaun Phillips from his son after the game.","More than half of Super Bowl ads included social hashtags .

"Seven years ago, Dawn Larkin-Wallace, a mom of three, took up running to lose that 10 to 20 pounds of baby weight that just wouldn't go away. She figured once she dropped the weight, she'd be off the treadmill. What she could have never imagined is that she'd become a marathon runner who inspired her three children to start running, too. ""We're just a running family,"" said Larkin-Wallace of Baldwin, New York, who is part of the running club Black Girls RUN!, a national group encouraging African-American women to make health and fitness a priority. First, Larkin-Wallace signed up 15-year-old daughter Kayla, a high school sophomore, for a race after realizing that the amount of running she did during her soccer games was the equivalent of a 5K. With the ""positive peer pressure ... and the competitive spirit"" that exists in the Wallace household, she said with a laugh, ""of course, her brother and sister decided that that's something they wanted to do, too."" Kimberly, 11, and Kevin Jr., 9, ran their first 5K's this year. Larkin-Wallace said her goal is for ""healthy living to become a lifestyle and not just a fad"" among her kids, who also play a range of sports from basketball to soccer to lacrosse. What she's also very mindful of is encouraging her children, especially her girls, to feel good about their bodies. A recent study found that two in three 13-year-olds worry about gaining weight. Helping her girls feel good about their bodies . ""It's always on my mind, and I have African-American daughters. ... I have to help them understand that because their body type is different than others doesn't make one better or more right than the other,"" she said during a conversation with her family in their home. ""As long as we're healthy and taking care of ourselves ... the way we are made is the way we are made and we should accept ourselves."" That isn't always easy, she added, especially when she goes clothes shopping with her girls. ""Total meltdown in the dressing room trying on jeans and I'm like, 'Well, Kayla, everything is not cut for everybody so you just have to find what works for you,'"" said Larkin-Wallace. ""It's something I live with. It's something my mom lives with. She's going to have to live with it. It's just the way it is. (You) just have to find what manufacturer or designer works for you and live a healthy lifestyle and love yourself."" But what makes that harder than when Larkin-Wallace was growing up is that today's teenagers are inundated with messages in the media ""telling them that they either need to be superskinny or they need to have this unrealistic ... video-girl body,"" said Ashley Hicks, who co-founded Black Girls RUN! in 2009. The organization, with 70 groups across the country, has approximately 60,000 members. And it's not just girls who are experiencing body image problems. Boys are also flooded with images of what a manly man is supposed to look like, which can be just as harmful as the media's depiction of girls. Hicks said the best way to counteract those messages is by ""showcasing that not everyone who runs or is fit is a size 2 or a size 4. They're going to be size 8s and 10s and 12s and 14s."" ""A lot of people are going to have curves and there's nothing wrong with that."" ""Do I look fat?"" Up against the media, some parents might feel helpless when it comes to helping their teens develop a positive body image, but there's a lot that parents can do, said Anne Wennerstrand, a psychotherapist in private practice in Katonah, New York, who works with teens and parents to treat and prevent eating and body image problems. How we talk about our own bodies directly affects how our children might feel about theirs, she said. ""Are we asking 'Do I look fat?' or are we making excessive comments about appearance even in casual conversation?"" said Wennerstrand, who is also on the faculty of The Women's Therapy Centre Institute. ""If parents can raise their own awareness of how much they're commenting about appearance, how critical do they feel of their own bodies, that's really where it starts."" Dr. Larissa Hirsch, medical editor for KidsHealth.org, added, ""It's just hard for a teenager to grow up in a household where someone is constantly saying 'I look fat in this' and not internalize some of that."" The best advice for parents, Hirsch said, is to focus less on appearance and more on health, internal qualities and ""things that your body can do, rather than how your body appears."" ""Compliment them on things that have nothing to do with appearance: how well they shared with their brother, how nicely they stood up for their friend, how generous they were, things of that nature, trying to be supportive and positive and showing the importance of things that have less to do with appearance and more to do with the type of person you are,"" said Hirsch. Starting healthy early . Parents can also help their kids by showing them, even when they're little, how to be healthy. That means a lifestyle that includes physical activity, but also eating right, and not making the mistake of missing meals and eating too much fast food and too many desserts. ""Seeing what the parents eat, that makes a big impact,"" Hirsch said. ""Keep your kitchen stocked with healthy options. It's hard when you go to the kitchen to get something to eat and the things that you see are all of these snack foods that are filled with fat and salt and calories."" Helping children develop healthy habits early, even as young as elementary school or in the tween years, can set them on a healthy lifestyle path into their teens and beyond, said Toni Carey, the other co-founder of Black Girls RUN! In her early years and all through middle school, Carey said she was the ""chubby kid in class,"" and that it wasn't until her adult years that she really started to take care of herself. ""I look back on that time and think, 'Wow, what if I started running in middle school or high school or just creating healthy habits, it wouldn't be so difficult now,'"" Carey said. ""So that's why, we know that the moms are the key to making things happen in the household. If mom is being healthy and eating right, then everybody else will, too."" That's definitely the case in the Wallace household, where the children are following mom's lead in the kitchen and on the running track, and seem very comfortable with how they look. ""When you exercise and you feel good, it's like I don't need to look like a Victoria's Secret model,"" said 15-year-old Kayla. ""I just need to feel healthy about myself.""

On the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest that the situation was a ""humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, and right now we are not responding effectively."" ""In Lebanon now a quarter of the population are refugees,"" said Kim. ""It would be as if twice the population of Canada came into the United States in a two year period... (Lebanon is) going to lose $7.5 billion in terms of GDP growth. The number of unemployed people in Lebanon -- Lebanese -- has doubled."" The UNHCR says more than 2 million Syrians have fled their homeland since the beginning of the conflict in 2011, with most taking refuge in the neighboring countries of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. Reports have found many refugee children living without a father, and some without parents altogether. Kim said the response to the crisis had failed due to a lack of funds, but also due to a lack of leadership and concerted effort. ""There are many political difficulties in deciding who's going to step up, who's going to provide the funds. We have given all the money we can under the rules of the World Bank and we now need others to step up,"" Kim said. His organization was ""happy to lead"" the effort, he said. Kim also reiterated the need to address inequality, a hot topic at the World Economic Forum. ""Two and a half billion people in the world don't have access to financial services. This is a bank account. Not having the ability to save is a huge problem,"" he said. ""Eighty percent of people in Africa don't have access to energy.  You cannot participate in the global market if you don't have access to reliable energy."" There were encouraging signs that some in attendance grasped the long-term economic benefits of investing in health and education. ""People are now understanding that education is going to determine the competitive abilities of a country into the future, but still many finance ministers are looking at the short term. They're looking at it as an expense,"" he said. ""We've got to help them fundamentally change that view, and as they fall behind they're going to get it.""","World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim has called for a global response to Syrian refugee crisis .

"The air travel debate of the moment -- about seat width on planes -- is an easy one to be seduced by. Airbus released a marketing campaign last month claiming 18-inch-wide seats -- compared to 17 inches -- make sleep much easier and have called on airlines to make these standard in economy-class, long-haul flights. Airlines, so far, have not been enthused with most refusing to be drawn into the debate and others, such as Lufthansa, as diplomatically as possible suggesting it's a non-starter. It certainly seems like an odd campaign for a supplier to embark on, apparently trying to dictate to customers what they should be buying. But it's also a rather clever campaign I would argue, a gamble that Airbus doesn't need to pay off. There's a telling quote from the Airbus head of passenger comfort, Kevin Keniston, who says: ""Economy passengers who are not prepared to accept long-haul 17-inch crusher seats ... will choose airlines that offer better seat comfort. We are encouraging them to be aware of the difference an inch makes in long-haul economy."" So on the face of it this campaign is aimed at passengers, who will then supposedly pressure airlines to offer 18-inch-wide seats. The kicker is this -- fliers in economy are unlikely to start demanding anything. The economy expectation . Economy fliers get the worst seats, the blandest food, the noisiest cabins and guess what -- we expect that, because we also get the cheapest tickets. Let's just get there, and get out, is the mentality. It's not like we're business or first class fliers who airlines do occasionally listen to. Proof comes in the form of Airbus' own cabin layout page for the A330, which promotes economy seating of much less than 18 inches to its clients, even while telling the world 18 inches should be standard. So Airbus puts out the right message to the public, we feel a little better that at least someone appears to be complaining on our behalf while behind the scenes the industry carries on as usual. Well fellow coach-class fliers, it's time to start speaking up. I recently flew New York to Narita, Japan -- a tortuous 14 hours in an economy-class middle seat, with a coughing, wheezing, hacking old man on one side and a fidgeting iPad/iPhone/iDon'tcare on the other. After a claustrophobic, knee-bumping, armrest battleground of a flight like that, you'd think more space would be welcome, right? There's an alternate view. Better headrests required . It struck me that the problem here wouldn't be solved by an extra inch of space, nor perhaps even by an extra three inches of space. But maybe it could by headrest design. As I drifted off into a semi-slumber, my noggin had nowhere to go. I was rudely awoken on several occasions by my own skull as it went into a slow-motion collision course with one of my neighbors. The little flick-out flaps -- or ""wings"" -- that are now common on airline seat headrests make it about 0.5% more likely that your head will stay put allowing you to get some good zzzs. So you can keep the extra inch of width -- what I want is a seat that keeps my head in place while I doze. Unfortunately, and as expected, no one was particularly convinced. The airlines I contacted gave the usual sound bites about how great their economy class seats were already, while Airbus just took the opportunity to underline their existing seat campaign. ""Headrests in our opinion are not as critical as seat width,"" says AlizÃ©e Genilloud, manager media relations at Airbus. ""Some passengers find headrests helpful and some find them uncomfortable. But an extra inch in seat width definitely provides more comfort for all."" A good point, particularly considering that as a six-foot, 80-kilo man, I am probably Mr Average when it comes to size. Fliers bigger than me would likely prefer bigger seats. But would they not also enjoy better headrests? Who's responsible? Boeing refused to be drawn on an area they don't see as their turf. ""Seat design is handled and decided by the airlines, not the airframe manufacturers. We simply ensure the seats comply to safety standards,"" says a spokesman. I suppose as a cheap-fare hunting, bland-food eating economy-class flier, I shouldn't expect to be taken too seriously. But then I contacted one of the seat-manufacturing companies. ""The headrest is one of the features that can improve the comfort experience during a flight,"" says Dr. Mark Hiller, CEO of Recaro Aircraft Seating, promisingly. He goes on to describe a headrest that can be tilted horizontally ""for optimal neck support while sleeping,"" with adjustable side bolsters for a better resting position, an ""exceptionally"" wide height adjustment range and increased wings. I don't know whether this is the headrest revolution I'm requesting, but I'm glad someone else considers the thing worth at least some effort. Would you prefer wider seats on planes, or are there other areas of cabin comfort you think would improve travel? Tell us below.","Airbus released report claiming 18-inch seats better for sleeping than 17-inch seats .

"A police cruiser draped in black banners and topped with a rose sat in front of the Jupiter, Florida, police department Monday morning, paying testament to a 20-year department veteran killed Sunday while helping escort President Barack Obama through Palm Beach County. Officer Bruce St. Laurent, 55, was traveling with the presidential motorcade around 4:45 p.m. Sunday southbound on Interstate 95 through West Palm Beach when he pulled his motorcycle onto an on ramp, so he could stop traffic from accessing the highway, according to a statement released Monday by Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Teri Barbera. The statement said St. Laurent drove into the path of a 1994 Ford F150 driven by Susan Holloway, 56, of West Palm Beach, as she was accelerating to merge onto the interstate. Holloway hit the brakes to avoid the crash, but she hit St. Laurent's motorcycle, knocking the officer from his motorcycle and trapping him under her pickup when the vehicles came to rest, the statement said. Jupiter Police Chief Frank Kitzerow said St. Laurent was transported to nearby St. Mary's Medical Center, where he died Sunday. Barbera told CNN the statement details preliminary findings, and the ongoing investigation ""could take months."" When the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and the Florida Highway Patrol complete their investigation, state attorneys will determine whether any charges will be filed in the case. CNN senior photojournalist Peter Morris, who was in the motorcade, said this presidential caravan was longer than normal. In addition to the standard package of SUVs, he said three buses, including the president's campaign bus, comprised Sunday's motorcade south through Florida. Morris said motorcycle police often act as escorts and handle intersection control for motorcades. This is at least the fourth fatal accident in recent years involving motorcycles accompanying motorcades for presidents or presidential candidates. In November 2006, three Honolulu motorcycle officers crashed on a rain-slicked road escorting President George W. Bush's motorcade. One of the officers died several days later from his injuries. The following August, an Albuquerque police officer was killed in a crash as President Bush's motorcade arrived at the airport. Then, in February 2008, a Dallas police officer was killed in a motorcycle crash during then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's motorcade. Kitzerow visited St. Laurent's family Monday morning to discuss funeral services, and memorial information will be made public when it is finalized, Jupiter police spokesman Sgt. Scott Pascarella said Monday. He added that in addition to the squad car memorial in front of the Jupiter police station, radio station 103.1 WIRK Country was there, raising money for St. Laurent's family. The Jupiter Police Department was working on setting up an account at a local bank to gather money for the slain officer's family as well, Pascarella said. WPTV: Officer honored in Jupiter . St. Laurent was born in Fall River, Massachusetts, in 1957, but moved to Jupiter in 1973, and had lived there ever since, according to a memorial statement on the town of Jupiter's website. He began his decorated career with the Jupiter Police Department in 1992. Three times, most recently in 2008, St. Laurent was named ""Officer of the Quarter,"" and in 1996, he was selected as ""Officer of the Year,"" according to the memorial. The memorial also credited St. Laurent with contributing to his community in several ways, including playing Santa Claus at local holiday events, helping high school students with physics experiments and helping Habitat for Humanity build houses for the needy. President Obama was notified of the death, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters after Air Force One landed Sunday night in Washington. Carney added that the president's thoughts and prayers were with the officer's family. The crash happened near the front of the president's motorcade, and Obama did not see it, Carney said. The White House spokesman said no other vehicles from the motorcade were involved. St. Laurent is survived by his wife of more than 30 years, Brenda, and four children, according to the memorial statement.","Police release details of accident that killed officer Bruce St. Laurent during motorcade .

"It was my least favorite part of being pregnant, hands down: Family, friends, even strangers felt the need to pat, rub or touch my expanding belly without asking permission. I cracked up every time. What is it about a pregnant woman's belly that makes the common sense rules of personal space fly out the window? A bother? Yes. A pet peeve? Sure. But an illegal offense? I am wondering if we're taking things a bit far. In Pennsylvania, there were rumors that a person could be charged for doing what a good number of people did to me and do to countless other moms-to-be. A Cumberland County man reportedly faced possible harassment charges after touching the belly of a pregnant woman -- a woman he did not know, according to attorney Phil DiLucente, who is not directly connected with the case but is familiar with the reporting about it. 'Expecting Better' pregnancy advice . ""There was a woman who was pregnant and (a) man had touched her belly area, which women have to go through all the time, and she didn't permit him to do that, and then he repeated it, so she decided to file charges,"" DiLucente said. (The Cumberland County district attorney has not returned our call.) ""Any time you harass, annoy, alarm another and there's touching involved without consent, someone can be charged with harassment,"" the Pittsburgh-based attorney said. He added that all states have similar harassment laws on the books, although he knows of no other case where the the law was applied to unwanted pregnant belly touching. DiLucente said he was ""surprised"" by the harassment charge, because what was previously considered acceptable behavior is no longer being tolerated, at least by one expecting mother. From Twitter to Facebook to e-mail, I found there was no shortage of opinion about whether it should be illegal to touch a woman's pregnant belly without asking. Mothers on what you don't expect when you're expecting . Jennifer Bosse, a mother of two and host of the blog Defining My Happy, said it's a ""really tricky"" question. ""Elderly grandmother that exclaims excitedly and touches your belly for the briefest of moments? Maybe mildly annoying but not a crime. Scary woman or man that grabs at your belly and continues to jiggle you around long after the first no? Crime,"" Bosse wrote in an e-mail. Dani Mathes said on CNN's Facebook page, ""Annoying? Sure. Illegal? Heck no. We can't have laws for everything. We already complain about having so many laws for minor crap."" ""If he doesn't know her well, then he should not touch her,"" said the person behind the handle @lizturn585859 on Twitter, adding that although it shouldn't be illegal, it's still not a ""good idea."" Beth Engelman, who has an elementary-school-age son and co-founded the site Mommy on a Shoestring, thinks people who ask intrusive questions or tell a pregnant woman what to do ""are way worse"" than people who pat pregnant women's bellies. ""It's not that I think it's OK to go up and pat a pregnant woman's belly, but I don't think it's harassment or should be illegal,"" said Engelman, a single mom in Chicago. ""Having strangers pat your belly, predict what you are having, ask about names or give you unsolicited advice is part of the experience."" The new dad learning curve . On the other side are readers like Jordan Elizabeth who believe unwanted rubbing of a pregnant woman's belly should definitely be considered a crime. ""Would you think someone should be charged with harassment for wandering around rubbing the stomachs of non-pregnant people in public without their permission? Because I am fairly certain someone would eventually call the police -- or more likely simply hit them,"" she said on CNN Living's Facebook page. ""I fail to see what about a woman being pregnant suddenly makes her body in any way the property of society. It's inappropriate touching and that is harassment under most penal codes,"" she added. Irene Issaias wrote on CNN's Facebook page, ""Any unwanted physical contact is an assault and battery so yes it is and should be illegal if it is not consented to by the mother."" Carrie Courter, also on CNN's Facebook page, said, ""If he had touched her breasts without her permission it would be a non story, as that is not allowed. Why is her belly any different?"" Said @MrNickCharles  on Twitter, ""As a former law enforcement officer, I always assumed unwanted touching of another is assault."" The great pregnancy food chase . While there may be a debate about whether unwanted pregnant belly rubbing should be against the law, there didn't seem to be any disagreement when it came to the act itself. Just stop doing it, folks, said many moms. Andrea Kristina said that when people would put their hands out to pat her pregnant belly on the grocery store line, she would take a step back. ""There is such a thing as 'personal space' and you wouldn't just walk up and touch every round thing that strikes your fancy otherwise, so why do that to a pregnant woman,"" Kristina posted on CNN Living's Facebook page. ""It's creepy and rude."" Laura Weinberg Kovall is a mom of one who runs Fit4Mom in New York, which offers fitness classes of all levels to moms. She said she never understood the urge to reach out and touch a pregnant woman's belly. ""Would it be OK to randomly touch a nonpregnant woman's belly? Never,"" Weinberg Kovall said. Diane Martin, also on CNN's Facebook page, said she was touched without her permission during both of her pregnancies. ""I got mouthy and pushed hands away,"" she said. ""Before I gave birth in July, I had my own personal bodyguard. My 4-year-old son told people to not touch my tummy. 'Only me, my daddy and the doctor can touch my mommy's tummy!'

"The vice president of Iraq -- the country's top Sunni politician -- pleaded for calm Monday following his death sentence in absentia, while lashing out at Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki over what he described as a politically motivated case. The fallout over the death sentence handed down to Tariq al-Hashimi has generated a political split along sectarian lines in Iraq, raising fears the conflict will translate into violence in the streets. ""The verdict is unjust, political and illegitimate and I will not acknowledge it,"" al-Hashimi told reporters in Ankara, Turkey, where he has been living since fleeing Iraq five months ago. The verdict was handed down Sunday, the same day a wave of bombings across Iraq left up to 94 people dead and more than 300 wounded. Al Qaeda in Iraq -- an umbrella group for predominantly Sunni insurgents -- claimed responsibility for the attacks in a post on Monday on a well-known jihadist web site. ""To my dear people, I say, make sure that al-Maliki and those who stand behind him don't get what he wishes. Because they want sectarian strife,"" al-Hashimi said. ""Whoever loves al-Hashimi and believes in my vision, do not target or harm any civilian or any resident in Iraq either by your action or your speech,"" he said. Al-Hashimi has vehemently denied charges of overseeing death squads that carried out more than 150 attacks, accusing al-Maliki of pushing the case as part of an effort to consolidate power and push the country toward a religious divide. ""Al-Maliki is pushing my country to a turning point with a deeply sectarian dimension,"" al-Hashimi told CNN in an interview earlier this year. At the time, he warned that the United States ""will face the same problem as they faced in 2003"" when a U.S.-led coalition toppled Saddam Hussein, igniting sectarian violence that nearly tore the country apart. Al-Maliki has dismissed the claims, saying there are a number of Sunnis in key government positions. Critics point to al-Maliki's failure to name ministers to key posts, including the ministries of interior and defense. Months before American troops withdrew from Iraq, U.S. military officials failed to get al-Maliki to fill what the ministry positions that are seen as essential to stability in Iraq. Al Qaeda in Iraq, also known as the Islamic State of Iraq, warned following a spate of attacks in July and August that it planned to rally Sunnis across the country. The claim has raised concerns that the group could unite Sunnis who feel disenfranchised by the political process. While sectarian violence has decreased since the height of the U.S.-led war in 2005 and 2006, there has been a sharp escalation in attacks in recent months. In July, the number of dead hit a two-year peak with 325 deaths reported, according to the Interior Ministry. That's the deadliest single month since August 2010, it said. The timing of al-Hashimi's death sentence also threatens to upend Iraq's fragile power-sharing agreement that has been mired for more than a year in political infighting. ""It was regrettable that the judicial decision against him was issued at this particular time and he is still officially in his position, which could become a factor that does not help or may complicate efforts to achieve national reconciliation,"" Iraqi President Jalal Talabani said in a statement Monday. Under the proposal, the three major governmental positions -- prime minister, president and parliament speaker -- were to be filled by members of the country's three largest ethnic groups: the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunnis. As late as July, the U.N. Security Council called on Iraq to carry out long-postponed political reconciliation talks, saying all sides need to refrain from making statements that could aggravate tensions over efforts to push for inclusive political talks and national reconciliation in Iraq. Lawmaker Nada al-Jabouri, a member of al-Hashimi's Sunni-dominated Iraqiya political party, criticized the timing of the sentencing. ""Iraq is preparing for a big national reconciliation in the near future in order to achieve stability in this country,"" he said. ""This will not help."" There are also questions about what the sentencing means for already tense relations between Iraq and Turkey. The two countries have been divided over Syria and the Kurdish militant group PKK, which has launched attacks from Iraq into Turkey for years in effort to gain Kurdish autonomy. Shortly after al-Hashimi's sentence was announced, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said he could remain in Turkey for as long as he wants, according to media reports. Al-Hashimi has refused to return to Iraq, saying he could not get a fair trial from a court backed by al-Maliki. Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council sentenced al-Hashimi to be hung for the killings of a female lawyer and an Iraqi army general, according to a court spokesman. Al-Hashimi can appeal the death sentence. The arrest warrant for al-Hashimi was issued late last year after his Iraqiya party announced a boycott of Parliament, saying al-Maliki was cutting it out of the decision-making process. His Sunni-majority party has since ended its boycott. The case appeared to largely rest on the purported confession of three men, who were identified as members of the vice president's security detail. Iraqi state television aired video of the confessions in December, though al-Hashimi's supporters said the confessions were coerced. CNN has not been able to verify the identities of the three men. Among the aired confessions was one by a man who detailed al-Hashimi's involvement in roadside bombings and shootings that targeted government and security officials in 2009. Al-Hashimi fled the same day the arrest warrant was issued, first to Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region north of Baghdad. He then went to Turkey. Iraq asked for help from Interpol, which issued a ""red notice"" that calls on the 190 countries that belong to the international police organization to help locate and arrest al-Hashimi. No action appears to have been taken to return al-Hashimi to Baghdad. He currently is living in a government house in Istanbul.","Death toll rises to 94 in Sunday's attacks .

"In a dry and dusty soccer field the boys shrieked and screamed as kids in the midst of a highly competitive soccer game often do. A neighborhood resident pointed towards another three boys on their bikes off to the side watching. ""See where they are? That is where the cars would pull up,"" he told me. ""They would drag a man out and execute him.  Some days it was more than one."" Just a few years ago, this same soccer field was an Al Qaeda killing ground where, like clockwork every day right before evening prayers, executions would take place, and young boys -- the same ages as those now playing soccer in front of us -- would gather to watch the macabre event, seemingly immune to the horrors they were witnessing. That was in February, when we were in Iraq filming stories for the 10-year anniversary of the start of the Iraq War. In April I found out that a couple of the boys we filmed were killed in a bombing down the road.  The bomb -- containing 2 kilograms of highly explosive material -- was hidden in a plastic bag, placed outside of a three-story building that had a popular ice cream parlor on the first floor.  The boys were there. This is the tragic norm of Iraq that people are forced to live with.  Violence few understand, fear that permeates every aspect of life, where even a simple action like taking children to eat ice cream can result in death. This past year has seen a marked increase in attacks, especially coordinated simultaneous strikes, a trademark of ISI -- the Islamic State of Iraq -- an umbrella organization that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. Baghdad is a maze of blast walls and checkpoints, with Iraqi security forces ""beefing up"" security but hardly accomplishing anything more than creating ever-more frustrating traffic jams.  The government touts instances when it has managed to diffuse bombs, but the harsh reality is that they simply cannot stem the violence. July was the deadliest month in Iraq in the last five years since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to the U.N., 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence last month. And on Saturday bombings spanning from Nassiriya in the south, to Baghdad, to Mosul in the north claimed dozens of lives and wounded nearly two hundred more.  It was Eid, the three day holiday that marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. The explosions mostly went off in predominantly Shiite areas -- at coffee shops, markets and bus stops. ""Where are the security forces?"" a man at one of the bomb sites asked angrily. ""If you -- Prime Minister Maliki -- cannot deal with security, let someone else!"" Anger and frustration among Iraqis is heartbreakingly palpable. The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility in a statement, saying that the violence was intended to be a message to the ""animals of Rawafdh 'Shiite' and their government."" Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) was once described by the U.S. military before it withdrew from Iraq in 2011 as being ""on the run.""  But that clearly is no longer the case. To start with, Iraq security forces were never capable of containing the ""security gains"" of the U.S.-military era. AQI and other Sunni extremist groups have capitalized on the predominantly Shiite-led government's failure to bring Sunnis into the political fold.  Iraq's Sunni population maintains that it is being systematically targeted by government forces and grows more alienated and disenfranchised by the day.  And Iraq remains a nation where violence and politics go hand in hand. AQI has also expanded its operations into Syria under the umbrella of ""Al Qaeda in Iraq and the Levant (Syria)."" Its head, who goes by the pseudonym Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi or Abu Dua'a, among others, is believed to be mostly operating out of Syria. But al Qaeda's resurgence and its operations are just one part of the messy and vicious patchwork of forces that govern this part of the world at the expense of the civilian population sucked into an existential battle that started millennia ago. Those forces include the ongoing regional struggle pitting Shiite Iran against Sunni Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- regional powerhouse who have found proxy battlefields in Syria and Iraq -- along with Russia and America. The fates of Iraq and Syria are growing more intertwined by the day, and it is the civilians always who continue to be victims of this lethal web of dynamics over which they have little control.

"(CNN) -- How cold is it? It's so cold, even polar bears and penguins were being kept indoors Monday. Anana, the lone polar bear at the Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago, has never grown the thick layer of fat that bears in their native Arctic develop to insulate themselves against winter temperatures that can range as low as -50 degrees F, zoo spokeswoman Sharon Dewar said. So when temperatures plunged well into the negative range in Chicago, Anana stayed in a 40ish-degree habitat, Dewar said. ""In the wild, they would seasonally eat seals and fatten themselves up with that blubber,"" Dewar said. But zookeepers ""don't feed them seals or fatten them up,"" she said. And at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh, both bald eagles and African penguins ""who are used to temperate climates"" were taken off exhibit until the weather warms up, the facility reported. Chicago saw a record low of minus 16 (minus 27 C) on Monday. The day's high was minus 11, with a windchill of minus 34. It's part of an Arctic blast that plunged deep into the central United States on Monday, leaving Nashville, Tennessee, 40 degrees colder than Albany, New York; Memphis 20 degrees colder than Anchorage, Alaska; and Atlanta colder than Moscow -- Russia or Idaho, take your pick. The bitter cold that a ""polar vortex"" is pushing into much of the United States is not just another winter storm. It's the coldest in 20 years in many areas. The South was downright balmy compared to the Great Lakes region, where temperatures hovered in the negative 20s -- before wind chill, which dropped temps to the negative 40s and in places like Minneapolis. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton ordered the state's roughly 2,000 public schools to close on Monday, the first such order since 1997. Many of those will stay closed Tuesday, including the three major districts around Minneapolis, where blowing snow shrouded bridges over the frozen Mississippi River. ""I've only been out of school four days ever, and today and tomorrow are two of the four days,"" said Graham Myers, who was going to a movie with several friends and his father. Wind chills in the 40-below range can cause frostbite in a matter of minutes, the National Weather Service warned. But there were those who reveled in it. ""I love the cold. I'm one of those crazy cold-weather Minnesotans who just enjoys this,"" Robert Pettit told CNN as he took a walk on a work break. If properly dressed, ""It's not so bad,"" he said. ""You dress up, put your mukluks on, get some gloves and a hat and you're set,"" Pettit said. Freeze toll 15, mostly from accidents . Authorities have blamed a total of 15 deaths on the cold so far, 11 of them from traffic accidents. But the the death of an Indianapolis woman found in her backyard early Monday ""is believed to be weather-related,"" police spokesman Kendale Adams told CNN. A man in Wisconsin died of hypothermia, and an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease who wandered away from her home in New York state was found dead in the snowy woods about 100 yards away, authorities there said. In addition, hypothermia was a contributing factor in the death of a patient at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, hospital spokesman George Stamatis told CNN. At the Salvation Army Harbor Light Center, a Minneapolis homeless shelter, Executive Director Bill Miller said 750 people came in off the street to spend the night Sunday. ""That's a record,"" he said. He said Harbor Light ""will take in everybody, no matter if they've been drinking or whatever their issues might be."" Further south, the chill was less brutal but still nothing to dismiss. In Fairfield, Iowa, at minus 9, CNN iReporter Deborah Roberts called Monday ""a good day to stay in and use the excuse it's too darn cold."" In Illinois, Gov. Pat Quinn called on state residents to stay off the roads and activated National Guard troops to help local authorities clear highways. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel urged residents ""to keep exercising good judgment and remain indoors if at all possible."" 8 tips to ease winter travel woes . The deep freeze has also snarled air traffic across the country, with more than 3,800 flights canceled by Monday evening, according to flightaware.com. Among those stuck waiting for a way home was New York resident Mindy Goldberg, whose family's flight back from Mexico had been diverted to Boston because of bad weather. ""I just called my kids' school to tell them they wouldn't be there, and she said, 'Everyone's stuck somewhere,' "" Goldberg told CNN affilliate WBZ. In Indianapolis, Los Angeles resident and iReporter Jason Bentley took some time out to play in the snow outside the airport after learning his flight home had been canceled Sunday. It was 15 below zero. ""This is the wettest snow I've ever touched,"" Bentley said. ""The easiest snow to make a snowman and to have snowball fights. It's also probably the worst (weather) I've ever been in because of the temperature."" The Northeast will be seeing its own swift drop in temperatures as the arctic air works its way east. In New York, where it was about 50 degrees with wind chill Monday morning, could go as low as minus 7 on Tuesday, said CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons -- a nearly 60-degree temperature change in a single day. Welcome to 'Chiberia' The National Weather Service adopted the Twitter hashtag ""#Chiberia"" for Chicago. Parts of the vast Siberian region, such as Tobolsk, had Fahrenheit temps in the low teens Monday, though other parts had temperatures of 50 below zero. Chicago opened up 12 centers for residents to seek warmth, one of which was to stay open all night through Tuesday. Libraries and some other city facilities would also be open, said Evelyn Diaz of the city's Department of Family and Support Services. Quinn said 100 warming centers were open statewide. The Southern Illinois University men's basketball team, fresh off a game against Illinois State, got trapped on the side of Interstate 57 late Sunday and was prepared to spend the night on the bus, SIU Athletic Director Mario Moccia said. There wasn't a massive amount of snow on the ground, Moccia said. Rather, it was the blowing snow that made the road virtually impossible to see. Players later tweeted that they were going to spend the night at a nearby church. ""Somehow this eventful day/night has led to our team sleeping on the floor of a church in Tuscola.

"Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States will help the Iraqi government in its battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but stressed it won't send troops. Speaking to reporters in Jerusalem on Sunday during his visit to the Middle East, Kerry said the United States is not contemplating a return to the volatile nation. U.S. military forces, which invaded Iraq and toppled the Saddam Hussein regime in 2003, fought insurgents there for years until they withdrew at the end of 2011. ""We are not, obviously, contemplating returning. We're not contemplating putting boots on the ground. This is their fight, but we're going to help them in their fight,"" Kerry said, noting that the United States plans to be in ""close contact with all of the Iraq political leaders"" to determine how to help them. ""We going to do everything that is possible to help them, and I will not go into the details except to say that we're in contact with tribal leaders from Anbar province whom we know who are showing great courage in standing up against this as they reject terrorist groups from their cities. And this is a fight that belongs to the Iraqis. That is exactly what the President and the world decided some time ago when we left Iraq."" Fighting in the predominantly Sunni Anbar province in recent days has posed a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his Shiite-dominated government, raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. Conflicting reports have the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), formerly the group commonly known as al Qaeda in Iraq, in partial control of Falluja, the site of some of the bloodiest fighting between U.S. forces and insurgents during the Iraq War. Sunni populist ire in Anbar . This weekend, the government claimed, the Iraqi army shelled the Anbar city of Falluja in an effort to clear out al Qaeda-linked fighters amid dueling claims by the terror group and government forces about just who was in control of the flashpoint town. But the conflict in Anbar is not black and white -- al Qaeda vs. pro-government troops -- according to local officials, political analysts and tribal leaders in Falluja and Ramadi. They say al-Maliki is spinning the strife to his political advantage. These sources say al-Maliki is trying to cite al Qaeda as a pretext to crush Sunni protesters and is using the same tack to get international support for his fight. They say he's trying to create the false impression that ISIS fighters control much of Falluja. ISIS has been working doggedly to exploit a security vacuum across Iraq. While there are pockets of al Qaeda-linked militants in Anbar cities such as Falluja, most regions in Anbar, including Falluja, are under the control of local police and Sunni tribes not aligned with militants, they explained. Fighting also has raged between these local tribes and the Iraqi army in Falluja. Violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a Sunni lawmaker in Ramadi and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in Falluja and Ramadi. Most Sunnis in Anbar have simply been angry at being regarded as second-class citizens in the majority Shiite country. They have been upset with the local and central government authorities, and these grievances have spurred an ongoing uprising against the Shiite-led government. Things are a bit more stable in Ramadi, Anbar's capital because the local government struck a deal with tribes to fight against ISIS. Al-Maliki is more supportive of local government in Ramadi than Falluja, according to these sources. Soldiers have not been stationed inside Anbar cities for nearly a year. Now, al-Maliki is trying to bring the soldiers back, a move prompting Sunni resistance. The deal the government made with some Sunni tribal fighters was comparable to a 2007 U.S. pact that saw Sunnis turn on al Qaeda, siding with American and Iraqi forces to bring about an end to the terrorism. The fighting between Sunni militants against Shiite-dominated forces was reminiscent of fighting during the height of the Iraq War in 2006 and 2007, when sectarian violence nearly tore the country apart. The analysts who spoke to CNN said that Shiites have more to fear in the conflict with Sunnis because they risk losing its newfound and widespread power after decades of domination by a large Sunni regime led by Saddam. The fight against the militants is ""bigger just Iraq' As for Kerry, he said the U.S. government is concerned that al Qaeda and ISIS ""are trying to assert their authority not just in Iraq but in Syria."" ""These are the most dangerous players in that region. Their barbarism against the civilians of Ramadi and Falluja and against Iraqi security forces is on display for everybody in the world to see. Their brutality is something we have seen before. And we will stand with the government of Iraq and with others who will push back against their efforts to destabilize and to bring back, to wreak havoc on the region and on the democratic process that is taking hold in Iraq."" Kerry called the fight against the militants ""bigger than just Iraq"" and the United States has an ""interest"" in helping an elected government ""push back against the terrorists."" ""The fighting in Syria is part of what is unleashing this instability in the rest of the region. That's why everybody has a stake. All of the Gulf states, all of the regional actors -- Russia, the United States, and a lot of players elsewhere in the world -- have a stake in pushing back against violent extremist terrorists who respect no law, who have no goal other than to take over power and disrupt lives by force. Violence raged in the capital of Baghdad on Sunday.

"A week after U.S.-led airstrikes in Syria began, lawmakers continued to question President Barack Obama's strategy for defeating the militant group ISIS, which he admitted in a televised interview Sunday was more powerful than the U.S. initially believed. Echoing sentiments also expressed by James Clapper, the head of U.S. intelligence services, Obama said the government ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" during its civil war, allowing Syria to become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world."" Speaking in a taped interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" Obama said the terrorists were remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq, which after being diminished by U.S. forces ""went back underground."" ""Over the past couple of years, during the chaos of the Syrian civil war, where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned, they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos,"" Obama said, adding later the U.S. also overrated Iraq's security forces, which were quickly overrun by ISIS when it took over the northern city of Mosul this summer. The President stressed that the issue in Iraq is not simply a military problem; it's a political one. ""This is America leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with, to make sure that they are able to take care of their business,"" he told ""60 Minutes."" The President added: ""If we do our job right and the Iraqis fight, then over time our role can slow down and taper off."" U.S. and its allies strike ISIS tank, refineries and checkpoints . Obama spent much of last week rallying international support for his mission against ISIS at the United Nations, telling leaders there the fighters represent a ""network of death"" that must be defeated. An air campaign, which began last week and included coalition support from five Arab nations, continued over the weekend with strikes on the northern Syrian city of Ayn al-Arab, where Kurdish forces have been battling ISIS. The mission is meant to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" ISIS, Obama says. The White House has remained adamant there won't be any U.S. combat forces deployed in Iraq or Syria, though military ""advisers"" have been sent to Iraq in the hopes of fortifying local security forces. The President warned the campaign probably won't conclude any time soon. ""There is a cancer that has grown for too long that suggests that it is acceptable to kill innocent people who worship a different God. ""And that kind of extremism, unfortunately, means that we're going to see for some time the possibility that in a whole bunch of different countries, radical groups may spring up -- particularly in countries that are still relatively fragile, where you had sectarian tensions, where you don't have a strong state security apparatus. ""And that's why what we have to do is, rather than play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops wherever this occurs, we have to build strong partnerships,"" Obama told ""60 Minutes."" Aides to Obama have been careful to underscore that the military operation in the Middle East won't resemble the wars of the past decade, which left many Americans skeptical of intervention abroad. ""We're doing this in a very different way than in the past,"" Tony Blinken, a deputy national security adviser, said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Candy Crowley. ""We're not sending in hundreds of thousands of American troops,"" Blinken continued. ""We're not spending trillions of American dollars.  What we are doing is empowering local actors with some of the huge assets we can bring to this, like our airpower, intelligence, training and equipping, advising and assisting."" The ""no boots on the ground"" mantra was questioned Sunday by House Speaker John Boehner, who said if local forces aren't trained to battle ISIS quickly enough, U.S. troops would be required. ""Maybe we can get enough of these forces trained and get 'em on the battlefield. But somebody's boots have to be there,"" the Republican leader said on ABC's ""This Week."" Boehner added later that if Obama advanced a new resolution authorizing the military action in Syria, he would be willing to call lawmakers back from the campaign trail to vote on it. Obama claims he doesn't need Congress' permission for the air campaign under way in Iraq and Syria, citing the 2001 authorization to go after al Qaeda. He has said he would ""welcome"" Congress showing its support for the mission. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said Sunday an authorization vote would allow lawmakers -- and by turn the American public -- to hear more about long-term plans in Syria. ""I think the reason that we need to have the debate is so that we can get a better explanation as to what the endgame is in Syria,"" Murphy, who sits on the Foreign Relations Committee, said on ""State of the Union."" ""In the end, that's the check on a war without end: a Congress speaking for the American people who can put an end date on an authorization for military force or put a limitation, so that you can't use ground troops,"" he said.","In a CBS interview, Barack Obama calls for a political solution in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- Six job recruiters have been indicted in federal court in what the FBI has called the largest human-trafficking operation ever to result in charges in the United States. An indictment unsealed in Hawaii on Thursday accuses employees of a California-based company of luring about 400 people from Thailand with false promises of lucrative jobs. Many of the imported workers wound up laboring on farms under substandard conditions, had their passports confiscated, and were threatened with deportation. In one instance, several Thai workers allegedly were detained at a pineapple farm on Maui and told to pay an additional fee of $3,750 to keep their jobs. Those who refused were sent back to Thailand with unpaid debts. ""The object of the conspiracy was to obtain cheap, compliant labor,"" said the indictment, ""indebted by the defendants' recruitment fees, and to compel the workers' labor and service through threats to have the workers arrested, deported, or sent back to Thailand."" The workers were brought to the United States under the federal H2-A visa program, which places foreign workers on U.S. farms. The case was investigated by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI in Honolulu, where many of the guest workers wound up. Four of those charged worked for labor recruiting firm Global Horizons Manpower Inc., based in Beverly Hills, California. Two Thai-based recruiters also were charged. The operation allegedly began in May 2004. Global Horizons President and CEO Mordechai Orian, 45, an Israeli national, was accused of leading the conspiracy. His attorney, Alan Diamante, did not return a message seeking comment. A call to the company was not answered. FBI agents went to Orian's home with an arrest warrant Friday morning, but he was not at home, said Special Agent Tom Simon in Honolulu, Hawaii. He said agents have been in touch with Orian by telephone and are attempting to negotiate his surrender to authorities. Attorneys for the Thai laborers said many of them initially were taken to farms in Hawaii and Washington state, where the working and living conditions were often deplorable. Other sites included California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah. Several guest workers alleged one of the defendants, Pranee Tubchumpol, promised them pay of $8.72 per hour, plus overtime, with a three-year employment contract. But when they arrived in the United States, they received a fraction of the money and were warned not to leave or talk with anyone outside the farm. ""Do not escape or flee because the police or Global [Horizons management] will find, deport, or send you back to Thailand,"" the workers were told, according to the indictment. The recruitment fees paid by the workers were reportedly as much as $17,000 each, with much of the balance to be paid in the United States, subtracted from the weekly wages. The indictment alleges many of the recruitment fees were financed by debts secured with the workers' family property and homes, which the government says kept many of the employees at the mercy of the defendants. Tubchumpol, who headed international relations for Global, is accused of being the liaison between the company, the guest workers and the Thai authorities. Tubchumpol, 44, was picked up in suburban Gardena on Thursday and had an initial court appearance in federal court later in the day, said FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller in Los Angeles, California. She is in federal custody and at some point will be transferred to Honolulu, Hawaii, Eimiller said. The first court appearance for any of the suspects is scheduled for Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Honolulu, said Special Agent Simon. He said the other suspects include Shane Germann, 41, who surrendered to the FBI in Fargo, North Dakota, Friday morning; and Sam Wongsesanit, 39, a resident of Kona, Hawaii, who is expected to surrender to the FBI early next week. Two others are residents of Thailand and are considered fugitives, Simon said. He identified them as Ratawan Chunharutai and Podjanee Sinchai, both females, and said FBI agents in the U.S. Embassy in Bangkok will be working with Thai officials to apprehend them. If convicted, all of the defendants would face sentences ranging from five to 70 years in prison. The company says it provides contract labor in 15 countries, including the United States, on four continents. ""Global Horizons Inc. thinks globally and acts locally with a post-9/11-worldview, one which understands that economies cannot continue to grow and prosper without an ample, qualified and legal workforce,"" says a statement on its website. ""Too, it understands the aspirations of countless workers who dream of having better jobs in better places, but who wish to return to their country of native origin when they've completed the job. This fulfills both the economic and security needs of the host country."" Global Horizons was cleared two years ago in a federal discrimination case from Washington state, where it was accused of favoring non-Hispanic farm workers in the hiring and firing process on local farms. Simon said the investigation is not over. ""There are more than a dozen Hawaii farms that utilized the labor of the alleged victims in this case,"" he said. ""None of these farms have been criminally charged in this indictment. The FBI is attempting to learn the extent that these farms were aware of the forced labor conditions of its workers. With few exceptions, the farms have been cooperating with our investigation."" And other investigations are likely, he indicated. ""There are more people living in forced labor today than when President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation,"" he said. ""As long as this is true, the FBI will continue to pursue organizations and individuals involved in human trafficking.""","Indictment unsealed in Hawaii accuses employees of a California-based company .

"Jay Carney is stepping down as White House press secretary, President Barack Obama announced on Friday. Obama said Carney told him of his decision in April, and Carney later said he plans to leave the position in mid-June. The President announced that deputy press secretary Josh Earnest will step into the role. Obama considers Carney ""one of my closest friends."" ""He's got good judgment. He has good temperament and he's got a good heart, and I will miss him a lot,"" Obama said. Carney previously spent 21 years in journalism, including a stint as Washington bureau chief for Time magazine, and Obama noted that he went from one of those asking the questions to the person behind the podium in the White House briefing room. He is Obama's second press secretary during the more than five years of his presidency. Carney took over in 2011 when Robert Gibbs stepped down, and has been Obama's chief spokesman through budget battles with Congress, the 2012 reelection, the rocky Obamacare rollout, the controversy over the Benghazi terror attack, the Edward Snowden NSA leaks, and now the scandal engulfing the Veterans Affairs Department. ""It's been an amazing experience,"" Carney told reporters. ""In midlife you don't often make a whole new set of friends, and not just friends, but people you would fight by and for under any circumstances and that's certainly what I have been lucky enough to get over these past five and a half years,"" he said. Carney said that he's had discussions about what's next for him but hasn't made any firm decisions. He was a former director of communications for Vice President Joe Biden before ascending to the White House job he has now. Carney's married to journalist Claire Shipman, a senior correspondent  for ABC News. As for Carney's successor, Obama called Earnest a ""straight shooter and a great guy.""

"The recent fighting in Iraq has posed a serious challenge to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki and his government, raising questions about his ability to hold the country together amid a rising insurgency. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the United States will help the Iraqi government in the battle against al Qaeda-linked fighters in western Iraq, but he stressed it won't send troops. Here are five questions about the deteriorating situation: . 1. I thought the Iraq war was over. Why is there still fighting? Well, actually last year was the deadliest since 2008. The number of dead reached its worst levels since the height of the Iraq war, when sectarian fighting between the country's Shiite majority and its Sunni minority pushed it to the brink of civil war. Those tensions continue to be fueled by widespread discontent among the Sunnis, who say they are marginalized by the Shiite-led government and unfairly targeted by heavy-handed security tactics. Al-Maliki tells troops not to strike Falluja neighborhoods . Sunni anger has made it easier for al Qaeda-linked militants to recruit and operate while eroding the public's cooperation with security forces. Violence has flared in recent days because of the arrest of a Sunni lawmaker in Ramadi and the dismantling of protest sites by the army in Falluja and Ramadi. Sunnis have rejected the authority of the government, and some Sunni officers in the army have deserted to fight Iraqi forces and attack police stations and prisons. Now fears are mounting that national elections in April will bring more violence and descend into civil war. 2. Wait, I thought al Qaeda was on the run? Now they control parts of Iraq? The U.S. made impressive gains in weakening the so-called ""core al Qaeda"" leadership in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but affiliate groups, specifically in Iraq, are gaining strength. Since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops, the Sunni-led group tied to al Qaeda, known as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), has staged a comeback amid Iraq's growing sectarian tensions and launched a series of bloody attacks on government buildings and personnel, killing thousands of civilians. ISIS has been working doggedly to exploit the security vacuum across Iraq. Conflicting reports say ISIS this weekend captured the western city of Falluja and took control of most parts of the principal capital of Ramadi. Iraqi troops are now battling insurgents in both places for control. 3. Falluja and Ramadi were pretty important to the U.S. during the Iraq war. Isn't the U.S. going to help? Both were important battlegrounds for the U.S. during the Iraq war. Falluja was an insurgent stronghold until U.S. Marines fought their bloodiest battle of the war in 2004 to drive militants out. In Ramadi, the U.S. supported the ""Awakening,"" in which tribal leaders turned on al Qaeda and aligned themselves with American and Iraqi forces to secure Anbar province. That was a turning point in the war. Now that U.S. troops are all out of Iraq, Washington is not eager to go back in. Kerry said Sunday the U.S. would help the Iraqis in their fight against al Qaeda, but ""this is their fight."" Kerry: We'll help Iraq but not send troops . 4. What does Syria have to do with it? The international community has long been concerned about spillover from the civil war in Syria, and the conflict is clearly helping to fuel violence and tensions in neighboring and tensions in Iraq. ISIS was formerly known as al Qaeda in Iraq but was renamed to reflect its growing ambitions in Syria and Lebanon. Their goal is to establish a single Islamic state, or caliphate, based on sharia law. Anbar province shares a 400-mile border with Syria and because of the power vacuum there, ISIS fighters move back and forth between the countries and mount attacks on both sides of the border. But with recent setbacks in Syria, ISIS has increased its attention to Iraq. 5. I heard these ISIS guys are in Lebanon, too? This region is a mess. There are signs ISIS may have its sights on Lebanon as well. The group said it carried out a suicide bombing on Thursday in a Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb of Beirut. And it warned about more attacks against Hezbollah if it continued to send fighters to Syria to defend Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against the rebels. Weak governments in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon have helped al Qaeda gain strength, and now Kerry calls ISIS ""the most dangerous players in the region."" Iraq, Syria and Lebanon are all seen by many experts as proxy wars between Shiite Iran and Saudi Arabia, a Sunni nation. A full-blown civil war in Iraq, in addition to Syria, could further increase sectarian tensions and destabilize the region. Still out there and growing -- al Qaeda on the rebound .

"A man shot and killed four children and two adults Wednesday at a Houston-area home belonging to relatives of his estranged wife, authorities said. A seventh person, a 15-year-old girl, was critically wounded in the shooting near Spring, Texas, and taken to a local hospital. Ron Lee Haskell was arrested after a three-hour standoff that followed a short chase with sheriff's deputies. Haskell, 34, is being held on charges of capital murder, Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman said. Killed were Stephen Stay, 39; Katie Stay, 33; two boys, ages 13 and 4; and two girls, ages 9 and 7, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said. Police said Haskell entered the home demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, who was not there. The house belonged to relatives of Haskell's spouse, and Haskell might have been an uncle by marriage to at least some of the children, but his relationship to everyone in the home wasn't immediately clear, Hickman said. ""I've not personally in 40 years seen a tragedy in one family that's this horrific,"" he told reporters Thursday morning. Officials: Suspect was prepared to take more lives . Haskell, apparently posing as a parcel delivery driver late Wednesday afternoon, entered the home of one of his estranged wife's relatives while only the children were there, Hickman said. Wearing a purple ""Fed-Ex-looking shirt,"" the suspect ""gathered up the children"" and waited for the two adults to arrive, he said. Haskell was not the slain children's father, as police had mistakenly asserted earlier, Hickman said. Haskell used to drive for a service that had a contract with FedEx, but not since January, FedEx spokeswoman Erin Truxal said. Investigators didn't immediately know what led to the shooting; Hickman described it as a ""domestic situation."" Authorities believe the suspect was prepared to take the lives of other relatives who lived nearby. As the gunman left, one of the victims called police and notified ""us of the location that she believed that he may go from there,"" Hickman said. ""Grandparents were also targets of him,"" Harris County Sheriff's Sgt. Thomas Gilliland said. ""Fortunately, they were brought out of the house before that could happen, (or) we would have had more tragedy."" Hours-long standoff . Haskell approached the second home and saw officers there; he drove away and the officers pursued him, Hickman said. Police trapped Haskell in a cul-de-sac, and he surrendered after about three hours, having had discussions with negotiators, Hickman and Gilliland said. During much of the standoff, Haskell held a gun to his head, while deputies surrounded him with their weapons drawn, police said. Haskell has children with his estranged wife, but those children were not believed to have been in the Spring-area home where the shootings happened, Hickman said. The estranged wife lives out of state, police said. Haskell is expected to make his first court appearance Friday at 9 a.m., the county clerk's office said. Spring is about 20 miles north of Houston.

"As Islamist militants battle Iraqi security forces for control of towns and cities not far from Baghdad, the capital has taken on the tense feel of a city under siege. There's a heavy police and military presence on the streets and at checkpoints that sometimes appear to pop up overnight. Nowhere is the sense of fear more palpable than at Baghdad International Airport, where hundreds and hundreds of people wait in long security and check-in lines for one of the few, precious seats available on flights out of Iraq. For days, the United States has considered what to do about the militants, and on Thursday, U.S. President Barack Obama said he is prepared to send military advisers to Iraq, adding that America was not returning to a combat role in the country. The Pentagon earlier presented Obama with a plan to send up to 100 special forces advisers to Iraq to work along with that country's military, several U.S. officials told CNN on Thursday. The U.S. withdrew its final troops from Iraq at the end of 2011, nearly nine years after leading the invasion of Iraq that toppled longtime leader Saddam Hussein. As the al Qaeda splinter group ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, continues its fierce advance in Iraq, senior U.S. officials tell CNN that the Obama administration is of the belief that Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is not the leader Iraq needs to unify the country and end sectarian tensions. The officials, along with Arab diplomats, say the White House is now focused on a political transition that would move Iraqis toward a more inclusive government -- one without al-Maliki that would include Sunni, Shiite and Kurdish factions. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, told Congress that the United States has received a request from the Iraqi government to use its air power in the conflict. Those discussions continued after Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, fell last week to ISIS. The militants were barely opposed by Iraqi security forces, many of whom abandoned their weapons and fled their posts. Airlines adding flights . Many people at the Baghdad airport are seeking safety in Iraq's Kurdish-controlled north, particularly Irbil, or in the southern port city of Basra. Others are trying to get out of the country altogether. To accommodate the exodus, airlines have begun adding flights and, in some cases, much larger planes. Still, there are few seats available as most flights, according to travel agencies, are sold out weeks in advance. Where once there was one Iraqi Airways flight a day to the northern city of Irbil, there are now three. On Thursday, a Royal Jordanian flight flew from Amman to Baghdad nearly empty. But it is oversold for its return, a flight attendant said. The fighters are now within 40 miles of the capital, where at least three people were killed and 15  injured Thursday when a car bomb and two roadside bombs exploded in three separate areas, police officials there told CNN. A few miles outside of the Baghdad airport, dozens of men waited in lines in the sweltering sun to answer al-Maliki's call to join the military's fight against the Sunni extremists. The Prime Minister, whose Shia-dominated government is accused of fostering sectarian tensions by marginalizing Iraq's Sunni and Kurd minorities, is facing growing calls from some quarters to stand down. Battle for Baiji oil refinery . Meanwhile, Iraqi security forces and Islamist militants clashed again Thursday as they battled for control of the nation's main oil refinery. Conflicting reports have emerged as to who has the upper hand. In a phone interview on state-run al-Iraqiya TV on Thursday, Col. Ali Al Qureshi, the commander of troops responsible for protecting the refinery in Baiji, some 140 miles north of Baghdad, said Iraqi armed forces were in full control. He said the militants had suffered dozens of casualties in the course of multiple attacks but had failed to take the refinery complex. But police officials in Samarra and Baghdad said ISIS fighters control 60% of the oil refinery. Dozens of vehicles full of militants launched a fresh assault on the sprawling refinery complex around 4 a.m. local time Thursday, the police officials said. Iraqi security forces are still trying to expel them and regain the control. Al-Iraqiya television reported that 40 ""ISIS terrorists"" were killed during the clashes. The Baiji refinery is a key strategic resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for internal consumption. There are already long lines at many gas stations across the country. Iraq is also a major exporter of fuel from oil fields in the country's south. As the U.N. World Food Programme highlighted the plight of a half-million Iraqis forced from their homes by days of fighting, the European Union announced it would give an additional 5 million euros ($6.8 million) in assistance to Iraq, taking the total to 12 million euros this year. ""This fresh wave of violence has terrible consequences for vulnerable children, women and men,"" said EU official Kristalina Georgieva. Militants seize Al Muthanna complex . Also on Thursday, ISIS militants took control of a facility Saddam Hussein once used to produce and store chemical weapons. But the State Department doubts that the Al Muthanna complex contains any material of ""military value."" ""The materials in the bunkers, which date from the 1980s, are of little military value and would be very difficult to safely move,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday. But ""the materials pose serious health hazards to anyone attempting to access the bunkers."" Calls for change of leadership . Al-Maliki struck a defiant tone Wednesday in a televised weekly address, saying Iraqi forces were on the ""on the rebound"" after their initial shock in the face of the militants' lightning advance. ""We will respond and keep the momentum,"" al-Maliki said. But despite al-Maliki's words, there's a growing chorus of calls -- both in Washington and in the Arab world -- for him to go if there is to be any hope of unifying Iraq as the Islamic militants advance. There's hope that a government bringing the Sunnis and Kurds into the political process would curb sympathies for ISIS by those who find themselves on the outside. However, al-Maliki maintains a strong grip on power and his party recently won national elections. The Prime Minister's office has not received any official statement asking for him to step down, al-Maliki adviser Ali al-Moussawi told CNN on Thursday. ""Nobody said this, and we have not received any official statement suggesting that al-Maliki has to leave his position,"" al-Moussawi said. While some on Capitol Hill aren't shy about saying his days as the Iraqi leader should come to an end, at the White House it's more of a whisper. The lightning-fast advance by ISIS has seen large portions of northern Iraq fall under its control. ISIS wants to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state, that would stretch from Iraq into northern Syria. Curbing sympathies . A change in government in Iraq can't come too soon for some in Washington . Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said al-Maliki has to be convinced that it's in the country's best interest for him to retire. ""I think that most of us that have followed this are really convinced that the Maliki government, candidly, has got to go if you want any reconciliation,"" she said this week. Publicly though, the White House isn't being as direct. Earlier this week in a Yahoo News interview, Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States shouldn't be dictating to the Iraqi people that al-Maliki needs to resign. ""Now, we clearly can play an encouraging, consultative role in helping them to achieve that transition, and we have people on the ground right now,"" he said. U.S. options . On Wednesday, Obama huddled with congressional leaders, briefing them on options he is considering. A few hours earlier, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Dempsey said they were working out details on possible U.S. steps that could include airstrikes on Sunni militants advancing through northern Iraq. House Speaker John Boehner demanded that Obama lay out a ""broader strategy"" but sidestepped a question about whether he supported airstrikes. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spoke out forcefully against sending U.S. service members into Iraq. ""This is an Iraqi civil war, and it is time for Iraqis to resolve it themselves,"" he said. In their meeting, Obama effectively told congressional leaders that while he'd let them know what was going on, he didn't need any new permission to act in Iraq. While a White House statement emphasized that Obama would continue to consult with Congress, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said the President ""basically just briefed us on the situation in Iraq and indicated he didn't feel he had any need for authority from us for the steps that he might take."" Several military sources have confirmed to CNN that manned reconnaissance flights over Iraq to collect up-to-the-minute intelligence on ISIS movements and positions have begun. Unmanned reconnaissance flights have been going on already for several days. Transcript: Obama's remarks on U.S. response to Iraq crisis . Obama announces military advisers going to Iraq .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan arrived in Maiduguri in northeastern Nigeria where the terror group Boko Haram is highly active, according to presidential spokesman Reuben Abati. Earlier the country's military said that Nigerian soldiers had thwarted a Boko Haram attack on Wednesday in the town of Biu in the restive northeastern section of the country. Critics have accused Jonathan's government of not doing enough to address the insurgency, which mostly affects opposition strongholds. Nigeria is holding presidential elections in February. Earlier this month, Jonathan launched his re-election bid in a raucous rally in Lagos. The Nigerian Defense Headquarters said five terrorists and two anti-aircraft guns had been captured. Officials gave no casualty tolls, but residents told CNN that at least 40 Boko Haram fighters were killed when they were surprised by Nigerian soldiers and fought a lengthy gun battle. Nigerian military disorganized, under-equipped in battle against Boko Haram . Scores of Boko Haram militants in 10 pickups and two motorcycles attempted to storm the town, 200 kilometers (about 124 miles) south of the Borno State capital, Maiduguri, around 7:30 a.m. local time. They were intercepted by soldiers from nearby military barracks, leading to two-hour gunfight, residents said. Dozens of troops lay in wait for the militants and opened fire on an advance team of three pickups carrying the gunmen near an airstrip 2 kilometers (1.25 miles) outside Biu, residents said. ""Soldiers killed 40 Boko Haram insurgents and foiled their attempt to take over the barracks and attack the town,"" said Biu resident Mahmud Bukar. ""All 30 gunmen in the three vehicles were killed by the barrage of gunfire from the soldiers."" The remaining gunmen who had camped at a gas station in nearby Kigir village mobilized and faced the troops in a fierce battle that lasted two hours, said Bashir Babagoni, another resident. The gunmen were overwhelmed and forced to retreat in disarray, according to witnesses. Satellite images show devastation of Boko Haram attacks . Soldiers, aided by local vigilantes, went on their trail in the bush while youths armed with crude weapons set up barricades in different parts âof the town to prevent infiltration by the gunmen. Residents trooped to the scene of the fighting to see the dead gunmen and their bullet-riddled vans, Babagoni said. Biu is a religiously mixed town and the largest in southern Borno. It is an important commercial center that includes a large military base. Although Boko Haram has carried out several raids on villages in the area in the past two years, Biu has never been attacked, residents said. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Last week, it brutalized a town and some villages near the border with Chad, killing hundreds, perhaps thousands of people. Human Rights Watch said it acquired satellite imagery that shows the results of fires set by Boko Haram. The rights group said 11% of Baga and 57% of Doro Gowan were scarred by the flames. Bodies still litter bushes from Boko Haram's 'deadliest' massacre . Boko Haram's brutal tactics have shocked and stunned the world. It has kidnapped students, including more than 200 schoolgirls who were abducted in April and remain missing. It has also strapped bombs to young girls and ordered them to blow themselves up in markets, according to one teenager who said she refused and fled the scene of an attack.

"It is a parent's worst nightmare: Your child goes to school, never to return home. Scores of Nigerians are living that horrific reality after 230 schoolgirls were abducted, allegedly by Boko Haram, under the cover of darkness on April 16. Of the hundreds of girls herded into vehicles, only 43 have escaped. And as their parents wait and hope, the government is grappling with an Islamist terror group that has gotten more brazen. So has its abductions of women and girls in northern Nigeria, the region most affected  by the insurgency. Why does Boko Haram kidnap girls? The Islamist militants' name translates to  ""Western education is a sin"" in the local language. The group especially opposes the education of women. Under its version of Sharia law, women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands, not at school learning to read and write. It has repeatedly targeted places of learning in deadly attacks that have highlighted its fundamental philosophy against education. The spate of kidnappings began in May 2013 when Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau announced in a video that this was part of its latest bloody campaign. The kidnappings, he said, were retaliation for Nigerian security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members. Those kidnapped, he said, would begin a new life as a ""servant."" Has it kidnapped girls and women before? Yes. In November, the militant group abducted dozens of Christian women, most of whom were later rescued by the military deep in a forest in Maiduguri. At the time of their rescue, some were pregnant  or had children, and others had been forcibly converted to Islam and married off to their kidnappers. Rights groups have said Boko Haram has kidnapped girls as young as 12. And the abductions are only getting worse. In the first two months of this year alone, it kidnapped at least 25 girls and women, according to Human Rights Watch. What does it do with the women? The group is always on the move to escape an intensified crackdown by the government, and members leave their wives behind when they scamper into hideouts deep into the forests . Some girls and women are kidnapped to take the place of wives, and perform chores and sexual services, according to rights groups. Does it target any particular schools? Those abducted are both Christian and Muslim students enrolled in secular schools. Not all cases involve kidnappings, however. Gun and bombing attacks on schools have killed hundreds of children in recent years. In February, the Nigerian military blamed Boko Haram for killing at least 29 students in an attack on a federal college in Buni Yadi in Yobe state. Another bloody example came last July, when 20 students and a teacher were fatally gunned down in the same state. What are the chances the girls kidnapped recently will be rescued? It won't be easy. For one, the hundreds of girls seized most recently  from the high school in Chibok were not in a central location where the government has a firm grip. The school is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) west of Maiduguri and some 600 miles from the capital of Abuja. Where exactly they went from there is unknown. The area where they are believed to be is remote and heavily forested. It's also close to Cameroon, which means that the captives and captors could slip through the porous borders into nearby countries, including Chad or Niger. And the large number of hostages may limit Nigeria's options. That means airstrikes employed in the past may not be possible, lest they kill captives in the process. A ground assault isn't a great option either -- not when it is done in unfamiliar terrain against entrenched, well-armed fighters. Who started Boko Haram? Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic young cleric, founded the group 12 years ago as part of his push for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. He was killed in 2009, but his group lived on. Boko Haram became more violent after his death as his supporters vowed to strike back. Human Rights Watch estimates that in the past five years, more than 3,000 people have been killed in the violence. Its  targets include government buildings, police barracks, newspaper offices, village markets, churches and mosques. Is the group tied to al Qaeda? The U.S. says the militant group has links to the al Qaeda affiliate in West Africa and to extremist groups in Mali. How closely related Boko Haram is to al Qaeda is hard to define. In one respect, at least, the groups are on par: As of November, they are part of the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations. Ansaru, an offshot of Boko Haram, is on the same list. What does Boko Haram want? It says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Africa's most populous nation, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. The northeast, where Boko Haram has been most active, is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in Nigeria. Islamists view the most powerful people there as corrupt, and accuses them siphoning off Nigeria's considerable natural resources and assets. Despite its vast supply of oil and natural gas, the World Bank says that about 54% of Nigeria's population can be considered ""extremely poor."" What is Nigeria doing to combat the group? Last year, President Goodluck Jonathan declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states -- Borno, Yobe and Adamawa. This declaration gave the nation's security forces wide latitude to go after suspected terrorists. But rights groups have accused Nigeria of going too far in using heavy-handed tactics such as illegal searches, torture and extrajudicial killings. The government's stepped-up campaign may have emboldened Boko Haram to become even more violent. Amnesty estimates that at least 1,500 people -- more than half of them civilians -- died in the first three months of 2014. ""The escalation of violence in northeastern Nigeria in 2014 has developed into a situation of non-international armed conflict in which all parties are violating international humanitarian law,"" said Netsanet Belay, an official with that rights group. ""Civilians are paying a heavy price as the cycle of violations and reprisals gather momentum."" The campaign has heightened some Nigerians' skepticism of their government. Some complain the wide array of criminal activity pinned on Boko Haram gives authorities liberties to make arrests or use deadly force with little oversight or consequences.

"(CNN) -- Joan Rivers started her career as a stand-up comedian quick to poke fun at herself -- at her body, her family responsibilities and being a misfit within an unaccommodating world. By the time she died Thursday at 81, Rivers had become a worldwide celebrity. But she was still a misfit, biting the well-groomed hands that fed her. The comedian was quick-witted and sharp-tongued, known for standing on the red carpet or presiding over her show ""Fashion Police"" and, she said, saying the things that other people were thinking. Rivers, the pioneering, sassy comedian whose gossipy ""can we talk"" persona led to a career as a headlining talk-show host, best-selling author and red-carpet maven, died a week after being rushed to the hospital after suffering cardiac arrest at a Manhattan clinic. ""My mother's greatest joy in life was to make people laugh. Although that is difficult to do right now, I know her final wish would be that we return to laughing soon,"" said her daughter, Melissa, in a statement. Joan Rivers dies at age 81 . Rivers' initial rise to fame was propelled by jokes about herself and her family duties. ""I hate housework,"" went one of her jokes. ""You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again."" ""I blame my mother for my poor sex life,"" went another. ""All she told me was 'the man goes on top and the woman underneath.' For three years my husband and I slept in bunk beds."" Rivers in her own words . Over time, her self-mocking shtick gave way to more pointed comedy, with shrewd and cutting insults aimed at celebrities and politicians. Comedians such as Roseanne Barr, Sarah Silverman, Kathy Griffin and Chelsea Handler owe a great deal to Rivers' brash, commanding personality, which was unusual when she first came up. ""My heart is torn in half,"" said Silverman in a tweet. ""She wasn't done."" iReport: Share your memories of Joan Rivers . She was a popular talk-show guest, most notably on Johnny Carson's ""Tonight Show,"" and used that platform to become one of Carson's regular guest hosts -- and, in 1983, his permanent guest host. But their relationship was severed when, in 1986, she became the host of her own talk show on Fox, then a new television network. Her show would air opposite the ""Tonight Show."" Carson, feeling betrayed, cut her off cold. She didn't appear on the ""Tonight Show"" again until Jimmy Fallon took over as host earlier this year. Rivers' Fox talk show was short-lived and its cancellation coincided with a dark period in her life, including the suicide of her husband-manager, Edgar Rosenberg, three months after the show was pulled. Still, the comedian eventually bounced back, first with a daytime talk show, then as co-host with daughter Melissa of E!'s red-carpet coverage. The two Rivers became mainstays of awards season -- later for the TV Guide Channel -- with Joan known for mocking celebrities and their outfits there and on the show ""Fashion Police."" Rivers also became known for her extensive plastic surgery, which -- in typical Rivers fashion -- she flaunted rather than played down. ""I've had so much plastic surgery, when I die they will donate my body to Tupperware,"" she said. 'Screaming her way through life' Joan Alexandra Molinsky was born June 8, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of a doctor. Her childhood home wasn't always a happy one; her mother, though gifted with a strong sense of humor, was critical, and her father was softhearted but tight with a dollar. Her parents argued over money regularly. Rivers attended Barnard College and had dreams of making it as an actress, a dream both parents discouraged. After giving up performing after college, she had a brief marriage, and then turned to comedy. She became a regular at Greenwich Village coffeehouses and was part of Chicago's Second City comedy troupe for a time. A 1965 booking on Carson made her career. She soon had her own talk show and kept up regular appearances on ""Tonight"" and several talk and variety programs. She met Rosenberg in 1965, not long after the Carson appearance. They married four days later. The two maintained a you-and-me-against-the-world attitude, as noted in a 1987 People article after Rosenberg's suicide. ""Joan and Edgar, pursued by the same ghosts and hurts, feeling mutually threatened by adversaries real and imagined, trusted only each other and existed as an island built from intense and protective loyalty,"" wrote the magazine's Richard Meryman. Rivers summed up the impact of his death bluntly, of course. ""All that happened to me,"" she told The New York Times, ""was my husband committed suicide, my daughter didn't talk to me for two years, and I was broke."" A year after Rosenberg's death, she joined the cast of Neil Simon's ""Broadway Bound."" Indeed, she often took refuge in work, whether it was writing books, mocking celebrities, starring in Las Vegas or even appearing in a documentary about her life, 2010's ""Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work."" Rivers was often a polarizing figure, recognized for her wit but feared for her underlying wrath. She was well aware of her personality, once describing herself as ""screaming her way through life."" Her relentlessness could serve her well, however. In 2009, she won an edition of Donald Trump's ""Celebrity Apprentice."" ""She had unbelievable stamina,"" said Trump Thursday. Some of the criticism she faced was standard Hollywood fare. In 1978, Rivers directed a movie, ""Rabbit Test,"" starring Billy Crystal as the world's first pregnant man. The reviews were mediocre. ""I sat in the midst of an audience that broke its silence only to yawn, take orders for popcorn, and (in the case of audience members under 5) break into tears,"" wrote Roger Ebert, giving the film one star. Rivers shrugged that off. ""Seventy percent of the critics have hated my movie,"" she told Ebert. ""The other 30% were geniuses, knew their work and were sensually attractive."" Nevertheless, she never directed again. 'It's my job to make them laugh' More recently, her red-carpet quips and ""Fashion Police"" commentary got her attacked as cruel. In 2013, Jennifer Lawrence noted of Rivers' chatter, ""They put values in all the things that are wrong and show that it's OK to just point at people and call them ugly and call them fat and they call it fun."" Rivers immediately struck back: ""She has been touched up more than a choirboy at the Vatican,"" she told the New York Post. And earlier this year, she abruptly left a CNN interview when asked about her ""mean"" reputation. She was also criticized for comments about the Cleveland kidnap victims, the Gaza conflict and for calling first lady Michelle Obama ""a trans."" Always, Rivers soldiered on. ""I don't want a warm hand on my shoulder. I don't want sympathy audiences. It's my job to make them laugh, and I'm a professional, and my husband was a professional,"" she told People two weeks after her husband died. She earned several honors over her career. She was nominated for a Grammy and a Tony, and won a Daytime Emmy for her early-'90s talk show. She had a successful jewelry line that she sold on QVC. She almost never apologized and rarely looked back. After all, she said, it was her bluntness that made her who she was. ""I succeeded by saying what everyone else is thinking,"" she said. Rivers is survived by her daughter, Melissa, and a grandson, Cooper. People we've lost in 2014 .

"The Islamic State terror group is now ""a credible alternative to al Qaeda"" that is ""expanding its presence"" with foreign fighters returning from Syria, and possibly Iraq, to their home countries, a U.S. intelligence official said Thursday. The official, who declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the information, has direct knowledge of the latest intelligence on the group, also known as ISIS or ISIL. According to an assessment, the group has grown in size since the spring and its takeover of Mosul in northern Iraq as more fighters from around the world have mainly traveled to Syria to join its ranks. The United States believes that while the group remains largely focused on its brutal takeover of large areas of Iraq, there is also an ""expansion of its external terrorist ambitions."" Some foreign fighters are returning to their home countries with orders to ""start new cells"" of terrorist activity, the official said. What to know about ISIS . While some members may have a desire to attack the United States, the group's leadership is still focused on establishing an Islamic caliphate. Still, they ""see conflict with the United States as inevitable,"" the official said. The United States believes a deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum in May by an alleged ISIS loyalist may be the kind of attack that could happen more often in western countries, possibly including the United States. U.S. law enforcement is watching a small number of Americans for possible affiliation with the group. How ISIS is overshadowing al Qaeda . ISIS foreign fighters may be operating somewhat independently of the organization's hierarchy, which the United States believes maintains lines of authority and even succession plans. The intelligence community is now updating its assessment of how many fighters may be loyal to the group, and the number could be more than 10,000, the official said. ISIS has taken advantage of the momentum it gained in Iraq over the past several months, resulting in a large number of new fighters joining up. Map: Where is ISIS? While it currently has funds from taking over oil facilities and other operations in Iraq, the United States believes that will not be enough to sustain ISIS if it tries to seize the entire country, the official said. The United States also is watching closely to see whether and at what point ISIS loses support from Sunni loyalists in Iraq. The U.S. calculation is that ISIS is taking advantage of its recent momentum. Because it is seen as ""successful"" in many areas, including Yemen and Africa where al Qaeda affiliates operate, they have gained support from some jihadists more widely. Who is the ISIS? In those areas, they also remain at odds with the core of al Qaeda in Pakistan led by Ayman al-Zawahiri and several of affiliates. The thinking is as momentum slows, ISIS will be ""under more pressure, reality sets in,"" the official said. ""We don't see the group as 10 feet tall.""","The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, is expanding its presence, official said .
Fighters loyal to ISIS could number more than 10,000 with some returning home countries .

"The United Nations and the United States are calling for an immediate investigation of Syrian activists' claims that the Bashar al-Assad government used chemical weapons in an attack on civilians. Anti-regime activist groups in Syria say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack outside Damascus, many of them women and children. Video footage and witness reports appeared to bolster claims that chemical weapons were used. President Barack Obama has directed the U.S. intelligence community to urgently gather additional information to try to assess whether chemical weapons were used Wednesday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday. At this time, she said, the United States is unable to ""conclusively determine"" chemical weapons use, but is focused on trying to nail down the facts, along with its international partners. Psaki said, as she has before, that if reports of chemical weapons use prove true, the president has a range of options available to him to respond. Later, a senior defense official told CNN that ""the military continues to refine options for Syria to be prepared for whatever the president might request down the line."" Psaki noted that Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone Thursday to Syrian opposition leader Ahmad Jarba; U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon; and French, Jordanian, Turkish and European Union leaders. Ban Ki-moon said the alleged incidents Wednesday need to be probed ""without delay."" Ban urged a Damascus-based team ""to be granted permission and access to swiftly investigate the incident"" and the United Nations is sending a formal request to Syria. ""He expects to receive a positive response without delay,"" his spokesperson said in a statement. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the matter is ""of utmost urgency"" and the ""allegations are exceptionally grave."" Pillay urged both the government and opposition to enable investigators ""to examine the site of the alleged attacks without any delay or obfuscation."" ""The use of chemical weapons is prohibited under customary international law,"" she said, noting that the prohibition is binding on the government and rebels. ""Whether or not chemical weapons were in fact used, it seems that once again in Syria many civilians have been killed in flagrant contravention of international law."" U.N. special advisers Adama Dieng and Jennifer Welsh similarly urged immediate access for the U.N. investigation. ""There is never any military justification for the use of chemical weapons -- whether by governments or anti-government armed groups -- given their horrific and indiscriminate impact,"" they said in a joint statement. International outrage . Suffering in Syria is clear, but cause and culprits are murky . The reports prompted international outrage, with a U.N. Security Council briefing called late Wednesday to discuss the situation. However, Russia and China -- consistent allies of the Syrian government -- reportedly blocked a formal resolution. Hours after the closed-door meeting, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told CNN affiliate BFMTV that ""a reaction of force must be taken"" if the allegations are true. ""If the U.N. Security Council cannot do it, decisions will be made otherwise,"" Fabius said. But, he said, sending ground troops to Syria is out of question. Chemical weapons frightful, relatively inexpensive . Fabius also added his voice to calls for a U.N. team currently in Syria to investigate previous claims of chemical weapons use by either side to be given access to the site of the alleged massacre outside Damascus. If al-Assad's regime ""has nothing to reproach itself with,"" it should let the U.N. weapons inspectors investigate the alleged attack, Fabius said. ""If the Syrians refuse, that means they have been caught red-handed,"" he said. Turkey urges decisive action . Speaking on a visit to Berlin, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called on the United Nations to act decisively, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported. Davutoglu said ""all red lines"" have been crossed without the United Nations taking action in Syria and that the body ""can't assume an undecisive attitude about chemical weapon attacks"" there. ""If the Syrian regime is confident enough, it should allow the U.N. team to investigate (the chemical attack claims) immediately,"" he added. Speaking alongside him, German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said the reports from Syria ""are serious and, should they be confirmed, outrageous."" He demanded a prompt explanation of the reported chemical weapons use, and also called for the U.N. chemical weapons team to be allowed access. ""I regret that Russia and China have blocked a formal resolution of the Security Council,"" Westerwelle said. Al-Assad's government denied the claims on state-run media Wednesday, calling them ""completely baseless."" ""Everything that has been said is absurd, primitive, illogical and fabricated,"" said Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi on state TV. He said the claim was timed by the opposition to coincide with the U.N team's visit and came as government forces were making gains on all sides against the rebels. CNN could not immediately verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not authenticate the number killed or injured. Israel: World paying lip service . Yuval Steinitz, Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs, told Israel Radio on Thursday morning that its intelligence assessments indicated that ""chemical weapons were used, and they were not used for the first time."" Syria strikes refugee camp in northern Lebanon . He accused the international community of ""paying lip service"" when it comes to Syria. ""Nothing practical, significant, has been done in the last two years in order to stop the continuing massacre of civilians carried out by the Assad regime,"" he said. ""I think that the investigation of the United Nations is a joke."" The White House said Wednesday that officials were ""working urgently to gather additional information."" It called for the U.N. team in Syria to be given immediate access to witnesses and affected individuals, and to be allowed to collect evidence unhindered by the government. ""If the Syrian government has nothing to hide and is truly committed to an impartial and credible investigation of chemical weapons use in Syria, it will facilitate the U.N. team's immediate and unfettered access to this site,"" the statement said. But U.S. senator and former presidential candidate John McCain was strongly critical of the administration's handling of the situation in an interview with CNN's ""New Day"" on Thursday. He said chemical weapons use was ""obvious from the pictures when you see the dead bodies of children and women and others stacked up."" McCain said he was ""sure and confident"" that al-Assad had used chemical weaponry before, and that Barack Obama's failure to act on what the U.S. president had said would be a ""red line"" had given the Syrian leader a green light to use these weapons again. McCain called for the United States to take military action from outside Syria's borders to prevent that happening, saying it could ""very easily"" do what's needed to take out Syrian runways and aircraft and establish a no-fly zone. Witness: Convulsions, trouble breathing . The Syrian civil war has killed more than 100,000 people and displaced millions, according to the United Nations. There have been repeated allegations that chemical weapons were being used during the course of the conflict. The latest alleged attack took place in eastern and western Ghouta, rebel strongholds that the regime has been fighting to take back for more than a year. Initially, Syrian opposition groups claimed that hundreds were killed Wednesday, but as the day wore on, the number went up -- more than 1,300 people, according to the opposition Local Coordination Committees and the Syrian National Council. The council is an umbrella group of anti-regime activists. Video posted Wednesday shows people carrying limp bodies, some haphazardly covered in sheets, others splayed, nearly nude, on the floor. A man is on his back, staring blankly upward, his chest convulsing violently. Others hold tissues to their mouth, appearing to gag. Dr. Abu Said at a field hospital in Sakba, east of Damascus, told CNN how the injured started streaming in shortly after predawn prayers Wednesday. Forty of the 200 people brought to the field hospital died, Said said. A man who referred to himself as a volunteer first responder, Abu Gazi, said he was with a doctor at a field hospital in Arbeen who reported 300 people dead and 500 wounded. The symptoms, he said, included unconsciousness, foaming from the nose and mouth, constricted pupils, fast heartbeat and difficulty breathing. People died of asphyxiation, he said. ""The inspectors will not come,"" said a resident who didn't want his name used. ""If they wanted to come, they would have come a long time ago. ""The Assad regime determines where the inspectors go, and they will not let them go there. There is already a siege around eastern Ghouta from the Assad regime."" 'Held to account' Rights group Human Rights Watch also called Wednesday for the U.N. inspection team to be given immediate access to the area. ""Whether or not chemical weapons were used, the attack left a large number of civilians dead, and those responsible for unlawful killings should be held to account,"" it said. U.N. children's agency UNICEF said the reports of Wednesday's attack on civilians were deeply disturbing and that those who failed to protect children must be held accountable. Bashar al-Assad is all smiles on his new Instagram account . Syria's official news agency, SANA, quoted Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Thursday as saying the rebels must be behind any chemical weapons attack, if confirmed, as ""they do not hesitate to commit any crime."" Russian officials, meanwhile, dismissed the claims of chemical weapons as a ""provocation planned in advance,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich told Interfax news agency. He suggested it was  timed to coincide with the visit by the U.N. team.","U.S. military ""continues to refine options"" says a senior defense official .

"Seattle (CNN) -- A suspect in the attempted bombing of a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade frequently posted his beliefs on white supremacist websites, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. According to the Law Center, in 2004 Kevin Harpham posted, ""I can't wait till the day I snap,"" on the Vanguard News Network online forums, a white supremacist site. ""Who was the person during WW2 that said something like (sic). Those who say you can't win a war by bombing have never tried,"" another posting purportedly by Harpham read, according to the Law Center. On the Vanguard website, Â­which advertises itself as ""No Jews. Just Right,"" Harpham posted over 1,000 comments, according to the Law Center. Although the posts did not carry Harpham's name directly, Law Center officials said they had come to know him by his writing, and recognized his work as it appeared on line. ""He'd been on our radar screen for some years,"" said Mark Potok, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project. ""He wasn't a major character but we were aware of him."" Harpham was arrested Wednesday outside his home in Addy, Washington, about 55 miles from Spokane, where on January 17 a bomb was found along the route of the city's Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade. A bomb squad rendered the device inert. Officials called the situation an instance ""of domestic terrorism"" that could have caused ""mass casualties."" An official briefed by law enforcement but not allowed to speak to the media regarding the investigation said the bomb was ""chilling"" in its sophistication. The bomb contained anti-coagulant chemical agents intended to make anyone wounded by the blast ""bleed out,"" the official said. The bomb was surrounded by metal shrapnel and designed to go off by remote control, the official said. Roger Peven, a court-appointed attorney for Harpham, said he had no comment on the internet postings and had not decided on a plea for his client, who, he said, is unemployed. ""It's too early,"" he said, ""We are awaiting to see what the grand jury does."" A grand jury is expected to hear evidence in the case on March 22, the day before the next court hearing is set for Harpham. He has been charged with the attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and possession of an unregistered explosive device. A conviction for attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, according to prosecutors. The attempted bombing was an unwelcome reminder for many residents of the region's past with white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups. ""It was called 'the Northwest imperative,'"" said the Southern Poverty Law Center's Potok, ""It was a call to other white supremacists to move to the Pacific Northwest and populate the area with their own people. A nation within a nation. As ludicrous as that sounds, hundreds of white supremacists moved to the area and many still remain to this day."" Many of the postings the Southern Poverty Law Center cited Harpham as writing on white supremacist websites were written under the pseudonym ""Joe Snuffy,"" military slang for a low-ranking soldier. Harpham served in the U.S. Army at Fort Lewis from June 1996 to February 1999 as a fire-support specialist in the 1st Battalion, 37th Field Artillery Regiment, according to a release from Joint Base Lewis-McChord. ""He would have had to fire rounds down range,"" base spokesman Joseph Piek said. ""That's a long way to allegedly making bombs."" But postings that the Southern Poverty Law Center said Harpham authored alluded to his Army service. ""This could be a long story but to make it short I went in the army in 96' and learned that n----- were an entirely different critter than I had thought they were,"" said a 2007 post by ""Joe Snuffy,"" posted on the Vanguard site. ""I realized I was at war and didn't even know it.""","The Southern Poverty Law Center monitors hate groups .

"The cold snap that wreaked havoc on eastern and central Europe this week moved west on Saturday, triggering a rare snowfall in Rome and prompting Heathrow Airport to cancel some flights. Ukraine appears to be the worst affected so far, with Poland, Romania, Serbia and Belarus also suffering much more severe winter conditions than usual. A total of 122 people have frozen to death in Ukraine since the cold spell started more than a week ago, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported, citing government ministries. More than 1,500 people have been hospitalized, it said. In Rome, residents woke up to snow for the first time since 1985. The rare precipitation caused traffic jams and left some people stranded. While further west, in London, Heathrow Airport said it would cancel approximately 30% of its flights on Sunday in response to the winter weather. ""This decision ensures that the greatest number of passengers can fly with the minimum amount of disruption. It also means that those passengers whose flights are canceled will know in advance, and can make alternative arrangements or rebook in relative comfort,"" said Normand Boivin, chief operating officer for the airport. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said the challenge now faced by many people is that the cold spell is lasting so long. The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26, Ramos said. Now, although temperatures are becoming more moderate, the snowfall will be very heavy. Twenty-nine people had died in Poland as of Thursday, according to the publicly funded Polish Radio's news website. Other cold-related deaths have been reported in Serbia, Romania and elsewhere in the past week.","State media: 122 people have frozen to death in Ukraine .

"Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki gave up the fight Thursday to keep his post, clearing the way for a new leader that many hope can hold Iraq together as the country battles brutal extremist fighters. In a televised address, al-Maliki withdrew his candidacy for a third term and endorsed the Prime Minister-designate, bringing to an end a political battle that just days ago saw him vow to hold onto power as he ordered tanks into the streets. ""I announce to you today that I am withdrawing my candidacy in deference to my brother, Haider al-Abadi, in the highest interest of the country,"" he said. The news -- first flashed on state television -- follows mounting pressure, at home and abroad, for al-Maliki to step aside and make way for someone to bridge the sectarian divide that many accuse him of fomenting. The move comes at a critical time in Iraq as Sunni fighters with the so-called Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, force hundreds of thousands from their homes as they seize large swaths of land. Al-Maliki's announcement came the same day that U.S. President Barack Obama declared the ISIS siege that trapped thousands in the Sinjar Mountains over, but warned the crisis is far from solved. While humanitarian airdrops and U.S. airstrikes saved those stranded from starving and provided safe passage off out of the mountains, the Yazidis arrived by the thousands at camps in and outside Iraq. Al-Maliki will continue to serve as the country's caretaker Prime Minister -- as well as its top military commander -- until al-Abadi forms a new government. Al-Maliki's acquiescence was a turnaround for the man, who in recent days called the appointment of al-Abadi unconstitutional and said he would not step down. He had gone so far as to file a lawsuit in federal court to stop the formation of a new government and ordered tanks and soldiers loyal to him into the streets of Baghdad, raising concerns of a possible coup. But with world leaders, diplomats, members of his own political party and the country's most revered Shiite cleric pressuring him to step down, al-Maliki gave up the fight. Calling it in an ""honorable decision"" by al-Maliki, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged al-Abadi to move quickly to form the government, saying it is essential to pulling the country's various ethnic and religious groups together to fight a common enemy in ISIS. Who's Haider al-Abadi, the man who will lead Iraq? While Iraq works to seat a new government, Obama said in a televised address on Thursday that the United States will continue to conduct airstrikes to protect U.S. personnel and facilities. The United States carried out airstrikes Thursday against three ISIS targets northeast of the Kurdish regional capital of Irbil, according to the U.S. Central Command. The targets were U.S.-manufactured mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles, more commonly known as MRAPs, and other armored vehicles being driven by ISIS fighters. The vehicles are believed to have been seized by ISIS after it routed Iraqi troops in northern Iraq. Also, there were reports that ISIS fighters were advancing south and west of Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (149 miles) north of Baghdad. At the same time, Obama urged Iraq's Shiite-dominated government to seize ""the enormous opportunity of forming a new inclusive government"" under al-Abadi. ""He still has a challenging task in putting a government together, but we are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction,"" he said. The new battleground in Iraq appeared to be spreading to the south and west of Kirkuk, where ISIS fighters occupied four towns to the south and west of Kirkuk, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, a researcher at the Journalistic Freedom Observatory. According to his sources in the field, there was fighting ongoing between ISIS and Kurdish fighters, known as Peshmerga, in the town of Tuz Khurmatu. The town is home to a number of Turkmen, an ethnic minority in Iraq. The United Nations  estimates that more than 400,000 people have been driven from their homes since June, when ISIS swept across the border from Syria into Iraq. Of those displaced, more than 200,000 have poured into northern Dohuk province in recent weeks, where refugee camp populations have swelled since ISIS began its assault against Yazidis, Christians, Kurds and Shiites. Thousands of other refugees sought protection inside the northern Kurdish region of Iraq. ""To be blunt, we don't have housing for all of them. We don't have shelter,"" a spokesman for the U.N. human rights commissioner, Edward Colt, said at a camp near the Peshkhabour bridge where Iraqis are entering the area. ""Thousands of tents are being erected as we speak."" Yazidi refugees were also fleeing across the Iraqi border into Syria. As of Thursday, there were about 15,000 Yazidi refugees from Iraq who arrived at the Newroz camp in Syria, the U.N. refugee agency said. Thousands more are arriving, the agency said. The Yazidis fled last week in the Sinjar Mountains as ISIS overran the city of Sinjar. A senior commander said ISIS fighters abducted more than 100 Yazidi women and children from the community. The ISIS commander, who has knowledge of the events that unfolded, said the fighters killed a large number of men when they took over the town more than a week ago. ""At that time, they took Yazidi women and children, and I can confirm those women and children have entered Mosul,"" the commander said by telephone. ""...The Islamic State is taking this opportunity to call them to Islam."" While CNN cannot independently confirm the claim, it follows reports by survivors who describe ISIS fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children.","Secretary of State John Kerry says al-Maliki made an ''honorable decision''

"How hard is it to create a website to help people get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act? For three 20-year-old programmers in San Francisco, it took about three days' worth of work. Spurred by the problems that have surrounded the rollout of the official HeathCare.gov site, the trio created an alternative, Health Sherpa, quickly and cheaply. At first glance, it looks like a triumph of tech-startup nimbleness over government inefficiency. George Kalogeropoulos, who created the site along with Ning Liang and Michael Wasser, said all three of them had tried using the government website to get insurance. ""We were surprised to see that it was actually fairly difficult to use HealthCare.gov to find and understand our options,"" he told CNN. ""Given that the data was publicly available, we thought that it made a lot of sense to take the data that was on there and just make it easy to search through and view available plans."" The result is a bare-bones site that lets users enter their zip code, plus details about their family and income, to find suggested plans in their area. ""The Health Sherpa is a free guide that makes it easier to find and sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. We only use carefully vetted, publicly available data,"" the site reads. ""The Health Sherpa is not affiliated with any lobby, trade group or government agency and has no political agenda."" Tech experts enlisted to help fix Obamacare website . The Sherpa are an ethnic group in Nepal, some of whom have long served as guides for people climbing Mount Everest and other mountains in the Himalayas. The name has come to be used generically for any kind of guide or mentor. Of course, it's not fair to compare the creation of Health Sherpa to the rollout of the more complicated government ACA site, which everyone from President Obama on down has acknowledged as a horribly botched affair. For one, you can't actually use Heath Sherpa to sign up for coverage. The site states that it's for research purposes only, and that users must verify the premiums and subsidies they find there with state health care exchanges, insurance companies or on HealthCare.gov itself. ""It isn't a fair apples-to-apples comparison,"" Kalogeropoulos said. ""Unlike Healthcare.gov, our site doesn't connect to the IRS, DHS, and various state exchanges and authorities. Furthermore, we're using the government's data, so our site is only possible because of the hard work that the Healthcare.gov team has done."" But it does cast light on the difference between what can be done by a small group of experts, steeped in Silicon Valley's anything-is-possible mentality, and a massive government project in which politics and bureaucracy seem to have helped create an unwieldy mess. NY government website lists bakery, mechanic for Obamacare help . Creating the original Sherpa site took three days and cost ""several hundred dollars,"" according to Kalogeropoulos. The three programmers have continued fine-tuning the site as its popularity has grown. In less than a week, the site has had almost 200,000 unique visitors and over half a million page views, he said. ""We've heard from people of all ages and walks of life, and thousands of people have reached out to us directly via email, phone, and Twitter to thank us to and to suggest features and request improvements,"" he said. ""Tens of thousands of  people have clicked through to buy a specific plan, suggesting that we are achieving our goal: helping people find a health insurance plan."" Maybe the Obama administration can learn from the Sherpa example. As it scrambles to fix the heath care site, the government  has sought to inject a little more Silicon Valley into the process by enlisting a ""Tech Surge"" of staffers from Oracle and Red Hat, as well as Michael Dickerson, a site reliability engineer on leave from Google.","Three 20-year-olds create alternate site that lets people search for health care .

"The ground just swallowed him up. A Florida man fell into a sinkhole that opened suddenly Thursday night beneath the bedroom of his suburban Tampa home, calling out to his brother for help as he fell, the brother said Friday. ""I ran toward my brother's bedroom because I heard my brother scream,"" Jeremy Bush told CNN's ""AC360."" ""Everything was gone. My brother's bed, my brother's dresser, my brother's TV. My brother was gone."" Bush frantically tried to rescue his brother, Jeff Bush, by standing in the hole and digging at the rubble with a shovel until police arrived and pulled him out, saying the floor was still collapsing. ""I couldn't get him out. I tried so hard. I tried everything I could,"" he said through tears. ""I could swear I heard him calling out."" Jeremy Bush and four other people, including a 2-year-old child, escaped from the blue, one-story 1970s-era home in Seffner, a Tampa suburb. Sinkholes: Common, costly and sometimes deadly . What began with hopes of rescue turned into a body recovery operation after monitoring equipment failed to detect any signs that Jeff Bush survived the fall into the hole, according the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. Rescuers still hadn't gone into the hole -- it's too dangerous, Fire Chief Ron Rogers told reporters. Authorities say they worry the hole is still spreading and the house could collapse at any time. ""Until we know where it's safe to bring the equipment, we really are just handicapped and paralyzed, and can't really do a whole lot more than sit and wait. It's a tough situation. It's even tougher for the family,"" Rogers said. The sinkhole is about 20 feet to 30 feet across and may be 30 feet deep, said Bill Bracken, president of an engineering company assisting emergency workers. The hole was originally reported to be 100 feet across, but that is the diameter of the safety zone surrounding it, Bracken said. ""It started in the bedroom, and it has been expanding outward and it's taking the house with it as it opens up,"" he said. As the sinkhole continued to deepen, nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. Check out images of the sinkhole house . On Friday, the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office released a 911 call from the night before. ""The house just fell through,"" a female voice says on the recording. She asks for an ambulance and the police. ""The bedroom floor just collapsed, and my brother-in-law is in there. He's underneath the house,"" she says. Jessica Damico, Hillsborough County Fire Department spokeswoman, said about 40 police and firefighters were standing by at the scene Friday morning. Meanwhile, engineers hoped to use more sophisticated equipment to get a three-dimensional image of the sinkhole. Family members were also on hand, waiting out what they feared would be a devastating day. ""I'm praying that there's an air pocket in there ... but I can't see nobody surviving that long in a hole like that. There was too much dirt, too much stuff,"" Jeremy Bush said. ""He was my brother, man, I loved him."" Sinkholes are common in Florida, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. The state lies on bedrock made of limestone or other carbonate rock that can be eaten away by acidic groundwater, forming voids that collapse when the rock can no longer support the weight of what's above it. Hillsborough County is part of an area known as ""sinkhole alley"" that accounts for two-thirds of the sinkhole-related insurance claims in the state, according to a Florida state Senate Insurance and Banking Committee report. But Mike Merrill, county administrator for Hillsborough County, stressed Friday that the sinkhole in question was not ""your typical sinkhole."" ""They still have not been able to find the boundaries of the underground chasm. For that reason, we're being very deliberate, he said. ""We're very frustrated. But we're pursuing it as quickly as we can, as safely as we can.""","Man's brother talks to CNN's ""AC360"" about trying to save his brother .

"If you're traveling over the holidays, chances are you're not looking forward to spending time in a crowded, stressful airport. Faced with the prospect of long waits, deafening public-address systems, and indigestion, you may quickly lose that festive feeling. O'Hare Airport in Chicago ranked third because 90 percent of its restaurants offer low-fat, fiber-rich, veggie-heavy meals. Still, airports are not all bad. In fact, based on research Health magazine has done to find America's Healthiest airports, some are actually working hard to make your traveling experience healthier by offering nutritious food, special relaxation zones, walking paths, the latest safety technology, and a whole lot more. We scored the nation's major airports, see how we did it, and then asked a panel of expert judges (meet them here)  to help us choose the top 10. Congratulations to the winners. And to those airports that failed to make our list: Please shape up! 1. Phoenix Sky Harbor International . 42 million passengers per year . Our top scorer won rave reviews for its commitment to a comfortable, low-stress experience for flyers. Sky Harbor's healthful dining options scored well on the annual Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine airport-food scale, which measures the percentage of eateries with healthy offerings at major airports. Tempting low-fat choices include Yoshi's Asian Grill's avocado-cucumber sushi and edamame, Roadhouse 66 Bar's veggie burgers, and Oaxaca's vegetable burrito. ""Burrito spots are great in airports because they often have several options that are healthy and fast,"" says judge Amy Lanou, Ph.D., a senior nutrition scientist for PCRM. Also elevating the Phoenix experience is a video-paging system that lists and announces names, making them accessible amid the usual din. There are even two pet parks where traveling canines can work off energy before or after a flight. And the airport is always open to change: After a family with a disabled son suggested upgrades, the airport recently added adult changing stations to its family bathrooms. Plus, the airport's bathrooms are widely known as some of the nation's cleanest. 2. Baltimore/Washington International . 21 million passengers per year . Baltimore/Washington International now features soft music and comfortable lighting at one of its key security checkpoints, instead of the usual crowding and confusion. The changes are part of the Transportation Security Administration's new Checkpoint Evolution program designed to reduce stress and hike safety. ""High-stress areas are the perfect camouflage for bad guys,"" says TSA spokesperson Christopher White. To take stress down another notch, walk the BWI Trail, a 12.5-mile hiking-and-biking path that circles the airport and goes through wetlands and forest areas; it's accessible from public areas of the terminal. Still stressed? Get a seated massage at the Destination Relaxation spa. Health.com: America's healthiest spas . 3. O'Hare International (Chicago) 76 million passengers per year . Big airports usually have a great selection of healthy food, Lanou says. That's one reason why O'Hare International, the second-busiest airport in the world, is in PCRM's top 10. More than 90 percent of its 100 restaurants offer low-fat, fiber-rich, veggie-heavy meals. CIBO Express, for instance, has grilled veggie salads and kosher crackers and chips. O'Hare also wins points for its super-fun children's play areas and the fitness facility in its on-site Hilton Hotel, which offers workout equipment plus massages, a sauna, a lap pool, showers, and a Jacuzzi. Day passes are $15. 4. Detroit Metropolitan . 36 million passengers per year . A white Christmas is wonderful -- except when it ruins your travel plans or makes them unsafe. Detroit Metro is working hard to limit the risks. The National Weather Service recently recognized the airport as the nation's first ""StormReady airport system."" Airport police officers, firefighters, and field-maintenance and security personnel are being trained as weather spotters; if they're aware of approaching storms, they alert airline employees (who consider boarding delays), disseminate information to keep ticket-holders from being stuck at gates without knowing why, and develop evacuation and sheltering plans. And should the weather delay you in Detroit (always a possibility during the winter), finding a healthy meal is easy. The airport partners with local health organizations to flag heart-healthy dishes on restaurant menus. Sushi, anyone? Health.com: America's healthiest restaurants . 5. Denver International . 50 million passengers per year . The largest airport in the United States can also boast about its energy efficiency. Acres of solar panels provide enough electricity to run half the airport's train system. The green electricity dramatically reduces carbon emissions -- equal to the impact of 255,000 gallons of gasoline (enough to power 500 cars for a year). The airport also has a recycling system built into the runways and taxiways to collect 70 percent of the glycol used to de-ice aircraft. ""You've got to tip your hat to Denver International for establishing themselves as a model,"" says judge Steve Howards, executive director of the Clean Airport Partnership, a nonprofit group devoted to improving environmental quality and energy efficiency at airports. Denver also receives high marks for its close-to-75-percent on-time arrival and departure rates, the second-largest public art collection in Colorado, free Wi-Fi, and healthy restaurant choices. Health.com: America's healthiest grocery stores . 6. Washington National . 19 million passengers per year . Anything that helps you take your mind off the fact that you're in an airport waiting to be crammed into a tiny airplane seat is a good thing. The museum-quality artwork at Ronald Reagan Washington National is the perfect diversion. Architect Cesar Pelli integrated 30 works -- stained glass, marble and glass mosaics, terrazzo, cast bronze, hammered aluminum and copper, and traditional paint on board and canvas -- into terminals B and C. If your flight's got a major delay, you can even get some fresh (fume-free) air at this airport: Try the walking-and-biking trail that goes through the airport grounds; flyers can access it by exiting terminal C. Our judge Tom Parsons, CEO and founder of BestFares.com, also gives Washington National props for being one of the easiest airports to get around in because of its one big terminal. 7. Dallas/Fort Worth International . 60 million passengers per year . There's no better place for a family layÂ­over than Dallas/Fort Worth International (DFW), which has two 600-square-foot play areas that feature padded airplanes, taxis, and luggage for climbing, plus a TV showing kids' cartoons. DFW also scores high for its green fleet. Of the airport's 580 vehicles, from buses to lawn mowers, 540 are hybrids or run on compressed natural gas. And thanks to restaurants like Tequilerias, which serves nutritious options such as jicama and mango salads, the airport stands tall in PCRM's food rankings. 8. Logan International (Boston) 28 million passengers per year . If you're a green fanatic, you'll love this: Logan's terminal A, its biggest, is the world's first airport terminal certified by the U.S. Green Building Council for using the highest green construction standards. It features roofing that reflects heat, special stormwater-filtration devices, low-flow faucets, waterless urinals, self-dimming lights, recycled construction materials, and more. And Logan's compressed-natural-gas shuttle buses prevent 7 tons of pollution emissions from reaching the atmosphere and causing smog every year, the equivalent of taking nearly 800 cars off the road. You care more about comfort than the environment? Logan pampers all weary travelers with 50 wooden rocking chairs, 16 decorated by local artists. 9. Portland International (Oregon) 15 million passengers per year . You'd expect an airport in the crunchy Northwest to go all-out for the environment. Portland doesn't disappoint with a paved bicycle-and-walking path that links local hotels, businesses, and regional hiking and biking trails to the airport. The airport offers free covered bicycle parking adjacent to the terminal, too. Our judges also laud Portland's recycling of cooking oil into biodiesel fuel, the abundance of live trees in the terminals, and the musicians -- mostly local stationed throughout the airport to lower the stress level. ""Loudspeaker noise on top of ambient noise is really hard on your senses,"" Lanou says. ""The whole traveling experience is a lot easier when you know you don't have to listen to just PA-system announcements."" Not surprisingly, Portland's Laurelwood brew pub offers certified-organic beers. And the airport gets high marks for on-time departures: 80-plus percent in the latest Transportation Department annual reporting period. 10. Philadelphia International . 32 million passengers per year . If you get sick at the airport, what do you do? In Philadelphia you can head straight to the new AeroClinic, where nurse practitioners and physician assistants can diagnose and treat minor conditions like colds, allergies, and flu. The facility also offers well-care checks for people who have high blood pressure, cholesterol, thyroid problems, and diabetes. If you're feeling fine, get a dose of heart-healthy wine at Vino Volo, the airport's new wine-tasting bar. And if you're traveling on a Saturday or Sunday, bring your laptop because Philly International features free . Wi-Fi weekends to help you keep your mind off the stresses to come.

"Heavy snow left several Italian villages paralyzed and without power as winter weather and cold temperatures spread across Europe, the mayor of one village said. Many of the 32 villages in the Aniene Valley, near Rome, lost electricity on Friday when an electric pylon fell because of the snow, said Piero Moscardini, mayor of Vallinfreda. The valley, home to about 50,000 people, has received some 100 cm (39 inches) of snow, Moscardini said. ""It's the worst snow since 1956,"" he said. ""The situation is tragic. We need the Army to save us."" Ambulances cannot traverse the roads, he said, and some villagers cannot reach their stables to feed livestock. Meanwhile, deaths continued to increase from the cold. In Romania, four people died on Saturday and another six on Sunday, authorities said. A total of 34 people have died since the cold snap began in late January. Nineteen national roads and one highway remained closed on Sunday. More than 30 cities and villages are isolated, authorities said, and power outages were reported in 200 cities and villages. More than 3,000 employees belonging to the Interior Ministry were involved in rescue operations, as hundreds sought refuge in temporary shelters and hundreds more were hospitalized because of hypothermia. In Poland, TVN Poland said a total of 53 people have died, eight of them in the past 24 hours. The victims are mainly homeless people, according to the report. Heathrow Airport, one of the world's busiest international airports, canceled about half of its flights Sunday, its owner said Sunday -- about 260 more flights than it expected to cancel as of the night before. Between two and four inches of snow fell on London overnight, as the British capital became the latest European city to be hit by winter weather wending its way west. Drivers in both London and Rome will need to worry about ice as temperatures rise slightly, then fall again to below freezing, CNN meteorologist Tom Sater said Sunday. Eastern Europe will have a much rougher ride, with temperatures in Moscow plunging far below freezing, and snow sweeping into the continent from the southeast. But Heathrow's runways were clear as of Sunday afternoon, owner BAA said. It was not immediately clear why more flights were being called off, as Heathrow spokeswoman Alexandra Blomley said the airport's snow plan ""has worked far better than in previous years."" Heathrow and other British airports have been snarled by snow about once a year for each of the past several years. The airport's chief operating officer urged travelers to check before coming to the airport so they would not be left stranded there. Normand Boivin said Heathrow ""deeply regret any disruption caused to passengers by the cold weather,"" but said: ""Reducing the flight schedule means we can fly as many people as possible and return the airport to normal as quickly as possible."" The airport did not say how many passengers were affected, but did say it expected to operate a normal flight schedule Monday. Rome was blanketed in a rare snowfall Saturday. Landmarks such as Rome's Colosseum were dusted with snow for the first time since 1985. The rare precipitation caused traffic jams and left some people stranded. Barb Mayer, who lives about 20 miles northeast of Rome, said she woke Saturday to a snowfall ""unlike anything I've seen since I've had my house in Italy."" ""Our house is out in the country and nobody clears the roads here,""  said Mayer, an iReporter who teaches English to business clients in Rome. ""Even in Rome, they don't have the equipment for snow removal since it snows so infrequently."" ""It usually takes my daughter an hour to drive home (to Palombara-Sabina) from Rome, but last night it took her four hours because of the traffic and the poor road conditions,"" she said. By Sunday, traffic was clearing, a taxi driver said, and temperatures were rising. However, Rome's Mayor Gianni Alemanno was being criticized for the city's handling of the weather. Schools and public offices will be closed on Monday, the city said. But Sarajevo, Bosnia, canceled school for a week as the Balkan city was hit by the biggest snowfall since 1999. Snowdrifts that were 110 centimeters (43 inches) high snarled the center of the city, with even more snow in the hills around it. The news was not all bad, said Amina Sofic, a 20-year-old medical student. ""People in Sarajevo like to play in the snow, to ski or board because we have lots of hills. And now that there is no traffic, it's pretty fun to go on sleds (or) go walking,"" said Sofic, a CNN iReporter. Ukraine appears to be the worst affected so far, with Poland, Romania, Serbia and Belarus also suffering much more severe winter conditions than usual. A total of 122 people froze to death in Ukraine since the cold spell started more than a week ago, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported Saturday, citing government ministries. More than 1,500 people have been hospitalized, it said. The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26. Now, although temperatures are becoming more moderate, the snowfall will be very heavy, meteorologists say. Other cold-related deaths have been reported in Serbia elsewhere in the past week.","Several Italian villages are isolated by heavy snow, without power .

"Eastern and central Europe continue to shiver under a blanket of heavy snow Friday, with more deaths reported after bitter cold overnight temperatures. Ukraine is probably the worst affected, with Poland, Romania, Serbia and Belarus also suffering much more severe winter conditions than usual. Thirty-eight people have died of hypothermia in Ukraine over the past 24 hours, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported Friday morning, citing government ministries. The latest deaths take the total number killed in Ukraine in the cold spell that started January 27 to 101, the news agency said. Meanwhile, temperatures in the Ukrainian capital, Kiev, continue to plummet. Friday morning's lows dipped to 27 degrees below zero Celsius (17 degrees below zero Fahrenheit), and it was the ninth day in a row that temperatures had dropped below minus 15 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit). Twenty-nine people had died in Poland as of Thursday, according to the publicly funded Polish Radio's news website. Other cold-related deaths have been reported in Serbia, Romania and elsewhere in the past week. Are you there? Share your story with iReport . Joe Lowry, spokesman for the International Red Cross Europe Zone, said many people across the region are in urgent need of help. ""If 163 people have frozen to death on the European streets, it is a disaster,"" he told CNN. The homeless and elderly are among the most vulnerable, Lowry said, as well as those who often find themselves on the margins of society, such as alcoholics or people with mental health issues. He said the Red Cross is helping people by providing warm clothing, boots, hot drinks and food, as well as shelter in heated tents and moral support. Local authorities must also react effectively to the crisis to save lives, he said. The sudden start to the bitter cold weather after what had been a mild winter for some parts of Eastern Europe caught many people unaware, Lowry said. He added: ""The human body is not designed to withstand temperatures of -32 degrees Celsius (about -25 degrees Fahrenheit). If you are not well nourished, if you don't have the right clothes to wear, if you don't have shelter, you cannot possibly stand them for long."" The International Red Cross has released just over â¬108,000 ($141,000) from its disaster relief fund to help deal with the emergency, with about one-third going to Belarus and two-thirds to Ukraine, an online statement says. More funds are needed to help pay for supplies, fuel for volunteers' vehicles and publicity to get information out to those in need, Lowry added. CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said the challenge now faced by many people is that the cold spell is lasting so long. The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26, Ramos said. Now, although temperatures are becoming more moderate, the snowfall will be very heavy, particularly for Bosnia, Serbia, Hungary and Romania. Some areas could get an additional half meter (20 inches) of snow. Ramos advises people to be ""weather aware"" in how they dress, making use of layers and keeping dry if at all possible. In extreme temperatures of minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit) or lower, exposed skin can freeze in less than 30 minutes, she said -- and even faster if clothing is wet. People should wear a hat and gloves, and cover their ears, nose and mouth to help them regulate their temperature, she said. A state of emergency has now been declared in 23 municipalities in Serbia because of the snow, the state-run news agency Tanjug reported Friday. Six people have died from the cold in Serbia, and one is missing and presumed dead, the news agency Tanjug quoted emergencies official Predrag Maric, of the country's interior ministry, as saying Thursday. About 11,500 people have been cut off from the world by heavy snowfall, Maric told the agency. Europe's cold blast extends all the way to Africa, with rare snow falling in parts of the Sahara Desert in Algeria and Morocco, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. More snow is expected this weekend for some areas that see snow fewer than once a decade. Cold and snow warnings stretch from Portugal to Finland, with 25 countries posting warnings, Miller said. It's been snowing in central Italy for almost a week and there is more forecast for the next two days. Ferrari's plans to unveil a new car for the 2012 Formula One season Friday were dashed by heavy snowfall at the Italian team's Maranello factory. The legendary brand had planned to showcase the new car, which they hope will win them a first drivers' championship since 2007. Eastern England will see significant snowfall this weekend, including London which could see 5 to 10 centimeters (2 to 4 inches) accumulate. Temperatures will rebound this weekend in Eastern Europe, but a significant snowstorm will make travel conditions treacherous from the Aegean Sea all the way to Moscow, Miller added.","The Red Cross releases $141,000 in emergency funds to help those in need .

"More deaths were reported in Eastern Europe on Thursday as the region continued to shiver in the grip of unusually frigid weather. The coldest temperatures continued to chill the Eastern European countries of Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, where Thursday was the coldest day yet for many. In Ukraine, 65 people have died since the bad weather started this week, according to the Ukranian Emergency Ministry. Of those, 47 were homeless. Others died in their homes or in hospitals as a result of frostbite and hypothermia. Health officials say that more than 1,100 people have sought help for hypothermia and frostbite over the past six days, the state-run Ukrinform news agency reported, and more than 900 of them have been treated in hospitals. The authorities have opened more than 2,200 heated tents for people who do not have heating in their homes. Most schools in the capital, Kiev, are closed through the weekend. Temperatures there dipped to 25.5 degrees below zero Celsius (13.9 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) Thursday, the coldest night in 83 years, according to Ukrinform. Conditions in eastern Ukraine are among the toughest because high winds are common there, and it is a poor area. Many homes still have a Soviet-era heating system, which is prone to break down. Temperatures are expected to drop as low as 35 degrees below zero Celsius (31 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) overnight Thursday to Friday in parts of the country. CNN International meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said eastern and central Europe are being hammered by a ridge of high pressure that is pulling in cold Siberian air. The trend will continue Friday, she said. In Poland, 29 people have died as a result of the freeze, the publicly funded Polish Radio's news website reported, up from only half that number a day earlier. Temperatures plummeted to 34 degrees below zero Celsius (29 degrees below zero Fahrenheit) in the Bieszczady mountains in southeastern Poland overnight, the website said. The country's southern, eastern and central provinces are most affected by the cold, with temperatures expected to fall even lower overnight into Friday. Some schools are closed because their heating is inadequate to cope with the conditions. Katarzyna Najorczyk, vice principal of a high school in Bydgoszcz, said, ""Kids' safety and health is the most important."" Police are continuing to search for homeless people to take them to shelters. In Szczecin, Arkadiusz Oryszewski of the Phenix Association said, ""During the last days of cold weather, our team had to go out to bring new people every two hours. Only tonight, seven people were brought, and this morning we have three men so far."" Six people have died from the cold in Serbia, and one is missing and presumed dead, the Serbian state-run news agency Tanjug quoted emergencies official Predrag Maric, of the country's interior ministry, as saying. About 11,500 people have been cut off from the world by heavy snowfall, and a state of emergency has been declared in 14 municipalities, Maric told the agency. More icy rainfall and snow is expected. Temperatures in Bucharest, Romania, dropped below 21 degrees below zero Celsius (minus-6 Fahrenheit) for the fifth consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. Romanian Transport Minister Anca Boagiu said, ""It's a moment when we cannot play games with nature, but we have to respect the force of nature. We have to protect ourselves and our families."" In western Turkey, heavy snow is expected to continue through Friday morning. Some city administrations sent workers home. Temperatures in the capital, Ankara, dipped to 19 degrees below zero Celsius (minus-2 Fahrenheit), and snow continued to fall there as well as in Istanbul. Farther west, much of central and northern Italy has been blanketed by unusually heavy snowfall. Air and road travel has been disrupted, and many professional soccer games have been canceled because of the bad weather. CNN iReporter Luca Martini said heavy snow had fallen in the northern Italian city of Ferrara. The 12-centimeter (5-inch) snowfall is quite unusual for the area, he said, and is causing traffic problems. Miller said a strong high-pressure area -- named ""Dieter"" by the Free University of Berlin, which has responsibility for naming highs and lows in Europe -- is currently bringing down the frigid Siberian air and keeping Europe in the teeth of its worst cold spell in years. The heart of the cold air is now migrating slightly to the north, he said, and the most extreme temperatures will probably be found in the Baltic states and eastern Scandinavia as the week goes on. An area of low pressure moving in from the Mediterranean will help the temperatures rebound somewhat in eastern and southeastern Europe, Miller said, but the system will bring heavy snow and storms, which will make travel even more treacherous.","Kiev has its coldest night in 83 years .

"Renewed accusations that Woody Allen molested an adopted daughter two decades ago were ""engineered by a vengeful lover,"" the filmmaker's lawyer told CNN on Monday. The allegations were ""fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities,"" Allen attorney Elkan Abramowitz said in a written statement. The controversy dates back to 1992 after the revelation that Allen, then 56, was having an affair with Soon-Yi Previn, Mia Farrow's 19-year-old adopted daughter with composer Andre Previn.  Allen and Previn married five years later. Allen's legal and public relations teams scrambled to respond to an open letter written by Dylan Farrow and published by The New York Times on Saturday recounting her allegation that Allen sexually assaulted her when she was a child. ""What's your favorite Woody Allen movie? Before you answer, you should know: when I was seven years old, Woody Allen took me by the hand and led me into a dim, closet-like attic on the second floor of our house,"" Farrow wrote. ""He told me to lay on my stomach and play with my brother's electric train set. Then he sexually assaulted me."" When Mia Farrow's 12-year relationship with Allen ended two decades ago, the actress accused him of molesting Dylan, one of two children she had adopted with Allen. The charge triggered a child custody battle, with Allen going to court to get both adopted children and Satchel, their biological son, who now goes by Ronan Farrow.  But a police investigation of the allegations ended without charges against Allen. ""A team of investigators from Yale-New Haven Hospital that was retained by the Connecticut State Police subsequently concluded Dylan had not been abused,"" according to an account in the Times, which covered the custody proceedings. Acting Justice Elliott Wilk of New York's State Supreme Court ""said it was unlikely that Mr. Allen could be prosecuted for sexual abuse based on the evidence,"" the newspaper reported. ""But while a team of experts concluded that Dylan was not abused, the judge said he found the evidence inconclusive."" A former prosecutor who decided against pressing charges in the case declined to comment on the details in Dylan Farrow's letter Sunday. ""As a prosecutor I really can't comment on the substance of the statement of this now young woman. As a father of a child not too much older than this young woman, I can only say I hope she finds some peace and solace in the way she's expressing herself,"" former Connecticut State's Attorney Frank Maco said. ""I hope she had access to my written statement of decision. My statement is as valid today as it was 20 years ago."" In 1993, Maco -- who's since retired -- told reporters he believed there was probable cause to arrest Allen. But he said he decided not to press charges, with Mia Farrow's support, ""rather than exposing the child to possible harm."" Allen's team responds . Allen's lawyer responded in a statement e-mailed to CNN on Monday: ""It is tragic that after 20 years a story engineered by a vengeful lover resurfaces even though it was fully vetted and rejected by independent authorities. The one to blame for Dylan's distress is neither Dylan nor Woody Allen."" Allen denies Farrow's allegation . Allen representative Leslee Dart said in a prepared statement Sunday that Allen ""read the article and found it untrue and disgraceful.""  He would respond ""very soon,"" Dart said. ""At the time, a thorough investigation was conducted by court appointed independent experts,"" Dart said. ""The experts concluded there was no credible evidence of molestation; that Dylan Farrow had an inability to distinguish between fantasy and reality; and that Dylan Farrow had likely been coached by her mother Mia Farrow. No charges were ever filed."" Dylan Farrow's letter addressed this: ""Woody Allen was never convicted of any crime. That he got away with what he did to me haunted me as I grew up,"" she wrote. ""I was stricken with guilt that I had allowed him to be near other little girls. I was terrified of being touched by men. I developed an eating disorder. I began cutting myself."" Her letter and Twitter postings by Ronan Farrow attacking his estranged father come as the 78-year-old director and his latest film -- ""Blue Jasmine"" -- are up for honors during Hollywood's annual award season. When the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gave Allen a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes last month, his son tweeted: ""Missed the Woody Allen tribute -- did they put the part where a woman publicly confirmed he molested her at age 7 before or after Annie Hall?"" Dylan Farrow's letter appeared in Times columnist Nicholas Kristof's blog just hours before the Writers Guild Awards ceremony, for which Allen had been nominated for best screenplay for ""Blue Jasmine."" He did not win. Academy voters begin casting Oscar ballots on February 14.  Allen and his cast are up for three Academy Awards, including best original screenplay for Allen, best actress for Cate Blanchett and best supporting actress for Sally Hawkins. Dylan Farrow admonished actors by name for ""turning a blind eye"" and for continuing to work with Allen. CNN reached out to the stars that Dylan Farrow challenged by name in her letter but has not yet received responses. In a series of Twitter posts Sunday, actor Alec Baldwin, who starred in ""Blue Jasmine,"" fired back at people asking him to respond to the allegations. ""You are mistaken if you think there is a place for me, or any outsider, in this family's issue,"" he wrote. In another post, he slammed someone who asked whether he owed Dylan Farrow an apology: ""What the f&@% is wrong w u that u think we all need to b commenting on this family's personal struggle?"" Ronan Farrow's tweet puts Allen in harsh spotlight -- again .","Dylan Farrow accuses Woody Allen of sexually abusing her when she was 7 .

"Eastern Europe remained in the grip of brutal cold and deep snows Tuesday, with authorities in Ukraine, the hardest-hit country, scrambling to help thousands of people whose lives are at risk due to the weather. At least 250 people have already died across the region during the cold snap, with 135 of the dead in Ukraine. Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated and can supply hot food and drinks to people with nowhere else to go. Kiev alone has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said -- among the most vulnerable to winter. About 2,000 people have been hospitalized due to the cold since January 27, officials said. Electricity consumption in the country is at historic highs, Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Boyko said. Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow in contrast to the northeast, which is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages,  said CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. ""All of Europe will be well below normal,"" Ward said, ""10-15 degrees below normal."" Cold air arriving from Siberia has been hitting maritime moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, turning it into frozen precipitation. This will continue, and Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia are expected receive new layers of snow.  ""Turkey is also going to have heavy snow,"" said Ward. The bitter cold temperatures in the northeast have been deadlier than the snow farther south, with many dying from hypothermia. More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland, according to Polish TVN.  At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government said. Snow has also fallen as far west as Spain and snarled traffic in Brussels, Belgium.  Snowfall in Europe's southeast, close to the Mediterranean Sea, is cutting off roads and isolating areas from access to supplies. In Romania, where at least 39 people have died because of the cold snap, all ""national roads,"" two-lane highways, in seven counties in the country's south and east were completely blocked, state news agency Agerpres reported Monday. Traffic was in chaos in the capital Bucharest and possible blizzards have been forecast for half the country in the coming days. In Bosnia helicopters delivered supplies to an isolated region Monday, while the military worked to restore infrastructure, according to state news agency FENA. Snow over 10 feet deep (three meters) covered the village of Zijemlje, which has been cut off from electricity for at least three days. In Italy, a Milan court delayed on Monday the trial of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of bribery because of cold temperatures in the courtroom, according to the Italian ANSA news agency. It was moved to warmer chambers, which had often been the scene of another case involving Berlusconi, when he had been accused of paying for sex with a minor -- a Moroccan girl known as ""Ruby"". The severe cold is forecast to continue all week, Ward said.  ""We are definitely going to hit the two-week mark by this weekend.""","Ukraine sets up an emergency hospital and distributes heated tents .

"(CNN) -- Emblazoned with a red Iron Cross and calling itself ""2083: A European Declaration of Independence,"" the 1,518-page manifesto alleged to have been written by the suspect in shootings and bombings that left at least 92 people dead in Norway rambles from ways that ""Justiciar Knights"" can avoid detection by police to relatives' sexually transmitted diseases. Here are key points from the document, which CNN has not independently confirmed was written by suspect Anders Behring Breivik: . --The writer describes himself as ""Justiciar Knight Commander for Knights Templar Europe and one of several leaders of the National and pan-European Patriotic Resistance Movement."" --He anticipates a European civil war taking place in three stages, ending in 2083 with the execution of cultural Marxists and the deportation of Muslims. --The first stage runs through 2030 and includes ""open source warfare, military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems (and) further consolidation of conservative forces."" --Between 2030 and 2070, the author predicts ""more advanced forms of resistance groups (and the) preparation for pan-European coup d'etats."" --The final stage -- when the author anticipates Europe being 30%-50% Muslim by country -- features the ""execution of cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ... traitors,"" deportation of Muslims and ""implementation of a Cultural Conservative political agenda"" following the overthrow of existing governments across the continent. --The author says he personally has been attacked repeatedly by Muslims: ""I've 'only' experienced 8 assaults, attempted robberies and multiple threats. I've never actually been severely ravaged, robbed or beaten my Muslims (a broken nose is the worst thing that occurred) but I know more than 20 people who have. I know at least 2 girls that have been raped my Muslims and I am familiar with two more cases in my broader network (1 gang rape). One girl though was cut badly in the face by Muslims."" --He lists accused Bosnian Serb genocide suspect Radovan Karadzic among the people he would like to meet, denying that Karadzic is ""a mass murderer and a racist,"" saying instead that ""for his efforts to rid Serbia of Islam he will always be considered and remembered as an honourable Crusader and a European war hero."" --The author accuses Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and his Labour Party of perpetuating ""cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals"" and indoctrinating youth with those ideals. --""The situation is just chaotic,"" the author writes, noting that ""thousands of Muslims"" are coming into his country annually. ""These suicidal traitors must be stopped,"" the author writes. --The manifesto speculates about what would happen if the author were to survive ""a successful mission and live to stand a multiculturalist trial.... When I wake up at the hospital, after surviving the gunshot wounds inflicted me, I realize at least for me personally, I will be waking up to a world of shit, a living nightmare. Not only will all my friends and family detest me and call me a monster; the united global multiculturalist media will have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate, vilify and demonize."" --The author says he prefers fantasy video role-playing games to ones where the player sees through the eyes of someone shooting enemies, writing: ""I'm generally more the fantasy RPG kind of person -- Dragon Age Origins etc. and not so much into first person shooters."" --The author states that he was moved to action dating to ""my government's involvement"" in NATO's 1999 strikes during the Kosovo campaign, claiming this wrongly targeted ""our Serbian brothers (who) wanted to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to Albania."" --""Be extra careful when researching for bomb schematics (fertilizer bombs), as many terms will trigger electronic alerts,"" he writes, one of several tips that include using an ""anonymous laptop and browse free to your local McDonalds"" in order to ""avoid ending up on any watch list."" --Besides hands-on instructions, the document also functions as a running diary. It also includes references to his relatives' sexual indiscretions, entries on some of his friends' personal lives, and his own off-and-on steroid use. --From July 2 on, though, the author becomes more business-like and complains that going off his testosterone supplements had ramped up his ""aggressiveness."" He then digs up his guns and prepares the bombs. It all leads up to July 22, the date of the attacks. ""The old saying 'if you want something done, then do it yourself' is as relevant now as it was then,"" he writes. ""In many cases; you could do it all yourself, it will just take a little more time. AND, without taking unacceptable risks."" --The last entry is dated the day of the attack: ""I believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51."" CNN's Greg Botelho and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","Expects from the 1,518-page manifesto allegedly written by Norwegian terror suspect .

"A brown bear cub clumsily splashes into the Brooks River to receive his mom's first fishing lesson. Those too-big-for-his body paws will be perfect for catching sockeye salmon, which started running the river in late June. Witnessing this passing of ancient knowledge to the next generation is a once in a lifetime opportunity -- from at least 50 yards away, as the mother bear is as dangerous and unforgiving as the rest of Mother Nature's Alaskan creations. These bears live on the head of the Alaskan Peninsula, which is the gateway to the chain of Aleutian Islands, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions that built the geography that eventually made region habitable for human beings. The 1912 eruption of the Novarupta volcano was the largest of the 20th century, and four years later, the National Geographic Society sent Robert F. Griggs to explore the bottomless lakes, soaring mountains and impenetrable forests of what would become Katmai National Park and Preserve. Griggs' prize was the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, Novarupta's 40-square-mile stretch of then still-smoldering volcanic ash that ranged from 100 to 700 feet deep. Katmai, a national monument since 1918 and a national park since 1980, gives visitors the opportunity to see the wilderness as Griggs saw it, to witness bears, moose, eagles and salmon within the floral beauty and rugged expanse of Alaska. Park stats: In great part because of its remoteness, tourists didn't begin regularly visiting Katmai until the 1950s.  The 4-million acre park has averaged about 39,000 visitors a year since 2008, according to the park service. About 10,000 people visit Katmai in July to view the bears at Brooks Camp, says park ranger Roy Wood. Summer in the Park: Great Smoky Mountains . The location: Katmai is on the Alaskan Peninsula, and park headquarters is in King Salmon. Visitors can get to the park via plane or boat, but there is no road access. There are daily commercial flights from Anchorage to King Salmon, about a 290-mile trip. Travelers can also access Katmai from Kodiak, Iliamna, Soldotna or Homer. Visitors can also charter flights and boat rides within the park, including the 30-mile ride from King Salmon to Brooks Camp. If you go: Getting to Katmai is the hardest part, says Wood. But admission to the park is free. However, there is a camping fee for staying at Brooks Camp, and you will need a permit to do commercial filming or photography. Summer in the Park: Grand Teton . Meet our ranger: Roy Wood is Katmai's chief of interpretation, education and partnerships. Originally from Evansville, Indiana, Wood committed to becoming a park ranger after a college internship at Grand Canyon National Park. He also worked as a seasonal park ranger at Grand Canyon, Yellowstone and Everglades national parks. Wood came to Katmai National Park and Preserve 10 years ago and fell in love with the brown bears. ""I got to the point where I could recognize the bears,"" says Wood, producer of ""Katmai: Alaska's Wild Peninsula,"" which will debut July 5 on PBS. ""They ceased to be anonymous, wild animals in the forest. They became individuals with behaviors and identities. It's been really fun to see bears that I saw as cubs come back with their own cubs."" For a day trip, don't miss: Brooks Camp. The park service operates a visitor's center there from June 1 through September 17, and the area offers fishing, anthropological history and world-class bear watching. Overnight visitors can purchase a camping permit or stay at Brooks Lodge. Katmai is home to more than 2,100 protected brown bears. Wood says that during July, 70 to 100 brown bears are concentrated within a square mile of Brooks Camp. The bears can be observed from the trail or from stands that provide increased protection. ""We don't put radio callers or ear tags on the bears,"" Wood says. ""There is nothing to ruin your photos."" Travelers to Brooks Camp should come prepared, as the NPS website advises travelers to bring proper gear for rugged terrain and unpredictable weather, which often results in travel delays. Summer in the Park: Yosemite . Favorite less-traveled spot: Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes. While noting that most of the park is ""less traveled,"" Wood suggests visitors to Brooks Camp take the 23-mile daily bus ride to the valley. Created by the Novarupta volcano's 1912 eruption, it was the sight that so awed explorer Robert Griggs. Wood recommends visitors spend a night camping there. ""You have the volcanoes, the valley and beautiful uncluttered sky,"" he says. ""That intense solitude is available to just about everyone."" Favorite spot to view wildlife: When Brooks Camp is slow for bear watching, Wood says experienced outdoor explorers should check out any place on the Pacific coast where sedges, a grass-like plant that bears eat, grow above the high-tide line. There are pilots who will take you to Geographic Harbor, Swikshak Lagoon and Hallo Bay for bear watching during the spring and summer, he says. The northern edge of Katmai is best for viewing wildlife in August and early September, says Wood, but that the local names don't exist on a map and are known only by pilots who fly there. Summer in the Park: Cuyahoga . Most magical moment in the park: The first time Wood stood in a river to watch salmon run to their spawning grounds. ""We often speak of salmon being the lifeblood of the region and its people,"" he says. ""When you are waist deep among them, it is easy to see why.  At first, the salmon deflect around you. But if you remain still, they gradually accept your presence and resume their normal upstream movement."" Funniest moment at the park: A dominant male bear reclaimed his favorite fishing spot from younger male by intimidating the young bear into falling over the waterfalls. ""Bears can be unintentionally funny,"" says Wood. ""Every now and then their comedic timing is impeccable."" Watch a video of the showdown here . Summer in the Park: Isle Royale . A ranger's request: Katmai is home to brown bears, which are the same species as grizzly bears but have different behavior patterns, says Wood. Keep at least a 50-yard distance from all bears, which are solitary animals. You should never separate a mother from her cub, says Wood. The mother will interpret the separation as a threat. Since brown bears can move at speeds up 35 miles per hour, escape will be practically impossible. ""A common misconception about Katmai and Brooks Camp is that since they (the bears) don't run, they're tame or they like us,"" says Wood. Can't get enough bears? View live feeds of bears in Katmai at explore.org . Another park he loves: Canyonlands National Park in Moab, Utah. Wood says he would like to return to the Colorado River Plateau, the region where his long trek to becoming a park ranger began. Canyonlands is on the plateau and is a series of geographical forms created the by ancients flows of Colorado River and its tributaries, Canyonlands is home to Horseshoe Canyon's, rock art, Island in the Sky mesa and the Cedar Mesa Sandstone spires at Needles.

"""Remember the time Mikey found that massive diamond at that park?"" That's how one North Carolina family is going to remember this summer. Boy Scout Michael Detlaff, 12, was visiting an Arkansas park with his family on July 31 when he found a 5.16-carat ""honey brown diamond"" in the park's ""diamond search area."" The park's response? ""It is thrilling any time a child finds a diamond here."" The Arkansas' Crater of Diamond State Park is the only diamond-producing site in the world open to the public and this isn't the first time a diamond has been found, nor is it even close to the biggest diamond discovered at this amazing park. Visitors can dig for diamonds in the park's 37.5-acre plowed field, which was a diamond mining site before it became a state park in 1972. John Huddleston, the farmer who originally owned the property, is credited with starting a diamond mining rush when he first found diamonds in Murfreesboro in 1906. Mystery surrounds Egyptian sphinx unearthed in Israel . Free diamonds . The park's policy is finders keepers, which means Michael Detlaff went home with his diamond, which he named ""God's Glory Diamond."" Mining.com estimated his find to be worth between $12,000 and $15,000 after being cut and polished. ""Michael had only been searching for about 10 minutes when he found his diamond,"" said Park Interpreter Waymon Cox in a press release. ""In fact, Michael's dad was renting mining equipment to begin his own diamond search when Michael showed the gem to him at the park's Diamond Discovery Center!"" Michael's find was the twelfth diamond weighing more than one carat found at the park this year, and the 27th largest diamond found since the opening of the park. One thing we don't get -- how are there any diamonds left? Why hasn't this place been mobbed tourists on a daily basis going over every grain of sand with a magnifying glass and blunt instruments to ward off greedy fingers poaching their immediate territory? Underwater discovery of Apollo 11 rocket engines? Fun facts about the Crater of Diamonds . â¢ The three colors of diamonds found at the park are white, brown and yellow. â¢ 40 different types of rocks and minerals other than diamonds can also be found at the park. Other gems include amethyst, peridot and garnet. â¢ Buildings dating to the park's mining days remain on the premises, such as the Mine Shaft Building and the Guard House. â¢ Due to recent heavy rains, many of the recent finds were right on the surface of the field. â¢ The park says two diamonds a day are found on average. â¢ The largest diamond ever found on site was a white diamond weighing 40.23 carats unearthed in 1984 during the park's mining days. It's the largest diamond found in North America to date. â¢ The largest diamond ever found by a park visitor was a 16.37-carat diamond. â¢ Hilary Clinton borrowed the 4.25-carat Kahn Canary diamond, also a park find, to represent Arkansas's diamond site at a gala celebrating her husband's inauguration. â¢ Michael Detlaff's find is the 328th diamond found by a park visitor so far this year. â¢ Most diamonds found in the park are too small to be cut and are kept simply as souvenirs.

"Europe remained gripped by frigid temperatures and snow Friday, with the icy weather closing much of the Danube River to shipping and disrupting travel across the region. Central and Eastern Europe have borne the brunt of the unseasonably bitter weather, which has led to hundreds of deaths and thousands of cases of frostbite and hypothermia. Twenty-two countries have posted warnings for extreme cold temperatures and accumulating snow, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. The big freeze is not likely to end any time soon, Miller said, with the Arctic air forecast to continue spilling deep into Europe, keeping temperatures well below average and allowing the snow to continue to pile higher and higher. In Ukraine, the worst-affected country, well over 100 people have died and more than 3,000 have sought hospital treatment. State news agency Ukrinform said more than 120 ships -- most of them foreign -- were trapped in the Kerch Strait, linking the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea, because of ice. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years. That has led at least four countries to halt shipping along sections of the 1,700-mile-long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels' hulls. The river is also used for drinking water, irrigation and tourism. The stretch of the Danube running through Romania has been closed indefinitely to traffic, Romanian state television network TVR reported Friday. However, most roads had reopened as of late Thursday, TVR reported, although major problems remain on the country's rail network. Romania's capital, Bucharest, reached a low of -24 degrees C for the second morning running Friday, its lowest temperature since the cold snap began two weeks ago. Bucharest has not seen the mercury climb above the 0 degree Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) freezing point since January 24, Miller said. The average high for this time of year is 3 degrees Celsius (37 degrees Fahrenheit). Snow is lying 11 inches deep in Bucharest but has piled up even higher to the west, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the capital, Sarajevo, has seen over 39 inches accumulate in the past two weeks, Miller said. A year ago, the city was covered by less than half an inch of snow. The Balkan Peninsula has been hammered with a series of potent snow storms, the result of a jet stream that has sagged much farther south than normal, allowing storms to pick up moisture over the waters of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas and dump it on the already frozen landscape of the Balkans, Miller added. In Serbia, the death toll from the cold snap rose to 16 on Friday, Interior Ministry emergencies official Predrag Maric told Serbian state news agency Tanjug. The situation has improved, he is quoted as saying, since the government declared a state of emergency in 38 municipalities. Authorities are now focusing on getting food to people in the worst-affected areas, the news agency said. Five more people died of hypothermia overnight in Poland, according to the Interior Ministry, the website of the publicly funded Polish Radio reported, taking the total number of cold related deaths there to 97. Turkish Airlines, the national flag carrier for Turkey, canceled 57 domestic and international flights Friday because of severe weather, the semiofficial Anatolian news agency reported. In a sign of the extreme weather conditions, the city hospital in Split, Croatia, has used two years' supply of plaster in only five days; a result of treating the high number of fractures caused by slips on the snowy and icy terrain, Miller said. South-east and western Europe can also expect more wintry weather over the weekend. Italy is braced Friday for heavy snowfall, with more than 40 deaths blamed on the cold snap so far, according to reports. La Repubblica newspaper said it was expected to be the most difficult weekend for more than a decade, with the icy conditions extending as far south as Calabria. Schools and offices were closed in Rome as city workers prepared to cope with as much as a foot of snow overnight. The mayor has issued an order requiring drivers to carry snow chains, and extra salt has been stockpiled for use on the roads. Heavy snowfall a week ago paralyzed roads and trains in many cities across Italy, leading to wide criticism of authorities. The number of beds available for homeless people in Rome has almost doubled, from 1,300 to 2,500, and new shelters have been set up in many metro stations, which are being kept open overnight, officials said. The Six Nations rugby match between Italy and England in Rome will go ahead Saturday as planned, English rugby union officials said. Some weather-related delays and cancellations have been reported at Italian airports. Train services have been suspended in 12 regions, the Corriere della Sera newspaper reported. The center-north regions of Emilia Romagna, Abruzzo and Marche, where it has been snowing for several days, have been particularly affected by the bad weather. Local trains are suspended. In the northern Italian city of Trieste, an icy wind is blowing at more than 80 miles per hour and is expected to strengthen, according to the regional civil protection agency.  An alert has been issued for strong winds over the next 36 hours, as people in the city report finding it difficult to remain standing in the gusts. The famous canals of Venice started freezing over this week, preventing gondoliers from plying their trade on the city's picturesque waterways. Many parts of England and Wales saw snow Thursday night and Friday morning.","Temperatures in Bucharest drop way below freezing for the 18th day in a row .

"As a result of its ongoing player lockout, the National Hockey League is canceling regular-season games through October 24, the league announced Thursday. The season was scheduled to start October 11, but recent meetings between representatives for the players union and the NHL have failed to produce a collective bargaining agreement. ""If the owners truly cared about the game and the fans, they would lift the lockout and allow the season to begin on time while negotiations continue,"" said Don Fehr, the executive director of the players' union. ""A lockout should be the last resort in bargaining, not the strategy of first resort.  For nearly 20 years, the owners have elected to lock out the players in an effort to secure massive concessions."" The cancellation wiped out 82 games from the schedule and comes one week after the league called off preseason games.

"Even bundled up in a purple jacket and light blue turtleneck sweater, warming herself in a thick canvas emergency tent heated by a stove, the young Ukrainian woman feels the bitter chill. ""It is very cold,"" she said. ""The frost is very strong. It's very slippery out there."" But she is one of the lucky ones, taking refuge from the brutal winter pummeling eastern Europe in a temporary shelter put up by the Ukrainian government. ""Here it's warm and there's food and drink,"" she said. ""It's very important, especially for people like us in this unfortunate situation,"" said another man taking refuge in the shelter. At least 250 people have died across the region during the cold snap, with 135 of them in Ukraine. Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated, and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks. Kiev has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said. They are among the most vulnerable to winter. About 2,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since January 27, officials said. Electricity consumption in the country is at historic highs, Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Boyko said. In Bosnia, two men on snowmobiles finally reached the isolated village of Zijemlja, according to state news agency FENA. It had been cut off for five days. Residents in some parts of the country were warned of the potential for avalanches. There was some good news, according to FENA. Inhabitants of the Sarajevo Zoo were in winter quarters and had sufficient food. More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland in the past several weeks, according to Polish TVN.  At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government said. Snow has also fallen as far west as Spain and snarled traffic in Brussels, Belgium.  Snowfall in Europe's southeast, close to the Mediterranean Sea, is cutting off roads and isolating areas from access to supplies. Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow in contrast to the northeast, which is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages, meteorologists said. Cold air arriving from Siberia has been hitting maritime moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, turning it into frozen precipitation. This will continue, and Bosnia, Serbia and Macedonia are expected to receive new layers of snow. The bitter cold temperatures in the northeast have been deadlier than the snow farther south, with many people dying from hypothermia. Is the cold snap affecting you? In Romania, where at least 39 people have died because of the cold snap, all ""national roads,"" or two-lane highways, in seven counties in the country's south and east were completely blocked, state news agency Agerpres reported Monday. Traffic was in chaos in the capital Bucharest and possible blizzards have been forecast for half the country in the coming days. In Italy, a Milan court delayed the trial of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi on charges of bribery Monday because of cold temperatures in the courtroom, according to the Italian ANSA news agency. It was moved to warmer chambers, which had often been the scene of another case involving Berlusconi, when he had been accused of paying for sex with a minor -- a Moroccan girl known as ""Ruby."" The severe cold is forecast to continue all week, meteorologists said.","Snowmobiles finally able to reach Bosnian village .

"Waistlines drop, hemlines rise, but the domestic drama never wavers. And there's an outfit for everything. That's the case at Downton Abbey, the fictional estate at the center of the hit British period drama. Costumes from the show have been transported across the pond to one of America's great houses, where visitors can compare and contrast the lifestyles of the very rich in Britain and America. The exhibition ""Costumes of Downton Abbey"" opens March 1 at Winterthur, the historic Delaware estate where American industrialist Henry Francis du Pont lived and entertained lavishly in the early part of the 20th century. ""Winterthur was run kind of like a great resort hotel in its heyday. There were 34 indoor servants, and that was really to take care of Mr. and Mrs. du Pont, their two daughters and their house guests when they came to visit,"" said Jeff Groff, director of public programs at Winterthur and one of the exhibit's curators. The ""Downton"" exhibit features 40 costumes worn upstairs and downstairs by the fictional Earl of Grantham, Robert Crawley, his family and their staff of servants. The costumes are on loan from Cosprop, a prominent costumier for film, theater and television. The ""Downton Abbey"" series has moved from its start in 1912 into the Jazz Age of the 1920s, and the exquisite costumes have evolved with the times. In women's dresses, ""what we're really seeing through the seasons is the waistline dropping and the hem beginning to rise,"" Groff said. The shape of women's wear also changes, with sinuous form-flattering silhouettes giving way to less structured clothing. 'Downton' in America: 6 big estates . ""By the 1920s, you've got all of these loose-hanging, very short dresses,"" said Linda Eaton, Winterthur's director of collections and senior curator of textiles. ""Fashion history is following right along with cultural history in terms of votes for women, women working outside of the home, women needing the ability for movement, losing their corsets, more natural silhouettes, less underclothing,"" Eaton said. Men's clothing changes far less on the show, Groff said. Tweeds worn at the time are still popular today in different cuts. Lord Grantham and his gentlemen contemporaries wore tweed suits around their country estates in the daytime. They would not, however, have worn tweeds to town. ""There was kind of a catchphrase at the time of 'no brown in town,'"" Groff said. Things had loosened up a bit by the 1920s and ""Downton's"" season four, which just concluded for U.S. television audiences. Black tie was becoming an alternative -- in certain less formal circumstances -- to white tie and tails in the evening. The exhibit contrasts country house life in Britain and the United States using fictional Downton and real-life Winterthur. The differences? For one, Americans have long loved their technology. ""Americans love the history and style of Britain and the sporting life and kind of the gentleman's lifestyle, but Americans were completely devoted to the latest technology, modern conveniences and comfortable living."" 8 elegant U.S. mansion hotels . Winterthur had its own telephone system with 95 exchanges by the time it was overhauled by Henry Francis du Pont in the early 1930s. It also had central heating and 23 bathrooms. In ""Downton Abbey,"" anxiety accompanies the arrival of technological advances for many of the characters. Bringing the latest technology to American estates was easier, Eaton said, because homes were newer and successive generations were likely to regularly renovate to put their own stamp on the home. America's melting pot was also evident at Winterthur when the du Pont family was in residence, with a Swedish valet and a French ladies maid among many nationalities represented in the household. ""The diversity of nationalities who work in these great houses really reflects the diversity of nationalities who were coming to America,"" Groff said. In Britain, servants had more direct ties to local villages and tenant farms. What newly wealthy Americans lacked in centuries-old tradition, they made up for in money. ""By the late 19th century the Americans were the ones with all the money,"" said Eaton. ""Downton Abbey"" illustrates that wealth through Lord Grantham's American wife Cora, whose fortune has kept the estate from ruin, and her mother -- who occasionally sails in from New York sporting the very latest fashions. ""Wealthy Americans were not at all behind,"" Eaton said. ""They traveled, they frequented all of the best couture designers in both London and Paris."" Yet the American fascination with all things British is still very much alive and well. The exhibition is on view at Winterthur through January 2015. The museum recommends advance purchase of the timed tickets. Entry to the exhibit is included in general admission, which is $20 for adults.","Exhibit of ""Downton Abbey"" costumes opening in Delaware .

"Alcohol has been involved in most of the deaths blamed on the extreme cold in Ukraine, the country worst affected by the icy temperatures gripping Eastern Europe, a government minister said Wednesday. Nine out of 10 of the deaths reported have been alcohol-related, Emergency Situations Minister Viktor Baloga said. At least 135 deaths have been reported in Ukraine in the past two weeks, but he suggested the actual number that can be blamed on the winter weather is somewhat lower, at 112. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since January 27, officials said. Authorities in Ukraine have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated, and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks. Ukraine's capital, Kiev, has more than 14,000 homeless people, authorities said. They are among the most vulnerable to winter's bitter chill. Dr. Anatoliiy Vershigora, doctor-in-chief at an emergency help station in Kiev, told CNN many of those suffering frostbite, hypothermia and in some cases death were alcoholics -- but that others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm. Outdoor workers, such as those at market stalls, were also suffering frostbite in the extreme conditions, he said, as were some children whose parents had let them spend too long outside. Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Red Cross in Europe, said: ""It is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances -- it may be why they are homeless in the first place. ""Alcohol creates the illusion of being warm, so it's not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out,"" he said, adding that this is when hypothermia can occur. ""Our approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink, if we can find them and get them to safety. Obviously, a full belly or hot drinks is far, far better for you than vodka."" Red Cross volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing, boots, hot food and drinks in Ukraine and elsewhere, Lowry said, speaking to CNN from Slovakia. But, he added, the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate. ""These people are outside the normal safety nets, difficult to find, and don't realize the great danger they are in."" Dr. Sam Zakhari, director of the Division of Metabolism and Health Effects in the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, said consuming alcohol is dangerous in cold weather for two main reasons. One is that alcohol causes the dilation of blood vessels in the skin, which means they are wider and more blood passes through. This makes the person feel hot, which is not an issue if the person is warmly dressed and indoors,  Zakhari said. But ""if he or she is not wearing enough warm clothes they will lose heat rapidly, and that can contribute to hypothermia."" Secondly, he said, a person who is inebriated may not have the ability to judge what's happening or respond appropriately. He or she may slip and fall in the icy conditions and risk becoming unconscious, or fall asleep as alcohol depresses the central nervous system, he said. Zakhari advises those who are inebriated to stay inside for safety, where possible, or if they must be outside to dress in several warm layers to stop heat escaping and try to ward off hypothermia. Kiev marked its 24th consecutive day of below-freezing temperatures Wednesday, with a low of minus 18 Celsius (minus 0.4 Fahrenheit), CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. It could normally expect a high of minus 2 degrees Celsius at this time of year. And there is little respite in prospect for those suffering in the unusual cold. Another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of Russia into the rest of Europe for the end of the week, with Central and Eastern Europe catching the brunt of the coldest air, Miller said. Temperatures in some of the hardest hit countries, such as Ukraine, Romania, Hungary and Serbia, will once again drop below average by as much as 15 to 20 degrees Celsius (25 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit). Warsaw, in Poland, which would normally expect a high of 2 degrees Celsius (36 degrees Fahrenheit), has now spent 15 days below freezing, while Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina has spent 14 days in subzero temperatures, well below the average for this time of year of 5 degrees Celsius (41 degrees Fahrenheit.) Temperatures are likely to remain below average well into next week, at the least, with no significant warming likely until late February, Miller said. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years, showing not only the intensity of this cold snap, but also its longevity. The sustained cold spell is also putting a strain on power providers across the region and has raised questions over Europe's reliance on Russia for gas, as supplies sent via Ukraine have dipped below the expected levels. Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Boyko said electricity consumption in the country is historically high. But in an interview with CNN, he rejected suggestions that Ukraine has been siphoning off gas as it transits from Russia to Europe. Boyko said the main reason for the 30% drop in gas reaching Europe was the extremely cold weather in Russia, which meant a smaller than usual amount of gas entered Ukraine. Instead of Ukraine receiving the expected 500 million cubic meters per day, only 400 million cubic meters came to its western border, he said. Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, has denied sending lower volumes of gas to Europe. But Boyko said he believes the real answer is that given by the deputy chairman of Gazprom, whom he quoted as saying the company was not ready to send additional supplies to Europe during the cold spell. At least 250 people have died across the region during the cold snap. In Romania, where at least 39 people have died because of the weather, snow blown by icy winds on the shores of the Black Sea has disrupted road and rail travel and cut power to 35 settlements in southeast Constanta county, state news agency Agerpres reported Wednesday. Water supplies were also cut to 16 of those settlements. Meanwhile, holiday villas, beaches and resort buildings have been flooded by waves up to 5 meters (16 feet) high swept in from the Black Sea by the winter storms, the news agency said. Video shot by CNNi Reporter Angela Leeb in Constanta on Wednesday showed a fierce snowstorm howling outside her home. It's ""still very windy and cold but not snowing,"" she said. A yacht rides loose on the shore, torn from its moorings by a bad storm last week, she said. As the week started, all ""national roads,"" or two-lane highways, in seven counties in the country's south and east were blocked by snow, Agerpres reported. More than 50 people, most of them homeless, have died in Poland in the past several weeks, according to Polish TVN. At least 64 people have died because of the cold in Russia, the government in Moscow said. In Hungary, the Red Cross has helped more than 4,000 people this week through 15 homeless centers and door-to-door services in rural settlements. Twelve deaths have been reported there during the cold snap, the Red Cross said in a release. Snow has also fallen as far west as Spain. Snowfall in Europe's southeast, close to the Mediterranean Sea, has cut off roads and isolated areas from access to supplies. Southeastern Europe will see more heavy snow, while the northeast is predicted to shiver under temperatures much lower than its winter averages, meteorologists said. The German capital, Berlin, has spent nearly two weeks below freezing, whereas it would normally average 4 degrees Celsius (39 degrees Fahrenheit). In Berlin, CNN iReporter Meghan Nevill said it is too cold to stay outside for longer than 10 minutes. Water at a dam in the city, the Muggelseedamm, has frozen solid, she said. Britain's Met Office is warning of wintry weather over the next few days, with freezing rain and ice expected Wednesday night across northern England and parts of Scotland. London and portions of eastern England will see some significant snow accumulations by Friday, with up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) in the hardest hit areas and 2 to 4 centimeters possible in the London area, forecasters said. Temperatures in Paris have been below freezing for a week.","Some victims are alcoholics, others mistakenly drink to keep warm, a doctor in Kiev says .

"(CNN) -- NASA's Mars rovers are celebrating their fifth birthday on the Red Planet, exceeding their original life span by four years and nine months, with no end in sight to their history-making work. Spirit captured this stunning view as the sun sank below the rim of Gusev Crater on Mars in 2005. The rover Spirit landed January 3, 2004, with Opportunity touching down 21 days later. NASA said the rovers had made important discoveries about the wet and violent conditions on ancient Mars. They had returned 250,000 images, covered more than 21 kilometers (13 miles), climbed a mountain, descended into craters, struggled with sand traps and ageing hardware and survived dust storms, NASA said. ""These rovers are incredibly resilient considering the extreme environment the hardware experiences every day,"" said John Callas, Jet Propulsion Laboratory project manager for Spirit and Opportunity. ""We realize that a major rover component on either vehicle could fail at any time and end a mission with no advance notice, but on the other hand, we could accomplish the equivalent duration of four more prime missions on each rover in the year ahead."" Martian winds had helped clean dust from the rovers. However, NASA said that Spirit had not had a good clean for more than 18 months and that its dust-coated solar panels barely provided enough power to get it through its third winter, which ended in December. ""This last winter was a squeaker for Spirit,"" Callas said. But with spring and summer bringing more power, NASA planned to move Spirit to two new sites: a mound and a house-sized pit called Goddard. ""Goddard doesn't look like an impact crater,"" said Steve Squyres of Cornell University, a principal investigator on the rover project. ""We suspect it might be a volcanic explosion crater, and that's something we haven't seen before."" Opportunity, meanwhile, is to be moved to Endeavour Crater. At approximately 22 kilometers (14 miles) in diameter it is more than 20 times larger than another impact crater, Victoria, where the rover spent most of the past two years, NASA said. Endeavour is about 12 kilometers (7 miles) from Victoria, but Opportunity will take a longer route to avoid major obstacles. It has already covered about 2 kilometers of the journey. High-resolution images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which reached Mars in 2006, are helping the team plot routes. ""We keep setting the bar higher for what these rovers can do,"" said Frank Hartman, a JPL rover driver. ""Once, it seemed like a crazy idea to go to Endeavour, but now we're doing it."" Squyres said the journeys had been motivated by science but had led to something else important. ""This has turned into humanity's first overland expedition on another planet. When people look back on this period of Mars exploration decades from now, Spirit and Opportunity may be considered most significant not for the science they accomplished but for the first time we truly went exploring across the surface of Mars.""","NASA's Mars rovers are celebrating their fifth birthday on the Red Planet .

"A U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser took evasive action to avoid colliding with a Chinese warship in the South China Sea in what sources called a highly unusual and deliberate act by China, CNN has learned. The incident last Friday, which was resolved peacefully, was the latest sign of tension around recent and aggressive Chinese territorial claims in the region involving international waters and expanded airspace. Vice President Joe Biden last week pressed Beijing over the issue, which stems from a longstanding dispute with Japan that has grown tenser. Several U.S. military officials confirmed details of the incident on the high seas involving the USS Cowpens, which has just come to light. The American warship -- which U.S. officials say was in international waters -- was approached by a Chinese Navy ship. The smaller vessel peeled off from a group of Chinese Navy ships that included the carrier Liaoning. The Chinese ship failed to stop, despite radio warning from the Cowpens that it was getting too close. The Cowpens commanding officer then issued orders for an ""all stop"" when the other ship was less than 500 yards off its bow, a U.S. Navy official said. The Chinese ship proceeded past the Cowpens. ""It is unusual to have to take evasive action at sea to avoid a collision,"" the official added. While naval vessels from different countries often come close as they observe each other, the United States sees this case as one that could have led to a collision because of the time and distance it takes for an American warship to stop. ""The Chinese knew what they were doing,"" a second U.S. military official said. During the encounter, bridge-to-bridge radio communications were maintained between the American and Chinese commanders. ""Communications were professional,"" the second official said. Though the United States will not acknowledge it openly, the Cowpens was in position to conduct surveillance on the Liaoning, which would be a sensitive matter for the Chinese. U.S. officials insist the Cowpens remained in international waters at all times. During a visit to Beijing last week, Biden told Chinese President Xi Jinping the United States had ""deep concerns"" over its newly declared East China Sea air defense zone and that Washington did not recognize it. The Chinese action, Biden said in Japan before the Xi visit, raised the possibility of ""accidents and miscalculation."" The area in question includes uninhabited islands that have been the site of tense disputes between China and Japan, both of which claim the lands.","U.S. Navy ship forced to come to an abrupt stop in South China Sea .

"An old wooden shack and rows of tilted fence posts: In a way, this deserted little patch of Midwestern dirt was the starting point for every airport in the world. On a cold winter's day I scan a snowy, lonely field north of Dayton, Ohio. Not sure exactly where I am, I wonder for a minute if I'm lost. A National Park Service sign makes it clear what I'm looking at: ""The first airport. Exploring Huffman Prairie Flying Field."" Wait. Back up. I don't think I knew about that. Like millions of other Americans, I was taught that the Wright brothers worked their flying magic in a place called Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Then it hit me: What I'd stumbled onto was the Wrights' outdoor laboratory -- where they took powered flight to the next level. This 84-acre pasture is where Mrs. Wright's boys let themselves screw up. By learning from each misstep, they were able to develop ""a practical and usable machine,"" said park ranger Robert Petersen. ""This is the Holy Grail,"" he said. ""This is literally where aviation gets its start."" Related: Were the Wright brothers really first? After the brothers made history at Kitty Hawk, they schlepped more than 600 miles back to Dayton with a contraption that could fly 852 feet in 59 seconds. That was cool and all â but folks were wondering: Could an improved aircraft do more? Could it transport people from city to city? Maybe. Could it help defend democracy in a world war? Perhaps. The brothers and their employees had their work cut out for them. Between 1904 and 1916, according to Petersen and the National Park Service, a series of aviation firsts took place at Huffman Prairie: . -- First controlled turn . -- First circle . -- First controlled bank . -- First figure-eight . -- The ""world's first permanent flight school,"" was established here, said Petersen. -- Among the first students was Henry ""Hap"" Arnold, who would become the only five-star general in the history of the U.S. Air Force. -- Another student was Calbraith Perry Rodgers -- who in 1911 became the first pilot to fly coast to coast. -- The first ""cargo flight,"" took place out of Huffman Prairie, said Petersen. As publicity for a retail shop, a Wright aircraft flew several bolts of cloth to Columbus, about 55 miles away. ""So, yeah,"" Petersen said. ""It is the world's first airport."" Hold on now. Other experts aren't so sure about that word, ""airport."" ""That's not really an airport,"" said historian Deborah Douglas, curator of Science and Technology at the MIT Museum. ""An airport has to do two things: get airplanes in and out of the sky safely and it has to transfer people and goods from one mode of transportation to another. If you're not doing those things, then I'd say you're not really an airport."" No other place, as far as I can tell, calls itself the ""first airport."" College Park Airport, a tiny facility outside Washington, D.C., has a good shot at the claim, said Douglas. However, it avoids the controversy by simply calling itself the ""oldest continually operating airport in the world."" ""If someone says 'first airport in America,' you could argue Kitty Hawk,"" said Chelsea Dorman, program coordinator at the College Park Aviation Museum. ""But we've been flying here since 1909 and that's our distinction."" Related story: Were the Wright brothers really first? Another airport, Pearson Field, which serves southwestern Washington state, says it started four years before College Park, in 1905, as a landing facility for a blimp. But its website calls it ""one of the oldest operating fields in the U.S."" The actual word ""airport"" wasn't used until 1919, when a newspaper coined it to describe Atlantic City, New Jersey's Bader Field, which opened in 1910. Now closed, Bader was ""the first municipal airport in the U.S. for both land and seaplanes,"" according to the Federal Aviation Administration. ""For academic historians, we find that 'firsts' are really, really hard to establish,"" Douglas says with a laugh. ""They're hard to know."" Related: World's most terrifying airport . Whatever the case, by the end of the first decade of the 20th century, America needed more landing and takeoff locations to support U.S. air mail deliveries. That spurred the creation of airfields in New York and Philadelphia. Across the Atlantic, European aviators were establishing prototype airports, too. Spurred by World War I, cities there eventually established London's Croydon Airport, Berlin's Templehoff and Le Bourget in Paris. Back in Ohio, the Wrights faced a few surprising challenges. The landowner allowed the Wrights to use the field under the condition that they moved the horses and cows out of the way first, said Petersen. ""Sometimes there were issues."" Another problem: how to get airborne. The plane's engines weren't much more powerful than engines for riding lawn mowers. Nature wasn't always cooperative either. Ohio winds aren't quite as gusty as the beaches of Kitty Hawk. Solution: Use a catapult. Here's how it worked: The plane sat at one end of a 240-foot-long wooden rail atop a wheeled trolley. Ropes and pulleys connected the trolley to a 1,600-pound weight suspended from a 20-foot-tall wooden derrick. With the plane's engines revving, the weight was dropped, propelling the craft down the rail and -- one hoped -- into the air. ""This becomes the forerunner of catapult systems used to launch planes from aircraft carriers today,"" Petersen said. A replica of the catapult derrick stands at the site, along with a replica of the Wrights' hangar, built on the exact spot of the original. Because Huffman Prairie is part of Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, it has remained virtually untouched by real estate development, said Loyola University Chicago history professor Elizabeth Fraterrigo, who researched and wrote a paper on the property for the park service. (PDF) ""You can really get a sense of what it was like for the Wright brothers to work there,"" she said. ""You can think about what they accomplished at that place, and really feel a connection to it."" The field is among five Dayton-area sites that make up the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historic Park, including the Wright family mansion and one of the Wrights' bicycle shops. Eventually, Huffman Prairie was swallowed up by two nearby military installations: Patterson Field and Wilbur Wright Field. Later, the two merging facilities became Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, which has contributed to research and development of groundbreaking advances, including pressurized plane cabins, cockpit navigation instruments and night-vision technology. Amazing to think that it all sprouted from the exploits of two brothers, their bicycle shop and this hallowed piece of farmland.","Most know about Kitty Hawk, but the Wrights perfected their planes in Ohio .

"Suffering in the grip of a brutal winter where temperatures have not risen above freezing in nearly a month, Ukraine has seen a wave of deaths related to the cold, and the country's ambulance service is inundated with calls for help. On one recent night, emergency services raced through the streets of the capital, Kiev, in response to a call about a homeless man passed out in the freezing weather. The man got drunk and either fell asleep or dropped unconscious outside, putting him at risk of frostbite. Vladimir Poddubniy, a passerby, found him, brought him indoors and called for an ambulance. When paramedics arrived, they found the homeless man, who gave his name simply as Kostya, squatting drunk on the floor. His hand was so swollen, he could barely hold his cigarette. Poddubniy said the man was freezing to death, so he brought him inside. ""I felt sorry for him. But I also didn't want to find a body in the morning,"" Poddubniy said. Paramedics determined Kostya needed emergency hospital care for frostbite, and helped the intoxicated man to his feet. Kostya was so drunk, he could barely walk down the stairs. iReport: Beauty and danger of Europe's snow . But in a country where the cold has claimed at least 112 lives in the past month -- 90% of them alcohol-related, according to the government -- Kostya can consider himself lucky to be alive. About 3,000 people have been hospitalized because of the cold since January 27, officials said. Temperatures remained well below the average Thursday, with the mercury falling to -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of Ukraine. Authorities there have set up an emergency hospital to deal with people suffering from cold-related conditions, and distributed 3,000 emergency relief tents across the country, they said. The tents are heated, and people with nowhere else to go can get hot food and drinks. Dr. Anatoliiy Vershigora, doctor-in-chief at an emergency help station in Kiev, said many of those suffering from frostbite and  hypothermia and some of those who died were alcoholics -- but others had been drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm. Ukraine's capital, Kiev, has more than 14,000 homeless people, among the most vulnerable to winter's bitter chill, authorities said. ""It is an unfortunate fact that a lot of homeless people are alcoholic or dependent on other substances -- it may be why they are homeless in the first place,"" said Joe Lowry, a spokesman for the International Red Cross in Europe. ""Alcohol creates the illusion of being warm, so it's not surprising that people are drinking and not surprising that they pass out,"" he said, adding that this is when hypothermia can occur. ""Our approach would be to try to get to these people before they have too much to drink, if we can find them and get them to safety. Obviously, a full belly or hot drinks is far, far better for you than vodka."" Red Cross volunteers have been working with authorities to help distribute warm clothing, boots, hot food and drinks in the Ukraine and elsewhere, Lowry said from Slovakia. But, he added, the people who are most in need of help are often hard to locate. ""These people are outside the normal safety nets, difficult to find, and don't realize the great danger they are in."" Kiev marked its 25th consecutive day of below-freezing temperatures Thursday. It would normally expect a high of -2 degrees Celsius (28 degrees Fahrenheit) at this time of year, CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller said. And there is little respite in sight for those suffering in the unusual cold. Another surge of frigid air is pushing westward out of Russia into the rest of Europe for the end of the week, with Central and Eastern Europe catching the brunt of the coldest air. The cities of Bucharest, Belgrade and Sarajevo saw their coldest mornings so far this winter Thursday, with temperatures dipping to -24 degrees Celsius (-11.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in the Romanian and Serbian capitals and -19 degrees Celsius (-2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The region can expect below freezing temperatures through the weekend, CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos said. Parts of the Danube River, one of the most important rivers in Europe for commerce, have nearly frozen over for the first time in 25 years, showing not only the intensity of the cold snap, but also its longevity. At least four countries have halted shipping along sections of the 1,700 mile-long waterway because of the risk of damage to vessels' hulls, Ramos said, adding that the river is not only used for transport but for drinking water, irrigation and tourism. Areas along the Black Sea coast have also frozen over, she added. Western Europe can also expect more cold as the week ends, with snow forecast in many parts of England and Wales overnight Thursday to Friday. The sustained cold spell is putting a strain on power providers across the region. Germany announced Wednesday it would fall back on its energy reserves and restart several fossil-fuel power stations that have been dormant for some time. A combination of below freezing temperatures, insufficient yields from renewable energy sources, and interruptions to natural gas imports from Russia have aggravated a discrepancy in energy production left behind by Berlin's decision last year to rid Germany of nuclear power. Germany decided to phase out all nuclear energy in the wake of the meltdown at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, triggered by an earthquake and tsunami. A spokeswoman from Germany's Federal Network Agency, the government body responsible for the country's electricity and gas infrastructure, said that when eight nuclear reactors were taken off line last year, the ability of Germany's four network providers to compensate for unexpected interruptions in service was affected. The energy supply situation is especially tense in the south because that is where much of the country's industry is concentrated, she added. The cold snap has raised questions over Europe's reliance on Russia for gas as supplies sent via Ukraine have dipped below the expected levels. Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuri Boyko said electricity consumption in the country is historically high. But in an interview with CNN, he rejected suggestions that Ukraine has been siphoning off gas as it transits from Russia to Europe. Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly, has denied sending lower volumes of gas to Europe. At least 250 people have died across the region in the cold weather.","Severe cold is set to carry on through the weekend in many places, meterologists say .

"It's August when the Cape feels like summer to me. The rest of the summer, the ocean water feels a little cold to me. In August, however, I can convince myself I could live there all year long. I've been visiting the Cape Cod town of Provincetown and nearby towns since the early 1990s, when graduate school in Boston made it an easy two-hour trip. Traveling single with friends, a significant other and eventually with my family, I've listened to Provincetown's Broadway-quality cabaret, eaten a dozen times at Arnold's Lobster and Clam Bar in Eastham and staked out my place on the beaches in Sandwich and all along the Cape. That's why I'm headed back to the Cape this year, although we'll fly this year instead of driving because of our recent move South. And this year, we'll stay in Wellfleet and hopefully swim in the town's freshwater kettle ponds carved out by retreating glaciers. Five guys take same photo for 30 years . As summer winds down and parents prepare for another round of getting back into school routines, there's often one last trip to soak in the season before alarms and homework and fall set back in. It seems everyone has a favorite summer spot. Ask a handful of friends and you're likely to get a different answer from everyone. I asked a few friends and colleagues to share the places they'd happily visit again and again.  Do you have a favorite summertime destination? Please share your recommendations below. Rehoboth Beach: Where politicos go to relax . My pal Julianna Gonen can remember her first trips to Rehoboth in the late 1980s, traveling to the Delaware town for affordable weekend escapes with college friends. A graduate student on a budget in the early 1990s, she went with friends to play in beach volleyball tournaments and to enjoy the state park beach by Gordon's Pond. More than 20 years later, the Washington lawyer co-owns a home there and often makes the two-hour drive to spend relaxing weekends. These days she enjoys the side of the state park close to Lewes, biking on the wide, flat roads, and playing golf at the Rookery in Milton and Marsh Island in Lewes. Her ""tried and true favorite"" for a nice dinner is Eden, but she also loves Mixx, Nage and the new Shorebreak Lodge. Bin 66 Fine Wine & Spirits has free tastings Friday evenings (at the downtown store) and Saturday evening (at the Highway One location). ""I like how the landscape shifts from urban to suburban to rural as I leave D.C. and head toward the ocean,"" says Gonen. ""I like the wide open spaces that I drive by on the way to Rehoboth. Once there, I like the dunes, the old watch towers and kayaking on the Delaware Bay watching the Cape May-Lewes Ferry arrive and depart."" 10 budget-friendly all inclusives . Premier spots ""Up North"" Every spring and summer, after those long, snow-buried Michigan winters, city and suburb dwellers inevitably crave a new view. And so, they head toward a place everyone simply calls ""Up North."" To locals, it encompasses everything in the northern part of the state's lower peninsula. The Great Lakes offer more than 10,000 miles of coastline, but some of the most popular are the soft sand beaches around Traverse City. One favorite: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Empire. The top always looks so close, but the climb can take hours. Afterward, cool down in the clear, crisp water of Lake Michigan. Inland lakes sprinkled around the upper part of the state usually feel warmer, and a little more private. My pal and CNN colleague Jamie Gumbrecht's choice? The shores of Higgins Lake, near Roscommon and Grayling. Her grandparents once owned one of the tiny cottages tucked in the woods around the lake. ""How many happy hours were spent building kingdoms from perfectly damp sand, burning marshmallows over beach bonfires or floating in the water near South State Park?"" she writes. ""Didn't we beg every morning to shuffle over the fuzzy rocks, through the minnows and beyond the edge of the dock?"" She caught her first fish there, a humble rock bass she remembers for its tough magenta gills and pearlescent copper scales. ""The more memorable fish were the perch dinners provided by the lake -- small fillets grilled with flour, butter, lemon, salt and pepper."" There's a cruise for everyone . Landlocked beachgoers head to Florida . Atlanta resident Laura Cooper, a pal from our children's preschool days, grew up on the beaches of Long Island and still needs to get her toes in the sand. She started going to WaterColor and Seaside on Florida's highway 30-A when she moved to the South nine years ago, and it's ""hands down the best beach vacation anywhere,"" she says. ""The sand is soft and white, and the water is turquoise - really beautiful."" Cooper's family and friends usually rent a house with a gourmet kitchen for a week in May, when the weather is just right. There are just enough beach areas, pools, restaurants and ice cream shops for the family within walking or biking distance. (Her husband likes the Camp Creek golf course in Panama City Beach). ""I want my kids to play on the beach, not have to schlep them to rides and toy stores,"" she says. The group likes to food shop at Modica's in Santa Rosa Beach for groceries and head to Bud & Alley's in Seaside for drinks. (Sitters are easy to find, she says.) San Diego: Summer all year . If I need summer anytime of year, I sometimes take the plunge for the transcontinental flight to my hometown of San Diego, where the weather is often warm enough for swimming (the water is always cold, so jump in quickly). Many tourists will head to La Jolla Shores or Torrey Pines for quality sunning, swimming and surfing. Others might head to Pacific Beach or Mission Beach, near Sea World and many of the beach area hotels. I won't argue with them. I spent many a high school weekend on those beaches, depending on who was organizing the bonfire. My favorite spot was practically in my Point Loma backyard, when I was prepared to walk. During the last days of summer and into fall, we'd cut through the campus of Point Loma Nazarene College and hike down Sunset Cliffs toward a somewhat secret staircase to the tide pools. In the daytime, scattered surfers would try to catch a wave in the distance while children played in the shallow waters. If you want a view of the point where Juan Cabrillo became the first European to step foot on what is now the West Coast of the United States, head to Cabrillo National Monument and pay the National Park fee to see the most spectacular view of San Diego. Military buffs can enjoy the views of warships under repair and pay their respects at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. For my favorite seafood joint, head to Point Loma Seafoods and watch the fishing boats pull right up to the restaurant dock to unload their catch. Where do you go to capture those last days of summer? Do you like to visit the spots of your childhood or do you prefer to explore new places?","Cape Cod offers beaches, freshwater ponds and lobster rolls .

"President Obama has decided to nominate Sen. John Kerry to be the next secretary of state and could make a formal announcement as early as next week, a Democrat who spoke to Kerry told CNN Saturday. The expected nomination follows U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice's decision to withdraw her name from consideration for the post. She dropped out of the running Thursday after weeks of criticism from Republicans about statements she made about the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. If confirmed by the Senate, Kerry would replace current Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to leave her post within the administration. Kerry, the senior senator from Massachusetts and the Democratic Party's 2004 presidential nominee, is noted for the experience, gravitas and relationship-building skills that could help him succeed as the United States' top diplomat. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, recently jokingly referred to Kerry as ""Mr. Secretary."" Sizing up Kerry as secretary of state . In his current role as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Kerry has traveled the globe on behalf of the Obama administration to mend frayed relationships. Most notably he has traveled to Pakistan after a series of incidents, including the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, that had set relations back. Obama's Cabinet: Who's in, who's out? World travel is second nature to Kerry, 69. Born in Denver, he spent much of his childhood overseas, living in Berlin before going to a Swiss boarding school at age 11. After graduating from Yale University in 1966, Kerry was deployed to Vietnam as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. Kerry served as a gunboat officer on the Mekong Delta, earning the Silver Star, the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts. Upon his return home in the early 1970s, Kerry gained public recognition as the head of the group Vietnam Veterans Against the War and for his anti-war testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Jockeying begins for Massachusetts Senate seat . In 1972, Kerry ran his first campaign, a losing effort for a congressional seat in Massachusetts. He eventually entered politics in 1982 as lieutenant governor under Gov. Michael Dukakis. Two years later, Kerry won the U.S. Senate seat he has held for five consecutive terms. The Vietnam experience came back to haunt Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. A Republican-funded group called ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" aired campaign ads accusing Kerry of lying to receive two of his five combat decorations and criticizing his anti-war activism. Incumbent President George W. Bush won the Electoral College vote 292 to 252 and racked up 3 million more votes than Kerry. McCain, Rice, Obama and the politics of personality . After winning his fifth Senate race in 2008, Kerry took over the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the following January. If nominated by the president and confirmed by his colleagues in the Senate, Kerry would leave Congress, and Deval Patrick, Massachusetts' Democratic governor, would appoint a replacement. By state law, a special general election is required to take place 145 to 160 days after a vacancy occurs. So if Kerry were nominated, confirmed, and then stepped down on January 21 (Inauguration Day), the election would take place between June 14 and June 29, with primary elections being held six weeks earlier. Whoever wins the special election would serve the final year and a half of Kerry's term and would then be able to run again for a full six-year term in office in the 2014 midterm elections. Patrick says it's too soon to say whether he'll name a caretaker or appoint someone who would run in the special election. But a Democratic strategist in Massachusetts says Patrick is under pressure to avoid naming a caretaker, in hopes of preventing a divisive primary. The strategist told CNN that both Rep. Ed Markey and Rep. Michael Capuano have already separately met with Patrick to ask for the appointment if Kerry's seat does open up.","Obama has decided to nominate Sen. John Kerry to be secretary of state, Democrat says .

"It's not enough to eat good food, sit by the beach and sleep in for a week. Sometimes you need to make the most of downtime by stripping away anything that could potentially cause stress, including children. Whether you need a recovery trip on the heels of spring break or a haven from other people's cranky toddlers, some hotels and resorts remove that unpredictable variable of youth and allow for a special kind of exclusivity: adults-only properties. The model is most widely available at beach destinations, where hoteliers are focused on traveling couples intent on a more romantic atmosphere. An adults-only situation allows the resort to tailor its amenities to fit the needs of guests of a certain age, which could mean massages for two on the beach instead of chicken nuggets on the menu. But it's not just tucked-away resorts that are adopting this grown-up business model. The Out NYC, billed as New York's first ""gay urban resort,"" is eschewing anyone under 21 from booking a stay. ""I created the Out NYC to be a sanctuary steps from Times Square,"" says Ian Reisner, the hotel's founder. ""Creating an adult-only resort in the city offers a welcoming environment for like-minded travelers away from the frenetic pace of the city."" No matter the location, adults-only accommodations come with the guarantee that you won't be interrupted by crying babies or rambunctious children. But be warned, this type of added luxury doesn't come cheap. ""When you're choosing your vacation destination, you're paying for the experience, and adults-only resorts can have a higher price point because they offer the ultimate experience,"" says travel agent Jason Hedrick. Check out these retreats if you're in need of a little family-free R&R: . Glenmere Mansion, New York's Hudson Valley . This country retreat 50 miles from New York City is strictly for the over 18 crowd, including both of its fine dining restaurants, which are open to nonhotel guests. Originally built in 1911, the Italianate mansion houses 18 guestrooms, which range from standard to sprawling suites, all individually designed and overlooking either the estate's gardens or Glenmere Lake. Rub elbows with the other guests in the elegant public spaces, from the fireplaced library to the outdoor heated pool or the championship croquet court. Twin Farms, Barnard, Vermont . This luxury Relais & Chateaux hideaway set on 300 acres in Vermont affords guests one-of-a-kind privacy. Most of the 20 guestrooms (you can choose from suites or cottages) are spread out, so it's entirely possible to avoid other guests altogether. Instead you can hobnob with boldface names from the art world; expect to see works by modern masters such as Roy Lichtenstein and Jasper Johns hanging on walls. Come winter, ski enthusiasts will also appreciate Twin Farms' six private skiing trails. It's almost like having an entire mountain to yourself. Be warned, however, that the property does open itself up to families with children a few times a year -- allowing even the youngest travelers to revel in its splendor. El Dorado Casitas Royale, Riviera Maya, Mexico . Adjacent to Karisma Hotels' El Dorado Royale -- an adults-only beachside complex -- is an uber-luxury sister resort called El Dorado Casitas Royale, where private casitas sit right on the beach. Guests who opt to book one of these exclusive retreats for two have their own Jacuzzis, private beach beds, butler service and pools and restaurants to choose from, plus access to the amenities next door. The Out NYC, New York . The year-old Out NYC is a rare urban refuge: While the rest of this list features properties in the countryside or by water, the Out NYC is one of the few city hotels that target a specific age bracket. The ""straight friendly"" resort doesn't accept reservations from anyone under 21. So those looking to check out its 104 rooms, the 5,000-square-foot wellness facilities, the popular Mediterranean-inspired KTCHN Restaurant and the XL Nightclub, Cabaret & Lounge -- the first nightly gay party venue to open in the city in 15 years -- have to prove they are old enough to drink alcohol in the United States. Ponta dos Ganchos, Santa Catarina, Brazil . This exclusive resort in southern Brazil is so out of the way, it's not uncommon for guests (ages 18 and up) to arrive via private helicopters, landing on the on-site helipad. Situated on a peninsula, Ponta dos Ganchos has 25 villas, which feature private verandas and comfortable hammocks for enjoying panoramic water views. The pricier units really up the luxury quotient with plunge pools, saunas and Jacuzzis. Yellow Lagos Meia Praia Hotel, Lagos, Portugal . Lagos is one of Portugal's most beautiful coastal destinations known for idyllic spots for swim and surf. A reputation like this doesn't go unnoticed by sun-hungry Europeans of all ages. Find refuge at Yellow, where unobstructed views of Meia Praia beach are reserved for the over 17 crowd. If a break from the water is what you're after, the hotel is near a golf course and within walking distance of Lagos' historic city center, where you can settle in on one of its many restaurant patios for fresh fish.","Some resorts cater to a mostly 18-plus crowd with deluxe amenities .

"Cringe and propitiate: that's the Obama administration's response to the hucksters who have seized on a dopey YouTube trailer to enflame crowds across the Islamic world. Administration officials have deplored and condemned the video, sometimes remembering to add a mention of the right of free speech (as incumbent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did) and sometimes omitting it (see for example, Sunday's performance by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and potential future Secretary of State Susan Rice on ABC's ""This Week""). Blaming the video is convenient for the Obama administration. Blaming the video obviates questions about inadequate security at the Benghazi consulate. Even better, from the administration's point of view, the more we talk about the video, the less we talk about whether the administration made the right choices in its Libyan and Egyptian policies. Opinion: Arab Spring nations don't yet grasp freedom of dissent . But blaming the video also imposes some ugly costs. Self-selected Muslim leaders exploit incidents like this to pose demands that threaten human freedom in the Middle East and around the world. Even under the prior secular regime of Hosni Mubarak, Egypt regularly used blasphemy laws to persecute religious minorities and independent thinkers. That country's new Muslim Brotherhood government has already shown itself even more aggressively intolerant of dissenting speech, suppressing newspapers that print criticism of President Mohamed Morsy. Pakistan's record is even worse, with courts pronouncing death sentences on supposed blasphemers, most recently a mentally impaired Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Quran. (She was released on bail Friday after it was established that her accuser, a local imam, had faked his evidence.) Western countries, too, are targeted by demands for the regulation of speech deemed objectionable by certain Muslims. From ""The Satanic Verses"" uproar of 1989, through the Danish cartoon incident of 2006, to this latest video, European and American governments and media institutions have compromised their most cherished values to appease angry mobs. Clear-eyed observers will notice that these periodic uproars are rarely, if ever, spontaneous. They are almost always contrived by political actors for political purposes. Ayatollah Khomeini's issuance of a fatwa against Salman Rushdie helped distract attention from the bitter decision to end the war with Iraq with a compromise peace he could have had six years earlier, sparing hundreds of thousands of Iranian lives. The Danish cartoon incident was the work of freelance European imams, hoping -- like Al Sharpton in the Tawana Brawley case -- to promote themselves through a manufactured controversy. (The most provocative of the Danish cartoons were apparently fakes.) And this latest video uproar has been used by the Muslim Brotherhood government of Egypt to rally support against the last of the old leaders of the Egyptian army and security services. Opportunistic leaders use these incidents in this way for one reason: They work. They gain results at low to nonexistent cost. And unfortunately international institutions have lent legitimacy to these outrages. Opinion: Should Google censor an anti-Islam video? Again and again over the past dozen years, the human rights bodies of the United Nations have adopted resolutions to condemn ""defamation of religion"" as a violation of human rights. The first of these resolutions, introduced in 1999 by Pakistan, specified the ""defamation of Islam."" More generic language was substituted, but everybody understands that only one religion is meant. These resolutions are in no way legally binding on anybody. Yet they are very far from harmless. They allow persecution-minded governments and clerics to tell their citizens and adherents that they are not attacking human rights when they pronounce death in the name of religion. Oh no: they are upholding human rights. The violence threatened against those who say things that displease some mullah has distorting effects on Western societies too -- and not just on low-life provocateurs such as the so-called ""Sam Bacile."" This month, Britain's Channel 4 broadcast a new documentary on the historical origins of Islam, written and narrated by the distinguished classicist Tom Holland and based on Holland's previous book on the subject. Holland's book and documentary presented in accessible form the fruits of recent scholarship, widely accepted by leading academic authorities. That research points to Islam originating in Syria, not Arabia; points to parts of the Quran being translated from other languages, especially Aramaic; and points to the probability that Islam coalesced as a religion after the conquest of Mesopotamia and Persia rather than beforehand. As I mentioned, these are not new insights, but to date they have been published mostly by academics in books written for academics. When this knowledge was made available to the broader public, however, it generated more than 1,000 complaints to British TV licensing authorities and death threats against Holland. Last week, a scheduled public screening of the documentary was canceled because of security concerns. By threat of violence, Western intellectual life is policed and corrupted. The YouTube video ""Innocence of Muslims"" is no monument to either art or scholarship. It's a shabby piece of hack work. But it is as protected by the right to speak as the work of Rushdie or Holland -- because if it is not, their rights will be truncated too, as indeed they have been. The Obama administration's response to date to the video incident has been depressing and shameful. It's not too late to change course. Opinion: Extremists and leaders incite violent protests . President Barack Obama delivers his annual address to the United Nations on September 25. Let him take time in that speech to refute and repudiate blasphemy laws. Let him say that he upholds and vindicates free speech as an American right  and that he respects and endorses free speech as a universal human right. Let him say that Americans will be protected in their speech rights against threats of violence from anyone, anywhere. Let him say that if freedom of speech means anything, it means first and foremost the right to criticize orthodoxy, political or religious. Let him say that freedom of speech includes the right to mock, to be rude, to be stupid and to be wrong -- because we know that speech that is stupid and wrong will be rebutted, refuted and mocked in its turn. Not everyone shares the American regard for free speech. That's their lookout. But the leaders of the United States will not be bullied into compromising their most cherished values -- and their most solemn constitutional obligations -- by inciters of mobs, by would-be dictators and by overweening street preachers. Let him say that, too. Follow @CNNOpinion on Twitter .","David Frum: Obama team has focused response on blaming the offensive video .

Keswick Hall at MonticelloKeswick, Virginia . You'd never know it today, but the estate's historic 1912 wing, originally christened Villa Crawford for its first owner, fell into serious decay and was boarded up for many years. That is until 1990, when Sir Bernard Ashley (the widower of famed designer Laura Ashley) bought the 600-acre manor with the intention of turning it into a ""country house hotel"" fit for a king. His subsequent $25 million makeover both modernized and upgraded the property, while maintaining its fundamental structure and design, and then he added antiques and artworks throughout from his own private collection. From $495 per night. www.keswick.com . 8 very old sites in the New World . Dolce Hayes MansionSan Jose, California . Flush with riches from iron ore mining enterprises in Michigan and Wisconsin, Mary Hayes Chynoweth and her two sons had this expansive Mediterranean triple residence built in the early 1900s.

"Dear Chicago, . You sure aren't perfect. Numerous city aldermen and officials have been brought down by corruption charges. Your schools are failing. You have a high rate of gun violence, which has cast shadows upon your reputation. Despite the long list of wrongs, there are a lot of things you do right. Lifelong Chicagoans and loving visitors are consistently complimentary of you. We say this without shame: Chicago, we love you, imperfections and all. You are 77 official neighborhoods, according to the mayor's office. But more than 200 ""pocket"" neighborhoods make up your anatomy. WBEZ: Who creates Chicago's neighborhoods? Your people ride through your bloodstream on the L, where we can see your distinct personalities in each lively neighborhood. Concert venues and Al Capone's favorite hangout, the Green Mill, beam as we zoom through Uptown. The Garfield Park Conservatory emanates natural beauty on the West Side. And lessons from the past fill our minds as we near the DuSable Museum of African American History in Washington Park. ""Chicago is the world in one place. It's being able to get tacos in Little Village one day for lunch and tzatziki in Greek Town the next,"" says 21-year-old student Reynaldo Leal. Persian, Polish or Puerto Rican, you've got the world covered. Your citizens make you who you are, with people from across the globe calling you home. Some stay put in their ethnic enclaves, speaking their native tongues, while others are curious neighborhood hoppers who seek authentic food and culture. Chicago. Just saying your name is enough to conjure fond memories for Amanda Fallico. She can imagine riding down Lake Shore Drive on a warm summer evening. Summer is when our love for you crescendos. You are at your peak of liveliness. Tight-knit families watching movies in the park, children playing games at North Avenue Beach and couples strolling along the magnificent lakefront are some of the things that bring you to life come summer. ""Chicago's parks are the settings for (a) world-class collection of sculptures, and the people of Chicago are lucky enough to have them in their backyard,"" says Matt Kochar. But even in the winter, for any of us who brave the never-ending snowfall and brutal, subzero wind chills, you are truly a beauty. When the tourists are too scared to come outside, it's us locals who get the rare treat of staring into Cloud Gate (affectionately known as ""the Bean"") all alone. Zahava Hanuka witnessed your quiet side during a moment just like this. While the Bean, Chicago Picasso and Alexander Calder's Flamingo are all figures of beauty, your buildings and stunning skyscrapers are architectural marvels in themselves. Whether we're lost in the past of the historic Rookery building or meandering through the urban canyons beneath the futuresque Trump Tower, your architecture tells us the story of your life. Sometimes, you talk to us through your buildings. When the Blackhawks made the playoffs last year, skyscrapers lit up with words of encouragement. The same treatment goes for the Bears, Bulls, Sox and well, someday the Cubs. (Here's to hoping someone breaks the Curse of the Billy Goat soon!) Share your Wrigley Field photos . Your cheering buildings prove you're a big city that doesn't take yourself too seriously. As Swathi Sridhara puts it, ""Chicagoans have a unique blend of small-town Midwest charm and a gritty city work ethic."" And if your gleaming towers and your potholed streets are your skeleton, then your heart lies in your people. Farhaj Hassan, who moved away as a child, said it well: ""Chicago doesn't just reside in our heart -- it is our heart. Chicago is us, we of Chicago are Chicago.""

"Beach bums beware: 10% of water samples collected from U.S. beaches failed to meet the government benchmark for swimmer safety, according to a new report. It's an icky thought, especially considering the popularity of several of the failing beaches included in the Natural Resources Defense Council's 24th annual ""Testing the Waters"" report. Beach choices matter: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates up to 3.5 million people become ill from poor water treatment each year, largely because of contact with ""raw sewage from sanitary overflows."" ""Sewage and contaminated runoff in the water should never ruin a family beach trip,"" said NRDC senior attorney Jon Devine in a statement. ""But no matter where you live, urban slobber and other pollution can seriously compromise the water quality at your favorite beach and make your family sick."" So which beaches are ""superstars"" and which are ""repeat offenders""? Here's the good, the bad and the ugly. The good . At 4%, the eastern coastline comprised of beaches in Delaware, Maryland and Virginia boasts the lowest failure rate of beach water samples in the country. All samples were tested against the new EPA water quality standard, called the ""Beach Action Value."" For individual states, Delaware, New Jersey and New Hampshire tied for the top marks, each with a 3% failure rate. Additionally, the NRDC selected 35 beaches as ""superstars"" -- meaning popular spots that consistently meet water quality safety thresholds. These locations spanned 14 states and showed at least a 98% water safety record over five years: . -- Alabama: Gulf Shores Public Beach in Baldwin County, Gulf State Park Pavilion in Baldwin County, Dauphin Island Public Beach. -- California: Newport Beach in Orange County (one of three monitored sections). -- Delaware: Dewey Beach-Swedes in Sussex County. -- Florida: Bowman's Beach in Lee County, Coquina Beach South in Manatee County, Fort De Soto North Beach in Pinellas County. -- Georgia: Tybee Island North in Chatham County. -- Hawaii: Hapuna Beach State Recreation Area on the Big Island, Po'ipu Beach Park on Kauai, Wailea Beach Park on Maui. -- Massachusetts: Singing Beach in Essex County. -- Maryland: Point Lookout State Park in St Mary's County, Assateague State Park in Worcester County. -- North Carolina: Ocean Pier at Main Street and Sunset Boulevard in Brunswick County, Beach at Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in Dare County, Ocean Pier at Salisbury Street at Wrightsville Beach in New Hanover County, Ocean Pier at Ocean Boulevard and Crews Avenue in Topsail Beach in Pender County. -- New Hampshire: Hampton Beach State Park in Rockingham County, Wallis Sands Beach at Wallis Road in Rockingham County, Wallis Sands State Park in Rockingham County. -- New Jersey: Washington (Margate) in Atlantic County, 40th Street (Avalon) in Cape May County, 40th Street (Sea Isle City) in Cape May County, Stone Harbor at 96th Street in Cape May County, Upper Township at Webster Road in Cape May County, Wildwood Crest at Orchid in Cape May County, Broadway (Point Pleasant Beach) in Ocean County . -- New York: Long Beach City in Nassau County. -- Virginia: Virginia Beach at 28th Street in Virginia Beach County, Virginia Beach at 45th Street in Virginia Beach County, Back Bay Beach in Virginia Beach County, Virginia Beach -- Little Island Beach North in Virginia Beach County. -- Washington: Westhaven State Park, South Jetty in Grays Harbor. The bad . The new ""Beach Action Value"" resulted in a significant increase in failure rates in 2013, especially in certain states. The Great Lakes region had the highest rate of beach water impurities, with 13% of all samples failing to pass safety standards. The region was also home to the worst individual state offender, Ohio, which posted a 35% failure rate. Next closest states were Alaska and Mississippi, with 24% and 21% failure, respectively. Under the old, less-stringent standard, 7% to 8% of beaches failed to meet water quality standards. This year, the number jumped to 10%. The report detailed the disastrous effects swimming in infected waters could have. ""Beach water pollution nationwide causes a range of waterborne illnesses in swimmers including stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, ear, nose and throat problems, dysentery, hepatitis ... and other serious health problems,"" it said. ""For senior citizens, small children and people with weak immune systems, the results can even be fatal."" The ugly . Some beaches just don't get the hint. Over the past five years of analyzing over 3,500 beach water samples, the NRDC has identified 17 U.S. beaches that have ""consistent contamination problems."" To qualify for this ""repeat offender"" list, a beach has failed to meet public standards for water quality more than 25% of the time since 2009 -- a dubious distinction. Here they are: . -- California: Malibu Pier, 50 yards east of the pier, in Los Angeles County . -- Indiana: Jeorse Park Beach in Lake County (both monitored sections): Lake Jeorse Park Beach I, Lake Jeorse Park Beach II. -- Massachusetts: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County. -- Maine: Goodies Beach in Knox County. -- New Jersey: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County. -- New York: Main Street Beach in Chautauqua County, Wright Park -- East in Chautauqua County, Ontario Beach in Monroe County. -- Ohio: Lakeshore Park in Ashtabula County, Arcadia Beach in Cuyahoga County, Euclid State Park in Cuyahoga County, Noble Beach in Cuyahoga County, Sims Beach in Cuyahoga County, Villa Angela State Park in Cuyahoga County, Edson Creek in Erie County. -- Wisconsin: South Shore Beach in Milwaukee County. What you can do . Strictly swimming in ""superstar"" beaches would be a plus, but the NRDC has other recommendations on how to remain safe in troubled waters. Here are two suggestions: . -- ""Stay away from beaches with visible discharge pipes and avoid swimming at urban beaches after a heavy rainfall."" -- ""A good rule of thumb is to avoid swimming at the beach for at least 24 hours after it rains and 72 hours after heavy rains.""

"Imagine the delight at unwrapping your Christmas present in 2043 and discovering you've been gifted a trip around the Moon. It may seem a little far-fetched right now but it could become a reality if space companies like Virgin Galactic realize their aspirations over the next 30 years or so. Richard Branson and his children are due to fly in his company's spaceship on its first commercial flight currently slated for 2014. But speaking to CNN outside a space conference in the UK last week, the company's CEO George Whitesides said their ambitions extended beyond sub-orbital flights for those first customers. ""If we can make significant progress on the challenge of reusable space access then I think that opens up all kinds of opportunities in the future,"" he said. ""One of the directions that might open up is high-speed point-to-point travel on Earth -- so that you could go from London to Singapore in an hour or go from London to Los Angeles in a couple of hours. ""We may be able to open up the opportunity for habitats in low Earth orbit, we could make it more affordable to do longer term flights -- even trips around the Moon. I think he [Branson] has high aspirations for a lot of these different activities."" For the moment, Whitesides said the company is focused on completing the test flight program in preparation for the passenger flights that he said Virgin Galactic aims to run on a weekly basis once the service is established. Whitesides later told delegates at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory space conference that about 650 people had signed up for the trip, and over the next couple of years the company would double the number of people who have been into space since Yuri Gagarin's flight in 1961 which heralded the start of human exploration of space. But Virgin is not alone in developing the space tourism business. It faces competition from other commercial enterprises trying to attract fee-paying passengers -- and many agencies now offer satellite delivery services. Blue Origin, set up by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, says it is developing technologies to enable human access to space. And another private company, SpaceX, has already delivered payloads to the International Space Station. So with private companies launching services and national space agencies like India's ISRO joining the exploration of Mars and China setting off to land a probe on the Moon, is a fresh space race emerging? Whitesides suggests there is a new era dawning. ""This is a great time,"" he told CNN. ""There's a renaissance in space access -- between us and Blue and SpaceX and all these companies -- it's so exciting. ""I think there's a very good chance that we're alive when we actually find another 'Earth' in another solar system -- how profound is that?"" Scientists may get closer to that goal if proposed missions outlined at the UK conference get off the ground. Professor Giovanna Tinetti explained how one of the European Space Agency's candidate missions -- a space telescope called EChO -- would help analyze what exoplanet environments are like and whether they might be suitable for life. Delegates also heard about the plan to send a new probe to the Jovian system. The JUICE mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer) aims to explore not only the gas giant but also its three moons Ganymede, Callisto and Europa. Space physicist Professor Michele Dougherty said they were interested in finding out if water really is trapped between icy layers on Ganymede and its implications for ""watery worlds"" beyond Earth. The search for Earth-like planets is clearly something that fascinates Whitesides too. He believes we will soon be able to detect seasons on other worlds. And he's unlikely to have to wait until 2043 for his first taste of space adventure, having signed up for a seat in his company's spaceship. ""I'm actually a customer as well,"" he said. ""My wife and I bought two tickets in 2005. ""I think it's important that I fly because just as Richard's flight is such an important signal to our customers that he believes in the system, similarly I need to do that as well.""

"Port-Au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Haiti's economy is getting a boost thanks to a venture with one of Korea's largest companies that promises to bring 20,000 garment industry jobs to a new industrial park in the north of the country. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton and Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive were joined by members of the Interim Haitian Recovery Commission, the Inter-American Development Bank, Haitian business leaders and the chairman of Sae-A Trading Co. Ltd. at the Haiti Apparel Center in Port-au-Prince as they signed an agreement to build the North Industrial Park. It's part of an effort to rebuild the Haitian economy that began even before the earthquake struck one year ago. ""This will inspire people all over Latin America, the Caribbean, the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia who have thought seriously about investing in Haiti and not come through,"" said Clinton. ""What we need is a commitment to be competitive in getting investment and putting people to work, and then we need to build the institutions that will allow the people to flower. That is our commitment."" Smiling, Bellerive said that looking back over the past year, ""This is the best day of my life today."" The project is expected to generate $500 million in wages and benefits over 10 years and result in Haiti's first textile mill, according to its backers. Investment in the industrial park will also include the construction of at least 5,000 homes. The United States will oversee the construction of a power grid that will provide electricity to the park and the surrounding area. The garment industry had been the prime source of Haitian exports before the earthquake and it remains so today. About 28,000 people currently work in Haiti's garment sector, manufacturing products for Gap, JCPenney, Wal-Mart, New Balance and other well-known brands. Georges Sassine owns a garment plant in Port-au-Prince that employs 530 people. He believes the garment industry holds the key to growing Haiti's economy and making the country self-sufficient. ""Today, this industry represents over 50% of our earned foreign currency earnings. It also represents over 50% of the total commercial exports of Haiti,"" he said. Sassine didn't have a problem retaining buyers after the earthquake. ""We shipped our first container 10 days after the quake. We were ready to do business."" At the time, he had to ship his goods over land to the Dominican Republic before delivering them to buyers. Today, he is able to ship goods from a reopened port in the capital, Port-au-Prince.","The project began even before the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti .
Clinton says it will inspire more investment in Haiti .
The plans include a textile mill and 5,000 homes ."
