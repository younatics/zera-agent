They are one of the most iconic symbols of British independence and the inspiration for one of the most famous wartime songs. But walkers have been warned to take care when walking along a stretch of the famous White Cliffs of Dover after tonnes of chalk crashed into the English Channel when part of the cliff-face sheared off. A giant mound of clay was left on the shore near St Margaret's Bay after the collapse between between Dover and Deal in Kent. Landslide: Tonnes of chalk were left piled on the Kent coastline after part of the White Cliffs of Dover collapsed . Warning signs: The collapse happened in St Margaret's Bay between Dover and Deal in Kent, and the National Trust has now put up signs telling walkers to beware further collapses in the area . Dover Coastguard said a bench and fencing which sat on the cliff-top were also sent tumbling to the base, prompting warnings to coastal walkers. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The collapse is thought to have been caused by a combination of high winds and rain freezing after being absorbed into the chalk and then expanding, causing the cliff to weaken. A similar collapse saw a chunk of the cliff-face slip in March last year. A Dover Coastguard spokesman said: 'There was a similar fall in 2012 but this one is smaller than that one. A bench and fence have gone down with it. Rubble: The National Trust, which owns the stretch of land said that the collapse was smaller than a similar one last March . 'Coastguard rescue officers were tasked to make an assessment of the area and take some pictures which were sent off to the relevant authorities. 'The cliff-fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level, and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high.' On a clear day you can see right across from the Dover cliffs to the cliffs on the French coast at Cap Gris Nez, proof of the continuous strata of chalk. About 70million years ago this part of Britain was submerged by a shallow sea. The sea bottom was made of a white mud formed from the fragments of coccoliths - the skeletons of tiny algae which floated in the surface waters of the sea. This mud became the chalk. It is believed to have been deposited very slowly, probably only half a millimetre a year. In spite of this, up to 500 metres of chalk were deposited in places. The coccoliths are too small to be seen without a microscope but if you look carefully you can find fossils of some of the larger inhabitants of the chalk sea such as sponges, shells, ammonites and urchins. (Source: Dover Museum) The National Trust, which owns the land, were told of the collapse and have put up signs warning walkers to beware. A National Trust spokesman said: 'This . cliff fall is part of a process of natural regeneration that happens on . this world famous stretch of the Kent coast, helping to keep this . special place, recognised by millions across the world, so distinctive. 'We’ve installed signs and information to help keep access open to this British icon. 'Throughout the year we closely monitor how the elements affect the chalk cliffs, helping us to manage the coastal footpath.' The Kent landmark, immortalised by Dame Vera Lynn’s wartime song The White Cliffs of Dover, has suffered large falls before, and is thought to recede by around half an inch each year. Experts believe that the cliffs could move up to 200 yards further away from France by the end of the century. Parts of the cliffs are now supported by concrete. The chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the first arrival of the Romans and the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War. They are also home to a rich array of wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly and peregrine falcons, Kent’s only kittiwake, and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots. Last year, the National Trust, which owns five miles of the white cliffs, successfully raised money to buy a mile of the coastline from a private owner in a campaign backed by celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, singer Joss Stone and chef Rick Stein. More than 16,000 people and organisations backed the appeal, which was launched in June last year and saw an average donation of £40.21, including Gift Aid, from members of the public. Collapse: The cliff-fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level, and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high .

Google's chief executive Eric Schmidt has blasted the US government's spying on data centres as outrageous and illegal if true. The media mogul's comments came after reports emerged last week claiming officials had tapped into Google servers to access data in email accounts. It is the latest in a fresh string of allegations launched against America's National Security Agency (NSA) this month. Leaks including news that America has been tapping Angela Merkel's phone have put the nation at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies. 'It's really outrageous that the NSA was looking between the Google data centers, if that's true,' Mr Schmidt said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. 'The steps that the organization was willing to do without good judgment to pursue its mission and potentially violate people's privacy, it's not OK.' The NSA has allegedly collected the phone records of 320million people in order to identify roughly 300 people who might be at risk of intrusion, the CEO revealed. Mr Schmidt said: 'It's just bad public policy and perhaps illegal.' He added that Google had registered complaints with the NSA, President Barack Obama and Congress members. However, the NSA has declared that the report 'is not true'. Leak: Last week it was reported that the NSA tapped into Google and Yahoo servers to access email data . 'I can tell you factually we do not have access to Google servers, Yahoo servers,' NSA Director General Keith Alexander said at a conference last week. 'We go through a court order.' News reports that the NSA swept up millions of phone records in Europe have frayed relations with some U.S. allies, though the agency's chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that Nato allies collected and shared with the United States. Dismissing the latest revelation, the NSA referred again to its previous statements. Controversy: Former NSA worker Edward Snowden has leaked a tumult of data about the agency's operations . Meanwhile, US officials are on a push to regain the trust of the international community and top businesses like Google and Yahoo - which was also allegedly tapped. The US Senate Intelligence Committee approved legislation on Thursday that would tighten controls on the government's sweeping electronic eavesdropping programs - but critics attacked the move that will allow them to continue. On Friday, John Kerry indicated a softening of the U.Sâ€™s defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, admitting that on occasions its spying has â€˜reached too far inappropriatelyâ€™.","Media mogul has filed complaints with president and Congress members .

Piling on to a crammed Tube during the morning rush hour can be a gloomy way to start a winter's day, but pranksters have come up with a way to bring a smile to commuters' faces. Cheeky stickers have been slapped over the information signs on London Underground trains, showing a spider's web spanning the Central Line and Shepherd's Bush station renamed Shepherd's Pie. Transport for London's priority seat labels have also been replaced by stickers reserving spots for smelly commuters, drinkers, and even Her Majesty the Queen. The comedy stickers include this one showing a spider web on the Central Line . A blue sticker modelled on TfL priority seat signs features a picture of a crown and the words 'Royal seat: By appointment to Her Majesty Queen's bottom'. Other tongue-in-cheek stickers have been used to designate a 'drinking seat', for Tube passengers who want to 'get absolutely red signalled', a Harry Potter-inspired 'sorting seat' for those who need advice on where to go, and even an electric chair for smelly commuters. One label shows Oxford Street station renamed as 'Nightmare on Elm St', and indicates that passengers should change here for connections to Heaven or Hell. According to another of the comedy stickers, which appeared on a Facebook page called Stickers On The Central Line, lonely commuters can use the Tube to travel from 'Single' to 'In a Relationship' in a single stop with no changes.

Neglect: Tiffany Nicole Klapheke claims her military husband's deployment left her too stressed to care for her three children . Less than a week before a 22-month-old child was found dead in her urine-soaked bed, a Child Protection Services supervisor closed the case - despite it being 11 months since the home had been visited. Tamryn Klapheke suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died. She also had chemical burns on her face and body, indicating she was exposed to human waste for a long period of time. Her mother, Tiffany Nicole Klapheke, 21, was charged with . three felony counts of injury to a child in connection with her daughter's death and the severe neglect of her two other . daughters, aged six months and three years. She said she was depressed over her husband's deployment. On August 22, Texas CPS caseworker Claudia Gonzalez closed the case without making a required final visit to the family or having someone approve the case's closure. Tamryn died on August 28 at an Abilene hospital after being found unresponsive at her Dyess Air Force Base home. Because of this, and a series of other errors by CPS workers in Abilene, the agency is now the center of a rare criminal investigation, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'The Abilene Police Department is actively investigating the local CPS office,' Chief Stan Standridge confirmed, declining to give any other details. Horror: Tamryn Klapheke, aged just 22-months, suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died . Absence: Klapheke, pictured with her husband Thomas,had a boyfriend in the home at the time her child died, according to CPS . Home life: The husband, pictured in their Texas home with an infant, presumably their youngest child Tamryn; MailOnline has blurred their face . When Tamryn died, the agency had a backlog of almost 500 cases, with each caseworker handling a load of more than 60 at a time. The Klapheke's children had been the . subject of three previous neglect investigations between April 2010 and . September 2011. Though neglect had been ruled out in all three, between the last . visit and the time of Tamryn's death, a lot had changed within the home. Tiffany Klapheke had given birth to a . third girl, lost her job and said goodbye to her husband Thomas, . who had been deployed to Oman. When questioned by police, Klapheke said she was 'stressed out and depressed' and had no help looking after her children or the home. Felonies: The young mother is charged with three felony counts of injury to a child in connection with her 22-month-old daughter's death and the severe neglect of her two other daughters . 'I just got tired of always changing the sheets, so it was on there a little bit longer than it should have been,' she said. Klapheke recalled her impatience over her children's potty training, saying she left her toddler in the crib in her own urine for nearly a week. CPS records show that she had a boyfriend in the home at the time of Tamryn's death, also an active duty service member. Tamryn's sisters now are in foster care together. CPS spokesman Patrick Crimmins told . the Houston Chronicle: 'We are providing a great deal of support and . services to the father, and everyone involved in the case has agreed . that this is what is best right now.

Check please: Anthony Malabehar has been jailed for three years after refusing to pay his restaurant bill . A diner who refused to pay for his meal at a Charleston steak house will now eat for free for three years, after being sent to prison. Anthony M Malabehar ran up a $70 bill at the Alamo Steak House in Mattoon, after enjoying a meal on April 4 and then refusing to pay. The 47-year-old had pleaded guilty earlier in the year to not paying for a meal at a different restaurant. Malabehar, who enjoyed drinks, an appetizer and entree at the steakhouse, told staff he could not pay and, according to the Journal Gazette & Times-Courier, just waited for police to arrest him. In February, Malabehar refused to pay for his dinner at the Hunan Chinese restaurant in Mattoon. Because of this, and other theft convictions, he was sentenced to three years, and ordered to pay a $100 fine and reimburse the Alamo Steakhouse for his meal. Assistant stateâ€™s attorney Rob Scales said Malabehar refused to explain why he stole from the restaurants. In both cases he told restaurant workers that he couldnâ€™t pay. A charge that Malabehar had gone to the restaurant with the intention to steal, which carried a maximum sentence of 14 years, was dismissed by the court. Tall order: Anthony Malabehar enjoyed meals at Alamo and Hunan in Mattoon, then refused to pay . As Malabehar settles into life as a prisoner he will be able to dine without paying on a daily basis. Prisoners in Illinois have a choice of eating for free in the prison canteen, or buying pricey food from the prison shop. However, recent cutbacks in prisons have led to complaints about the quality and portion size in some U.S. prisons.","Charleston man enjoyed meal and drinks then waited for police to arrive .

A long-lost diary belonging to one of Adolf Hitler's senior henchman has been found at a private company in upstate New York after it went missing 70 years ago. The 400 loose, handwritten pages were pictured on Thursday as federal authorities announced at a press conference that they had seized the wartime diary of Nazi official Alfred Rosenberg after it went missing 70 years ago. The diary pages were found at a business in Lewiston, New York. Part of history: Federal officials announced the seizure of a long-lost diary kept by a close confidant of Adolph Hitler, Alfred Rosenberg after they were uncovered in upstate New York . Harrowing tales: A diary has been recovered which belonged to Hitler confidant Alfred Rosenberg with the chilling language of the fascist regime . A criminal investigation has been launched to work out how Rosenberg's diary, a key portion of evidence during the Nuremberg trials, ended up in the U.S., CNN reported. Senior Nazi Alfred Rosenberg played a significant role in . the slaughter of millions of Jews and other non-Aryans considered . inferior under the Third Reich. He was convicted of war crimes at the . Nuremberg trials after World War II and executed in 1946. Officials say Rosenberg's diary was smuggled . into the U.S. after the war, most likely by Robert M.W. Kempner, a government lawyer during the Nuremberg trials. Born in Germany, Kempner had fled to America in the 1930s to escape the Nazis, only to return for post-war trials. Kempner . cited a few Rosenberg diary excerpts in his memoir, and in 1956 a . German historian published entries from 1939 and 1940. But the bulk of . the diary never surfaced. The lawyer died in 1993, and museum officials later took possession of some of his . extensive document collection. But the Rosenberg diary remained missing . until recently. 'One of . the enduring mysteries of the Second World War is what happened to the . Rosenberg diary,' said John Morton, director of U.S. Immigrations and . Custom Enforcement said on Thursday. 'We have solved that mystery.' Evil workings: Reichsleader Alfred Rosenberg (left) and Reichsminister Dr Henrich Lammers with Adolf Hitler . Learning from the horrors of the past: Holocaust experts are set to decipher and examine the diary in detail . The search for the diary dates to 1996, when two of Kempner's . former legal secretaries approached a Holocaust museum official about . Kempner's collection of papers. Over . several years, museum officials assessed and took possession . of several documents from Kempner's collection, although some material . they initially viewed in 1997 at Kempner's Pennsylvania home were . missing when they went to retrieve the papers. Officials later learned that the two secretaries and 'another gentleman from upstate New York' had taken the papers. Officials . later found the materials at the home in Lewiston, New York, with the . help of a private investigator and former FBI agent. Acting . upon a warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in Delaware, . authorities seized the diary in April. Authorities repeatedly refused to . say who had the diary. 'After a bit of negotiation, shall we say, we were allowed to remove this material,' Mayer said. He offered no other details. On Thursday, officials from the . Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department joined . experts from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for a news conference to . outline how they found the documents, which cover the years 1936 to . 1944. Gerhard . Weinberg, professor emeritus of history at the University of North . Carolina and a leading historian on the Nazi era, said the diary could . shed new light on Rosenberg's role in administering the occupied eastern . territories, and his relationships with other high-ranking Nazi . officials. Museum officials . said the documents provide valuable information, as Rosenberg helped . orchestrate the looting of artwork and other valuables from . Nazi-occupied territory during that the time. 'Its . discovery will undoubtedly give scholars new insight into the politics . of Nazi leaders and fulfills a museum commitment to uncover evidence . from perpetrators of the Holocaust,' the web posting said. Important find: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director John Morton (second left) points to evidence as Henry Mayer (second right), senior adviser on archives at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, looks over pages of the 'Rosenberg Diary' Researchers have yet to begin a thorough examination of Rosenberg's diary. But Henry Mayer, a senior adviser on archives for the Holocaust museum, suggested that it will offer some 'amazing new evidence' and that he believes some of the material will contradict written history. Rosenberg, a Nazi ideologue and propagandist, was the author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a 1930 book espousing the superiority of Aryan culture over the Jewish race. He later led the Nazi Party's foreign affairs department and rose through the party hierarchy to become Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories in 1941. 'It is very possible that, at least to some extent, there will be clues not just to Rosenberg's total lack of brilliance, but there will, or well might be, interesting bits of information on conversations he had with other important figures in the government,' Weinberg said of the diary. 'It's important that as soon as possible, somebody decipher the handwriting and publish, hopefully, an annotated edition of this material,' Weinberg said. 'It is also possible that we will all be disappointed. There may turn out to be very little that we don't know.' Among . early translated excerpts is a passage from 1941 in which Rosenberg . wrote proudly of a conference marking 'the first time in European . history that 10 European nations were represented at an anti-Jewish . conference with the clear program to remove this race from Europe. ...' Historic role: Robert M. W. Kempner, a Nuremberg prosecutor, was long suspected by U.S. officials of smuggling Rosenberg's diary out of Germany after the Nazi trials . Later that year, Rosenberg wrote of reports that Russian leader Josef Stalin had ordered the 400,000 Volga Germans 'to be dragged away to Siberia, i.e. to have them murdered. ...' 'Yesterday I had a proposal drafted for communication by broadcast to Russia, England and the USA that in case this mass murder is implemented, Germany will punish the Jews of Central Europe for this.' Other translated excerpts involve the 1936 Olympic games, including Rosenberg's assertions that Britons were 'angry about the negroes from the USA as they squeeze out the English during the Olympic Games'.

A surveillance image of a 'person of interest' in connection with a bank robbery where a policeman was shot dead has been released. The grainy picture, issued on Thursday as part of a nationwide manhunt, shows a man in a hoodie at a convenience store minutes before the armed robbery on December 23 in Tupelo, Mississippi. A desperate search involving the FBI is underway as police in Chicago were placed on high alert following reports the gunman may have fled to the city. Father-of-two Corporal Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, was shot dead when he tried to stop suspects in a car as they waited at a level crossing. Authorities have released a photograph of a man in a hoodie at a convenience store shortly before the robbery . At least one of the gang shot Cpl Stauffer at close range from inside the vehicle before driving off. Fellow officer, Joseph Maher, 27, was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious but stable condition. Cpl Stauffer is due to be buried today with military and law enforcement honors. Detectives increased the reward from $152,000 to $162,500 for information that can help them catch the suspects who are believed to have robbed BancorpSouth bank in Tupelo. Tragedy: Cpl Kevin Gale Stauffer, 38, was killed after trying to apprehend a car of suspected bank robbers . Authorities warned that the heavily-armed suspects could also have fled to either Alabama or Arkansas. One suspect being sought is a thin, possibly African-American man with light complexion, between 5ft 9in and 6in, according to Mississippi Department of Public Safety. CCTV footage, which has been released to the public, shows one of the suspects in a convenience store wearing khaki trousers, white Converse trainers, a long-sleeved jacket and a blue ski mask. The robbers are thought to have been driving a dark grey sedan. A team of more than 100 law enforcement staff worked over Christmas Day and Boxing Day to trace the gang. On Christmas Day, a candlelit vigil was held in the town centre for Mr Stauffer, a combat veteran of the Louisiana Army National Guard with whom he served a tour in Iraq. Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton praised Cpl Stauffer, who 'made the ultimate sacrifice for his community'. Grieving wife Beth Stauffer told WTVA-TV: 'I have my moments.

A man was arrested Wednesday after climbing a fence at the Phoenix airport on Christmas Day and running out to a plane that had just landed. Police say Robert Edward Bump, 49, got onto the taxiway around 5:30 p.m. and started banging on the engine of a Southwest Airlines plane. The shocking breach was one of two that occurred Christmas day at major American airports that have made multimillion dollar perimeter upgrades in the years of heightened security concerns since September 11. Scroll down for video... Again? Robert Edward Bump, 49 (pictured), was arrested Christmas Day for allegedly scaling a fence and running up to and smacking a plane at the Phoenix International Airport . It was also the fourth such breach in ten years at the Phoenix airport, according to KPHO. No injuries were reported, and Phoenix police Officer James Holmes said passengers were never in danger. Police announced the breach one day after Siyah Bryant, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey made headlines after allegedly stumbling through security a Newark International Airport while dressed in women's clothing after a 'bad date' despite the hub's reported $300 perimeter upgrade. According to the New York Post, Bryant said he felt unsafe and left his date when the man called a friend to bring them gasoline. Police say Bump (center), who is homeless, was spotted by airport employees after he scaled a fence while intoxicated on Christmas . In one piece: Police say Bump ran up to a Southwest Airlines jet and tried to bang on the engines, which an alerted pilot had already shut off . Workers in the Phoenix airport's tower had spotted a man climbing the fence and running onto the tarmac and then the taxiway near Terminal 3. The pilot was alerted of the man's presence and turned off the engines before he reached the aircraft. Surveillance video shows the man being surrounded by airport security vehicles as he wandered away from the plane with his arms outstretched as if he were flying. A police officer arrived soon after and arrested him. Bump showed signs of drug and alcohol impairment and was booked on a misdemeanor charge of entering a restricted area at the airport, said Holmes, adding that the man didn't explain to authorities during questioning why he did it. 'He didn't really say anything that made any sense,' Holmes said. Bryant was reportedly able to enter Terminal C at the Newark airport (pictured) and was not spotted until he confronted a United Airlines employee . It wasn't immediately clear whether Bump has an attorney. Police said he is homeless. Security on the airport's runway system has been breached in the past. In November 2012, a woman rammed through a partially open gate at the Phoenix airport and drove on the runway with her infant son in the car. Also, Sky Harbor spent $10 million to upgrade its perimeter security and access gates after a man being chased by police in 2005 crashed a stolen pickup through a gate and drove onto the runways, passing several jets on a taxiway. It's not known whether the airport has a perimeter intrusion detection system consisting of ground and motion sensors and closed-circuit cameras. Sky Harbor officials declined to comment on the security breach and referred questions to Phoenix police, who said they won't talk specifics about the airport's security. A $300million dollar security system is supposed to detect any breaches on the Newark Liberty International Airport grounds . Jeff Price, an aviation professor at the Metropolitan State University of Denver and former assistant security director at Denver International Airport, said perimeter intrusion detection systems might be needed at the nation's larger airports as an extra layer, given their prominence and volume of passengers. Still, installing such a detection system is no guarantee that breaches will be avoided. ""There's no such thing as airtight security,"" Price said. Price said it looked as though people working in the airport tower did as they were supposed to by responding quickly. While perimeter fences are a key part of airport security, Price said an airport relies on many layers of security, including workers required to challenge and report people on air fields who don't have security badges.","Robert Edward Bump, 49, was arrested Christmas day for climbing over a fence and onto the tarmac of Phoenix Sky Harbor International .

Major food companies are 'hoodwinking' shoppers by naming products after ingredients that aren't even in the packet, an investigation has found. Beef and Tomato Pot Noodle, Uncle Ben’s chicken rice and Schwartz bacon-flavour bits are just some of the big brands which fake their meat content to entice consumers. Instead, manufacturers create phoney meat flavouring using lumps of soya protein, yeast extract and powdered vegetables. One popular product even achieves its meaty appearance by colouring their food with crushed insects. But an investigation conducted for MailOnline . by leading consumer activist Martin Isark found that nearly all of this . information was buried on the back of the packet where shoppers are . often too busy to look. Not what it says on the tin: Some of the big brands that name their food after meat that's not even in the packet. But what do they use instead? Find out below... With the recent horse meat scandal making many people sensitive about what's in their food, campaigners now want firms to be more honest with their packaging. Mr Isark, founder of the Can I Eat It? barcode scanning app and website, said: 'They’re not breaking any rules – but there are calls for clearer labelling to stop shoppers from being caught out. 'The information's all there on the back of the pot, but not on the front - and that’s the part facing busy shoppers.' His supermarket survey found all Pot Noodles including Beef and Tomato, Chinese Chow Mein and Sticky Rib could be eaten by a vegetarian as they contain soya pieces and artificial MSG flavourings. Even Schwartz bacon-flavour bits have come nowhere near a pig. They are instead fashioned out of textured vegetable protein. And the bacon-style colour is achieved . by a little-known ingredient called carmine or E120, a red dye . made from the crushed bodies of beetles which may well be an unpalatable addition for many consumers, particularly vegetarians. Major food companies are 'hoodwinking' shoppers by naming products after ingredients that aren't in the packet . Meanwhile, a pack of bacon-flavoured, rasher-shaped Frazzles could also be enjoyed by non-meat eaters because they get their taste from smoke flavouring and flavour enhancers. Mr Isark says companies can get round the law by using the term 'flavour' on their products, but claims these are often in obscure places or hidden in the small print. Commenting on the findings, Liz O’Neill, head of communications for The Vegetarian Society, said: 'It’s important for everybody to know what’s in their food and it’s surprising how few people really do know what they’re eating. 'Vegetarians probably know more about ingredient lists than most consumers - indeed, that’s why many of us are vegetarians. 'However, we can all be caught out by misleading terms and it’s certainly a shame if vegetarians miss out on foods that they could enjoy because manufacturers believe that there are marketing benefits in the terms like ""beefy"" or ""chicken flavour"".' Tom Hay, vegetarian judge for Great Taste Awards, said: 'If I can eat these products, I want to know about it. 'Unfortunately, for the veggie shopper that ""suitable for vegetarians"" logo is often pretty well hidden. 'When products don’t contain the thing they’re supposed to taste of, food brands don’t like to shout about it.' Shopper Stuart Rhodes, 56, from Harrogate, told MailOnline: 'I think consumers are being hoodwinked by mislabelling of products. 'It’s just chemicals that are made to taste like the real thing - but they’re allowed to get away with it as long as they use the word ‘flavour’. 'And we’re being gullible enough to believe it. Some people don’t look beyond the label.' Here, Mr Isark gives his verdict on some of the main offenders.... Schwartz bacon flavour bits and Walkers Frazzles are just two of the so-called 'meaty' products that do not actually contain any meat . SCHWARTZ BACON FLAVOUR BITS . Main ingredients: Soyabean flour, sunflower oil, Salt, flavourings, colours (Paprika extract and carmine). MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT: . 'They are just textured vegetable . protein and meaty insects in the colour. 'Most shoppers have no idea when the ingredient list display colour as carmine or E120 - that it is a red dye made from the powdered bodies of . the cochineal insects. 'Manufacturers should stop hiding unpalatable information behind . E-numbers or secondary names that don’t mean a jot to 99.9 per cent of . shoppers/consumers.' 'It would be more honest for food manufacturers to say: colour from . cochineal insects – the shopper would then be left in no doubt whether . to leave it on the shelf or put it in the trolley.' WHAT SCHWARTZ SAYS: 'We have clearly labelled our product ""Bacon FLAVOUR Bits"" to avoid any ambiguity and all ingredients are listed on the back of the pack. 'Carmine is a safe, natural and well-established food colouring.' WALKERS FRAZZLES . Main ingredients: Maize, vegetable oil , bacon flavour (lactose from milk), flavour enhancers including monosodium glutamate, yeast extract, rusk, smoke flavouring, colour (paprika extract, beetroot red) MARTIN ISARK'S VERDICT: . 'These crispy bacon Frazzles fake their bacon flavour with milk, the dreaded flavour enhancer monosodium glutamate (MSG), hydrolysed Soya protein and smoke flavouring. 'They colour them with paprika extract and beetroot red. Surely, real bacon would be a healthier option!' WHAT WALKERS SAYS: Not yet responded to request for comment.

Carlin Isles, 24, has signed a contract with the National Football League's Detroit Lions to play wide receiver, the team announced. Mr Isles will play at first for the team’s practice squad, according to the announcement. The season ends Sunday, it is not clear how long the contract will last. World-class speed: Carlin Isles runs a fast enough 100 meter dash to potentially qualify for the Olympics . The fastest player on the rugby pitch, he ran the benchmark 40-yard dash in less than 4.3 seconds, according to the team. That places him in the upper echelon of speed in the league. Mr Carlin plays winger for Team USA. His fastest 100 meter time of 10.13 seconds would have qualified for at least the semifinals at the 2012 London Summer Olympics, according to CNN. He was signed after another player was promoted from the practice squad to the main team for Sunday’s game, the last of the season. Wide receiver is a position where players with varying background from track and field to basketball have found success in the past. Mr Carlin isn’t even the only rugby player in the league. ‘Indianapolis has a rugby guy as a pass rusher (Daniel Adongo) and I know San Fran brought a guy in (Lawrence Okoye) that was a shot-putter or a discus guy,’ said Lions coach Jim Schwartz. The coach also mused about athletes from other sports making the jump to the gridiron. ‘It hasn't been unusual to see basketball players transition to the NFL,’ Mr Schwartz said. ‘That's not just recently, that goes way back. Even track guys like Bob Hayes and Renaldo Nehemiah, things like that. Afterburners: Mr Isles is the fastest man playing rugby right now, and could be the fastest man on any NFL team's roster . ‘An athlete's an athlete. There are skills that you can develop, and if you see something you like then you can work with him.’ Mr Adongo has played two games for the Colts this year while Mr Okoye was placed on season-ending injured reserve. With the allure of playing in the NFL being dangled in front of him, Mr Isles still plans to play Rugby. ‘Thank you everyone!!!!! No worries I'll still be playing rugby and will be in Vegas. God has been good and just enjoying gods blessings,’ he tweeted Thursday evening after the announcement was made public. He explained the move to CNN. ‘Rugby is quite similar to American football,’ Mr Isles said. ‘Besides the blocking and no pads, the tackling is similar. But American football you've got breaks -- rugby, you don't have no breaks, you've got to keep running and running.’ A similar game: Mr Isles during the Gold Coast Sevens round one match between the New Zealand All Blacks and the United States at Skilled Stadium on October 12, 2013 in Gold Coast, Australia . He played football in both high school and college before joining US rugby, he added. His new coach is excited at his potential, and even compared him to one of the league’s best return men. ‘He's a legit track guy,’ Schwartz said in the statement. ‘I mean, his background happened to be rugby, but it's probably more track and that speed, that's not unusual at all to see track athletes get chances. ‘The guy for Denver [return man Trindon Holliday] that went to LSU had a similar background and maybe even similar size,’ he continued. The team may be looking outside the box for answers after missing the playoffs and going into the season’s final game with seven wins and eight losses.","Carlin Isles, 24, has signed a contract to play wide receiver with the NFL's Detroit Lions .

Weighing 28 stone, Tracey Shellard claimed she was so unwell she could hardly walk and struggled even to make a cup of tea. Over the years Shellard, 49, claimed almost £100,000 in benefits by detailing severe health problems linked to her obesity. But her sob story, a court heard, turned out to be a big fat lie. While receiving the benefits, Shellard went on a strict calorie-controlled diet and began to lose vast amounts of weight, slimming down to 10 stone. Shamed: Tracey Shellard, 49, pictured leaving Manchester Crown Court, said she needed benefits because she could not even make a cup of tea due to her 28 stone weight . Yet she hid the news from the . Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Far from being incapable of . looking after herself, she ditched her mobility scooter, began taking . her dog on long walks and was fit enough to carry heavy shopping bags. A covert surveillance operation was launched by the DWP, and she was spotted carrying a 32-inch television from the shops. Eventually Shellard was arrested and . hauled before the courts, where she admitted four charges of failing to . notify of a change in circumstances. She was branded a ‘lying scrounger’ by the judge at Manchester Crown Court, but was spared jail, despite a . previous conviction for benefit fraud in the 1990s. Up and about: Surveillance footage of Tracey Shellard on a shopping trip recorded by Department for Work and Pensions investigators proved to be crucial evidence in convicting her of benefit fraud . Caught in the act: Tracey Shellard, 49, of Wythenshawe, Manchester, pictured centre, was filmed carrying a television during a DWP sting - despite saying she was too fat to make a cup of tea . Spending spree: Tracey Shellard, who claimed to be too fat to work, was caught by undercover investigators buying a flat screen TV . Jonathan Rogers, prosecuting, told . the court that Shellard had been overpaid a total of £98,000, although . she would have been entitled to £8,000 of the cash in tax credits if she . had been honest. She claimed disability living . allowance from 2000, with payments increased to a higher rate after she . detailed health problems linked to her obesity. However, in 2008, Shellard began getting more exercise and lost eight stone. By 2011, she had lost a further ten stone. 'Lying scrounger': Tracey Shellard was blasted by the judge for claiming to be too fat to work - despite undergoing dramatic weight loss . After she was arrested in September 2011, she got a job at a nursing home, working up to 48 hours a week. Shellard also lied about living alone to rake in income support, housing benefit, and council tax benefit. In fact, she was living with her . husband of 23 years, who was in work and supporting her financially. Denise Fitzpatrick, defending, said Shellard had ‘learned her lesson’. Handing her a 12-month suspended . sentence, with a six-month curfew and 80 hours of unpaid work, Recorder . Craig Sephton QC said she had been ‘taking money this country . desperately needs to serve your own ends’. The  judge said he took into account that she had got a job and had completed training courses which meant she had made herself ‘a useful member of society instead of a sponger’. Back in 2003, she had said in a DWP interview that she struggled to stand up again after sitting down, used a walking stick indoors, needed help to stop her ‘sliding off pillows’ in bed, couldn’t make a cup of tea without dropping it, and was dependent on a mobility scooter when she left the house. She told officers: 'If I had help I would go everywhere - I just want to be normal, but I know that will never be.'","Judge branded Tracey Shellard a 'lying scrounger' for continuing to claim benefits despite massive weight loss .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 09:04 EST, 3 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:37 EST, 3 June 2013 . Britain's first motorway pub is set to open, serving alcohol from 8am. JD Wetherspoon has been granted a licence in a move that drew condemnation last night from road safety and alcohol awareness campaigners. They say the proposal is 'a backwards step' that sends out 'completely the wrong message' about drinking and driving. The branch of Wetherspoon is planned for the main building at Beaconsfield service station on the M40 . Wetherspoon plans to open the pub at . the Extra service area on the M40 near junction two at Beaconsfield, . Buckinghamshire, later this year – with more to follow at other Extra . sites. The pub chain said bar staff will . trust customers to know whether they should be drinking or not and does . not plan to quiz people asking for a pint of beer or glass of wine. It follows a move by the Home Office to relax the law that bans the sale of alcohol at motorway service stations. As a result, a growing number now sell drink through retail partners such as Marks & Spencer. And two weeks ago, Harvester opened . its first motorway restaurant – selling alcohol – at Moto services on . the M1 at Donington Park in Leicestershire. It is part of a six-month trial but . more Harvesters are expected to open at other Moto sites. Alcohol . Concern chief executive Eric Appleby warned: 'Selling alcohol on our . motorways sends all the wrong signals to drivers, it just sounds like . profits being put before sense. Wetherspoon: has been given permission for a £2million licensed bar and restaurant on the M40 at Beaconsfield, Bucks . 'Campaigners have worked tirelessly to . improve road safety in the UK and persuade people that drinking and . driving don't mix and this feels like a backwards step.' Carol Whittingham, the founder of . Campaign Against Drink Driving, said: 'I'm absolutely astounded they . have got permission for this. 'People will be tempted to drink and . drive and I can't understand how the local authority has allowed this. It is just not necessary – you can buy alcohol on every street corner so . why tempt people by having it at motorways as well? Sir Ian Gilmore, chairman of the . Alcohol Health Alliance, said: 'To reduce alcohol-related harm, we have . to reduce its availability, not increase it. Opening a bar at a service . station sends out completely the wrong message if we are trying to . prevent harm from alcohol-related traffic accidents.' Drink-driving resulted in 9,990 . casualties, including 280 deaths, on British roads in 2011, with 42 per . cent of all road deaths linked to drinking. But Wetherspoon insists that neither . Thames Valley Police nor South Bucks district council raised any . objection to its licence application for the first fully-fledged pub to . be opened specifically to serve motorway traffic. The Conservative-run council said the . licence was granted last week following the statutory 28-day public . consultation during which no objections were lodged. It insisted the M40 site is not . directly on the motorway – drivers have to take a slip road to reach it. Wetherspoon and Extra are investing more than £2million on the M40 . development, which will create 50 jobs. It will open 24 hours a day for . food, coffee and soft drinks, and serve alcohol from 8am to 1am. JD Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin . said: 'The company has always been innovative and this is an exciting . new development for us. Hopefully it will be the first of many.' Asked about the risk that it will . encourage people to drink-drive, a Wetherspoon spokesman said: 'We think . the majority of people who want a drink will be coach parties with a . driver who is not drinking. 'If an individual comes in and orders a . whisky or pint of beer, we are not going to ask whether they are . driving. You wouldn't do that in a village pub and we won't be doing . that here. We expect people to act responsibility. We don't see this as . any different to a pub that you may drive to that is just off the . motorway network.' Extra chief executive Andrew Long said the motorway pub would 'improve customer choice'. Until recently, the sale of alcohol at motorway service station outlets was banned. However, this has been relaxed over the past 18 months. A proposal to remove controls has been . outlined by the Home Office in its Alcohol Strategy, which is designed . to reduce the red tape surrounding drink licensing.","J D Wetherspoon given go-ahead for £2 million bar and restaurant .

Chris Grayling today condemns Brussels over an 'absurd' proposal to bring dozens of new European human rights into British law . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today condemns Brussels over an ‘absurd’ proposal to bring dozens of new European human rights into British law. If introduced, it is feared they could lead to a deluge of claims against  businesses and the Government. The rights are contained in the European Union’s controversial Charter of Fundamental Rights. The UK opted out of the charter in 1998, but now the European Comission has suggested it could be imposed on all member states. Mr Grayling said the suggestion showed Eurocrats were aiming to create a European justice system that overrides domestic courts. ‘This country never wanted a charter of fundamental rights and the idea we would sign up to changes that meant it took over our domestic laws is absurd,’ the  Justice Secretary said. ‘The European Commission should stop trying to create a European justice system, and should let member states get on with solving the real challenges we all face.’ His intervention marks a significant stepping up in Tory efforts to demonstrate how they want a looser, more trade-based relationship with the EU ahead of the European  elections in May. Mr Grayling’s anger has been prompted by a document produced by the European Commission suggesting that the charter should apply in all member states. The blueprint, which contains 54 provisions – including the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining – was attached to the EU’s controversial Lisbon Treaty. The then PM Tony Blair told MPs it was ‘absolutely clear that we have an opt-out’ from the charter. But a new consultation document calls for it to be implemented throughout the EU. It says people’s ‘interests in and expectations about the enforcement of fundamental rights by the EU are high’. It goes on to suggest that ‘one option would be to make all fundamental rights guaranteed in the charter directly applicable in member states.’ Mr Grayling's anger has been prompted by a document produced by the European Commission suggesting that the charter should apply in all member states . The Human Rights Act 1998 incorporated into our domestic law large parts, but not all, of the  European Convention on Human Rights. Some parts were  deliberately omitted by Parliament. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union contains all of the missing parts and many further provisions. The new discussion document also suggests a stronger role for the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, though it concedes the steps proposed would require the agreement of member states. Mr Grayling said a Tory-led government would never agree to the proposal to adopt the charter. However, many of the rights in the charter would be greeted with delight by trade unions who are likely to pressure Labour to accept them. In the field of employment law, the charter guarantees rights in areas such as collective bargaining, unjustified dismissal, ‘fair and just’ working conditions and maternity and parental leave. Mr Grayling will play a key part in Tory efforts to rein in the influence of European human rights law, which has stalled under the Coalition because of the fierce resistance of the Liberal Democrats. Earlier this year, Mr Justice Mostyn also expressed concern about the potential influence of the charter . The Justice Secretary is understood to be considering draft  legislation setting out how a  Conservative-only government would replace Labour’s Human Rights Act with a British Bill of Rights and reassert the authority of the Supreme Court over the European courts. He argues that the creeping influence of European courts in British law is unacceptable and underlines the case for renegotiating Britain’s membership of the EU. Earlier this year, a senior judge also expressed concern about the potential influence of the charter. Mr Justice Mostyn’s comments came in a judgment on the case of an asylum seeker whose barrister cited the document in a failed bid to win his case. The judge said he was ‘surprised, to say the least,’ by the claim, adding: ‘I was sure the British government had secured an opt-out at the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty’. Yet the European Court had suggested that the opt-out ‘does not intend to exempt the UK from the obligations to comply with the provisions of the charter’. The Conservative pledge is likely to be revived in the next Tory manifesto after being underlined by a draft Bill. Some Tories – including several Cabinet ministers – want to go  further and withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights. Last night a spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘This paper was published several months ago to stimulate debate at a conference in November. ‘It had a disclaimer saying it did not represent the position of the European Commission. Changes to the Charter – which covers only EU law – could indeed only be made if the UK signed up to them.’","If introduced, it is feared they could lead to a deluge of claims against businesses and the Government .

And it appears Sir Winston Churchill was no exception to the rule, as a new exhibition has revealed how the world's leaders came to admire his wife Clementine and shower her with tokens of affection. An exhibition of gifts given to the Churchill family are on display at their former home in Chartwell, Kent, including one sent from Charles de Gaulle to the former prime minister's wife near the end of the Second World War. Sir Winston Churchill pictured with his beloved wife Clementine who earned the respect of world leaders in her 'tireless' support of her husband . Among others are trinkets thanking her for her role in coordinating aid to Russia, a cut-glass fruit bowl from Stalin, and a collection of silverware from the town of Sheffield. A spokesman for the National Trust said the display of 30 pieces reflects the strong influence had by Clementine Churchill over state and international business. 'She helped maintain difficult relationships and worked quietly behind the scenes for the war effort,' said Judith Evans, house and collections manager at the property. 'She made sure they dined with the right people and led by example in keeping domestic life going,' she told the Daily Telegraph. One such well-suited dinner guest was the . former president of the French Republic, who sent a lalique crystal . cockerel after an argument had over the Churchills' dinner table. Among the gifts displayed at the family's former home in Chartwell, Kent, is a cigar box sent by the King Peter II of Yugoslavia . A cigar box with the former prime minister's portrait engraved on it was a gift from the 3rd Battalion 11th Sikh Regiment at Tehran . 'When he went away, he felt very keenly that he had upset her and the cockerel is supposed to have been sent to appease her,' added Ms Evans. A Viking Long Boat glass bowl with silver mounts was sent by Stalin after the Moscow Conference in 1944, while a brass brandy glass warmer a gift from Portugal. A large series of maps was sent as a Christmas gift by President Roosevelt in 1945 and King Peter II of Yugoslavia gave the family a silyer cigar box made by Asprey of London in 1942.

The couple knew how to keep good company, and frequently invited the 'right' people to dinner at their home . A lion, white kangaroo and black swans were recorded as being received as gifts, but were not kept at the house. The exhibition called Gift of Power was opened by the couple's great-grandson Randolph Churchill and will be open to the public until February 23. The daughter of  Sir Henry and Lady Blanche Hozier, Clementine spent her childhood in London's Mayfair before being relocated with her family to Dieppe, France. She was re-acquainted with Winston Churchill at a dinner party in 1908, after having met him four years earlier. After months of correspondence, Churchill wrote to her mother requesting her hand in marriage. On 12 September 1908, at St. Margaret's, Westminster, the pair married. Sir Winston was already a seasoned Parliamentarian before the couple had their five children. During the war the well-educated Clementine organised canteens for munitions workers on behalf of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in the North East Metropolitan Area of London. During World War II she was Chairman of the Red Cross Aid to Russia Fund, the President of the Young Women's Christian Association War Time Appeal and the Chairman of Fulmer Chase Maternity Hospital for Wives of Junior Officers. The Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, Middlesex is named after her. In 1946 she was appointed a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire, becoming Dame Clementine Churchill GBE. Later, she was awarded honorary degrees by the University of Glasgow and the University of Oxford and later, in 1976, by the University of Bristol. In May 1965, she was created a life peer as Baroness Spencer-Churchill, of Chartwell in the County of Kent. She sat as a cross-bencher, but her growing deafness precluded her taking a regular part in parliamentary life. Lady Spencer-Churchill died in Princes Gate, Knightsbridge, London of a heart attack on 12 December 1977. She was 92 years old and had outlived her husband by almost 13 years.","Clementine Churchill received gifts from Charles de Gaulle and Stalin .

Mr Mulkahainen said: 'The bears were around the house all night and the next morning. 'The mother bear was always nearby waiting for the cubs and when she felt they had played enough she would lead them further into the forest. 'I was very lucky; I've never seen anything like it and was pleasantly surprised that I could photograph the bears at such close hand. 'Most of all I liked the picture where the bear was hiding behind a tree and was seen only by his ear. How do you climb this thing? The cub tries several times to scale the smooth tree trunk before giving up and hugging it . He added: 'These cubs were very funny and cheerful. They constantly played with each other, fighting, tumbling and standing up on their hind legs. 'They repeatedly tried to climb the tree, but it was smooth, and so eventually they realised they were unable to climb on it.' Mr Mulkahainen, a married father of two who works as a PE teacher in Sotkamo, 70 miles from the centre, was bear-watching with three other tourists.

Mr Mulkahainen said: 'Bears are very cautious animals so it's rare to see them normally in the forest.

An Edwardian cul-de-sac on the Devon coast has been dubbed Britain's most dangerous street amid fears one house after the other is collapsing into the sea. The sprawling 90-year-old houses in Redcliffe Road, Torquay, have been rocked by a series of devastating landslides which saw one home fall over the cliff edge and others evacuated over safety fears. Coastal erosion has meant that the once-elegant family homes are at risk of falling down, with one evacuated by Torbay Council and the garden of another fenced off because it is judged at risk of falling 150ft into the waves below. Scroll down for video . Redcliffe Road in Torquay has been dubbed the most dangerous street in Britain after one house fell into the sea and another was condemned after a series of devastating landslides . This shot of the cliff-top cul-de-sac shows the house at the end that has already tumbled into the sea, and a neighbouring house which is deemed to be at risk of the same fate . The homes are said to be worth up to Â£360,000, and were built in the 1930s offering breath-taking views across the English Channel. But over the last few months, landslides have turned one home into a heap of bricks and wood dangling over the cliff edge, while a neighbouring house has been deemed too risky to live in. The street has become so notorious, it is attracting crowds of tourists - many just children - curious to see the cul-de-sac that is falling into the sea. Torbay Council has now warned sightseers to stay away, for their own safety, and asked residents to work together to keep the gawkers out. A spokesman said: 'Following the recent collapse of a property and ongoing concerns about cliff stability we are taking steps to ensure public safety. 'This includes requiring owners of properties at the seaward end of Redcliffe Road to take appropriate measures to prevent access to adjoining land approaching the cliffs. The cliff-side view of the house that tumbled 150ft down to the sea - Torbay Council fear the rest of the houses are in danger of following suit . Dangerous ruins: Ridgemont House, in Torquay's Redcliffe Road, collapsed and crumbled into the sea earlier this year because of coastal erosion . 'We would strongly advise parents to ensure their children do not go on to the private land and put their safety at risk.' A total of 100,000 tonnes of earth have come crashing down from Babbacombe's crumbling cliffs in recent months. The first house to fall victim was sprawling Ridgemont House, which has now almost completely disappeared over the edge.  The mangled mansion became infamous because it was declared unsafe just one week after being sold at a blind auction. The six-bedroom pile was bought for Â£155,000 in February 2010 via a telephone bid by a woman from London who had never been there. Police officers in Devon and Cornwall say the influx of sightseers is not only dangerous, but adding to the anguish of those still living in the street's 16 remaining homes. Such is the street's notoriety, crowds of sightseers, many of them children, have flocked to the cul-de-sac to see the houses still at risk . Police say sightseers are putting their own safety at risk by visiting the crumbling clifftop street . Police Constable Lee Metherell warned: 'Lots of youngsters are gaining access which will undoubtedly end fatally if we don't stop it.  You can clearly see that one slip on the uneven ground will most certainly lead to your death. 'Please keep out if you don't want to die.' PCSO James Milton added: 'We just don't want a group of drunk kids going in their at night. 'The gardens have been totally undermined. One wrong foot in the dark and you're gone.  I'm no geologist, but it looks as if there will be more movement.' The houses in Redcliffe Road were built 90 years ago so residents could enjoy far-reaching views across the English Channel . The green south Devon coastline has been blighted by the recent landslips that have devastated the large houses above . This handsome house at the end of the once-desirable cul-de-sac is next to Ridgemont House and thought to be at serious risk of further landslips . Torbay Council is to replace the 'road closed' sign at the seaward end of the street with a permanent metal barrier. Local councillor Alan Faulkner said: 'We have been meeting with residents and they have been issued with a letter about our intentions. 'For safety reasons, we cannot have people wandering up there looking around. 'We have to protect people who live there and make sure that onlookers don't keep going up there. It is a nightmare for them and we have to put this to bed once and for all.'","One house in Redcliffe Road, Torquay, has already crumbled and fallen 150ft into the sea below after landslides .

At the height of war, in the dead of night, the Halifax HR980 bomber was struck from the ground as it raced over Berlin in 1943, and plunged into a marsh. The World War Two aircraft was crushed by the impact and sank into the murky water, where five brave servicemen on board have lain trapped for 70 years. Generations later the wreckage has been found in a shock discovery signalling a long-awaited moment of closure for their families. Crashed: During a night raid on August 23, 1943, (left-right) Sgt Arthur Cox, Flt Sgt William Burgum, Flt Sgt Harley Harber, and (in front) Sgt Donald Hemstock were shot down over Berlin. Cox (far left) was one of just two German soldiers recovered and buried before the plane sank into the murky water . Sgt Peter Buck and Flt Sgt Gordon Harrison are both still trapped in the wreckage in the tiny village of Gollin . Now, the team of German archaeologists have been granted permission to recover the wreckage and bodies, prompting the brothers, sisters, and children of the Halifax airmen to demand a proper burial for their loved ones from the government. The men were deployed for a night raid over Nazi Germany on August 23, but never returned home. Enemy soldiers pulled two bodies from the wreckage before the plane sank from view into a marsh near Gollin, 35 miles north of the capital. While Australian air gunners Flt Sgt Harley Harber, 27, and Sgt Arthur Cox, . age unknown, were recovered and buried in the Berlin 1939-45 war cemetery, the others were deemed 'missing'. But this year, German aviation archaeologists announced a shock discovery as the marsh, which is now drying up, has pushed the wreckage back to the surface. Aviation archaeologists have scoured the area for years but only as the marsh dried up have found the plane . The German research team has now been granted permission to recover the wreckage and the bodies . This map indicates the site (circled) is 300 metres west of Reiersdorf and just south of Gollin . Delighted family members are desperate to see their loved ones finally honoured and buried. Pat Davies, 93, the sister of trapped navigator Sgt Peter Buck, said: 'It would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial. 'I think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty. 'Peter really loved flying and the crew were great friends.' Mrs Davies, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, added: 'We just weren't told anything at the time - it was quite extraordinary. 'One letter came and said the plane went down and roughly where it happened. That is all we ever heard. Sgt Donald Hempstock (far left) is one of the trapped servicemen that families would like to give a proper burial. Australian airmen Sgt Arthur Cox (centre) and Sgt Harley Harber lie in the Berlin WWII cemetery . The family of Flt Sgt William Burgum was one of the five told their relative was 'missing' after the HR980 crashed . 'I don't know what happened to the letter - I expect my mother did away with it. 'We never had any more details about what had happened to them after that.' The team of German archaeologists, who discovered the bomber crash site in 2002, have been given permission by the German authorities to recover the wreckage. The families of the airmen are calling on the British government to help fund the £50,000 project. John Williams, whose aunt was fiancée to air gunner Flt Sgt Harber, has worked with German archaeologists to rediscover the bomber crash site. He said: 'These airmen died a long way from home. They left to fight for a better world and died for it. Action: The recovery project set to be undertaken by these archaeologists will cost £50,000 . The team discovered the site in 2002 but have spent years rallying for permission to extract the craft . A Ministry of Defence spokesman said it is not custom to fund recovery projects but if bodies are found, measures will be taken to ensure they are buried properly. The plane will most likely be donated to a museum . 'We owe them a debt we can never repay but it is important to give them a decent burial and for them to be with their fellow crew members. 'A team has now been put together to recover the remains of the remaining trapped crewmen. 'All we are waiting for is a decision from the British and German governments as to which one is responsible for the operation.' A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: 'The MoD does not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft. 'However, if human remains are found, in co-operation with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the MoD will inform families, fund a burial in the local area where the remains are found, and support close family members attending a funeral service, if appropriate with a level of official ceremonial support. 'UK aircraft belong to Her Majesty's Government, however on conclusion of the formalities, we normally gift the remains of the aircraft if a local museum is willing to take them.'","Halifax HR980 bomber shot down during night raid over Berlin .

Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum engaged in a hostile exchange over gay marriage on Thursday, when asked to explain why he, personally, would be affected if same-sex marriages were legalised. The meeting ended with Santorum getting booed by much of the crowd in Concord, which included many college and high-school students, after suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are being 'harmed'. 'How does it affect you personally if two men or two women get married?' Santorum was asked at the College Convention 2012, to broad applause and cheers. Scroll down for video . Controversy: Santorum drew jeers from the crowd during a campaign stop on Thursday in Concord, New Hampshire for his position on gay marriage . Santorum said that basic rights taken for granted by married people, such as the ability to visit their loved one in the hospital and make medical decisions on their behalf – can also be arranged for same-sex couples. 'That can be done legally, through contract.' The former U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania, who is coming off a surprise near-victory in this week’s Iowa caucuses, then pivoted, and went on to equate same-sex marriages to multiple marriages. 'What about three men?' he said, as jeers rang out. 'If you think it’s okay for two, you have to differentiate for me why you’re not okay with three. Any two people, or any three, or four.”' 'He was comparing same-sex marriage to polygamy. I find that very insulting. We asked about two consenting adults,' said Tyrone Davis, 18, who was attending the College Convention 2012 in Concord from his home in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 'I don’t support Santorum at all. It seems he’s trying to create a theocracy.' Tense: Santorum equated same-sex marriages to multiple marriages during his speech as students tried to interrupt . Santorum went on to say that . marriages that produce children should have 'privileged status,' which . might be news even to straight, childless couples. 'Marriage . is the union of a man and a woman. God made men and women. Men and . women come together in a union to have children. It should be valued and . have privileged status over people who want to have a relationship . together. 'The uniqueness of marriage is it provides an intrinsic good to society. It’s the union that causes children to be born and raised in an environment that’s a birthright. When we deny children that birthright by saying other types of relationships are okay – I think we are harming children.' - Rick Santorum . 'The uniqueness of marriage is it provides an intrinsic good to . society. It’s the union that causes children to be born and raised in . an environment that’s a birthright. 'When we deny children that . birthright by saying other types of relationships are okay – I think we . are harming children,' Santorum said. The . College Convention is a once-every-four-year event that gathers college . and high school students from across the nation to discuss the . political climate. Rhiannon Pyle, 17, of Newburyport, Massachusetts, asked Santorum the question about how his same-sex marriage opposition squared with support of constitutional rights for all. 'We don’t see same sex marriage as a big deal,' the high school student said. “I’m sure it’s not going to be the first issue for a lot of people.' Gay marriage has been legal in New Hampshire since 2010. Santorum was asked if, should he become president, he would uphold state laws on issues such as that and the legality of medical marijuana. “I don’t believe that we can have 50 definitions of marriage in this country,” he said. The youth vote: The College Convention is a once-every-four-year event that gathers college and high school students nationwide to discuss politics . He went on to draw a parallel between . states being allowed to set policy on things like medical marijuana use . and states being allowed to sterilize their citizens. 'States have . rights. But they don’t have the rights to do anything they want to.' The . heated exchange followed another line of fire as the politician . defended his infamous 2003 comments on homosexuality and 'man on dog' sex on Wednesday night in an interview with CNN's John King. 'If you think it’s okay for two, you have to differentiate for me why you’re not okay with three. Any two people, or any three, or four.""' - Rick Santorum . Asked by an Associated Press reporter . on whether he thought that if someone is homosexual, he would argue . that individual should not have sex, Santorum responded in part: . 'Every society in the history of man has . upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on . the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous . relationships. 'In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality.

But now Dame Judi Dench has had a chance to compare her on-screen persona with a real-life head of a secretive intelligence agency. The actress came face-to-face with former head of MI5 Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller. Double take: Real-life spy chief Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller meets Dame Judi Dench, right, who played M in the Bond films for 17 years . Dame Eliza used the opportunity of guest-editing Radio 4's Today programme . to interview her fictional counterpart and criticise the Guardian newspaper for publishing highly sensitive material from U.S. whistleblower Edward Snowden. The 65-year-old former spook also revealed she was nearly . thrown out of a pub after being mistaken for a prostitute while training . to be a spy. Dame Eliza had been tasked to find out key personal details from a stranger in a pub during an exercise. But . her attempts to elicit the information did not elude the eye of the . barman who thought she was more lady of the night than spook. Action: Daniel Craig as James Bond, left, and Dame Judi Dench as MI6 head M star together in a scene from the film Skyfall . 'I said, but Brian has driven me for years. ""No, no he won't know the way"". I said: ""To the Lego building on the South Bank? He can't miss it"" She . said: 'The task was to pick someone up in a pub and learn enough about . them that you had their date of birth and what they did and what their . full name was. 'I . was sent off to a particular pub and it was quite clear that the barman . thought I was a hooker and he tried to throw me out and I was getting . desperate because I knew I was going to fail this particular test. Former spy chief Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller attacked the Guardian newspaper for publishing leaked information from U.S. intelligence whistleblower . Edward Snowden, pictured above. She said the paper had done untold damage to counter-terrorism efforts with its revelations. The ex-Director General of MI5 added that only those in the intelligence services could truly understand the danger of publishing details about the activities of U.S. and UK spy agencies. Dame Eliza said: 'I do understand there are people who think he has done the public a service and who applaud him. 'But . I can't be one of them because what neither the Guardian, nor really . anybody, including me, can judge is what damage he has done to . counter-terrorism. 'We . can't, I can't, they can't see what the loss of information is; what . plots were being investigated that have now gone dark; what will now not . be detected and not now be thwarted. She added: 'My concern is the damage which I don't think anybody outside the intelligence community can really detect or judge. 'I don't think those who have published can possibly work out what those consequences are because they don't have access to the information.' She told the programme: 'The debate should not be what the capability of the state is, because the terrorist has that capability. But what should be authorised and who does the authorisation and what are the limits on it.' Dame . Eliza also speculated that U.S. authorities might seek to do a deal . with Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia after . leaking thousands of sensitive government documents earlier this year, . to prevent more information being disclosed. She . said: 'I think what will happen actually is there will come a deal that . he doesn't release any more, but I really don't know.' Eventually, another drinker turned his attentions on her and she managed to extract enough information. 'So . I sat down in the corner feeling rather miserable and had a drink, and I . was picked up by an American who was selling lasers, I think, to the . Russians. I thought he was a plant — I couldn’t believe he was real.' She . added: 'He was lonely, he told me his entire life history. I kept . having to rush out to the ladies and write it down. 'I got sort of an . essay on him and I got a distinction in that part of the test and I had . done nothing but sit there.' The former spy chief, who resigned as . Director General of MI5 in 2007, took the opportunity of a day in the . editor's chair at Radio 4's flagship current affairs programme to . interview Dame Judi Dench. The . actress told how she was once late for lunch with the boss of MI6 – . because the driver sent by the Intelligence Service could not find where . to pick her up. Dame . Judi, who famously played spy boss M in the James Bond movies for a . 17-year span, had been invited along to the London HQ to meet her . real-life counterpart Sir David Spedding. But . in an interview for the BBC Radio 4 Today programme she explained that . she was issued with a special driver whose bungling led to her being 45 . minutes late. Dame Judi tells her: ‘I did get to go to MI6 once – I was invited to lunch by Sir David Spedding. 'I . said but Brian has driven me for years. ""No, no he won’t know the way"". I said, ""To the Lego building on the South Bank? He can’t miss it"". 'But . they did send their driver - he couldn’t find me. So subsequently I was . three-quarters of an hour late. I was so late for lunch - . embarrassingly late.' Other guest presenters for the Today . programme include Michael Palin on Monday, Barclays boss Antony Jenkins . on Tuesday and musician PJ Harvey on Thursday and Sir Tim Berners-Lee. Sir Tim today revealed how the BBC prevented him from commissioning an atheist to give the Thought for the Day item. The man credited with inventing the internet guest-edited the Boxing Day broadcast of Radio 4's Today programme. But . when he explained to programme bosses about his plans for the Thought . for the Day slot, he was told only a religious leader would do. Asked . about how he coped with editing the programmed, he said: 'Thought for . the Day was an interesting point. There I was saying if we have a . thought, why can’t it be a thought from an atheist? 'I’m . very sensitive about it - the background and a certain amount of . discrimination about it around the world against atheists - and wondered . whether it was my duty to poke a bit at the BBC and its tradition.'

The figures come ahead of an expected influx of migrants from Bulgaria and Romania when immigration controls are lifted on January 1. A study by the Public Policy Research says the UK could see an increase in ‘anti-social behaviour’ such as ‘aggressive begging, rough sleeping and even criminality’ as a result of the new arrivals.

Target has confirmed that customers' encrypted PIN data was I fact removed during the catastrophic hack that occurred earlier this month. The company issued a statement Friday that additional forensic work has shown that encrypted PIN data was removed along with customers' names and card numbers. But Target says it believes the PIN numbers are still â€˜safe and secureâ€™ because the information was strongly encrypted. It says the PIN can only be decrypted when received by its independent payment processor. Scroll down for video . Revelation: Target says PIN data was stolen in the breach but there was no evidence that it has been compromised because it was highly encrypted . A PIN number is the personal identification code used to make secure transactions on a credit or debit card. According to the company, the decryption key needed to translate the unintelligible code back into the PIN was not stolen during the breach because it was not in Target's system. 'We remain confident that PIN numbers are safe and secure,' company spokeswoman Molly Synder said in a statement cited by Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'The PIN information was fully encrypted at the keypad, remained encrypted within our system, and remained encrypted when it was removed form our systems.' Data connected to about 40 million credit and debit cards used at Target were stolen between November 27 and December 15. Minneapolis-based Target says it is still in the early stages of investigating the breach. Snyder insisted earlier this week that 'no unencrypted PIN data was accessed' and there was no evidence that PIN data has been 'compromised'. She confirmed that some 'encrypted data' was stolen, but declined to say if that included encrypted PINs. Denied: Target says there is no evidence PINs were compromised as part of the retail behemoth embarrassing and worrisome Christmastime security breach . One major U.S. bank fears that the . thieves would be able to crack the encryption code and make fraudulent . withdrawals from consumer bank accounts, said the executive, who spoke . on the condition of anonymity because the data breach is still under . investigation. The hackers who attacked Target Corp . and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also . managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers, according to . a senior payments executive familiar with the situation. 'We continue to have no reason to believe that PIN data, whether encrypted or unencrypted, was compromised. And we have not been made aware of any such issue in communications with financial institutions to date,' Snyder said by email. 'To date, there is no evidence that unencrypted PIN data has been compromised,' Target said in a statement . 'In addition, based on our communications with financial institutions, they have also seen no indications that any PIN data was compromised,' Target said . The No. 3 U.S. retailer said last week that hackers stole data from as many as 40 million cards used at Target stores during the first three weeks of the holiday shopping season, making it the second-largest data breach in U.S. retail history. Target has not said how its systems were compromised, though it described the operation as 'sophisticated'. The U.S. Secret Service and the Justice . Department are investigating. Officials with both agencies have declined . comment on the investigations. The news comes as the retailer says it has learned of some incidents of scam emails related to its recent data breach. The company says it is aware of 'limited instances' of scam emails, but does not have specific information. The Minneapolis retailer says it is creating a section of its website for Target's official communications so customers can verify the authenticity of notes from the retailer. The attack could end up costing hundreds of millions of dollars, but it is unclear so far who will bear the expense. CBS News reports the company faces at least 15 lawsuits . seeking class action status as a result of the cyber-attack. The suits were filed by people who claim their information . was stolen, and they allege Target either failed to properly secure the . customer data, did not promptly notify customers of the breach or . both. But so little information disclosed so far about the breach, . it is unclear whether the plaintiffs will be able to prove their allegations. Hacked: The hackers who attacked Target and compromised more than 40 million credit cards and debit cards also allegedly managed to steal encrypted personal identification numbers . Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Senators, Richard Blumenthal of . Connecticut and Chuck Schumer of New York, have asked the U.S. Federal Trade . Commission to investigate the breach. 'If Target failed to adequately protect customer . information, it denied customers the protection that they rightly expect when a . business collects their personal information,' Blumenthal said in a letter to . FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez today. 'Its conduct would be unfair and . deceptive.' While . bank customers are typically not liable for losses because of . fraudulent activity on their credit and debit cards, JPMorgan Chase . & Co and Santander Bank said they have lowered limits on how much . cash customers can take out of teller machines and spend at stores. The . unprecedented move has led to complaints from consumer advocates about . the inconvenience it caused from the late November Thanksgiving holiday . into the run-up to Christmas. But sorting out account activity after a . fraudulent withdrawal could take a lot more time and be worse for . customers. JPMorgan has said it was able to reduce inconvenience . by giving customers new debit cards printed quickly at many of its . branches, and by keeping branches open for extended hours. A Santander . spokeswoman was not available for comment today. Security . experts said it is highly unusual for banks to reduce caps on . withdrawals, and the move likely reflects worries that PINs have fallen . into criminal hands, even if they are encrypted. 'That's a really . extreme measure to take,' said Avivah Litan, a Gartner analyst who . specializes in cyber security and fraud detection. 'They definitely . found something in the data that showed there was something happening . with cash withdrawals.' Litigation: Target reportedly faces at least 15 lawsuits seeking class action status . While the use of encryption codes may prevent amateur hackers from obtaining the digital keys to customer bank deposits, the concern is the coding cannot stop the kind of sophisticated cyber criminal who was able to infiltrate Target for three weeks. Daniel Clemens, CEO of Packet Ninjas, a cyber security consulting firm, said banks were prudent to lower debit card limits because they will not know for sure if Target's PIN encryption was infallible until the investigation is completed. As an example of potential vulnerabilities in PIN encryption, Clemens said he once worked for a retailer who hired his firm to hack into its network to find security vulnerabilities. He was able to access the closely guarded digital 'key' used to unscramble encrypted PINs, which he said surprised his client, who thought the data was secure. In other cases, hackers can get PINs by using a tool known as a 'RAM scraper', which captures the PINs while they are temporarily stored in memory, Clemens said. The attack on Target began on November 27, the day before the Thanksgiving holiday and continued until December 15. Banks that issue debit and credit cards learned about the breach on December 18, and Target publicly disclosed the loss of personal account data on December 19. On December 21, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, alerted two million of its debit cardholders that it was lowering the daily limits on ATM withdrawals to $100 and capping store purchases with their cards at $500. On Monday, the bank partly eased the limits it had imposed on Saturday, setting them at $250 a day for ATM withdrawals and $1,000 a day for purchases. (The usual debit card daily limits are $200 to $500 for cash withdrawals and $500 for purchases, a bank spokeswoman said last week.) On Monday, Santander - a unit of Spain's Banco Santander - followed suit, lowering the daily limits on cash withdrawals and purchases on Santander and Sovereign branded debit and credit cards of customers who used them at Target when the breach occurred. Santander did not disclose the new limits, but said it was monitoring the accounts and issuing new cards to customers who were affected. The largest breach against a U.S. retailer, uncovered in 2007 at TJX Cos Inc, led to the theft of data from more than 90 million credit cards over about 18 months.","Target hackers allegedly stole encrypted PINS in 'sophisticated' operation .

Feeling down: Men feel less attractive if their partner takes the oral contraceptive, a study claims . It has been blamed for altering women’s moods – but it seems the Pill also has an impact on their male partners. Men feel less attractive if their wife or girlfriend takes the oral contraceptive, a study claims. British and Dutch researchers studied 14 women who were on the Pill, then stopped taking it. They were asked how attractive they felt – and their partners were asked how they saw them. The men were also asked how they rated their own looks. The team found being on the Pill made no difference to how a woman saw herself. However, the men felt more attracted to women when they were not on the Pill, which is taken by three million Britons. The researchers say this could be because the treatment stops hormonal fluctuations that make a woman particularly fertile at certain times in a monthly cycle. At these times, said Kelly Cobey, of Stirling University, women display subtle cues, such as clear skin and flirty behaviour, that men respond to subconsciously by feeling attracted to them. So why did a partner on the Pill make men feel less attractive? The scientists said men’s sense of their own appeal is based on their partner’s looks.

Two men pushed their way into the home and told the terrified great-great-grandmother that they would cut off her finger if she didn't say where her money was kept.

The benefits offered by conventional supermarket loyalty cards, such as Tesco’s Clubcard, are ‘meaningless’ to customers, a rival has claimed. The boss of Waitrose argues that shoppers want instant rewards, rather than points that are collected over months and then used to claim discounts on groceries and days out. Mark Price is speaking from a position of strength as Waitrose is putting on sales while the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury’s, which both run points based loyalty cards, are losing market share. Loyal: Mark Price from Waitrose claims supermarket loyalty cards like Sainsbury's Nectar are 'meaningless' and shoppers want more instant benefits instead of collecting points for months and months . He claims that shoppers prefer the benefits offered by the myWaitrose card, which includes a daily free cup of coffee or newspaper. The offer of free coffee has been enormously popular with the chain’s high street outlets now giving away around one million cups a day. But, while this has been good for Waitrose in terms of building customer loyalty, it has been a disaster for independent coffee shops, who have complained about losing vital trade. Some have suggested they may make a formal complaint to the Office of Fair Trading because Waitrose is effectively using its financial muscle in a way that could put some small coffee shops out of business. Mr Price said he understood the free coffee deal has been ‘disruptive’, however he insisted customers prefer it to the points earned with conventional supermarket loyalty cards. He said: ‘Giving free coffee or free newspapers is disruptive to the market, but I think that is what customers want, I don’t think they want a point. Offers: Mr Price claims that shoppers prefer the . benefits offered by the myWaitrose card, which includes a daily free cup . of coffee or newspaper . ‘I mean, what is a point? I think it’s meaningless. It doesn’t have the richness, it doesn’t have the affinity you can gauge if you engage with your customers in a different way. ‘It is about what do consumers value today, not what did they value historically. So green shield stamps, or points, were a response to what happened post-war . . . I just don’t think that is where the world is now.’ Tesco’s Clubcard was the brainchild of the chain’s former boss, Sir Terry Leahy, in the early 1990s and was instrumental in making it the UK’s biggest supermarket with a 30per cent share of grocery sales. As well as inspiring loyalty among shoppers, it provided Tesco with a huge amount of information of the nation’s shopping habits. As a result, it was able to tailor the range on offer in each supermarket to the tastes of local shoppers, so dramatically boosting sales. Success: Tesco’s Clubcard was the brainchild of . the chain’s former boss, Sir Terry Leahy, in the early 1990s and was . instrumental in making it the UK’s biggest supermarket with a 30per cent . share of grocery sales . It was so successful that Sainsbury’s followed suit with its Nectar card, which has been credited with delivering an improvement in its fortunes. Recent independent trading figures show Tesco and, to a lesser extent, Sainsbury’s have lost market share over the past year. By contrast, Waitrose has seen an increase of 6.7per cent. However, it is debatable as to how much the different approach to loyalty cards has played in this shift in fortunes, . The fastest growing supermarkets in the UK are Aldi, where sales are up 30.6per cent in a year, and Lidl, where sales have jumped 15.5per cent. These no-frills retailers do not offer any kind of loyalty scheme, which can be expensive to run. Rather they concentrate on keeping prices below those of the mainstream supermarkets. Tesco’s ClubCard has some 15million users, suggesting it remains popular with customers. Chief executive, Philip Clarke, has made clear he is fully committed to the loyalty scheme. In fact, he said information gathered through the Clubcard is proving more useful than ever to, for example, target personalised promotions at customers surfing its website. For example, Clubcard spending data means that people who are known to be price sensitive will see website advertisements and promotions for the Everyday Value range. There are also Apps which allow people to keep a check on how many points they have earned and how they can be used. Mr Clarke said: ‘Clubcard will always be rooted in rewarding people for their loyalty to us.’","Mark Price from Waitrose says shoppers want instant rewards and not points collected over several months .

Unprecedented: Online sales were up 20 per cent this year as more people stayed at home to shop . Online shoppers made history on Friday spending almost £600million in the post-Christmas sales from the comfort of their homes. Analysts claim the bad weather likely contributed to the unprecedented figure, which beat last year's takings by 20 per cent. Meanwhile, there were less in-store shoppers than expected, with the total spend of £2.2billion falling short of the predicted £2.9billion. The findings by IMRG, the internet retailing association, showed the average internet shopper took 40 minutes each out of Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and Boxing Day to take advantage of cut prices. Retailers celebrated a record-breaking Boxing Day with £540million spent in just 24 hours, up 10 per cent. Christmas Day spending was also up 50 per cent as numerous stores started cutting prices online a day early. The number of people filling their baskets on mobiles and tablets is up 50 per cent this year, according to John Lewis. Andrew McClelland, IMRG Chief Operations and Policy Officer, said: 'Mobile device usage really is changing the way we shop. Online always used to be mutually exclusive and not always consistent with the High Street. 'Smartphones, accounting for 20 per cent of mobile-enabled sales on retailers' websites, really are helping customers shop whilst on the move. Sign of the times: In-store shoppers spent £2.2billion this year, falling short of the £2.9billion predicted . 'Tablets are also accelerating this mobile change, lowering the barriers to entry, with prices continuing to fall, their design and interfaces being less intimidating and truly being 'always on' so we as shoppers can now truly shop whenever and wherever we want.' It is far from the end, experts claim, with £1.8bn forecast to be spent in stores today, according to the Centre for Retail Research.

New figures have revealed a 100 per cent rise in 10 years in the number of patients needing extra treatment after botched operations. File picture . Surgeons cutting the wrong part of the body, dirty instruments and leaving equipment inside patients during operations has resulted in 35,000 of people needing extra hospital treatment in a decade, it has emerged. Patients groups have branded the sharp 100 per cent rise in patients being re-admitted to hospital after botched operations, 'shocking and frightening'. Figures released under Freedom of Information laws, found that in 2012 5,328 people had to be re-admitted to hospital following botched operations. That figure is a jump from 2,641 patients in 2003. The main reason given for re-admissions . doubling in a decade is 'unintentional cuts, punctures, perforations or . haemorrhages' or bleeding. Patient Concern's Roger Goss told the Daily Mirror: 'The level of NHS mistakes is shocking and frightening. 'We shouldn't have to fear going home with the wrong part of our body mutilated.' Over the 10-year period a total of 35,000 patients have needed further treatment after blunders of these kinds, but the year-on-year figures have risen from 2,462 in 2003 to 5,139 in 2012. The number of patients taken back into the operating theatre after surgeons left 'foreign objects' inside their patients has remained the same. Last year 164 'never' events - dubbed that, due to the serious nature of the incident and fact it should never occur - were recorded by the Department of Health, up from 138 in 2003. Roger Goss of Patient Concern said the figures, released under Freedom of Information laws, were 'frightening'. The Department of Health said 'patient safety must be a top priority'. File picture . Meanwhile there has been a fall in the number of patients requiring extra treatment because medical teams failed to keep the operating theatre or equipment clean. Twenty-five incidents relating to dirty theatres or instruments were recorded last year - the lowest on record - compared with 41 in 2003. Two surgeons, speaking to the Mirror anonymously, said a reason for the rise could be the fact more complex procedures are being carried out in hospitals across the UK, than was the case 10 years ago. A further explanation put forward is that a campaign towards greater transparency in the NHS as a whole has resulted in a more open culture of reporting mistakes. A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Patient safety must be the priority for the NHS and it is unacceptable . 'never events' occur. Thankfully, the incidents are relatively rare.'","Figures show 100 per cent rise in patients needing extra treatment .

A fashion designer was stabbed through the heart by a man he befriended and asked round to his north London flat, the Old Bailey has heard. The body of Shaun Akanbi, 26, who dressed the likes of Ms.Dynamite and Tinie Tempah, was found in his locked bedroom at the flat he shared with others in Exeter Road, Kilburn, in December. Police broke down the door after police and family said they were concerned no-one had seen him for three days. He had been stabbed five times. Achraf Jandara, 20, is accused of murdering Mr Akanbi before ransacking his flat and fleeing wearing clothes from the victim's label Billy Boyce. The Moroccan was captured on CCTV walking . off with a rucksack and trolley bag and dressed in a jacket bearing the . Billy Boyce logo. The court was told that Mr Akanbi and . Jandara had previously swapped messages over Facebook and Mr Finnigan . said the 'apparent purpose of the meeting was connected to proposed or . actual sexual activity.' Peter Finnigan, QC, prosecuting told the court: 'The motive for the killing was very probably robbery. Items were stolen from the flat. '[Mr Akanbi] had already attained a fair amount of success. He was talented. He was reasonably well-off. He was also sociable and well-loved.' Jandara, 20, of Camberwell, south London, denies murder. The jurors were told Jandara was claiming someone else murdered Mr Akanbi and that he was the first to come across the body. Fans of the Billy Boyce brand, named after Mr Akanbi’s father, include Brit award winner Miss Dynamite and Fazer from grime trio N-Dubz. Mr Akanbi founded the label while studying at the London College of Fashion in 2009. Shaun Akanbi founded the Billy Boyce label in 2009 when he was still a fashion student . He was last seen alive by a pizza delivery driver who dropped off food at the victim's flat at about 10.40pm on the night he died. The driver later told police he saw the . victim with a white man with a distinctive long face and long skinny . nose, although he was unable to identify Jandara. Mr Finnigan told the court that Jandara's footprint was found in Mr Akanbi's flat and his DNA was on a mug in the bedroom. He said he stumbled across the body of Mr Akanbi. Mr Finnigan said: ‘The new defence is . the murderer slipped in and out of the building unobserved by CCTV, . conveniently leaving the door open for the defendant to find the body. Musicians such as Tinie Tempah, left, Ms. Dynamite, right, and Fazer from N-Dubz are known to be fans . 'You will have to consider why he did not call the police or emergency services. Instead he stripped the flat of as many of Shaun Akanbi’s possessions as he could bodily carry out of the flat. ‘He even had on Shaun’s clothes which he got from a rack on the flat. ‘Shaun had his own special unique line of clothes with his own logo - you can see it on the CCTV.’ Mr Akanbi’s Macbook laptop was sold by Jandara’s cousin two days after the murder for £160, the court heard.

Dressed in matching skin-coloured caps, round spectacles and grey moustaches, these young children are taking part in a lookalike record attempt like no other. The 485 children donned matching outfits in honour of Mahatma Gandhi, the iconic Indian spiritual leader who was assassinated 64 years ago to the day. As well as the peace leader's trademark round glasses and moustache, the boys also sported white robes to mimic his traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, as well as holding walking sticks. Record: The 485 boys who dressed as peace icon Mahatma Gandhi represented the biggest number ever . Fitting: The half a kilometre march the children completed mirrored Gandhi's Dandi peace march in 1930 . Finishing touches: A young boy puts his grey moustache back in place as the record attempt in eastern India gets under way . Their march was an attempt to bring alive memories of Gandhi's historic Dandi march in March 1930 which sparked India's independence movement. The boys, all aged between ten and 16 and mostly from single mothers, walked in costume for half a kilometre in central Kolkata, West Bengal. Icon: Gandhi led the way for non-violent civil rights and independence in Indian before his death in 1948 . The underprivileged youngsters also set a world record, as their march of 485 children was the largest such gathering ever recorded. Their impressive effort eclipsed the previous record for such an event, where 255 children dressed as Gandhi in Tamil Nadu's Coimbatore district on June 13, 2010. The children took part in the march named 'Rise Up' while watched by Gandhi's granddaughter Usha Gokani. She said: 'It's a great feeling. When my children heard of the effort they egged me to come to Kolkata. 'They said it may be a bit tiring for you, but the trip is worth to be made. 'I now know they were right. I am moved by the passion for the father of the nation displayed by these children.' Michael Anthony, who runs the UK-based organisers TRACKS (Training Recourse and Care for Kids) who set up the march, said: 'We don't want the underprivileged kids to forget the rich legacy of Gandhian ideology.' Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2 is commemorated as Gandhi Jayanti - a national holiday which sees tributes across the country. 'Mahatma' Gandhi, which means Great Soul, was born in 1869 and was an inspirational leader of India and the Indian independence movement. He is famed for his non-violent means to achieve his goals, which resulted in the independence of the country.

Copycats: The young boys also sported replicas of Gandhi's trademark dhoti and shawl during the march . Gandhi is one of the most influential figures in recent history and his methods inspired civil rights movements across the world. Gandhi was fatally shot on January 30 1948 while having one of his nightly public walk on the grounds of the Birla Bhavan (Birla House) in New Delhi.

An independent report which found there was evidence that Portsmouth MP Mike Hancock 'made unwelcome sexual advances' towards a vulnerable female constituent, has been branded 'one-sided' by the former Lib Dem. The report, seen by the Guardian, found there was 'prima facie evidence' the backbencher, who resigned from the party over the allegations, had made the 'sexual approaches'. The MP was arrested in 2010 in . connection with the allegations but Hampshire police decided there was . not enough evidence to mount a criminal case. Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock has today claimed an independent report which claims there is evidence he sexually assaulted a 'vulnerable' constituent is one-sided as his accuser sues him in the High Court . He was accused of making repeated sexual advances towards the woman, who had contacted him for help in dealing with her 'noisy neighbours'. It is alleged that Mr Hancock sexually assaulted the woman despite knowing she suffered mental health problems and had been sexually abused as a child. His accuser is taking civil action, suing Mr Hancock through the High Court. But the MP has vowed to clear his name, vehemently denying the allegations. Portsmouth City Council instructed Nigel Pascoe QC, a leading barrister specialising in sexual crime cases, to interview the alleged victim after the council said it received a standards complaint against the Fratton councillor. In June Mr Hancock, 67, stood down from the Lib Dems after a meeting with the party’s chief whip, Alistair Carmichael. In . an exchange of letters, the MP wrote: ‘I have decided to temporarily . withdraw from the parliamentary party in the Commons until the civil . court case against me has been concluded. He added that he would ‘vigorously defend my position and that I completely refute the allegations made against me’. But in August, Mr Pascoe's report, seen by Rajeev Sajal and Daniel Foggo at the Guardian, concluded there is evidence of sexual approaches made by the MP. The inquiry goes on to conclude that Mr Hancock was aware of the woman's mental health problems. The Guardian reported Mr Pascoe said in the 49-page report: 'I consider that the prima facie evidence of his unwelcome sexual approaches remains unquestionably a very serious matter in the light of the position which he holds and his knowledge from the beginning of the vulnerability of (the alleged victim).' The MP stepped down from the Lib Dem party in June vowing to clear his name in the High Court . The report is based on Mr Pascoe's investigation of a seven-month period from November 2009, the Guardian said. The leading barrister also looked into text messages sent by Mr Hancock to the alleged victim. In the messages, the MP refers to his accuser as 'my princess', and tells her she is 'special and sexy' to him. The woman, who was 35 at the time, claimed Mr Hancock touched her breast, exposed himself to her and kissed her without consent. It is also alleged the MP took the woman's son, aged 12 at the time, to parliament for dinner, bought her a teddy bear named Mike and sent her numerous text messages. The report was compiled following two interviews with the alleged victim, and Mr Pascoe's examination of her mental health history, The Guardian said. It says the woman is 'convincing and truthful' but also 'angry and hurt' by what she claimed had happened. 'Making full allowances for the . disclosed mental history of [the alleged victim], I have no doubt that . she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious . and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock. 'I am of the clear view that her account is credible and merits both compassion and respect,' he wrote in the report. 'I . found [the alleged victim] to be a straightforward and vulnerable . person, angry and hurt by what she said had happened to her… Indeed, at . no point did I form the view that she lied to me,' he said. Mr Pascoe added Mr Hancock had shown kindness towards the woman, which had not been reflected in the media. He said: 'There is . clear evidence that he sought to help her wholly properly as her local . councillor in a detailed way which was commendable.'. Mr Pascoe says he did approach Mr Hancock but sources close to the council told The Guardian the MP declined to meet the barrister. A spokesman for Mr Hancock today accused the report of being 'one-sided' adding the MP looks forward to the case coming before the High Court so he can 'strongly and utterly refute' the accusations made. The spokesman said: 'These matters have twice been looked at by the police, first in 2010, and in conjunction with the CPS, they have found that there is no case for Mr Hancock to answer and have taken no further action. When a person complains to police they are the victim of a sexual offence, they are immediately granted anonymity for life. The Sexual Offences Act, 2003, includes  numerous crimes including: . Those convicted of a sexual offence will be forced to sign the Sexual Offenders Register for a length of time dictated by the sentencing Judge. Once a police force has gathered the evidence, they present their findings to the Crown Prosecution Service. It is the CPS who review the evidence and determine whether there is enough evidence to bring a case to court. Where they decide the evidence is insufficient, the case is dropped. But the alleged victim is entitled to take civil action, suing the alleged perpetrator for damages. In criminal proceedings the prosecution has to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. But in civil court the UK standard is only to prove guilt on the basis of a balance of probability. 'Mike Hancock looks forward to the civil case coming to court so that he can bring forward evidence to strongly and utterly refute the allegations made. 'The independent legal advice to Portsmouth City Council noted that the High Court was a better place to establish matters of fact - not least because it could take evidence under oath which the council cannot. 'Mike Hancock asked to meet with the council's independent investigator to explain this and this was denied him despite the city council's solicitor asking the investigator to meet Mr Hancock. 'He therefore believes the report which he has not seen is likely to be one-sided. 'The most suitable place to settle a civil case is in court and not in the newspapers. 'As this is an on-going legal case, it not appropriate for Mike to give a running commentary. 'In the meantime he will continue to work hard to serve his constituents as an MP and councillor.' Following the completion of the report in August, police officers re-examined the claims made but announced in November that they required more evidence and dropped the case. A spokesman for Portsmouth City Council, told MailOnline their inquiry into the allegations have been suspended until the conclusion of the civil case. The council's solicitor, Michael Lawther, said: 'The council's procedure for dealing with complaints against councillors makes no provision for a copy of a report to be provided to a complainant or to be published. 'We have therefore been unable to release it. We anticipate that we will be reviewing our procedure once the investigation of this complaint is over. 'After legal advice, the council sub-committee running the investigation decided on November 15 that it could be unsafe to deal with the complaint using our internal disciplinary process when the same allegations were due to be tested in the High Court. 'It therefore postponed the process until the High Court action was concluded. 'It felt there was a risk of inconsistency between a decision the council could reach and one which the High Court might reach. 'In deciding to postpone, it also considered the greater suitability of the High Court for determining contested issues of fact, including its ability to compel the attendance of witnesses, and provision for cross-examination while on oath.'","Report ordered by Portsmouth City Council finds evidence MP Mike Hancock made 'made unwelcome sexual advances' towards a constituent .

So when Nick Clegg was asked what he would like for Christmas from his wife Miriam, he was quick to answer – a pair of boxing gloves. In Liberal Democrat yellow, of course. But rather than use the gloves on his ministerial colleagues, the Deputy Prime Minister needs them for the kickboxing classes he now does every week as a way to ‘get stuff out of my system’. During  his LBC show Nick Clegg said he had asked for boxing gloves as a Christmas present from his wife . Practice sessions allow him to imagine he is delivering a blow to a Westminster foe – although he won’t reveal who. He currently uses ‘slightly smelly’ gloves supplied by the gym he attends near his south west London home, so he hopes to be treated to a pair of his own. While he was happy to reveal the preferred colour - yellow - he refused to reveal who he imagined punching . Speaking on a festive edition of LBC radio’s Call Clegg programme, to be broadcast on Christmas Day, Mr Clegg said he knew his choice of present would be a gift to satirists. He told the show’s host Nick Ferrari: ‘This is so going to be misinterpreted – but I’ve actually asked for a pair of boxing gloves. ‘Not to wear them in the House of Commons, although come to think about it, maybe I should. It’s because once a week, I go to a gym and... I do these exercises.’ He said his preferred colour was ‘yellow, of course’. Asked who he imagined fighting, he added: ‘I sometimes imagine people who will remain nameless.’ Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I didn’t know he did boxing once a week – is it called the Cabinet? I hope he’ll be using them on Vince Cable, that would be a good start.’ Mr Clegg is said to have lost around a stone in weight after stepping up his fitness regime and starting a more healthy diet. He recommended kickboxing as good workout, saying: ‘I love it. It’s very good fun... it gets stuff out of my system. ‘I’m not any good at it, but it’s incredibly good exercise.’ A source said the Lib Dem leader has always tried to go to the gym once a week but has been working on his fitness for several months.

Judge Edith Jones is alleged to have said that blacks and Hispanics are predisposed to crime and violent acts . A coalition of civil rights organizations has filed a judicial misconduct complaint against a conservative federal judge for discriminatory comments she allegedly made during a speech, including that some racial groups were predisposed to violent crime. Judge Edith Jones of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the University of Pennsylvania law school on Feb. 20. Her comments were not recorded, but five students and one attorney who were in attendance signed affidavits swearing to what they heard. The complaint alleges that Jones said certain ‘racial groups like African-Americans and Hispanics are predisposed to crime,’ and that they are ‘prone to commit acts of violence’ and be involved in more violent and ‘heinous’ crimes than people of other ethnicities. The judge also allegedly said . Mexicans would prefer to be on death row in the U.S. than serve prison . terms in their native country, and that it's an insult for the U.S. to . look to the laws of other countries such as Mexico. The . allegations were laid out in a 12-page complaint backed by several . Texas groups and filed Tuesday in New Orleans, where the appeals court . is based. The . complaint said Jones engaged in conduct that, among other things, . ‘undermines public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the . judiciary, and creates a strong appearance of impropriety.’ A message seeking comment left at Jones' law office in Houston was not returned. Appointed by President Ronald Reagan, Jones has served on the court since 1985 and was its chief justice for seven years, until October 2012. Judge Jones allegedly said that Mexicans would prefer to be on death row in the U.S. than serve prison terms in their native country . ‘Students were appalled by her speech,’ said Katie Naranjo, a spokeswoman for the coalition backing the . complaint that includes the Mexican Capital Legal Assistance Program, . the League of United Latin American Citizens and the Texas Civil Rights . Project. The NAACP in Austin and the National Bar Association's Houston affiliate also are included. The complaint also states that Jones said defendants' claims of racism, innocence, arbitrariness, and violations of international law and treaties are just ‘red herrings’ used by opponents of the death penalty. She allegedly said claims of ‘mental retardation’ by capital defendants disgust her, and the fact that those defendants were convicted of a capital crime is sufficient to prove they are not ‘mentally retarded.’ And she said a death sentence provides a service to capital-case defendants because they are likely to make peace with God only just before their execution, according to the complaint. Judge Edith Jones of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals addressed the University of Pennsylvania law school, left, on Feb. 20 . Naranjo said the coalition is demanding an investigation. She said it took months for those who heard Jones' comments to contact lawyers and verify that they could warrant a formal complaint. It also took time to compile the affidavits, she said. The coalition said Jones' comments resembled those made during the trial of Duane Buck, a black Texan sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of his former girlfriend and another man. At Buck's trial, a state psychologist listed race as one of several factors in describing the danger he would continue to pose. Though the psychologist was called to the stand by defense lawyers, a prosecutor emphasized the testimony in her closing argument. Later, then-Texas Attorney General John Cornyn identified the case as among six in which race had played an inappropriate role in death sentences. The other inmates all received new sentencing hearings, and they've been resentenced to death. Buck hasn't received a new hearing. ‘Judge Jones's comments are frighteningly similar to those that violated Duane Buck's constitutional rights,’ said Christina Swarns, one of Buck's lawyers and director of the Criminal Justice Project of the NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund.

The pair were caught on camera as they helped themselves to the charity cash from a town centre fountain in the middle of the afternoon. The men, one wearing a camouflage jacket and the other a baseball cap, leant over the edge of the fountain and used long sticks to drag the coins towards them, then reached into the water to fish them out. Dreadful: One man was spotted using a stick to rake up money while the other suspect appears to have coins inside his hand after plunging his arm in . Brazen: Despite being photographed in broad daylight both men were happy to be shown pocketing cash from the fountain . Witnesses said the two continued to trawl the foot-deep water despite efforts from members of the public to intervene. Sharon Bevis, 33, used her mobile phone to take photographs of the pair after she spotted them in Redditch, Worcestershire, at about 4pm on Monday. Mrs Bevis, a mother of six, said: ‘They were taking the money out for bus fare and beer money and they were just not bothered at all when I told them they were bang out of order for doing it. ‘They were drunk and didn’t seem to care that there were lots of people around and even children watching.

Cruel: Dent, 44, of Bagillt, Wales, has stolen money from two pensioners while acting as their carer . A carer who fleeced a stroke victim of his £13,000 life savings leaving nothing to pay for his funeral has been spared jail today. Belinda Dent, 44, emptied the bank account of David Lewis, 68, for whom she was meant to be caring. The 'despicable' theft was only discovered when Mr Lewis died in October 2010. It turned out that Dent emptied his bank account then transferred money from his ISA into that account so that she could steal that as well. The money in the ISA had been to pay for his funeral expenses. The thefts - described as a breach of trust - meant that the trustee of his will had to pay for the funeral out of his own pocket and his gravestone has still not been inscribed because there is no money left to do it. The court heard that since the offence, . again while working as a carer Dent had received a suspended sentence . for stealing more than £500 from a 92-year-old client. In December Dent, of Ffordd Canton in Bagillt, Wales, admitted stealing £13,000 from Mr Lewis while caring for him at his home in Prestatyn. Sentence had been deferred for six months to see if she could come up with compensation money. Judge Niclas Parry, who described the theft as 'despicable', gave Dent six months to raise funds to pay some of the money back to her victim. But he accepted that she had not thrown that chance back in his face and that genuine attempts had been made to raise the money. Since then she had lost her home, her car and her job, she was caring for her disabled husband and her very sick father, and her teenage daughter also relied upon her. The judge said that in the circumstances, the court could show compassion and he said he would pass a 12 month prison sentence suspended for 16 months. But he ordered her to repay the full amount of £13,300 at £250 a month. Betrayal: Judge Parry, sitting at Mold Crown Court, pictured, said Dent systematically and repeatedly stole in such a breach of trust . Judge Parry, sitting at Mold Crown Court, told Dent, who wept throughout much of the proceedings: 'This serious and quite despicable matter involved the theft of more than £13,000 in breach of a high degree of trust. 'Your victim, the victim of a stroke, required daily assistance with all personal care and by the time Cambrian Home Care Ltd began to care for him, his physical condition meant had deteriorated and he was prone to confusion. This person had cared for his finances and had worked hard. 'After he had been targeted by you, his finances were in such a state that that the trustee found that he could not even finance his gravestone to be engraved. To this day it remains un-engraved.' At the time she was a woman of good character but having stolen £13,000 in October 2010, she went on to steal from another person in her care five months later. The judge said that those who systematically and repeatedly stole in such a breach of trust had to receive prison sentences. 'You only stopped when there was no money left,' he said. 'Any right minded person would be sickened by what you have done.' But she had pleaded guilty, he accepted that she was truly remorseful, and he told her: 'You are ruined. 'You have lost your home, lost your car, lost your job and lost your reputation. Despite all of that your strong work ethic remains. 'You remain a fighter for your family. I accept that you were driven not by greed but by your desperation to address financial problems that were not of your making.' When sentencing, the judge was asked to bear in mind that Dent had been caring for husband who was disabled following a work related accident. Kate Meredith-Jones, defending, said that while in a reference her employers had said they would stand by her, they had not provided her with any work since.","Belinda Dent emptied David Lewis's bank account leaving nothing to pay for his funeral .

Of all the images England’s suffering supporters will take home from . the loss of the Ashes Down Under, the sight of Ian Bell dragging himself . from the pitch at the Melbourne Cricket Ground carrying his bat upside . down might just turn out to be the one that survives the longest. In . the English summer series, Bell was the batting rock on which England . built their 3-0 win, with 562 runs, including three hundreds at Trent . Bridge, Lord’s and the Riverside: brilliant, confident and consistent . performances which team-mates and opponents alike understood might have . papered over a variety of cracks. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Charles Sale: England only have themselves to blame . Sorry sight: Ian Bell leaves the field after being dismissed by Nathan Lyon . Drag on: Tim Bresnan was bowled by Nathan Lyon during England's abysmal collapse in the evening . Cheers! Lyon somehow managed to take five wickets for 50 on a pitch that failed to turn . Get on with it: Brad Haddin looked to score quickly in the morning but was eventually caught behind . On day three of the fourth Test at the MCG, his dismissal from the first delivery of his second innings, caught at mid-off by Mitchell  Johnson off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, and his slow march back to the pavilion underlined the state of utter confusion in the minds of  England’s batsmen. Their batting stalwart from the Sixties and former coach Kenny Barrington, a magnificent jumbler of popular terms, once called the condition ‘caught in two man’s land’. Hard to better that here. Indeed, such was the collective loss of marbles England suffered in collapsing not once in a second innings lasting just 61 overs, but twice as they slumped from 65 for no wicket to 179 all out, that some unkind observers might suggest they may as well all try using the bat upside down for what remains of the series. England had produced some beauties before they arrived in Melbourne: six for nine runs and seven for 49 in the first Test in Brisbane and four for six in Adelaide the best of them. But losing three wickets for one run in six balls, then squandering their last five for six runs in a sorry, overall surrender of eight wickets for seven runs, when attempting to convert a first innings lead of 51 into a match-winning position was something else. And no matter how the rest of the series pans out here and in Sydney next week, the manner of so many of the dismissals, ranging from the brainless to the brain-dead, not only indicates just how mentally shot Alastair Cook’s men are but how much work is required to fashion a side capable of winning back the urn in 18 months’ time. Hard to credit it, but the outcome could have been even worse had Australia taken another golden opportunity to dismiss Kevin Pietersen when he had scored just nine of the 49 runs which, in the main, he had earned with great skill, patience and focus until he ran out of patience and partners. If Peter Siddle had hit any of the three stumps he had to aim at when Ben Stokes called his partner for an imaginary single at 102-4, Pietersen would have been run out by the best part of three yards and the match might not even have lasted until day four. Thanks! Haddin celebrates reaching his half-century as Australia's tail wagged once again . Fast start: Alastair Cook wasted no time in scoring his runs when England's openers when out to bat . Milestone: The skipper became the youngest player ever to pass 8,000 Test runs during the afternoon . Captain's job: Cook scored a gutsy half-century - here's his Wagon Wheel from our Hawk-Eye service . Pietersen and Cook can be exempted from some of the criticism. The . skipper batted more fluently than at any other time in the tour for his . fifty before Johnson did him for pace at 65-1. Pietersen showed once . again that he does have the flexibility of approach to adapt his game to . the needs of the side and the context of the match, the sadness being . that it seems to have taken him until now even to accept the possibility . that he might need to. Michael Carberry, lbw to Siddle, battled well . for just over two hours without looking as though he would ever make it . to 20. Jonny Bairstow hit out briefly against Lyon before Johnson had . him caught behind. Far better batsmen than Monty Panesar have been . nowhere near good enough to survive the kind of delivery with which . Johnson claimed his 31st wicket of the series. But the rest of the . dismissals betrayed techniques and minds stretched beyond the point of . no return, from Joe Root’s mad and ultimately successful attempt to run . himself out at 86-2, Bell’s half-push, half-block at 86-3, Stokes’s . underhit drive to Steve Smith off Lyon, and later as they slid from . 173-5 to 179 all out, possibly the worst of them all, featuring Stuart . Broad. Got him! Mitchell Johnson appeals just before Cook was given out lbw as the England wheels began to come off . Dropping like flies: Joe Root was run out by Johnson after making 15 as the tourists' demise started . Trudging off: Michael Carberry departs the MCG square after being trapped in front by Peter Siddle . Golden? Ian Bell was caught by Johnson after misjudging a Nathan Lyon delivery first ball . Pietersen was on 45 and in a groove, and another hour or so of . him and England may well have racked up a lead of 300-plus which would . have made them favourites for a victory that would mean so much. All . Broad needed to do, especially after Tim Bresnan had just chopped one . on, was not get out, so quite what he was doing teeing off and slicing . his third ball, from Lyon straight to Michael Clarke at slip, must . remain a mystery. Two-man’s land? That is where you end up when you . don’t know when the time is right to try to grind out runs or to attempt . to impose yourself on the bowlers, or maybe when you have lost the . ability to distinguish between the two.Not knowing whether to stick or twist and ending up doing neither. Lyon . deserved his moment in front of another huge crowd of 70,000-plus but . even he must have been somewhat embarrassed by the fact that none of the . balls with which he took 5-50, and his 100th Test wicket in the . process, actually turned. No wonder Graeme Swann called it quits. It was . left to Pietersen to try to make sense of it all and, to be fair to . him, he made a pretty brave fist of it, suggesting the demands of . back-to-back Ashes series had left England jaded and ‘a bit fragile’, . not to mention the possibility that the schedule may have contributed to . the early return home of Jonathan Trott and the permanent departure of . Swann. ‘I think people shouldn’t forget, and it’s never been done . before that guys have got to go and endure 10 back-to-back Ashes . matches. ‘It has been an incredibly pressurised situation, being away . for the second leg and not starting in the manner that we are . accustomed to … it’s been incredibly difficult. ‘I’ve been told that a . number of Olympic athletes go into some sort of post-Olympic depression . or a negative frame of mind, and I’m not saying we’re in a depression . or a negative frame of mind, but after you’ve competed at such a level, . post that competition, mentally you are a bit fragile.’ That is one explanation. Another is that England have played a lot of pants. Wheeling away: Lyon took five big wickets with his off-spin during the third day . Temper!

Argentine intimidation has led to the cancellation of two luxury cruise ship visits to the Falkland Islands. The plush 700-capacity Seven Seas Mariner and Oceania Cruise flagship Regatta, owned by Prestige Cruise Holdings, axed an early February stopover to the British overseas territory. John Pollard Managing Director of Port Stanley based Sulivan Shipping Services, agents for the Prestige Cruise group, confirmed the cancellations. Blocked: The Seabourn Sojourn was blocked in by Argentine port workers who want to prevent the ship sailing to the disputed islands . Mr Pollard said he believed the decision was taken in light of the increasingly aggressive tactics by Argentinean nationalists. An FCO spokesperson said: ‘We are deeply concerned to learn that these cruise ships have cancelled their upcoming visits to the Falkland Islands following intimidation from factions in Argentina.’ The news follows militant action by Buenos Aires port workers on Wednesday which prevented the British-flagged Seabourn Sojourn cruise ship from setting sail for the Falklands. Arriving in Hong Kong: The ship's 450 passengers paid between £4,200 and £9,300 each for the trip. It boasts 225 cabins spread over eight decks, a casino and two swimming pools . It was delayed for seven hours as United . Maritime Workers Union leaders attempted, and failed, to wrestle a . pledge from the captain not to land on the Falklands. Mike Summers Chairman of the Falkland Islands Tourist Board said directors of the Miami-based Prestige group had showed ‘a disturbing lack of backbone’ and had ‘caved in to Argentine pressure’. ‘This type of bullying by a large aggressive neighbour against a small innocent community is despicable, and deserves to attract worldwide condemnation,’ Mr Summers said. Cruise ship stops are estimated to be worth at least £10 million to the island’s economy. The announced cancellation will affect several small Falklands businesses. But there are fears that withdrawals by cruise companies could escalate. Trapped: Workers from the United Maritime Workers Union (SOMU) prevented the Seabourn Sojourn from leaving the port in Buenos Aires as it headed for the Falkland Islands . Stop over: The ships were scheduled to make an eight-hour stop at the Falklands' capital Port Stanley, pictured . Britain summoned Argentina’s ambassador Alicia Castro to London on Monday after masked leftists thrashed the offices of a shipping company in Buenos Aires, a move the Foreign Office alleged was aimed at deterring ships from visiting the disputed Falkland Islands. Following the violent attack two cruise ships belonging to the Carnival Corporation, which carries 40 per cent of cruise passengers to the Falklands, pulled out of scheduled trips. Posting on an online news board ‘Outlawcatcher’, a Falklands war veteran, voiced his support for the islanders: ‘As an ‘82 vet I can say that this behaviour by those contemptible people only reaffirms that our actions thirty years ago were utterly worth it. War didn’t work out for them and they now think that bullying will ... pathetic.’ The Foreign Office said yesterday: ‘We will take every necessary measure to support the Falkland Islanders.’","Seven Seas Mariner and .

Tragic: Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, passed away on Saturday just weeks after he posted a heartbreaking video on to YouTube wishing an inspirational farewell to the world . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Terminally-ill Australian Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, died yesterday just weeks after he posted a heart-breaking and inspirational farewell message to the world on YouTube. Shaun, who was told by doctors he did not have long to live after his body rejected a second heart transplant, passed away holding his father’s hand reported the Sun Herald. The teenager became an internet sensation after a glitch meant the tragic goodbye he was trying to post his tragic goodbye speech to his friends on Facebook was uploaded on YouTube as well. He woke up to find it had more than 10,000 views. The video, in which he shows no signs of self pity - instead encouraging watchers to seize the day and make the most of their lives – had been viewed more than 1.9 million times on Sunday. The boy’s devastated father said his son’s positivity never wavered and that Shaun had given him constant hugs in recent days. ‘He passed peacefully with me holding his hand; that is something the family will hold with us,’ he told the Sun Herald. Shaun’s death came as a shock as his distraught family hoped he had weeks, or even months, to live.Tributes from around the world have started to pour in for the inspirational teen, including from his favourite football club. In his three-minute long 'My Final Goodbye' clip, after choking back tears, Shaun says: 'I won't be here as long as I thought, but I want to say that it's been an awesome ride and I have no regrets. 'Live life to the fullest because you never know what's going to happen.' The video has inspired such a wave of emotion in his homeland that Shaun spent his final weeks living out his dreams by appearing in Neighbours, meeting his favourite Aussie Rules football player, writing his memoirs - and even finding love. Shaun's girlfriend is a fellow heart patient he started a relationship with just over a month ago but has been friends with for seven years. 'The hardest thing for me is leaving her, knowing that I won't get to marry her,' he told the Herald Sun in Australia. 'To have kids together. To grow old together. That is what makes me sad. He added: ' I want to have fun. I want to enjoy my life. The way I look at it is I didn't get to decide this. These are the cards I have been dealt. I just have to roll with the punches. 'I have had two heart transplants and a stent put in. I have had ten more years than I should have because of that. I want to go out with a bang.' His father Cameron admits the circumstances surrounding Shaun's death have left him bursting with pride at his boy's bravery - but utterly devastated he will have to bury his beloved son. Cameron told the Herald Sun two weeks ago: 'I just pray that it's quick. I don't want him to suffer. No parent should have to bury their child. But he's just loving life and wants us to do the same. He doesn't want us to cry for him. 'I've become angry with the world, I question why this beautiful person should be taken way from me, from his family and from the world. But he doesn't want me to cry. He needs to know I'm going to be OK.'","Shaun Wilson-Miller, 17, died on Saturday after his body rejected a second heart transplant .

North Korea is expanding its already extensive network of prison camps, eating up entire villages as  it struggles to house hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, latest satellite images have revealed. The secretive communist regime has built a huge 'security perimeter' around an existing camp restricting movement in nearby villages as part of its 'general repression' of its people, human rights watchdog Amnesty International said today. The reclusive country's network of political prison camps is believed to hold at least 200,000 people and has been the scene of rapes, torture, executions and slave labour, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in January. Satellite images show how North Korea is expanding its already sizeable network of prison camps . Clampdown: North Korea has built a huge 'security perimeter' around a camp for political prisoners, restricting movement in nearby villages . Analysis of new satellite images of the area near Camp No. 14 in Kaechon shows that the government is 'blurring the lines' between its camps and surrounding civilians, Amnesty said. The images show that between 2006 and 2013, North Korea has constructed 20 km (12 miles) of posts around the Ch'oma-Bong valley located 70km north of Pyongyang. The new perimeter encloses civilian villages with a series of check points and guard towers, Amnesty said in a statement voicing fears about government intentions for the valley, 70 km north of the capital Pyongyang. 'The security and control adjacent to Camp 14 shows the degree to which general repression and restrictions on the right to liberty of movement have become commonplace in North Korea,' said Rajiv Narayan, North Korea researcher for Amnesty. Expansion: Satellite images reveal an increase in housing between 2008 and 2011, in North Korea's Ch'oma-Bong valley . The images show that between 2006 and 2013, North Korea has constructed 20 km (12 miles) of posts around the Ch'oma-Bong valley located 70km north of Pyongyang. A satellite image shows what Amnesty International believes is the construction of an entrance gate in North Korea's Ch'oma-Bong valley . The London-based group called on the U.N. Human Rights Council, holding its main annual session in Geneva through March 22, to launch an international commission of inquiry into grave and systematic violations 'including crimes against humanity'. North Korea denies the existence of a network of camps. A similar U.N. investigation similar to the one Amnesty is demanding, made up of independent experts, has said it is documenting war crimes committed by both sides in Syria's conflict so as to build a case for future prosecution. Top U.N. rights official Pillay, who met two North Korean camp survivors in December, has called for an independent investigation into 'one of the worst - but least understood and reported - human rights situations'. Concerns about abuses in the impoverished country have persisted for years, but have been largely overshadowed in international forums by fears over North Korea's attempts to become a nuclear weapons power. Blind obedience: North Koreans attend a political rally earlier this week. Criticism of the ruling communist regime is strictly forbidden . The U.N. Security Council is expected . to vote later on Thursday on a draft resolution in response to North . Korea's third underground nuclear test last month. Amnesty commissioned DigitalGlobe to take the images and help with their analysis following reports of the possible construction of a new political prison camp adjacent to Camp No. 14 in Kaechon, South Pyongyan province. 'Dear leader': 29-year-old North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un . 'We expected to find a new or expanded prison camp. What we found is in some ways even more worrisome,' said Frank Jannuzi, deputy executive director of Amnesty International USA. The security perimeter beyond what appears to be the formal boundaries of Camp 14 blurs the line between people in the prison system known as Kwan-li-so and civilians, he said. New buildings that appear to house workers are probably linked to expanded mining activity in the region, Amnesty said. Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans, including children, are held in political prison camps and other detention facilities, often subjected to forced hard labour, denial of food rations, and torture, it said. Many detainees have not committed any crime, but are relatives of those deemed unfriendly to the regime and detained as a form of 'collective punishment', it added. Japan and the United States called last week for the council to launch an inquiry into alleged violations including torture and execution of political prisoners in North Korea. The council already has an independent investigator on North Korea, Marzuki Darusman, who has said a wider inquiry should examine personal and institutional accountability for crimes. Activists hope the forum adopts a resolution on North Korea by consensus now that neither China nor Russia are members.","Images show new security perimeter enclosing entire civilian villages .

Hypocritical: Police Inspector Mohammed Razaq may himself face jail after the fraud conviction . A senior police officer who spearheaded a ‘zero tolerance’ crime clampdown is facing jail after being convicted of a £46,000 insurance and mortgage scam. Mohammed Razaq was in charge of a neighbourhood police team in Bolton, Greater Manchester, until he was arrested and his office was raided by police. Disgraced Inspector Razaq, 53, has been found guilty of a fraud involving four rental properties he owned. Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that Razaq created a false damage report document, purporting to be from a genuine company, and used it as evidence for a bogus insurance claim. He then made a series of claims for damage on properties that he owned and a false mortgage application. Insp Razaq, who owned four homes and was trying to buy a fifth property in Bolton, used several different identities in a bid to cover his tracks. Robert Hall, prosecuting, said that his ambition was part of his downfall. He said: ‘He was undoubtedly ambitious in his approach to life and his rise to inspector. ‘The Crown says that his ambition for status and wealth is what fuelled this dishonesty.’ The court heard that in 2008 he ‘could not have wanted for anything else’. He had a wife and three children in their teens or early 20s and Mr Hall said Razaq was ‘not short of a bob or two’. ‘The effect of this financial demand on Mohammed Razaq was that his bank account, that was in good credit, started to go down in balance to where money was needed to keep them in the black,’ Mr Hall told the jury. Razaq was found guilty of six counts of fraud and three counts of converting criminal property and will be sentenced next month. Bad landlord: One of the Salford houses owned by Mohammed Razaq where neighbours complained about anti-social behaviour from the tenants . His dishonesty started in 2008 when he had a water leak at his home and a surveyor said the cost of the damage was about £1,200. Razaq . disputed this and submitted two documents from companies showing that . the damage cost more than £7,000. The insurance company paid out £7,685. The court heard that there was water damage at another house he owned, which prompted a fire service call-out. Insp Razaq submitted an insurance claim for £20,000 but it was rejected. He changed his insurance company on his home in Bradford Road and, in 2010, he claimed again for water damage, having not declared a previous claim to the company. The prosecution says this damage was the same damage that he had claimed for previously, but had not been repaired. He was paid £6,300. Police Inspector Mohammed Razaq  has worked for Greater Manchester police for more than 30 years before the fraud was uncovered . The court heard he also applied for a £12,000 mortgage for home improvements on an address in Bradford Street, on the basis that he lived there, but in reality it was rented out. The money was transferred to him in June, 2010. In March 2011, the court heard, Razaq . lied about which house he lived in when applying . for a mortgage for another property claiming he was going to more there. But within two weeks of the mortgage being granted . he called an insurance company for a quote to insure the building as a . rental property. Razaq had . more than 33 years policing experience, including spells in CID, . Tactical Aid, a firearms unit and various community cohesion projects. During . the 1980s, he helped to police the Toxteth riots, and was part of the . team which escorted the Moors Murderer Myra Hindley back to the . Saddleworth moors to identify the location of victims' bodies. He was eventually put in charge of . policing the Johnson Fold estate in Bolton where he introduced extra . high visibility police patrols and more CCTV surveillance. Groups of . youths were regularly stopped and asked to account for what they were . doing. Last year anti-social behaviour order . laws, which Insp Razaq often used to deal with thuggery on his beat, . were used to close down the house he owned in Higher Broughton, near . Salford after complaints it was a blackspot for late night parties, drug . taking and violence. All the tenants were moved out and the windows . were boarded-up. Speaking . after the court case yesterday Elisa Hopley, Senior Crown Prosecutor . from the CPS North West Complex Casework Unit said: ‘Mohammed Razaq . embarked upon a prolonged period of dishonesty, breaching the trust that . was placed in him as a serving Inspector for Greater Manchester Police. ‘The . public are entitled to expect the highest standards from police . officers and whilst cases where police officers are charged with . criminal offences are rare, today's conviction shows that they are not . above the laws they are expected to uphold.’","Mohammed Razaq created false document for bogus damages claim .

After documentary makers spent a year filming tennis champion Andy Murray, they admitted what many of us already suspected: he's pretty ordinary. Forget fathering children in laundry cupboards or smashing up hotel rooms - a good weekend for the 26-year-old Scotsman is spent at home, playing with his dogs and eating takeaway sushi. Andy Murray, who took on France's Nicolas Mahut at London's Queen's Club today, doesn't lead a flash life, a film-maker said today . And a bad weekend involves a bad result from his fantasy football team. Film-maker Jo McCusker, who trailed Murray around the world for her programme, has lifted the lid on the world of ice baths, early nights and six-hour training sessions that constitute the life of this top flight tennis player. She said he did nothing other than train, eat, sleep and travel. 'You don't see anything flash because he doesn't do anything flash,' she told the Radio Times. 'He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't go out. 'And it all comes back to one word, mentioned by everyone we spoke to - ""ordinary"".' Murray, who today took on France's Nicolas Mahut at the AEGON Tennis Championships at London's Queen's Club, is filmed during a six-hour 'boot camp' training session in Miami, during which he did Pilates, Bikram yoga, weights, speed-work and, of course, tennis. He then had to spend ten minutes in a freezing ice bath to rid his body of lactic acid, with a cup of sweets to lure him in. Andy Murray was watched by actor Kevin Spacey and his girlfriend Kim Sears at the match in London today . Miss McCusker said his determination and focus on being the best could make Murray appear aloof, but said she had been surprised by his manners, wit, and droll sense of humour. She described Murray as laid-back with other people but hard on himself, and said he wore his heart on his sleeve. 'There isn't an Andy that goes into a press conference and an Andy outside of it; he doesn't edit himself.' During the filming, the team also followed Murray visiting Dunblane Primary School where his famously ambitious mother, Judy, was giving a tennis lesson to youngsters.

The school, which Murray attended, was the scene of an appalling massacre in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed 17 people before shooting himself.  Murray, who has never spoken publicly about the tragedy, sheltered in a classroom during the shooting. The film-makers said the visit to Dunblane, during which Murray - fresh from a win at the U.S Open - spent hours shyly signing autographs and posing with children, was the most poignant moment during the year. In the Radio Times interview, Miss McCusker said: 'It was quietly moving to see how much the Murray siblings - his brother Jamie is also a professional tennis player - mean to that school and the Dunblane community.' The documentary covers the entourage behind the professional tennis player, which includes his coach, former player Ivan Lendl, his hitting partner Danny Vallverdu, and trainers Jez Green and Matt Little, physio Andy Ireland and Matt Gentry from Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment. Miss McCusker said Murray took some flak over the size of his team, but said he defended it by saying it was crucial to his success at such a high level. She also said Murray was friendly with other players off the court, and enjoyed playing PlayStation with rivals like Rafael Nadal, whom he has known since they were both children.

Marines are up in arms over President Obama's proposal to create unisex hats that some have branded too 'girly' for males - while others have lambasted its steep cost as unnecessary. One estimate is that the divisive new hats, which are thinner and smaller than those in the current uniforms, could cost as much as $8 million. 'What's wrong with the current uniform?' one Marine posted on a story about the proposed hats. 'NOTHING! Read the news... Marines getting relieved, . budgets and structure being cut, and we have time/desire to evaluate a . new cover [hat]. You gotta to be kidding!' New design: Proposed new hats for the Marines are smaller and thinner - and will cost $8 million . The hats, which have been designed to . be used in male and female uniforms, are called the 'Dan Daly' hat after . a Long Island sergeant who earned the Medal of Honor twice. He famously led his tired, outnumbered Marines at Belleau Wood in June 1918 during World War I, yelling: 'Come on, you sons of b****es, do you want to live forever!' But some Marines are complaining about the switch from the old hats, which have been part of the uniform since 1922, while others have complained about its look. 'The Dan Daly cap looks too French, and the last people we want to associate our Marines with would be the French military,' one wrote on the Marine Corps. Times website. Old design: The current hats are much wider - but the Marines wants uniforms to be unisex . Another quipped: 'Why not just put them all in pink camo?' Name sake: The hats are named after 'Dan Daly' a WW1 sergeant who earned the Medal of Honor . One senior Marine source added to the New York Post: 'We don't even have enough funding to buy . bullets, and the DoD is pushing to spend $8 million on covers that look . like women's hats! 'The . Marines deserve better. It makes them look ridiculous.' So far the hats are just a proposed design, and a second part of the proposal suggests women simply wearing the current male hats with slight modifications - instead of the Dan Daly hat. Marine Corps head Gen. James Amos will make the final decision, and officials have until the end of this week to allow or reject the proposed design. The move to make female uniforms more like those worn by men comes as the DoD starts to open more combat unit roles to women. An . informal survey of the Marine uniform advisory board already found: . 'The group members did not like the appearance of the Dan Daly cap on . the male Marine.' But the Marine Times reported how, over . the years, the Uniform Board has made recommendations against the . opinions expressed by the Marines in surveys. One example was the . decision to wear uniform sleeves rolled down, even in the summer.","The hats, called 'Dan Daly' hats after WWI sergeant, are part of a proposed uniform change to make female uniforms more like those worn by men .

Lucille Ball, center, dressed as Santa Claus in a colorized I Love Lucy Christmas Special, which aired on Friday, December 20 on CBS . Lucille Ball, who died in 1989, played a housewife with aspirations of showbiz fame.

"By . David Wilkes . UPDATED: . 01:42 EST, 26 October 2011 . They look so cute it is almost impossible to believe these dogs have had their day. But the Sealyham terrier, once beloved of Hollywood stars and royalty, is now ‘rarer than a tiger’ and on the verge of extinction. The staggering decline in the popularity of the little white dogs is highlighted in the latest edition of Country Life magazine as it sends an ‘SOS’ - that’s ‘Save our Sealyhams’ - message to its well-heeled readers. On the brink: Rare Sealyham terriers, which are described in Country Life magazine as 'cheerful companions' There are only 49 of the puppies registered in the country last year . Describing the breed as ‘both cheerful companion and efficient pest controller’, the article urges: ‘If we can save the rhino or tiger, we can surely save this useful and charming breed of dog.’ The call to arms to rescue the British breed from oblivion comes as the Kennel Club revealed that just 49 Sealyham puppies were registered with it in the UK last year. Almost incredibly, that is actually a very slight improvement on three years ago. In 2008, only 43 were registered - an all-time low which placed Sealyhams in the bottom three most endangered breeds on the Kennel Club’s Vulnerable Native Breeds list. It is all a very long way the days when more thousands were registered a year and everyone who was anyone seemed to have a Sealyham. Owners then included Princess Margaret, Humphrey Bogart and Elizabeth Taylor. - Sealyhams were first bred by Captain John Tucker-Edwardes between 1850 and 1891 at his home Sealyham House, in Pembrokeshire, to hunt rats, foxes, badgers and rabbits. - It is thought he produced them from a mixture of Dandie  Dinmont, the now-extinct  English white terrier, the fox  terrier, the West Highland and the corgi. - In 1959 a Sunday newspaper reported: ‘A notice has been posted in Clarence House and Windsor Castle giving explicit instructions that when Princess Margaret has breakfast in bed, her two Sealyhams must be brought to the room along with her breakfast tray.’ - In a typical cameo appearance in his 1963 film The Birds, Alfred Hitchcock walks his two Sealyham terriers, Geoffrey and Stanley, out of a shop. Sealyhams were originally bred to catch rats, rabbits and other vermin, but Country Life says: ‘People soon discovered that, although the Sealyham might have the wit and courage to hold a badger at bay, he was also a very charming fellow to have at dinner. ‘At the peak of their popularity, in the 1920s, the KC regularly registered more than 2,000 puppies each year, but this did nothing for the integrity of the breed. After the rise came the fall.’ The Kennel Club has blamed the decline of the Sealyham partly on the popularity of ‘designer’ continental dogs including Shih Tzus. Another possible reason was the ban on tail docking in 2006. The dogs' tails were traditionally docked to the strongest point so farmers could pull them out of rabbit holes. Even a Sealyham winning Best in Show at Crufts for the first time in 2009 could not stem the rot as the competition was not televised that year due to the BBC withdrawing support after exposing cruelty in the pedigree-dog world. ‘So an opportunity for publicity fell on stony ground,’ writes Tessa Waugh in article for this week’s Country Life, which is out today. Reasons listed by the magazine why you should have a Sealyham include: ‘They make adorable, loyal family dogs, which are eager to please and are quite trainable.’ It adds that they are ‘aren’t neurotic’, have a ‘non-shedding coat’. The one hope seems to be how passionate Sealyham owners are about promoting the breed. ‘Sealyham obsessive’ Finny Muers-Raby who lives at Cothelstone Manor in Somerset, and owns one called Molesworth, told the magazine: ‘Everyone flies the flag for a tiger or a bear, but this poor little British dog is being ignored. People need to know that they’re fun but gutsy little dogs with very gentle, sweet natures.’ Harry Parsons, founder of the Working Sealyham Terrier Club, who has 13 of them, which he uses as a pack to get rid of rats on farms. He and his wife Gail also tour game fairs to raise awareness of the seldom seen dogs. Yesterday Mr Parsons, 54, Brixham, Devon, told the Mail: ‘To sustain a breed you I think you need between 300 to 500 pups a year. 'My aim is to get them into good young people’s homes. They are intelligent and need to be part of a family.’ Last night a Kennel Club spokesman said: ‘Because the Sealyham terrier lacks the high profile that some breeds enjoy it has sadly fallen out of fashion. ‘We are concerned that too many people choose a breed purely because they have seen it flaunted by celebrities and fail to look beyond the obvious choices to the more obscure breeds which may perhaps be a better fit for their lifestyle.’ In a bid to improve lesser known breeds’ popularity, the Kennel Club is hosting the Discover Dogs event at Earls Court on November 12 and 13 where visitors can see more than 200 breeds of dog.",SOS: Save Our Sealyhams .

Travelled 17,342 miles: Clive, 54, and Gillian Raven, 53 - who have been together for 33 years - drove from Sheffield to Singapore in a blue 1968 Triumph 1300, before returning to Britain via India . Adventure: The couple's car is pictured next to the Angor Wat Temple in Cambodia (left) and in China (right) Mr Raven said: ‘We have been on plenty of package holidays - we've been to Australia and we've done Thailand - but we wanted to do something really different. Having a car gave us freedom. ‘(It) allowed us to go off the beaten track. If we didn't like a hotel we just moved on. If we loved somewhere, we stayed put for a little longer. We did what we wanted, when we wanted.’ The couple staggered their journey by alternating driving duties, spending one day out of every four days on the road. They spent their nights camping, or staying in budget motels. Mr Raven, a self-employed diesel plant fitter, bought the Triumph for £500 on eBay and restored it himself in preparation for their adventure. He said: ‘People thought we were mad. They said we would never make it. They kept asking me if we were worried about breaking down or getting injured. ‘The way I saw it, I'd only bought the car for £500, so if it didn't survive the trip then I wouldn't lose a huge amount of money.’ Achievement: Mr and Mrs Raven in Cambodia.

Meeting the locals: Children in China pose for a photograph with the blue 1968 Triumph 1300 on its journey . The wide variety of environments they travelled through brought particular challenges. Mr Raven said: ‘In the Gobi desert we had a bit of a problem with fuel evaporating because it was so hot. ‘I had to do a few repairs on it along the way, but only small things, and I had some spares with me in case of emergencies. Local people warmed to us when we drove through their villages. 'People thought we were mad. They said we would never make it' Clive Raven . ‘People saw the car and wanted to engage with us, coming over to shake our hands. Being in an old car, rather than a modern vehicle, we felt more connected with the world outside.’ The pair saw the Kremlin in Moscow, viewed the Terracotta Army in Xi'an and ate goats' cheese at the table of a hospitable Mongolian family. Mr Raven said: ‘In China we were required to stick to an agreed route and we were needed an official guide with us in the back seat the whole time. ‘The forests of Laos were stunning and the people were lovely. They had very little but were happy.  The sun setting over the Gobi desert is an experience I will never forget.’ Mr Raven estimated the trip cost £10,000. At one point the couple encountered some stick-wielding men, whom they . took to be bandits, while travelling through India. Happy trip: Mrs Raven is pictured driving in Mongolia.

He is standing inside a squalid shed in the back garden of a suburban London house. It has a concrete floor, a half-built roof open to the wintry sky, and is strewn with dirty mattresses, battered suitcases and plastic bags. Yet yesterday it emerged that the shack, with one of its four walls missing and covered instead by a blue cotton sheet, is home to a number of  Indian immigrants living illegally in Britain.

In total 14 people were living a three-bedroom home and the shack built in the garden.

The . scene of squalor, hidden away behind a house in an avenue in Southall, . West London, where property prices top £400,000, is all too common. Crackdown: Some 10 officers raided the house at 5am yesterday, making three arrests with more expected . Quiet: The property used to house 14 illegal immigrants sits on this quiet residential street in Southall, London (general view) A government crackdown on immigration is 'really spitting in the wind of the problem we face', a Tory MP warned yesterday. Philip Davis also predicted that new benefit restrictions would be found illegal in the European courts. He added 'The only way to get control of our borders back, and control of our benefits system, is to leave the European Union.' But David Cameron insisted that ministers had taken legal advice on limiting access to benefits to those who have been in the UK for three months. 'There is a right to work in different countries of the European Union but there shouldn't be a right to claim in different countries of the European Union,' the PM said. Earlier . this year, the local council – Ealing – estimated that the inhabitants . of bed sheds has pushed the area’s population up by 60,000 to nearly . 400,000. It has meant . schools struggle to cope with huge increases in pupils. GP surgeries and . health services are overwhelmed while rubbish collection and sanitation . services reel under the extra burden. I have seen the appalling conditions in which these newcomers live for myself. Earlier . this year I visited neighbouring Hounslow, a borough where there are . 20,000 gardens with ramshackle sheds or outbuildings of all sizes, a lot of them rented out illegally to migrants, mainly from India. As local councillor Sheila O’Reilly told me: ‘Once, it was a rural scene around here. Now, many areas resemble shanty towns.’ I was led by a council enforcement team to a cream-painted house on a leafy road which looked perfectly respectable. Yet . in the back garden was a jerry-built shack thrown together with breeze . blocks – and distinct signs of human habitation. When I poked my head . inside the door, the smell made my eyes water. Message: The Prime Minister said it was vital to send home people who don't have a right to be here . The . tiny, cramped outbuilding was home to eight Indians illegally living in . Britain, including a young woman, who paid hundreds of pounds a month . to a rogue landlord who owned a thriving grocery shop a few miles away. At the time of my visit, Hounslow had already inspected more than 2,000 bed sheds in its area – and was still counting. When . discovered, some are torn down because they break planning rules. All . too often though, red tape and lax laws mean that the landlord receives . only a warning. The council . must also give home-owners 24 hours’ notice of an inspection, which, of . course, gives them ample time to clear out a back-garden shack. Illegal: Mr Cameron said he wanted to see more raids being made of properties used to house people in the UK illegally . In . London suburbs and the Home Counties it is thought that tens of thousands bed . sheds now exist, each housing up to ten people. It is a huge secret . population living under the radar. 'We are dealing with the mess that we inherited from Labour, when immigration was completely out of control' Prime Minister David Cameron . Yesterday . Mr Cameron was confronting the harsh reality of a decade or more of . uncontrolled migration and the utter misery it can bring to everyone – . including the migrants themselves. Mr . Cameron said it was vital to ‘send home people who don’t have a right . to be here’, as he set out plans to prevent migrants claiming benefits . for three months after arriving in Britain. He . also said landlords would risk big fines if they fail to check the . status of their tenants under the terms of a new Immigration Bill. Curbs: The visit came after the government announced it was rushing forward legislation to stop migrants claiming benefits for the first three months they are in Britain .

Having spent 40 years flitting between careers in law enforcement and journalism, Senior CBS News Correspondent John Miller is re-joining the NYPD to once again work with friend and mentor Bill Bratton. Miller, who has worked at CBS since 2011, will return to the Department in a high-level counter-terrorism role, he announced on WCBS on Thursday afternoon. Miller - who faced criticism for a recent 60 Minutes report that many thought was too soft on the NSA - served as the chief spokesperson for the NYPD from 1994-1995 after twenty years as a local journalist in New York City. He then moved to ABC News for seven years before leaving to join the Los Angeles Police Department, followed by a stint as Assistant Director for Public Affairs at the FBI. Journalist John Miller is leaving CBS after two years to work in a counter-terrorism role at the NYPD. Miller is seen here in october 2013 participating in the Secrets of Homeland Panel at the Sheraton TriBeCa Club Lounge in New York City . Miller will work underneath Bratton, the NYPD Commissioner. Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio will be sworn in on Jan. 1 and has already tapped Bratton to once again lead the department. Ray Kelly has served as police commissioner for the past 12 years under Mayor Michael Bloomberg. As both a law enforcement agent and reporter, Miller has built a reputation as having an expertise in terrorism, even interviewing Osama bin Laden via video link in 1998. At the time the interview didn't 'create many waves', however it was replayed constantly in the wake of 9/11. In 2003 Miller joined the LAPD, working under Bratton, who was chief at the time, as the head of the Counterterrorism and Criminal Intelligence Bureau. He oversaw the LAPD’S bomb squad, its major crimes division and its hazardous materials unit. It was at the LAPD where Miller launched a system that helps to identify potential terrorist targets, according to CBS. 'The message going out from al Qaeda central is not ‘we need you to come here and train up in our camps and be deployed in our operations,’ he said on Thursday, in discussing his new role. Breaking from news: John Miller announces live on CBS New York he is rejoining the NYPD . 'The message going out is not from al Qaeda as much as it’s al Qaeda-ism, which is do what you can do with the resources you have.' Miller said that while a terrorist attack similiar to September 11 is highly unlikely, al Qaeda are now focusing on low-cost, high-impact attacks, such as the Westgate shopping mall attack in Kenya, which killed 72 people. Since joining CBS News in 2011, Miller has covered major stories like the Times Square bomb plot, the Boston Marathon bombings and the Newtown school shooting, for which CBS will be awarded the prestigious duPont-Columbia award for breaking news coverage.","John Miller is leaving his position as Senior News Correspondent at CBS after two years to return to the New York Police Department .

UPS sent out thousands of extra workers Thursday in scramble to deliver packages that had failed to arrive in time for Christmas as the No. 1 U.S. ground delivery service sought to stem the the growing fallout from the delays. The company's Facebook and Twitter became sounding boards over the past week for likely thousands of livid customers whose holidays were ruined by delays caused by a surge in online shopping the company simply couldn't handle. Along with 2,600 extra employees, the company has been forced to stick some 900 managers behind delivery truck wheels in order to meet a Friday deadline for the delivery of delayed packages it set for itself Christmas day. Scroll down for video... Scramble: UPS is scrambling to make up for its disastrous Christmas delays by sending out 2,600 extra workers and putting 900 managers behind the wheels of delivery trucks nationwide . UPS said on Wednesday that a confluence of factors from bad weather, a shorter shopping season and a surge in online shopping were to blame. It stressed that only a small percentage of total packages were delayed. The Associated Press spoke to people in Alabama, California, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia who didn't receive presents in time for Christmas. The company refused Thursday, along with its smaller rival FedEx Corp, to reveal how many packages had been delayed. However, judging from the backlash, the impact of the delays were far reaching. Ups and downs: UPS, the worlds largest parcel delivery service experienced overwhelming demand after a flurry of last-minute only Christmas purchases . When UPS posted a 'Merry Christmas' message on its Facebook page on December 25, hundreds of furious . customers replied with stories of how their holiday season would not be . bright because UPS failed to deliver in time. 'UPS ruined my Christmas,' Katherine McEachen of Fairfield, Connecticut, told NBC News. Ms McEachen said she sent her father a custom-made coffee mug with 'I love you' and a photo of the moment she was able to overcome her lupus and help them cut down a Christmas tree this year. None of them arrived for Christmas. 'It's just a mug, but it was supposed to be so special and it's the only way I can say those words to him,' she said. UPS truck driver Larry Ledet posted this comment on a Facebook page which drew angry responses from customers . Customers responded to the driver's remark that he had worked a 60-hour week trying to get all the packages delivered . Jill Amaya, of Houston, Texas, shipped her entire family's Christmas presents to her sister's home in Dallas week ago. They still had not arrived by Christmas Eve. 'I ordered my three-year-old grandson's entire Christmas on December 11. I received notice that it had been shipped December 13... the updated delivery date is Dec 27 . 'A little late for a 3 year olds Christmas... By the way, my 3 year old grandson was adopted out of a horrible situation in July and this is his first Christmas,' fumed Robbie Escalon of Amarillo, Texas. Widespread: Both UPS and its smaller rival FedEx experienced delays over the holiday. While both companies refuse to reveal the exact number of delayed packages, the problem appears to have been far more widespread with UPS . Amazon spokeswoman Mary Osako said in an email that orders were sent to delivery companies on time for holiday shipping and that the company was 'reviewing the performance of the delivery carriers.' Osako said shipping charges for late packages would be refunded and affected shoppers would receive $20 gift cards, though she did not provide a number of how many shipments were delayed. UPS says there was simply too much demand and the company couldn't keep up with the last minute shipments as 'the volume of air packages in our system exceeded the capacity of our network,' according to a statement. 'We're terribly sorry,' UPS spokeswoman Natalie Black told CNN. 'A small percentage of shipments are delayed and will not be delivered today,' another spokesperson told USA Today. Dissatisfied customers had been piping up for days, but their complaints became a chorus as hope they'd receive their packages in time for the holiday faded Christmas Eve . However, workers behind the scenes continued working over the holiday to ensure packages would be ready to go out Thursday. 'There will be an afternoon sort today,' Ms Black said. 'Workers will be processing packages so that tomorrow, bright and early, our drivers can clear out the remaining excess air volume. 'We expect that air volume to be delivered between tomorrow and Friday.' While UPS stopped making delivery date guarantees for ground packages on December 11, senders of next day air packages were told their shipments would arrive by Christmas Eve as late as Monday.","Families nationwide were disappointed Christmas morning after presents failed to reach doorsteps .

Prince Harry joined the UK team to race against two others from the Commonwealth and the US to complete the arduous trek. But the groups faced such extreme weather conditions during their 200-mile odyssey that organisers had to call off the competitive element of the adventure. Working as one unit, the three squads made it to their Antarctic goal together on Friday December 13. In total, 12 injured servicemen and women who have overcome life-changing injuries took part.

President Barack Obama's healthcare law could have a 'meltdown' and make it difficult for his Democratic Party to keep control of the U.S. Senate next year if ongoing problems with the program are not resolved, a Democratic senator said on Sunday. Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has urged delaying a penalty for people who do not enroll for health insurance in 2014 under the law, told CNN that a transitional year was needed for the complex healthcare program, commonly known as Obamacare, to work. 'If it's so much more expensive than what we anticipated and if the coverage is not as good as what we had, you've got a complete meltdown at that time,' Manchin told CNN's State of the Union program. 'Meltdown': Democratic Senator Joe Manchin says the president's healthcare law could have a 'meltdown' Heavy lifting: Manchin says that Democrats up for re-election next year are 'feeling the weight' of the disastrous roll out of Obamacare . 'It falls of its own weight, if basically the cost becomes more than we can absorb, absolutely.' The White House has been scrambling for months to control the damage from the botched Oct. 1 launch of the law, formally called the Affordable Care Act, which aimed at making sure that millions of Americans without health insurance are able to receive medical coverage. There have been complaints from consumers about higher premiums than they previously had to pay for health insurance after their old plans were canceled because of new standards under the law, as well as lingering problems with the main web portal used to sign up for insurance, HealthCare.gov. Manchin said Senate Democrats who are up for re-election next year are 'feeling the weight' of the program's woes and could have trouble keeping their majority in the chamber. Republicans have been highlighting the healthcare law's difficulties as they seek to gain the six seats they would need to win control of the 100-member Senate. Feeling the heat: The president has been running damage control since he flaws in his healthcare initiative became obvious . 'It needs to turn around,' Manchin said of Obamacare. 'I'm not going to say that I think we will lose it (the Senate). It's going to be extremely challenging. We have some very good people who are truly there, I believe, for the right reason. They're going to be challenged for the wrong reason.' Obama acknowledged on Friday that that the bungled launch of the healthcare law was his biggest mistake of 2013. His public approval numbers have dropped to historic lows over the law's debut. The president said more than 1 million people have signed up so far for new coverage under Obamacare through HealthCare.gov, which services 36 states, and 14 state-run marketplaces. A day earlier, Obama's administration said people whose insurance plans were canceled because of the law may claim a ""hardship exemption"" to the requirement that all Americans must have coverage by March 31 next year or face a penalty. Manchin, a conservative Democrat whose state of West Virginia has been increasingly trending Republican, has made no secret of his frustration over the program's fits and starts. Last month he introduced legislation to delay by a year the $95 penalty for failing to sign up for health insurance, saying Americans should not be penalized while Obamacare is going through its 'transition period.' Manchin does not face re-election next year, but some Democrats who do have also urged changes to the program, such as extending the open enrollment period beyond the March 31 deadline. One third of the Senate is re-elected every two years.","Manchin says Obamacare is 'so much more expensive than what we anticipated and if the coverage is not as good' there will be a 'meltdown'

As outrage continues to build over the National Security Administration's controversial Prism program, in which the federal government collects the electronic communications (email, text messages, phone calls, etc.) of average citizens, the nation's highest intelligence official is yucking it up about what many consider to be an unconstitutional violation of the U.S. citizenry's right to privacy. Foot-in-mouth-prone Director of National Intelligence James Clapper spoke at a black-tie dinner honoring former CIA and National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden on Friday night and - just days after admitting that he'd provided false testimony to Congress in regards to the Prism program - started cracking jokes about reading people's emails. Waka-waka! Director of National Intelligence James Clapper already is cracking jokes about the federal government's controversial Prism program . 'Some of you expressed surprise that I showed up,' Clapper quipped, according to the blog Government Executive.  'So many e-mails to read!” But Clapper's comedy show was just getting started - shortly after the line about reading people's emails, he tackled another controversial topic-du-jour. Last week - much to the ire of the airlines, pilots unions and Congress - the Transportation Safety Administration removed pocket knives from its list of prohibited items. So, naturally, Clapper worked it into his routine. While greeting Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole, Clapper asked, 'John, can I borrow your pocket knife?' Manhunt: as NSA Prism program leaker Edward Snowden is on the run, Clapper is joking about the controversial program the former NSA employee blew the whistle on . Clapper's big mouth has landed him in hot water on several occasions over the course of his career. In 2003, while attempting to explain the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Clapper, then the head of the Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, said the weapons were there, but they'd been shipped out of the country to places like Syria just prior to the American invasion - a conclusion his own agency said it 'could not provide further evidence to support.' In 2010, while serving as under-secretary of defense for intelligence, Clapper let it slip to Diane Sawyer that he had no clue that 12 would-be terrorists had been arrested in England earlier that day, despite the news having been broadcast across international news outlets like CNN and the BBC. In February, 2011, Clapper appeared before a House intelligence committee while serving in his current post as director of national intelligence. During the hearing, Clapper gave the Muslim Brotherhood - a violent, Islamic jihadist group - what pundits would later call a 'PR makeover.' 'The term ""Muslim Brotherhood""…is an umbrella term for a variety of . movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely . secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a . perversion of Islam…there is no overarching agenda, particularly in the . pursuit of violence,' Clapper explained to the committee. Is it something I said? Clapper's comments have landed him in hot water several times over the course of his career. Those comments were later described by former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton as 'perhaps the stupidest statement made by any administration in U.S. international history.' In March 2011, as the U.S. was assisting rebels in their efforts to oust Libyan dictator Muammar Gadaffi, Clapper - as the Director of National Intelligence - told the Senate Committee on Armed Services that 'over the longer term, [Gadaffi] will prevail.' Even the White House tried to distance itself from Clapper's comments, with then-National Security Adviser Thomas Donilon telling reporters Clapper's gaffe was nothing more than a 'static and one-dimensional assessment.' During that same hearing, Clapper neglected to include Iran and North Korea on a list of nuclear powers that might pose a threat to the United States - the general consensus, of course, is that the U.S.' two biggest nuclear threats are those very countries.","James Clapper jokes he was busy reading emails and almost didn't make it to the dinner .

"By . Ray Massey . PUBLISHED: . 17:59 EST, 27 December 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:00 EST, 28 December 2013 . Up to a million passengers were caught in rail chaos yesterday in what Network Rail bosses said was ‘the worst disruption in recent memory’. A quarter of all 8,000 trains running in Britain were cancelled or seriously delayed as 114mph gales, flooding and landslides threw services into disarray. The fiasco is set to trigger compensation payouts to thousands of travellers. Holidays derailed: Thousands of passengers were stuck waiting at Euston, pictured, in severe disruption . Commuter services in the South East and long-distance Virgin West Coast services in the North West were among the worst hit. Virgin Trains said around half of its services on the main Anglo-Scottish route from London to Glasgow were disrupted. With up to 28 trains running in each direction from London to Scotland, it means thousands of passengers were affected. Some services to Liverpool, Manchester and North Wales were also hit, but not as badly. A Network Rail spokesman said: ‘Around 2,000 of the 8,000 services run were seriously delayed or cancelled. This is one of the worst disruptions in recent memory but is down to the adverse weather conditions. ‘We do apologise and hope passengers will understand.’ There was virtually no service at all on some lines. Chaos: A Network Rail spokesman described the disruption as the worst in recent memory. Pictured: Euston . Impatient: Stephanie Harris, 19, from Sutton, Surrey, was stranded on her way to Liverpool for the new year . No room at the inn: This passenger used his groaning suitcases as a makeshift bench at Euston station . Southeastern, which covers services from London to Kent and Sussex, only started running services at midday yesterday but last night it said timetables would be back to normal today. Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations at Network Rail, said: ‘Passengers have had a tough week of travelling and unfortunately that is likely to continue for at least another day.’ He added that safety ‘comes first’. On another day, a cheerful festive greeting from Virgin Trains may have passed with barely anyone noticing. A spokesman tweeted: ‘We’re back in the game. Did everyone have a good Christmas?’ It was followed by: ‘We’re planning on running a normal service today.’ Alas, he spoke too soon as the cheery tweet became the focus of passenger fury when the schedule went off-track. As its page was inundated with angry tweets, . Virgin posted more sober messages such as: ‘NEW: From 11.45am the line between Carlisle and Preston will be blocked for two hours to make repairs. Replacement buses will run.’ However, MPs said it was not good enough. Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye, Amber Rudd, said she had received many gripes about Southeastern and its failure to supply buses to replace the trains. ‘I have received a lot of complaints about them,’ she said. ‘They have been just too complacent. The fact is that the buses are getting through. ‘Why haven’t Southeastern made sure that constituents who want to get to Tunbridge Wells or to London can use those buses? ‘Their point is that it’s a bit late in the day to try and get bus replacement services in place, but that’s not good enough.’ Labour MP Graham Stringer, a member of the all-party Commons transport select committee, said regulators should consider stripping franchises from those rail firms who have failed to deal effectively with the Christmas floods. He said: ‘These failings sadly confirm what is already known. Rail companies’ performance has been extremely patchy and that should be taken into account when the system is  re-franchised. Some of these companies are clearly not capable of running a public service.’ However, Mr Gisby insisted Network Rail staff have been doing their best: ‘This has been one of the most challenging periods we have faced in recent times and our engineers have been doing all they can to get things moving again. ‘We’ve spent 48 hours clearing up the remains of trees, a lot of landslips, mudslides and washouts. ‘On top of that we’ve got our Christmas weekend engineering work, which kicked in on Christmas Eve. So I’m afraid what passengers are facing today is some disruption anyway because of the engineering work.’ Chaos: Several trains were also delayed out of London's Paddington station, pictured .","Trains were delayed as 114mph gales, flooding and landslides hit Britain .

As a Hollywood legend, Shirley MacLaine could have been forgiven for expecting a wardrobe of new tailor-made costumes when she joined Downton Abbey. But the Oscar-winning star made her debut in the hit ITV show in a second-hand coat that had already appeared in three other television dramas in 20 years. More than ten million viewers saw the 78-year-old star of movies including The Apartment and Terms Of Endearment make her flamboyant entrance as Martha Levinson in the first episode of the new series. Second-hand: Shirley MacLaine makes her Downton Abbey debut in a coat first seen on television in 1994 . Welcome back: The familiar coat has made an appearance in at least five television dramas . Her character, a wealthy American socialite, stepped out of a car in an elegant evening coat embroid­ered with a silk and metal thread and topped off with a fur collar and cuffs. It was a show-stopping arrival – but the dress had already been seen on screen several times. Firstly, in 1994, the actress Gaye Brown wore it in an episode of the BBC drama The House Of Eliott, which was set in the Twenties. Three years later it was worn in an ITV adap­tation of Catherine Cookson's The Wingless Bird – a story of love and intrigue in the North East at the ­outbreak of the First World War. In April, French actress and model Josephine de la Baume wore the coat in ITV's four-part drama Titanic – which was also scripted by Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes. Miss de la Baume's character, the flirtatious Madame Aubert, can clearly be seen wearing it on the deck of the doomed liner. A week after Miss Mac­Laine donned the coat, it was on screen again – in the BBC's highly acclaimed five-part First World War drama Parade's End. Debut: Gaye Brown, right, gives the coat its first TV outing in 1994 as Anne Beaumont in The House of Eliott . In that show, Rebecca Hall, 30, who played the beautiful but scheming Sylvia Tietjens, wore it when she visited the front line to confront her husband Christopher, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Nigel Stafford Clark, the producer of Titanic, said he had no problem with the fact that Madame Aubert's coat had resurfaced in Downton. He added: 'I'm delighted it's keeping such exalted company – costumes do get recycled.' The fashion for reusing clothes is due partly to the fact that drama budgets have become increasingly tight. In addition, there has been a spate of recent productions set in the years leading up to and immed­iately following the First World War, and a consequent need for clothing to define that era. Male stars are also having to make do with hand-me-downs. In tonight's episode of Downton Abbey, Kevin McNally, who plays the gruff Horace Bryant, will be seen wearing a scarf previously sported by Rupert Everett in Parade's End. A spokesman for Downton Abbey said: 'As with all television costume drama, theatre productions and films, a proportion of the costumes will be originally designed and others will be hired.' Back again: The coat was back on television screens earlier this year with Josephine de la Baume, left, in ITV's Titanic before returning just months later with Rebecca Hall, right, in First World War drama Parade's End .",The Oscar-winning actress made her debut on ITV's hit show wearing a coat that had already appeared in three other television shows in 20 years .

Dog attack: Maddison Green was forced to have 80 stitches after being mauled by her grandparents' dog . A three-year-old girl was left needing 80 stitches in her face after she was mauled by a husky dog in her grandmother's home - sparking a bitter family row. Maddison Green was forced to undergo a two-hour operation after being attacked by the pet as she was being taken bed in Newport, South Wales. Her grandmother’s partner is . refusing to have his husky - called Zeus - put down despite the attack. If the incident had happened in a . public place the dog could have been put down - but the law does not . apply on private land. The government has pledged to removed the . loophole next year. Maddison’s father Craig said Zeus jumped forwards and bit into her face last Saturday. After . she was treated at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport he has called . for the dog to be put down - but his own stepfather Dave Sellwood, 41, . has said no. Craig Green, . 28, of Porth, Rhondda, said: 'I cannot believe that there is nothing we . can do to prevent this dog from attacking again. 'My stepfather is refusing to put the dog down. He regards it like a child. But it could have killed my daughter. 'He . has no children of his own, but Maddison has been brought up to call . him grandad. I cannot believe he is putting the dog first.' Anger: Maddison's father Craig said that the husky called Zeus should be destroyed after it mauled his daughter . Attack: Maddison was forced to undergo a two-hour operation after being mauled by her grandparents' pet . Dog owners cannot be prosecuted if their pet attacks a person if the attack takes place on private land. The Dangerous Dogs Act currently only covers 'maulings' in public places. However, the government has vowed to change the law after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was killed. No one could be prosecuted for the attack by four bull mastiff-type dogs in Athertron, Greater Manchester, because it happened on private land. Under the law, introduced in 1991, it is an offence to be the owner of a dog that was dangerously out of control in a public place or a 'non-public place in which it is not permitted to be'. The reform will change the wording of the law to cover all attacks, regardless of where they take place. Mr Green said changing the dangerous dogs law needs to be changed now so the husky can be destroyed. He . added: 'The law should be changed right now. We have to stop this from . happening. How can a little girl be injured and no one be held . responsible?' Fitness trainer Mr Sellwood, 41, who lives with his wife Catherine, has told Craig there is 'no point' in putting the dog down now. Mr Green said: 'He has told me and my partner that now the attack has happened there is no point in killing his pet. But it is totally absurd. The husky could have killed Maddison.' On the night of the attack last Saturday Maddison was staying with her grandmother. Mr Green and his partner, Cerys Shirley, 24, had left her with their son David, four, and his brother’s children to stay the night. Mr Green added: 'When we got the call . about what had happened it was horrible. Cerys is devastated - it seems . utterly unfair that no one is responsible for this in the eyes of the . law.'

The Duchess of Cambridge normally dominates the Royal style stakes, but it was the Queen who today stole the show with some vintage glamour in a luxurious fur coat. Queen Elizabeth II arrived for the royals' traditional Christmas church service at a chapel on the Sandringham Estate in the brown fur coat which she has owned since 1961. Paired with some simple black shoes and pearl earrings, the look was reminiscent of the Hollywood glamour typically associated with starlets in the 1950s. Vintage glamour: The Queen arrives for a Christmas Day service at The Church of St Mary Magdalene on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk in a luxurious dark brown fur coat she has owned since 1961 . Family outing: The Queen was joined by other members of the royal family for the Christmas Day church service . The Queen would have been perfectly warm in the thick coat, as while parts of the country were covered in snow or flood water, the weather in Sandringham, Norfolk, was mild and sunny. She was joined for the service at St. Mary Magdelene Church by the rest of the royal family, including her pregnant granddaughter Zara Phillips, Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. But the Queen didn't stay in the coat for long, making her first outfit change of the day into a vibrant burnt orange cashmere Stewart Parvin coat. Sticking with her glamourous theme, the Queen made the outfit even more dramatic by adding a black fur hat to match the fur ruffs on her coat. She kept on her classic pearl earrings with a matching necklace but added a diamond brooch in the shape of a bow to complete the ensemble. Second outfit: After the service, Queen Elizabeth II changed into a eye-catching burnt orange cashmere Stewart Parvin coat, pictured . Elegant: Queen Elizabeth II matched her hat to the black fur ruffs on her coat sleeves . On average, the Queen is said to make at least five clothes changes on Christmas Day - choosing a new outfit for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner, and something to wear for shooting or horseback riding. As well as these changes on the day, the Queen also reveals a carefully-chosen outfit in her annual pre-recorded Christmas Day speech which is aired every year on December 25th at 3pm. But this year she opted to recycle one of her favourite outfits - a yellow dress by designer Angela Kelly which she wore to the wedding of her grandson William to Kate Middletonin March 2011. She again wore a brooch on her left shoulder but picked a different one for this occasion. Rather than plain diamonds, she opted for a flower bouquet containing diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The brooch was a present from her parents to celebrate the birth of Charles in 1948, which she wore at George's christening. During her speech, the queen paid tribute to family and milestones but also urged people to reflect on the last 12 months. Well-wishers: Queen Elizabeth II receives flowers from children as the Duchess of Cambridge, top, looks on after the Christmas Day service . Style Queen: The Queen changes her outfits at least five times on Christmas Day - for breakfast, lunch, tea, dinner and outdoor activities . She said: 'With so many distractions, it is easy to forget to pause and take stock.' Seated at a table decorated with pictures of her immediate family, the 87-year-old monarch touched on prominent events over the past year - from the service that marked the 60th anniversary of her coronation to the birth of George. The birth of a baby 'gives everyone the chance to contemplate the future with renewed happiness and hope,' she said. The queen's message - the latest in a royal tradition that began with a radio address by King George V in 1932 - also contemplated the role of the Commonwealth and looked ahead to the Commonwealth Games being held in Glasgow next year. The queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957. She writes the messages herself and the broadcasts mark a rare occasion on which the queen voices her own opinion without government consultation.

Arrested: Joseph Martino, 34, was charged with criminal posession of a weapon and reckless endangerment when police found about 40 explosive devices in his apartment . A New York man found with an arsenal of weapons in his apartment was arrested Thursday night after an explosion when he reportedly tried to dry materials for a pipe bomb in his oven. Joseph Martino, 34, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment when police found about 40 explosive devices and materials in his apartment, according to 13WHAM-TV. Police said bomb-making was just Martino's hobby. Police arrived at Martino's Springwater, N.Y., apartment shortly after 8 p.m. when neighbors called 911 upon hearing an explosion. Police said damage from the explosion was limited to Martino's oven, where he was trying to dry materials he intended to use to make a pipe bomb. Police believe Martino was manufacturing homemade explosives in several objects. 'Some were pipe bomb, but there were also pill bottles and large pill bottles. Anything that he could put an explosive in,' Livingston County Undersheriff James Szczesniak said, according to The Livingston County News. Szczesniak said the Sheriff's Office hadn't had much prior contact with Martino. 'We are still try to determine the reason behind the activity and the quantity,' he said. Explosion: Joseph Martino's neighbors on Mill Street called 911 after hearing an explosion. Police said the explosion originated in Martino's oven, where he was drying materials for a pipe bomb . Martino was being evicted from his apartment, 'but we have no indication he was trying to destroy the building', Szczesniak said according to the Associated Press. Police said the scene was not rendered safe until 1 p.m. Friday afternoon because of the explosive devices and ingredients they found in the apartment. Mill Street, where Martino's apartment is located, was closed off from traffic until 2:30 p.m. Friday. Residents of Martino's apartment building were evacuated along with six homes nearby. They were expected to return home Friday afternoon. Authorities detonated some of Martino's explosives in a secluded rural field in Springwater later on Friday because they were 'extremely volatile'.

In addition to the pipe bombs, explosive materials and firearms found in Martino's home, several jars of the chemical TATP were recovered at the scene, an official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives told WHAM. TATP is a form of acetone peroxide Martino could have purchased at a drugstore, though the chemical is also commonly associated with terror groups. Police don't believe Martino is affiliated with any groups, but they said they found more materials in another storage site in Livingston County. Martino has a criminal history, but it does not involve explosives and police would not give further details.

The rise of these super nannies was one of the issues tackled in ABC’s 20/20 episode on Friday entitled ‘The new help’. Nowadays top nannies can charge the earth, with some making the kind of salaries more typically associated with lawyers. Beverley Hills nanny: The rich and famous are experiencing a nanny crisis and the lack of talent is forcing up salaries .

Not only are these super nannies working for the super wealthy they are extremely well off themselves with million dollar mortgages, plus perks of the job including pass me down Prada dresses and ball gowns. Agency boss Jack Lippman revealed that a current trend is for nannies who are trilingual with Mandarin especially popular. He says he's even had requests for scuba-certified nannies before. In San Francisco Mormon nannies are very popular because concerned parents don’t have to worry about what they get up to outside of their job. One popular trend at the moment is for nannies who are trilingual with Mandarin especially popular . Lana Fuchs hired a nanny for her pet monkey, while Robin Williams married his son's nanny Marsha Garces . The agency claims it is struggling to meet demand from its demanding clients who only want the best for their precious children. A . common mistake that some budding nannies make is being too pretty for . the lady of the house who tends to have final say on who gets hired. Many . wives are concerned about hiring attractive nannies after infamous . high profile cases of affairs including Robin Williams married his son's nanny Marsha Garces in 1989 and Jude Law who admitted to an affair with his children's nanny and apologised to fiancee Sienna Miller.

When Nate Poupko moved his family to Santa Monica he and his wife knew very few people in the city. With three children under two-years old, the couple approached several local nanny agencies to find quality care. The parents despaired after time and again getting disappointing candidates. Many nannies lacked appropriate qualifications or credentials. 'I've had nannies ask for six figures and benefits. I was like, hell, I want that job,' said Popupko. While other product and services such as restaurants and contractors had online review sites, there was no such forum for nannies, so he launched Nannyreviews.com. The site has blossomed into an online forum that connects nannies and parents with a wealth of resources and reviews to make the relationship between nannies and families successful and rewarding. He finally found what he was looking for – a house keeper, two baby nurses and a nanny - but also has cameras in every room in his house so he and his wife can view what their nanny and baby nurses are up to reading several horror stories in the press about nannies abusing the children in their care.

As England’s cricketers prepared for a pre-Ashes match on Saturday, Australian captain Michael Clarke appeared on the big screen and told the crowd: ‘Remember to drink within your boundaries.’ But perhaps his advice would have been better directed at the professionals in the changing rooms. Just a few hours later, Australian batsman David Warner attacked England’s rising star Joe Root, 22, during a drunken scuffle in a Birmingham city centre bar after he took offence at the green and gold comedy wig he was wearing. England beat Australia in the competition’s opening match at Edgbaston – a warm-up before next month’s Ashes. Scroll down for video . Altercation: Australian David Warner, pictured left with partner Samantha Williams, has been dropped after an alleged fight with England's Joe Root, right . Night out: Both players were believed to be in this Walkabout bar in Birmingham on Saturday night . After enjoying the weekend sunshine and posing in town with fans, young  England players Root, Steve Finn and Stuart Broad  headed out to Walkabout – an Australian-themed bar. There they met Warner, who was out drinking with five of his Australian teammates. At about 2am, a ‘slaughtered’ Warner confronted members of the squad and CCTV footage shows him throwing a punch at Root, striking him in the chin with a ‘glancing blow’. Australian Clint McKay managed to drag Warner away, while England’s  Stuart Broad protectively put his arms around Root. Warner was apparently mortified when he woke up the next morning, phoning Root to apologise for overreacting. At the bar: Root poses with fan Adam Wilbourn during his night out at the Walkabout on Saturday . He later picked up the group’s bar tab to try to make amends for his outburst. Teacher Ashley Fox, 25, from Stourbridge, West Midlands, was at the bar on Saturday night. He said: ‘We were having a laugh with Stuart Broad and Joe Root on the dancefloor. ‘They were in good spirits and Root even bought me a drink. They seemed to be having a good time. Star: But opening batsman Warner could miss the Ashes after courting more controversy . ‘I saw it kicking off and a punch was . swung but it was just a bit of a glancing blow. The two teams had been . goading each other all night. 'I never expected it to boil over like it did. You would expect two professional teams to behave.’ Staff said Warner had been drinking at Walkabout in the evenings ever since the team arrived in Birmingham last week. A barman said: ‘On Thursday I was serving him Jagerbombs [shots of Jagermeister liqueur combined with Red Bull] and vodka Red Bulls. ‘He had quite a few. He was downing them on Saturday night as well. He was pretty slaughtered.’ Warner was dropped from the Australian . team after a crisis meeting yesterday morning. He now faces a . disciplinary hearing for bringing the game into disrepute with . ‘behaviour unbecoming to a representative player’. A spokesman for Cricket Australia . said: ‘Warner was allegedly involved in a physical altercation with an England player in the early hours of Sunday morning. ‘Team management have stood down Warner pending the outcome of the hearing.’ West Midlands Police said officers were not called to deal with the alleged assault.

Face-off: The alleged fight came after England beat Australia in a Champions Trophy game at Edgbaston . BODYLINE - THE ROW WHICH SPARKED A DIPLOMATIC CRISISEngland captain Douglas Jardine devised arguably the most controversial of all cricket tactics to combat the great batsman Donald Bradman during the Ashes series of 1932. His bowlers - in particular Harold Larwood - repeatedly bowled fast, short deliveries which bruised the Australian batsmen. The tactic sparked an international outcry and a row which reached governmental levels.

A teenager who was given painkillers and antacids after complaining of stomach pains died of bowel cancer just weeks after her misdiagnosis. Layla Watt, 19, visited her GP surgery at least five times in January and February of this year, but each time she saw a different doctor. Each one suspected she was suffering with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) until her final appointment in February when the GP said her symptoms required immediate attention. She died from bowel cancer that had spread to her liver in April. Layla Watt died aged just 19 because doctors failed to recognise that she was suffering with bowel cancer. She was repeatedly given painkillers and indigestion medication to relieve her symptoms . Layla, of Cleland, Lanarkshire in Scotland, started to complain of pains in her side and having a swollen stomach in January. She was seen by different GPs on four separate occasions at the Wishaw Health Centre and because Layla's mother and sister suffered with IBS, the doctors presumed her problems were symptomatic of the same condition. As the weeks went by Layla complained of extreme fatigue, loss of appetite and developed an intense thirst. She was offered routine blood tests but they were not classed as urgent. Her concerned mother Margaret, 56, eventually insisted on accompanying her on a visit to the surgery on February 19. The doctor who examined her said her symptoms required urgent treatment and she was immediately rushed to hospital where she was given a scan. Doctors discovered a tumour that had wrapped itself around her bowel. The cancer had also spread to her liver. Layla was transferred to Glasgow's Beatson Hospital and despite chemotherapy, her condition worsened and she passed away on April 30. 'Full of life': Her mother Margaret said that Layla (pictured age six, left, and age four in dance clothes) was a 'unique, bubbly and beautiful person' who as a teenager loved going out with friends and listening to music . Mrs Watt has opened up about how she held Layla's hand in her final moments just 10 weeks after she had been diagnosed with cancer. She said:  'Layla was a unique, bubbly and beautiful person. Being a typical teenager she loved music and going on with her friends. 'She was just so full of life and things were just starting for her, but in January this year she started complaining about feeling ill. 'She wouldn't be able to go out [with friends] because of a sore pain in her side. 'As . time wore on she went to the doctors again and again. She had been to . the doctors about four or five times, but each time she was prescribed . something different. Layla (pictured, right, in 2012 with her mother Margaret, left, and her sister Emma, centre) had initially been diagnosed with IBS but doctors eventually realised she was suffering from bowel cancer . 'She would never finish the course of the drugs and I was always on at her to take them. But she would say they were making her feel worse, not better. 'She lost her appetite and her stomach swelled up but we thought she was putting on a bit of weight. 'But on February 17 she was crying and saying she thought something was really wrong. 'She told me she thought she had cancer. I broke down in tears, but looking back it was almost as if she knew. Doctors eventually discovered that Layla had developed a tumour that had wrapped itself around her bowel. The cancer had also spread to her liver by the time she was diagnosed . 'Two days later I took her to the doctor again and insisted on going into the room with her. 'After a quick examination the doctor looked at me and told me she needed to get to hospital immediately.' Her father Bobby said: 'We were just speechless. This was our young, healthy teenage daughter who was so healthy and had everything to live for. The worse part of knowing the truth was knowing that Layla had to be told too. 'She was 19, an adult and she had a right, but we just wanted to save her. Layla (pictured left as a one-year-old with her sister Emma, then 14, and brother Bobby, then six) fought against the cancer but died on April 30 . Bowel cancer affects 40,000 Britons and kills 16,000 each year. Symptoms usually include abdominal pain, blood in the stool, unexplained constipation or diarrhoea and unexplained weight loss. It is the third most common cancer in the UK, but is the second most common in women. Around 72 per cent of cases occur in those aged over 65 but numbers of young people developing the disease are rising rapidly. The number of young people with bowel cancer has more than doubled in ten years. Obesity and lack of exercise are blamed for the 120 per cent rise in cases among under-30s between 1997 and 2006. Age, a low-fibre diet, being overweight, high alcohol intake, smoking and a family history of the disease increases your risk of developing disease. The disease is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Early detection and treatment usually results in a cure but late diagnosis only has a five year survival rate of 6 per cent. 'We didn't want her to be frightened. A doctor explained that without treatment she wouldn't survive. That day, our whole world just fell apart.' Layla remained in the Beatson Centre where she was treated and visited by her parents and her older sister Emma Haddow, 33, and brother Bobby, 25. But after just 10 weeks she lost her battle against the disease. Mrs Watt said: 'When Layla was admitted, we were just in such shock, even Layla was convinced she was going to get better. 'She even updated her Facebook status telling her friends that she did have cancer, but she would get better. 'But every day I watched my beautiful daughter grow weaker and weaker, I just felt so helpless, so useless. 'She . was in a single room because she was so sick and from then on, I . just slept in a chair beside her. Bobby was given a fold-down bed and . stayed with her every moment for her final month.

'We should have pushed more, went back to the doctors and insisted.' Doctors at the hospital told the family that they had never seen a case like Layla’s because she was so young. Bowel cancer is typically seen in older men but numbers of the deadly disease have risen by 120 per cent in the past ten years.

Layla would have liked it as all her friends did it.' A spokeswoman for Wishaw Health Centre said: 'This is a very tragic case and our thoughts are with Layla's family at this difficult time.

The most popular time for love-making was July and August meaning that 20 per cent more babies were born in March and April than in other months. As a consequence, most deaths among women of childbearing age also occurred in these months. A Roman mosaic depicting the flooding of the Nile from the 1st century BC. Researchers say beliefs about the impact of Nile floods on fertility may explain birth patterns in the region . Archaeologists working at a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis in Egypt excavated 765 graves and were able to establish the month of each person’s death because the graves were all pointed towards the rising sun. Live Science reported that they uncovered the graves of 124 babies that had died 18 to 45 weeks after conception – putting these two pieces of information together enabled the researchers to piece together the most popular time for love-making. The findings are particularly surprising because in other ancient Mediterranean cultures fewer babies are thought to have been conceived during the hot summer months because the heat lowered libido and possibly affected sperm count. It is thought that in ancient Egypt beliefs about fertility and the Nile flood may have been responsible for the baby booms. The residents of the Dakhleh Oasis believed that the river was the key to their land’s fertility and the floods occurred during the summer months meaning that there were widespread celebrations. The researchers believe that the peak in spring births continued until the 1920s or 30s.

Anxiety: Stress can cause a permanent genetic change to men's sperm and even alter how their offspring's brains develop (stock image) Stress can cause permanent damage to a man's sperm and even stunt his children's brain development, a new study has found. Researchers have discovered that suffering anxiety or depression as an adult, teenager or even as a child could cause a lasting genetic change in a man's sperm. Scientists conducting a study on mice found that sperm damage caused by stress leads to offspring developing a 'blunted reaction to stress' - a trait associated with several mental disorders. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say this is the first time a link has been found between stress-related diseases potentially being passed from a father to his children. Previous studies have concentrated on how environmental challenges - such as diet, drug abuse, and chronic stress - felt by mothers during pregnancy can affect their offspring's neurodevelopment and increase the risk of certain diseases. In this study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, male mice were exposed to six weeks of chronic stress, before breeding, either throughout puberty or only in adulthood. Examples of stress include suddenly being moved to another cage, being exposed to predator odour, noise or a foreign object in their cage. Male mice are ideal for such an experiment because they do not participate in offspring rearing, meaning any external factors outside of germ-cell formation are essentially eliminated. A team of researchers led by Professor Tracy Bale found that stress among male mice prompted a genetic change in their sperm that re-programmed a part of their offspring’s brain. They found that offspring from . paternal stress groups displayed significantly blunted levels of the . stress hormone corticosterone - in humans, it’s cortisol - in response . to stress. Professor Bale . said: 'It didn’t matter if dads were going through puberty or in . adulthood when stressed before they mated. We’ve shown here for the . first time that stress can produce long-term changes to sperm that . reprogram offspring brains. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania carried out a test on male mice - finding that their sperm underwent a genetic change after they were exposed to stress . 'These findings suggest one way in which paternal-stress exposure may be linked to such neuropsychiatric diseases.' But researchers also point out that a reduced physiological stress response may reflect some evolutionary benefit passed on to offspring to ensure survival in what is expected to be a more stressful environment. Professor Bale added: 'Whether such diminished stress reactivity would be detrimental or beneficial to offspring likely depends on the environment into which they were born, as well as genetic background factors.'","University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine conducted study on male mice .

An immigrant who killed a disabled jeweller during a burglary was on the run from a Polish prison, it emerged yesterday. Ireneusz Melaniuk, 28, beat Peter Avis, 66, around the face with an ashtray before stabbing him 13 times after breaking into his home. Mr Avis, who used a walking stick after suffering a brain aneurism, had no chance of defending himself and died of his injuries. Melaniuk had been serving time in his home country for robbery, but fled to Britain after being granted day release three years ago. Fugitive: Robber Ireneusz Melaniuk, left, was on the run from jail in Poland when he stabbed jeweller Peter Avis, right, after breaking in to the 66-year-old's Suffolk jewellery shop . It is understood Melaniuk could not be . found on a European watch-list, so British authorities would not have . known he was a wanted man. He evaded capture by using a variety of . aliases, and carried a fake passport to enter the UK. However, he had several distinguishing . features which would have made him stand out. The two middle fingers of . his right hand above the knuckles are missing, as is the thumb from the . same hand. He also has tattoos on his hands. After the murder in Bury St Edmunds, . Suffolk, the killer returned to Poland, where he was later arrested. Last night the UK Border Agency faced questions as to why it had no idea . that Melaniuk was a wanted man. 'Gentle' classic-car fan Mr Avis was found dead in his bed in the flat above his jewellery shop in Bury St Edmunds . Tragedy: Mr Avis was described as an 'old-fashioned jeweller' who relied on a walking stick and frame to get around after suffering a brain aneurysm more than 20 years ago . David Ruffley, MP for Bury St Edmunds, . said: ‘The first question we should ask is how did an escaped criminal . on the run from Poland not get picked up at the UK border? ‘This reminds us of the need to tighten our borders so that heinous crimes like this don’t happen on our doorsteps.’ 'Old-fashioned family business': The jewellery shop in Bury St Edmunds where Mr Avis was killed . Vicky Ford, MEP for the East of . England, added: ‘If you have relatively open borders, then you need to . have the ability to protect yourself from very dangerous people, which . means sharing information.’ Earlier this year Ipswich Crown Court heard . how Melaniuk and friend Aleksandra Karpiuk, 27, raided Mr Avis’s shop in . January. They broke into the flat above the . store and attacked him when he tried to confront them. He had lived on . his own since the death of his mother in 1989. Melaniuk was driven to Stansted . Airport by his accomplice and boarded a flight to Poland. The following . month Polish police tracked him down. He was extradited and in August he . admitted murder. EU citizens can freely live and work . in Britain, but can face deportation if they are still claiming state . hand-outs after three months. Melaniuk was thought to have been living a . nomadic lifestyle in Britain and did not have a regular job. The UK Border Agency said its officers . had no contact with Melaniuk once he passed through immigration . control. A spokesman said it was Poland’s responsibility to ensure . Britain is told when criminals could be entering the UK. Melaniuk also admitted burglary. Karpiuk, of Bury St Edmunds, was convicted of assisting an offender and . conspiracy to commit burglary. They will be sentenced later. Weapon: This knife was found on Melaniuk's person following his arrest in Poland .

A 45-year-old man told another man he was going to eat him before almost biting off his nose and leaving it hanging by a thread, a jury heard. Heath Bowden then took a ‘chunk’ out of his victim Graham Brook’s right ear before sinking his teeth into his left ear, Gloucester crown court was told. Julian Kesner, prosecuting, said: ‘Having bitten through [Mr Brook's] nose, he bit a large chunk out of his right ear and then started on the left ear when he was pulled away.’ Mr Bowden of Norbury Ave, Matson, Gloucester, has pleaded not guilty to inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on his victim, Graham Brook, in February 2012. He claims he acted in self defence. Mr Kesner, said that ‘he had lost his temper totally as a result of an argument inside the pub.' He added: ‘We say the attack was so ferocious that whoever started the fighting the defendant was not defending himself when he bit Mr Brook.’ The incident occurred outside the Pelican pub in St Mary’s Street, behind Gloucester Cathedral. Mr Brook and a friend had gone there for a drink in the early evening. Mr Bowden was one of a few other customers already in the pub, Mr Kesner said. According to Mr Brook, he was being abusive to other customers. Mr Brook, who was previously a pub landlord, tried to usher him out of the pub to avoid him causing further trouble. When he gave evidence, Mr Brook said Mr Bowden swore at him. He told the jury: ‘Obviously I was not impressed with being spoken to in that manner. I believe also that the landlady was not keen to serve him anymore. ‘I tried to politely, in a professional manner, ask the gentleman to leave the public house. The fight between the two men started in the Old Pelican pub (pictured) in Gloucester . ‘I said if he did then probably the landlady would not bar him. But he started using bad language again and then took a swing at me which caught my jaw.’ A fight broke out in the pub and carried on outside. The defendant walked away followed by Mr Brook who was concerned that he would come back to cause more trouble. After seeing the defendant leave, Mr Brook turned back to go back inside the pub. With his back turned, the defendant ran up behind him and knocked him to the ground, landing on top of him. Mr Brook said: ‘He jumped on me and pinned me down on the road with his knees on my hands. ‘He said, “Right, I’m going to f***ing eat you, you bast*rd.” ‘The first thing he did was chew the end of my nose off. He bit into it. He got the nose between his teeth and just kept biting and biting and biting until the nose came off, basically. ‘It was hanging into my mouth.’’ The trial is taking place at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured). Mr Bowden has denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent . Mr Brook continued: ‘He then bit my right ear. He kept pulling my head backwards and forwards off the road with my ear in his mouth until eventually my ear came off. ‘The pain was horrendous. ‘I was screaming “get this man off me, get this man off me.” I was covered in blood. After biting chunks out of his face, Mr Bowden was dragged off Mr Brook saying ‘that was nice’. The jury saw photographs of Mr Brook’s injuries which prosecutor Mr Kesner labelled ‘rather unpleasant’. They then heard that when Mr Bowden was arrested he walked past Mr Brook and said: ‘You smashed my f***ing face in.’ Mr Bowden added to police: ‘They attacked me and they got beaten up. All I did was bite the first person that came along.’ When police charged Mr Bowden with the assault he said: ‘I think I need help.’ The trial continues.","Fight broke out in a pub in the centre of Gloucester after Graham Brook tried to take man outside to avoid causing further trouble .

Ministers are prepared to let the French and German governments hold a stake in the UK’s largest defence company, it emerged yesterday. At the same time, the Coalition could accept Britain not having an effective stake in the firm to be created by the merger of BAE Systems and Franco-German aviation firm EADS. The two companies are expected to apply . for a two-week extension from the stock market today over their plans . for the £30billion merger. The red arrows: BAE Systems Hawk trainer jet fighters line up. BAE and EADS are expected to apply for a two-week extension from the stock market over their plans for the £30billion merger . But with investors in revolt over the deal, the Government admitted it is prepared to give ground to make it happen. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain could tolerate both Paris and Berlin owning 9 per cent of the new company. And senior Government sources said David Cameron was prepared to ‘hit the phones’ to thrash out a deal with French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. That will enrage the 45 Tory MPs who last week demanded the PM block the deal unless France and Germany sell all their shares. The backlash grew yesterday when BAE’s largest shareholder, Invesco Perpetual, denounced the deal. In a scathing attack, Invesco’s Neil Woodford said he had ‘significant reservations’ about the deal. His intervention adds to the  opposition to a merger that threatens up to 50,000 UK jobs. Still British: Royal Airforce Typhoon Eurofighter taxis out in front of Hawk T1 aircraft both produced by BAE Sytems.  Investors are in revolt over the deal . Invesco, which owns 13.3 per cent of . BAE, warned the company would be ‘driven more by political . considerations than shareholder value creation’. While Britain would . retain a so-called ‘golden share’ in the new firm, this will have no . monetary value and will only theoretically allow a veto on future . takeovers. The two companies have until tomorrow to alert the stock market to their detailed plans. But Mr Hammond said: ‘I don’t think there’s any chance of getting the deal done by Wednesday. ‘We will want to make sure that British jobs, British strategic interests, British defence interests are protected.’ An EADS refuelling aircraft lands at Farnborough Airshow.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said wants to protect British interests . The French and Germans are seeking to . maintain control of up to 13.5 per cent of the new firm. But Mr Hammond . said 9 per cent was the maximum the UK would tolerate. He said: ‘If the French government is . prepared to reduce its stake and dismantle arrangements that have given . it the ability to control the company, then with the addition of . safeguards, a national security agreement, safeguards about where the . company is headquartered, what the composition of the board will be, I . think it will be possible to put something together. ‘What we can’t have is this business going forward with the French or German state able to direct its activity. That would not be acceptable.’ A senior Cabinet minister also expressed doubts that a deal could be done with ‘meddling’ European politicians. He said: ‘For French and German politicians it is axiomatic that they should own shares in companies like this. ‘When you say we don’t think it is a role for governments to meddle in the running of these companies they look at you strangely. The problem is that they want a stake and the right to decide where things are built. ‘They don’t understand where we are coming from at all. They are where we were in the 1970s before the Thatcher government.’ The Government’s position puts it at odds with investors and MPs.

Michael Wyatt had no artistic skills until he had surgery to remove a benign tumour from his pituitary gland . An IT sales director who had a brain tumour says surgery to remove it has mysteriously turned him into an artist. Until six months ago, Michael Wyatt, 47, had no artistic skills, but he claims a brain tumour on his pituitary gland caused him to develop a creative flair. Mr Wyatt, from Wokingham, Berkshire, said that since waking up from surgery to remove the tumour in January, he has felt ‘compelled’ to draw, paint and share his artwork with the rest of the world. His prints were immediately sought after by a London design buyer who decided to print them on T-shirts to be sold in shops including Next. Mr Wyatt said he believes the pictures were his 'subconscious revealed to him while under anaesthetic' and added that it was the ‘good thing’ to come out of having the brain tumour. The married father-of-two said his journey from salesman to artist began in December, when he was talking to a friend at his gym about some health issues. After some internet research he thought he might have a low testosterone and made an appointment with his doctor who at first told him it was ‘extremely rare’. Mr Wyatt said: ‘But he sent off some blood for tests anyway and said I was right  - I did have low testosterone. I was sent me off for a MRI scan immediately. ‘They found a benign tumour on my pituitary gland and it was taken out within the week.’ While he was under anaesthetic, Mr Wyatt had vivid dreams which he believes were his subconscious being revealed to him. These visions now shape his artwork . His work has now been displayed and sold around the country and is to feature printed on tee-shirts. Mr Wyatt has also been given a clean bill of health . It was during his return to consciousness that he had the kaleidoscopic visions that inspired his artwork. ‘I had really, really vivid dreams like . going through a colourful tunnel. I didn’t think anything of it and had . to take five weeks off before going back to work, he recalls. ‘Then one night I couldn’t asleep and went downstairs and started drawing. ‘I drew for three hours and filled an A4 page and by the time I had finished, I had an A5 sized very detailed picture. ‘I showed some family and friends who really liked it and I feel compelled to show other people.’ Mr Wyatt is now exhibiting in his home town while still working in IT.","Michael Wyatt, 47, diagnosed with a benign tumour on his pituitary gland .

The man authorities say killed a Transportation Security Administration screener and wounded three other people during a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport last month pleaded not guilty on Thursday to murder and other felony charges in a case that could bring the death penalty. Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, who was wounded before his arrest, occasionally touched a bandage on his neck and spoke in a hoarse voice during a three-minute arraignment before a federal magistrate at the West Valley Detention Center east of Los Angeles where there is a medical facility. The diminutive defendant acknowledged his name in a near-whisper and that he had read his 11-count indictment. Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, is questioned today by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Bristow in this court sketch at West Valley Detention Center in California. He pleaded not guilty to murder . Trial was set for February 11 in a downtown Los Angeles federal court. Authorities say the unemployed motorcycle mechanic arrived at the airport's Terminal 3 on November 1 with the intention of killing TSA workers. Paul Anthony Ciancia, 23, pleaded not guilty to murder on Thursday over the fatal shooting of a TSA agent at LAX . Officials have said Ciancia had a grudge against the agency, but they have not indicated what prompted it. After entering the terminal, police say Ciancia pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and began spraying the area with gunfire as hundreds of people fled in terror. TSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez was killed. Two other uniformed TSA officers and a traveler were wounded. Hernandez, 39, became the first TSA officer to die in the line of duty. A coroner's report showed he was struck by a dozen bullets. Witnesses have said that after first shooting him the gunman returned to shoot again when he saw Hernandez move. Airport police arrested Ciancia following a gunfight in which they wounded him four times. An indictment accuses him of 'substantial planning and premeditation to cause the death of a person and to commit an act of terrorism'. Authorities say if convicted he could be sentenced to death. Ciancia is from Pennsville, New Jersey, and moved to Los Angeles in 2012. It was revealed earlier this month that federal agents are investigating the possibility that the alleged gunman believed in a conspiracy theory about a global takeover by the government.

Paul Ciancia, 23, moved to LA in 2012 from his native New Jersey . The . FBI were given a warrant in early November to search Paul Ciancia's . cell phone for materials reflecting his 'views on the legitimacy or . activities of the United States government, including the existence of a . plot to impose a New World Order,' according to court documents. Ciancia, an unemployed motorcycle . mechanic, got a ride to LAX on November 1, walked inside and began . targeting Transportation Security Administration officers, authorities . said. By the time LAX police officers subdued him with several gunshots, one TSA officer, Gerardo I. Hernandez, had been killed and two others were injured. A . note found in a bag after the shooting mentioned the 'NWO,' an apparent . reference to the new world order belief that holds an international . cabal of elites is planning to take away the guns and personal freedoms . of Americans, authorities said. Perceived . masterminds behind the conspiracy have shifted over several . generations, among them bankers, communists and the government itself. Why airport security officers apparently came to personify oppression . for the gunman remains unclear. The TSA does not regularly feature as a . target of the theory's ire, according to Mark Potok, who has studied . extremist groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. More . typically, believers focus on another homeland security agency, the . Federal Emergency Management Agency, which according to the theory plans . to build camps to detain resisters to the new order, Potok said. Potok said he has seen no evidence that Ciancia was personally involved in hate groups. The rant in his note also spoke of how . TSA searches were a violation of constitutional rights and a vulgar . term was used to refer to Janet Napolitano, the former secretary of the . Department of Homeland Security, which oversees TSA. Ciancia's family, from Pennsville, New Jersey, have offered sympathy to the family of the victim. In a statement, they also expressed their shock at the rampage and hope for the recovery of the surviving victims. A motive? They are investigating his ties to the belief in the New World Order - that a totalitarian regime will take away weapons and freedoms. Pictured, Los Angeles airport after the shooting .

A lawyer who posed as a wealthy investor to con two venture capitalists out of £250,000 has been jailed for six years. Gordon Manson, 48, from Edinburgh, used the cash in an attempt to negotiate the takeover of a business worth £19million. His scam was only foiled when the owner of the company mentioned the deal to a friend over drinks and was told Manson was a conman. Jailing him at the Old Bailey, Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London, told Manson: 'Your whole lifestyle has been self-centred and based on dishonesty and self-delusion.' He added: 'You gave every appearance that your . interest in that company was genuine, using professional advisers. 'Subsequently your true identity was discovered and you were arrested. ‘You were financing these activities . on the back of two loans from venture finance companies. This was . fraudulent from the outset and professionally planned.’ The Old Bailey heard Manson first made an approach to invest in Avanta, a serviced office company, in late 2010. Posing as Fraser Henderson, he claimed he was ‘cash rich’ with a portfolio of serviced offices outside London. In May 2012 he made another approach . to buy the business and met with the owner David Alberto at the Westbury . Hotel in Mayfair to discuss the deal. Manson claimed he ran a property . investment business and spent most of his time in Andorra and Madrid. He . also claimed that he had access to a £50million fund to invest, although prosecutor Antony Swift said there is not believed to be any truth to the claims. Mr Alberto spent £80,000 in professional fees relating to the deal before learning ‘Henderson’ was in fact a conman named Gordon Manson. In 2003, Manson, a qualified solicitor, was jailed for five years in 2003 after attempting a similar £17million fraud in Edinburgh. After the discovery, Mr Alberto contacted police and then arranged a meeting with Manson at an office in London so the fraudster could be arrested. Old Bailey Judge Brian Barker said Manson based his life on 'dishonesty and self-delusion' as he jailed him for six years . Manson later admitted that he had obtained loans worth £250,000 in order to finance the acquisition of Avanta, including £100,000 from Jeremy Keith and £150,000 from Zafir Rafiq. Both loans were backed by personal guarantees which had been falsified by Manson. Mr Swift said: ‘He used false documentation about his own financial worth and false accounts, all giving the impression he was a man of substance when he was in fact a man of straw. ‘His explanation was the deal could have worked and nobody would have lost anything. The Crown say that is simply untrue. ‘Clearly when a fraudster like the defendant is looking to buy a company like Avanta the risk is once he gets his foot in the door he will use its good standing in order to fleece them and line his pockets.’ Defence barrister Wayne Cleaver said all of the money had been spent on surveyors, lawyers and ‘other expenses’ and there was nothing left. Manson pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud by false representation. The judge sentenced him to 32 months for the Avanta fraud. He was also sentenced for 40 months for each of the bridging loan frauds to be served concurrently.","Gordon Manson scammed fortune before trying to takeover £19m business .

A mother whose 11-year-old son sneaked aboard a passenger jet then flew to Rome alone is furious after three airline staff were told they would all keep their jobs. Liam Corcoran jumped on a plane at Manchester Airport and travelled over 1,000 miles without a passport, cash or boarding pass. Three Jet2.com workers were suspended in the wake of the incident, and warned they could be dismissed while the airline reviewed procedures at all their British airports. But today it emerged the staff members had been told they will not lose their jobs and are back at work after being retrained. Jetsetter: Liam with his mother Mary Corcoran, who is furious that Jet2 staff have not been sacked after the 11-year-old sneaked on to a plane at Manchester Airport . Rome alone: Liam managed to get on to the plane even though he had no passport or boarding pass . Liam’s mother Mary Corcoran, 30, said: 'I’m disgusted with Jet2. Three months on and I have not even had so much as an apology. I still haven’t had a letter, any correspondence or anything. 'That would have been the bare minimum that I would have expected after my son got half way to Rome before anyone realised. 'It’s a disgrace that these people can be reinstated after what happened and that’s what I find hard to understand - this was a vulnerable child who was by himself. She added: 'I knew that the staff were being investigated and I was hoping that the outcome would be that someone would be held accountable and sacked for it. 'At the end of the day they let a child who was alone get through all the security and on to a flight heading to Rome. 'It’s a disgrace and I’m very angry that the staff have not been sacked and have only been re-trained. I think it’s outrageous and I still can’t get my head around it. 'They put my son’s life at risk by not doing their job properly and checking. Alarm bells should have been ringing. 'I really do dread to think what could have happened if he’d got out of Rome airport. I don’t think I would ever have seen him again.' Liam Corcoran-Fort said he climbed on to the Jet2 plane looking for a toilet after slipping away from his mother near to Manchester Airport . Liam from Newall Green, near Wyhenshawe, Manchester evaded five separate checks to board the plane at Terminal One after giving his mother the slip at a shopping centre near her her home. He was only noticed by staff after the aircraft had taken off, and he spent two hours in the airport in Rome as the plane's crew were quizzed by Italian authorities. Liam was brought back on the return flight and reunited with his mother. Mrs Corcoran added: 'Thousands of people pass through that airport and I thought that it was meant to be one of the top ones for security, especially because the Olympics were approaching and security was meant to have been upped. 'They could have let anyone through. 'They should have done a head check when people boarded the plane but that never happened. I’m glad that this procedure will be put back in place but it does not excuse what happened and that is what failed Liam. 'I’ve still not had any answers about how he ended up on the plane before he was spotted. I’d like to ask them how he got through without a passport and boarding pass.' She added: 'Thankfully I got my son back but it could have been much worse and I’d hate to think that it could happen to another child, especially if these people are still employed. Liam on a less jet-setting holiday: As a toddler riding on a donkey in Blackpool . 'Liam could have got all the way to Rome and I dread to think what could have happened, he could have ended up dead. 'He got through five security checks and when he got to the one where the body scanner is they just told him to put his hands out and he said they said ""off you go"". It’s unbelievable. 'He was not stopped by anyone official and there must have been hundreds of people passing through who were going on their holidays who didn’t stop him.' As part of its review Jet2.com reinstated a headcount of passengers on every flight after it emerged that crews did not routinely carry out the check and concluded that this was the main reason why Liam was not spotted sooner. The practice is not legally required by the Civil Aviation Authority - whose rules state the final check can be cabin crew checking boarding cards as passengers get on the plane from a walkway. A spokesman for Jet2.com said the incident had been ‘thoroughly investigated' and all staff involved had been retrained and were still employed by the airline. He added: 'Following a full and thorough investigation, revised procedures have been implemented. 'Head counts are now in place across each of our flights from all airports, including those where airbridges are in use, and additional staff training has been carried out across the business. 'We continue to liaise closely with Manchester Airport regarding security processes.' Aviation security expert Chris Yates said: 'The fact that the Department for Transport has not come forward with an investigation would suggest that the actions taken by Jet2.com are proportionate given the risk involved.'","Liam Corcoran sneaked away from his mother near Manchester Airport - and managed to board a plane without a passport or boarding card .

Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez drafted tanks soldiers wielding AK-47s into the streets yesterday as he won a historic third re-election after almost 14 years in office. The former tank commander increased security in capital Caracas amid fears violent protests might erupt at the end of a bitterly fought election campaign between him and challenger Henrique Capriles. Both camps had warned that the other was attempting to destabalise the country, sparking allegations of underhand tactics and vote-rigging from supporters of either side. Scroll down for video . Victory lap: Hugo Chavez waves a Venezuelan flag while speaking to supporters after receiving news of his reelection in Caracas . Celebration: A Chavez supporter revels in the streets after the vote in October . But in the end the polling booths remained mainly peaceful as Chavez clung on to power with 54 per cent of the vote. But despite his landmark victory, fears are growing for his ailing health which has been ravaged by cancer in recent months. While Chavez himself insists he has beaten the deadly disease after successive bouts of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment, palace insiders have claimed it is terminal. The decision marks the end of a bitter campaign in which the opposition . accused him of unfairly using Venezuela's oil wealth and his near total . control of state institutions to his advantage. But Capriles' promises to seriously address violent crime that has spun out of control, streamline a patronage-bloated bureaucracy and end rampant corruption proved inadequate against Chavez's charisma, well-oiled political machine and a legacy of putting Venezuela's poor first with generous social welfare programs. Chavez rallied thousands of supporters from a balcony of the presidential palace, holding up a sword that once belonged to 19th century independence hero Simon Bolivar. 'The revolution has triumphed!' Chavez told the crowd, saying his supporters 'voted for socialism.' The crowd responded chanting 'Chavez won't go!' Chavez will now have a freer hand to push for an even bigger state role in the economy and continue populist programs. Six more years: The win gives Chavez another term to cement his legacy and press more forcefully for a transition to socialism in the country with the world's largest proven oil reserve . Jumping for joy: Supporters of Hugo Chavez celebrate in the streets as the longtime president won re-election . He pledged before the vote to make a . stronger push for socialism in the next term. He's also likely to . further limit dissent and deepen friendships with U.S. rivals. A Capriles victory would have brought . a radical foreign policy shift including a halt to preferential oil . deals with allies such as Cuba, along with a loosening of state economic . controls and an increase in private investment. At many polling places, voters lined up two hours before polls opened at dawn. Good feeling: Chavez gestures to supporters after casting his vote during the election in Caracas . Capriles had united the opposition in . a contest between two camps that distrust each other so deeply there . are concerns whether a close election result will be respected. The stakes could not have been higher. Many Venezuelans were nervous about what might happen if the disputes erupt over the election's announced outcome. 'I'm . really tired of all this polarization,' said Lissette Garcia, a . 39-year-old clothes seller and Capriles supporter who voted Sunday in . the wealthy Caracas district of Las Mercedes. 'I want to reconnect with . all my friends who are ""Chavistas.""' Chavez's critics say the president has inflamed divisions by labeling his opponents 'fascists,' 'Yankees' and 'neo-Nazis,' while Chavez backers allege Capriles will halt generous government programs that assist the poor. During Chavez's final rally Thursday in Caracas, he shouted to the crowd: 'We're going to give the bourgeoisie a beating!' Violence . flared sporadically during the campaign, including shootings and . rock-throwing during rallies and political caravans. Two Capriles . supporters were shot dead in the western state of Barinas last . weekend. Troops were dispatched across Venezuela to guard thousands of voting centers Sunday. Chavez, who says he has emerged successfully from long treatment for cancer, held an impromptu news conference Saturday night, and when asked about the possibility of disputes over the vote, he said he expected both sides to accept the result. Revelry: Chavez supporters celebrate at the Miraflores presidential palace after Chavez's victory was announced . Sadness: Supporters of Venezuela opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski cry after finding out the election results . Voting: A woman talks on the phone as people line up to cast their vote at a polling station in Caracas . 'It's a mature, democratic country . where the institutions work, where we have one of the best electoral . systems in the world,' Chavez told reporters at the presidential palace. But . he also said he hoped no one would try to use the vote to play a . 'destabilizing game.' If they do, he said, 'we'll be alert to neutralize . them.' His opponents mounted a noisy protest in . Caracas and other major cities on Saturday night, beating pots and pans . from the windows of their homes to show displeasure with Chavez - and . also their hopes for change. Drivers on downtown streets honked horns, . joining the din. The 40-year-old Capriles, a wiry former governor affectionately called 'Skinny' by supporters, infused the opposition with new optimism and opinion polls pointed to him giving Chavez his closest election. Some recent polls gave Chavez a lead of about 10 percentage points, while others put the two candidates roughly even. 'Chavez is going to fight until his last breath. He doesn't know how to do anything else,' said Antonio Padron, a bank employee backing the president. Padron expressed optimism that the 58-year-old Chavez would win, noting the leader's survival of a fight with cancer that included surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

"By . Andrea Magrath . UPDATED: . 11:51 EST, 20 July 2011 . The former bodyguard suing Britney Spears for sexual harassment has made yet more unsavoury claims about his former employer. Fernando Flores launched a lawsuit in September claiming that Spears continuously exposed herself and attempted to lure him into bed during his time working for her from February to July 2010. Now the singer's lawyers have filed a motion to strike his latest allegations, saying his claims that the star, 29, had disgusting hygiene habits and used drugs are false. Allegations: The former bodyguard of Britney Spears has made new claims about the singer, saying she was on drugs and had terrible personal hygiene . 'He's a liar,' one of Spears' entourage allegedly told TMZ. 'Spears was generally personally unkempt' during Flores' time working for the singer, he claims in new court documents. Flores is seeking $10million for psychological damage suffered as a result of the 'unwanted' sexual advances he alleges. In court documents, obtained by star magazine and Radar Online, Flores outlines the reasons: 'She broke wind or picked her nose unselfconsciously and unapologetically before Plaintiff (Flores) and others and she was constantly and gratuitously loud and profane in her speech. True or false? Fernando Flores filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the singer in September, claiming she made continuous 'unwanted' sexual advances toward him . 'She did not bathe for days on end, did not use deodorant, did not brush her teeth, did not fix her hair, did not wear shoes or socks.' The documents also reveal his claims that Spears used drugs. 'Based on his former experience as a police officer, Plaintiff (Flores) is informed and believes and alleged thereon that Defendant Spears was often under the influence of illegal prescription and non-prescription drugs, such as Ritalin, Narcon (Naloxone) and methamphetamines,' it reads. In her motion to strike the latest lewd claims, Spears says Flores is simply trying to 'embellish on his tale of lewd and sensational allegations.' The claims 'contain a litany of insults toward Ms. Spears that are clearly designed to prejudice Ms. Spears in the eyes of the public and the Court.' Unsavoury: The former bodyguard claims Spears (pictured during his time . of employment in March 2010) 'did not shower for days, picked her nose . and broke wind unapologetically' Spears' spokesperson pointed out after the scandal originally broke that details of Flores' claims were leaked to the media before the lawsuit was even filed. ‘This lawsuit is another unfortunate situation where someone is trying to take advantage of the Spears family and make a name of himself,' they said at the time. ‘Ms. Spears and her attorneys have every expectation that this matter will be dismissed by the courts.’ Fernando's initial allegations about Britney's sexual appetite and treatment of her children came just as the singer was re-establishing herself as a serious artist after a tumultuous few years in her personal life. Damaging: In the lawsuit, it is alleged that Britney mistreated her sons Jayden James and Sean Preston, though the boys' father Kevin Federline has deemed them unfounded . Flores said he had been warned about Spears' behaviour on his first day of employment by other members of staff who he claims also suffered harassment. Court documents describe one alleged incident in which ‘She leaned over me and I noticed that her right breast was exposed. She looked me right in the eye like she was waiting for something.’ Flores alleges that on another occasion: ‘She [Britney] was wearing a white lace, see-through dress. She walked over close by [Flores], intentionally dropped her cigarette lighter on the floor, bent over to retrieve it and thereby exposed her uncovered genitals to [Flores]. ‘The incident caused [Flores] shock and disgust’. The suit goes on to claim that ‘in addition to exposing herself to [Flores], Spears engaged in numerous sex acts in front of [Flores].’ ‘Plaintiff perceived, during security . checks of the perimeter, Defendant loudly having sexual relations while . her two children were in the suite with her.’ On tour: Spears is in the middle of her Femme Fatale north American and European tour . According to Flores' claims, Britney . created fantasy personalities and some days wanted to be called ‘Queen . B’ while on others ‘Jennifer’. Amidst allegations that the singer hit her children, Flores also claimed she had a violent relationship with boyfriend Jason Trawick and claims to have witnessed the singer ‘savagely hitting’ her son with a belt. On another occasion, Britney allegedly made the children eat crab meat even though she knew they had serious fish allergies. When both kids started vomiting, Spears apparently wouldn’t allow anyone to intervene, saying, ‘Mind your own f***ing business!’ Spears' ex-husband Kevin Federline has supported Britney throughout, and after looking into the allegations has said the allegations are unfounded. Federline’s attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan said in September: ‘He is satisfied that the allegations are a product of economic motives.  They are as baseless as they seem.’ Britney is in the middle of her Femme Fatale north American tour, wrapping up in North Carolina on August 25. After a month break the singer will then embark on a European tour, playing dates in several countries including the UK, Russia, Sweden, Germany and France before the tour ends in November.

A father-of-three has been jailed for six years after he smuggled £160,000 worth of cocaine into the UK in pasties. Dane Hamilton, 33, was stopped and searched at Birmingham Airport after arriving on a flight from Jamaica on August 2 last year.

Mr Belhadj and his wife were seized in Malaysia in 2004 and flown to Tripoli on a CIA jet, which it is claimed flew via Diego Garcia, the British territory in the Indian Ocean.

One of Britain’s largest energy providers is preparing to raise prices during the depths of winter, it was feared last night. German-owned E.ON, which provides power to 5million households across the UK, has pledged not to increase tariffs before December 31. But consumer groups yesterday said they suspected the company was planning to introduce inflation-busting increases immediately after the deadline expires on January 1. Feeling the chill: Gas price rises could hit the most vulnerable, including the elderly and poor . This would lock families into paying higher rates to heat their homes just as the coldest months of the year start to bite. Industry insiders warn that it is inevitable that all of the major providers – British Gas, EDF, SSE, E.ON, Npower and Scottish Power – will increase prices either before or during winter. This would leave almost every family . in Britain facing higher tariffs at a time when household incomes are . being squeezed by soaring food prices and savings are being eaten away . by inflation. A sharp and . sudden rise in bills could push millions more into fuel poverty – where . they face the nightmare choice between heating and eating – while more . cash pours into the coffers of the energy companies. The . Big Six all faced criticism from consumer groups last autumn for . raising tariffs and then dropping them again in the spring. It now . appears the same pattern could be repeated this year – further . increasing  suspicions that UK energy providers act  as a cartel. Next week Southern Electric owner SSE . will increase rates by 9 per cent – the first company to raise tariffs . as winter approaches. British . Gas has also warned it may have to increase bills by an average of £130 . before winter – which would take the average family’s dual fuel bill to . a record high of around £1,400. Soaring prices: Consumer groups suspect German-owned E.ON is preparing to hike gas bills during the depths of winter . Only . last week a report from energy regulator Ofgem laid bare the UK’s . desperate energy needs and said the country could face 1970s-style . blackouts in three years. Experts said household bills will double by 2015 because of the energy shortages which are being heaped on the UK because of green laws passed by the EU. E.ON is currently the only firm which has promised not to increase rates during 2012 – a pledge it made in May to try and win over new customers. But the group, which last year bumped up its prices by 11 per cent for electricity and 18 per cent for gas, has so far refused to extend the guarantee into 2013. Consumer champion Martin Lewis, from Money Saving Expert, said he expected a rise early in January. ‘What usually happens, a very short time after the pledge ends, is the prices jump,’ he said. He said he was willing to bet that the group would raise bills or announce an increase in January. He . said that price guarantees, such as the one offered by E.ON, ‘give . customers a false sense of security, even more so if they encourage . people to switch to a provider offering one’. Mr . Lewis added: ‘The promise is “no price hikes this year”. So . technically, it could announce a hike in November to start on 1 January. January and February are the coldest months of the year, but the price . promise does not extend to then. ‘Most people who switch stay with that provider for years, so the few months of price holds is of limited impact.’ Warning: Other energy giants, including British Gas, could follow any rivals' price increases with its own hike . Under industry regulations, energy . companies need to give 30 days’ notice of price rises. This means the . earliest another rise could come into force is November. Mr Lewis called for every energy company to promise not to increase prices in the first six months of a customer contract. E.ON boasts on the front page of its website: ‘We stand by our promise not to increase home energy prices in 2012’. But a spokesman for the energy giant yesterday said: ‘Our price promise runs until the end of the year. ‘While we do everything we can to help our customers, we can’t guarantee that we will extend this. ‘We are not ruling anything in or out at the moment.’","German-owned E.ON could be planning an inflation-busting hike during winter for its five million UK customers .

A man who stabbed his noisy neighbour in the heart with a fish knife in a row over her eviction has been cleared of her murder. Paul Lyon, who is epileptic and has mental health problems, was found guilty of the manslaughter of 22-year-old Heather Dyer. He stabbed her outside the building they both lived in on Chapel Street, St Helens, on September 23 last year. Court: Paul Lyon, left, who is epileptic and has mental health problems, was found guilty of the manslaughter of 22-year-old Heather Dyer, right. He said he acted in self defence on September 23 last year . Prosecutors claimed he deliberately plunged the knife into her heart after being driven to distraction by loud music coming from parties in the flat above him.

Tourism numbers during the Olympics fell to their lowest summer level for almost ten years as travellers were put off by warnings of gridlock and chaos. Although the Government had boasted the Games would deliver a boost to retailers, restaurants and attractions, foreign visitors to the UK actually fell 5 per cent compared with 2011. The figures, by the Office for National Statistics, showed 3.03million tourists arrived in Britain in August – 176,000 less than the same time last year. Some of London's busiest roads, including Regent Street above, were deserted during the London Olympics . It was the lowest August number since . 2003, when Tony Blair’s government joined America in invading Iraq – . resulting in foreign tourism, particularly from the US, falling sharply. Taking July and August together, the . total number of tourists was 6.21million – a decrease of 358,000. The . figures follow complaints by business leaders during the Games that . overblown warnings of travel chaos had turned some key tourism sites . into ‘ghost towns’. At the time, photos taken outside . normally busy attractions such as the Tower of London and Oxford Street . showed the normal summer queues were absent. A survey of London restaurants also found takings were down by an average of 40 per cent. Tourism chiefs also pointed to the unusually wet summer as having put some visitors off. Despite this, then culture minister . Jeremy Hunt denied that businesses were suffering, saying: ‘This is absolute nonsense and we have just got to knock this on the head. Tourism bosses hope the millions worldwide who watched the Games, including the Paralympic closing ceremony above, will now consider holidaying in the UK . ‘Anyone who has a business anywhere in . London is frankly quids in. Some West End businesses have done . extremely well because they’ve marketed on the back of the Olympics. Some businesses have taken a hit, others are doing well, but overall . there is a big increase in business in the East of London.’ But Nick Varney, chief executive of . Merlin Entertainments, which runs the London Eye and Madame Tussauds, . and is the second-largest attractions operator in the world behind . Disney, said yesterday: ‘These figures make clear Jeremy Hunt had no . idea what he was talking about. ‘The Government’s warnings to stay . away from London worked all too well. The Olympics was a marvellous . opportunity to showcase what Britain has to offer. ‘Everyone involved in delivering the Games did a wonderful job. ‘But the country cannot be quids in . and cannot get a return on the £10billion it cost without a radical . change in its approach to tourism.’ The ONS figures also revealed that . while the number of foreign tourists fell in August, the amount they . spent increased by 9 per cent to £2.4billion. It is hoped the Games showcased venues across the country, including East London, Weymouth, and Eton Dorney, where Britain's Helen Glover and Heather Stanning won gold medal in the women's pair final . However, this was mainly due to  the cost of Olympics tickets rather than a rise in spending in shops, hotels and restaurants. Sport and Tourism Minister Hugh . Robertson said: ‘This summer put the UK firmly in the global spotlight, . allowing us to shape international perceptions and help deliver . long-term trade and tourism benefits. ‘The Olympics generated record tourist . spend, up 9 per cent on August last year, helping to boost the . country’s economy and giving us enormous confidence as we build on the . fantastic showcase of this summer. ‘And domestic tourism was also strong, with more than £760million spent on Olympics-related day trips. ‘We also know some tourists may not . have wanted to come during the Games, which is why we focused on . building a long-term tourism legacy.’","In August foreign visitor numbers were five per cent down on last year .

A rich retired accountant allegedly killed by a Russian prostitute at his £1million Surrey home was planning to ask her to marry him, a court has heard. Winston Fernandez, 69, wanted to propose to the vice girl now accused of his murder, Natalia Woolley, 38, as long as she gave up working as an escort, the jury was told. The evidence emerged at Guildford Crown Court when transcripts of a police interview after the defendant was arrested were read out in court. 'Alluring to all men': Natalia Woolley, 38, who described . herself on escort websites as 'incredibly sexy . and curvacious', is accused of killing 69-year-old Winston Fernandez - who wanted to marry her, a court heard . DC Adam Ramiz said that Russian-born Woolley, who worked for an escort agency using the names of Lenka and Alice, had performed sexual services for the alcoholic pensioner - and Fernandez had posted enthusiastic comments about her performance on a website. 'He was thinking about asking her to marry him but that she would have to stop being a call girl,' DC Ramiz said. Mr Fernandez had booked Woolley three times . previously via an escort agency and even wrote an online review praising . her ‘aesthetic curves’ after ‘eight amazing hours’. He . wrote: ‘All good – nay, outstanding. It is a pleasure to be with you . every time! I have been addicted to you, I will spend [a] lifetime with . you!!’ Praise: The court heard that Mr Fernandez had booked Woolley three times previously via an escort agency and even wrote an online review . The court heard how his impressions of the £600 a night prostitute changed on the day he died. Moments before violence erupted at his four bedroom detached home, he accused her of taking his money and not doing anything for him, jurors were told. Mr Fernandez is alleged to have told Woolley: 'I paid you the money and you didn’t do anything'. The crown court was told that when the defendant arrived at Mr. Fernandez’s home, she found him drunk and in a very weird mood and Fernandez swung a wine bottle at her. 'I tried to grab the wine bottle,' she said, adding 'He didn’t seem to know what he was doing'. She said he then grabbed a bottle of beer and tried to smash it over the table. 'What are you doing? Glass could get into my eyes and I could be blind for the rest of my life,' she said. 'I thought if he is doing this and doesn’t know what he is doing I had better leave. I was very scared, I said ""Open the door otherwise I shall shout and scream"".' She said she then went upstairs and he finally agreed to unlock the front door but then she alleged that Mr. Fernandez had grabbed her leg and tried to stop her escaping. She said she kicked him in his middle and stepped over the pensioner as he was on the ground but in the skuffle that followed she stumbled and her leg landed on his head. The defendant said she then left the house and walked to a nearby garage where she called a cab to take her back home to London. 'Sexy and curvaceous': The call girl - who plied her trade under the aliases Lenka and Alice - is alleged to have broken 17 of the old man's ribs and fractured the bones in his windpipe in the brutal assault before cutting his phone lines as she left . Scene: Woolley was convicted of the manslaughter of 69-year-old Winston Fernandez with her cowboy boots after he invited her to his £1million mansion (above) in Epsom, Surrey, for sex . Jurors heard previously she repeatedly kicked, punched and stamped on her client before cutting the telephone lines and leaving him for dead. Prosecutor William Saunders claimed Woolley repeatedly beat the pensioner and left him dead or dying with injuries all over his body, including 17 fractured ribs and two broken bones in his larynx. Mr Saunders added: ‘These injuries would have left him unable to move, in obvious pain, and of course he would have had difficulties in breathing as well.’ Mr Fernandez turned to drink and escort girls after the death of his wife Joan 12 years ago, Guildford Crown Court was told. Police found Mr Fernandez’s decomposing body slumped against his bed a month later – on February 13 – after a neighbour raised the alarm. Woolley was arrested on April 2 and when police raided her home they seized her cowboy boots among other items. She denies murder.

But at 25, the social worker was diagnosed with an eye cataract condition that doctors said could lead to complete blindness. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smoldering eyes: Amy Weiss, daughter of past life regressionist Dr. Brian Weiss, says her cataracts were healed after she regressed to when she was a Middle Ages hermit whose eyes were burned by angry villagers . ‘I remember thinking, “Why would I lose my sight, why do I have the eyes of an old man?”’ she explained in an episode of ‘Super Soul Sunday’ on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN Network. With the bad news weighing on her, Weiss decided to give past life regression another try. ‘I'll see if I can figure out the source of my cataracts,’ she recalls thinking as she attended one of her Yale Medical School educated father’s regression workshops. At least, she thought, ‘Maybe I'll have a good nap.' But as soon as her father instructed her to think back to the source of her cataracts, Weiss closed her eyes and says she was transported to another place and time. Scary diagnosis: Amy, a social worker, was 25 when she was diagnosed with potentially blinded cataracts but past life regression had never worked for her . Retrospection: Amy decided to attend one of her father's, right, workshops, hoping it would help her explore the source of her cataracts. 'Why do I have the eyes of an old man,' she wondered . ‘Immediately, I saw myself in the body of an old man with long white hair, living in the Middle Ages,’ she says. She was living alone in the hut far from a village. ‘Basically a hermit,’ she says. ‘But these townspeople thought I was a wizard and that I was doing evil.’ Weiss says she saw the villagers storm her hut and set fire to everything she owned. ‘And the fire burned my eyes. It blinded me,’ she says. ‘I could feel his pain.’ As she watched the atrocity play out before her, Weiss says her father then initiated the workshop’s next step, telling them to fast forward to the end of their previous body’s life and ask what that life meant. Weiss’ eerie message was 'Sadness clouds the eyes.’ Angry villagers: The regression worked and Amy was transported to a hut like this one, where she lived as an old man hermit until angry villagers burned it, along with her eyes . ‘For me,’ she says, ‘that had a double meaning, not just that I had been carrying the cataracts and the literal blindness from the past life, but I had been carrying that man's sadness in the present life too.’ Then, as if her past life regression weren’t miraculous enough, something truly astounding happened. Soon after the workshop, doctors told Weiss that her cataracts, had healed. Amy’s father, Dr. Weiss, told an equally amazing tale during his appearance on Winfrey’s spirituality show, billed as an ‘eye-opening and inspiring block of programming designed to help viewers awaken to their best selves and discover a deeper connection to the world around them.’ On the show, Dr Weiss recalled a day in 1980 he was using hypnotherapy to treat a woman for anxiety and depression. Miracle: With her father's help, Amy believes she was healed when her former self told her 'Sadness clouds the eyes' and her cataracts soon disappeared . The room became 'icy cold' as the patient began to channel messages from Dr. Weiss’ deceased family members - things she would not have known. 'And she didn't know anything about me. I didn't even have diplomas in my office. 'So she's telling me your father's here and your son...It was before the Internet, before you could Google your doctor.' The experience inspired Dr. Weiss to pursue a career path in past life regression. He now leads past life regression workshops and  seminars and experiential workshops, and training sessions for professionals. He is the best-selling author of 'Many Lives, Many Masters' about past lives. He also co-authored ‘Miracles Happen’ with daughter Amy, compilation of personal experiences of past life regression as sent to Dr. Weiss by people who’ve attended his seminars. Two of a kind: Amy's father Dr. Brian Weiss has written two books on past life regression, the most recent of which 'Miracles Happen,' he co-wrote with Amy .","Amy Weiss is the daughter of past life regression expert Dr. Brian Weiss .

The Royal family is the hardest working in Europe, with Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth topping a list of British and Scandinavian monarchs. An investigation into the number of working days in European royal houses found that the 65-year-old Prince of Wales is the hardest grafter with 189 working days, followed by the Queen with 181 days and the King of Sweden coming in third. Despite turning 92 this year, Prince Philip did more work this year than a majority of the younger royals, clocking up an impressive 120 working days. Like mother, like son: Prince Charles was the hardest worker among the royals families investigated with 189 days completed in 2013, followed by the Queen, who worked 181 days . The 92-year-old worked more days than both Crown Prince Haakon of Norway, aged 40, who worked 114 days and Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, 45, who managed a mere three months. The list has been compiled by Danish tabloid Ekstrabladet, based on the official calendars of members of the Scandinavian and British royal families between January 1 and December 16 this year. The British Royal family came out looking the best, with its older members all in the top ten - including Charles wife Camilla sharing the fifth spot with the King of Norway and the Queen of Denmark at with 124 working days. In terms of heir apparents, Prince Charles is way ahead of both Haakon of Norway and Frederik of Denmark as well as Sweden's Crown Princess Victoria, aged 36, who only worked 89 days this year. The low number of 'working days' by Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, is a natural result of the Prince's job in the miliraty service, Kate's pregnancy and their time off to care for Prince George. Dedicated: The Prince of Wales visit  meets pupils from Minchinhampton Primary School, Gloucestershire earlier this month . Age is just a number: Prince Philip, 92, clocked up more working days than a majority of younger members of royal houses in Scandinavia and Britain . Busy mum and dad: Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge became parents to Prince George in July . Others with less of an excuse are the Danish royals who were subjected to heavy criticism by Ekstrabladet as its heir apparent, Crown Prince Frederik, only managed 90 days of work compared to Prince Charles 189. 'I donâ€™t know of any other professions which is measured purely in visits and where you completely disregard days in the office. Being royal cannot be compared to a 9-5 job,' said Lene Balleby, chief of communication at the Danish court, told Ekstrabladet. 'The Swedish Royal family work in the office where both internal meetings and audiences both with individuals and organisations,' Ulrika NÃ¤sholm, royal secretary of information at the Swedish court, told Â­Aftonbladet.

The number of British families who spend more than half their disposable income on debt repayments could treble by 2018 if interest rates rise faster than predicted, a leading think tank has warned. Fearing that politicians are ignoring a looming crisis in household debt, think tank the Resolution Foundation has urged banks to start checking on debtors now, in case they are caught off guard when the cost of borrowing goes up. Some two million households could be driven to 'the edge of their means,' the think tank said. Household debt crisis: If interest rates rise faster than predicted, some two million British households who spend more than half their income on repayments could treble by 2018 . Chief executive Gavin Kelly said: ‘There . is huge uncertainty about income growth and interest rates but under . almost any plausible scenario there is going to be a big spike in the . next parliament. ‘We could well be talking about this issue as much as we are currently discussing wages or energy bills. As yet there is little sign of the political or financial establishment giving this the priority it deserves.’ The projections, based on figures from the Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) which show household debt rising faster than income, lay out several ways in which the number of people facing 'debt peril' might rise from 2011's total of 600,000. In a 'good growth scenario,’ where interest rates stay low and income grows evenly across rich and poor - something Resolution calls ‘a marked departure from recent experience’ - the number of people facing 'debt peril' would still almost double to 1.1 million. But if interest rates go up and growth is slow or unequal, that figure would hit two million, rising from 5 per cent to 9 per cent in the bottom fifth of the income curve. Matthew Whittaker, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ‘Even if we take a somewhat rosy view of how the economy will develop over the next few years the number of households severely exposed to debt looks as though it will double. ‘This is an alarming prospect, where a large number of families find themselves struggling with heavy debt commitments. ‘Even . small increases in the cost of borrowing could push a significant . number of families over the edge and it's most likely to happen to those . with the lowest incomes, who are already spending the biggest share of . their budget on repayments.’ Mr . Whittaker called the worst case scenario speculative but plausible, if . the government's Help To Buy scheme created a new housing bubble or . spending increased among the affluent only, interest rates would be . driven up without any accompanying recovery. In practice, the number would not . actually hit two million, he said. Instead, ‘a high number of people’ would simply default on their debts after a few months, possibly losing . their homes and ‘drop out of the statistics’. Big spenders: Most of the UK's household debt is composed of mortgages, with the rest taken up with credit cards, personal lending and payday loans . Most of the UK's household debt is composed of mortgages, with the rest taken up by credit cards, personal lending and payday loans. Since household consumption accounts for about 65 per cent of GDP, any drop in disposable income could have a huge effect on recovery. Mr Whittaker said: ‘In the worst case scenario you've got two million households in a position where they are struggling to make ends meet, which means you've got two million households that aren't contributing to any consumption. ‘Worse, many of the people who are most over-exposed from pre-crisis debt are concentrated in the hands of particular banks and building societies, who could find themselves in a precarious situation.’ Last year rent and mortgage arrears drove 5,000 people out of their homes, according to the Centre for Social Justice. The right-leaning think tank, founded by Iain Duncan Smith in 2004, said there was £1.4 trillion of personal debt in the UK with average household debt having doubled in a decade to £54,000.","Think tank Resolution Foundation is urging banks to check debtors now .

But rather than accept that she would not be visiting, the schoolgirl became so incensed with the government that she decided to write a heartfelt letter to the Prime Minister. Isobel Wyatt, aged nine, is pictured at her home in Coventry, with the letter she received back from David Cameron . Incensed: The youngster sent a hand-written note to 10 Downing Street pleading with Mr Cameron to rethink his stance on the pension issue so the Tooth Fairy could get back to work and take this tooth . In it she pleaded with him to rethink his stance so that the tooth fairy would be happier and could get back to her job. Isobel and her parents didn't think they would hear back from David Cameron but to their amazement, she received a reply this month. An aide thanked her for her query - but confessed the Government was in the dark when it came to plans for a tooth fairy strike. They wrote: 'I was pleased to read your well-written letter and your concerns about the tooth fairy. 'Unfortunately, I am unable to answer your question about possible industrial action.' Primary school pupil Isobel – who lives with her parents, two brothers and sister - said she had been showing off the prized letter to her friends. She said: 'When I got the letter I was stunned. I wrote in because I thought David Cameron would take away the Tooth Fairy's pension. In the post: Isobel did not think she would hear back from the PM after sending this letter .

'I wasn't expecting anything back because he is very busy. I've taken the letter into school to show my friends – they think it's really good.' Her mother, Miss Wyatt a University of Warwick nursery worker, said the 'little white lie' had spiralled. She said: 'Her dad said ""maybe they've gone on strike"".' 'After that she came and spoke to me and I said I thought I'd heard something about David Cameron cutting their pensions. That was when she decided to write the letter.' Isobel had been told that the Government had threatened to take away the fairy's pension, so in protest she refused to go to work . The mother-of-four said Isobel became determined to write after her father, assistant accommodations manager at Warwick University, told her of the tooth fairy strike in October. 'I left her to it and she asked me to get the address, which I did. 'I gave her a stamp and she posted the letter herself back in October and when we didn't hear anything for a while we assumed she'd hear nothing back. 'It wasn't until earlier this month we received a reply and Isobel got very excited when she saw the Downing Street postmark on the back of the envelope. 'She knew what it was straight away. She'd been very upset about the missed visit so she was really pleased to get a response.' Isobel finally received her £2 from her mother after she decided to donate her baby teeth to an art project she saw at a local gallery. Called Palaces, the installation aims to build a 'magical sculpture' out of donated baby teeth from children across the world. Miss Wyatt added: 'Isobel decided she wanted to donate her teeth to the project instead - she's saved a few up. 'We have an arrangement where she donates them and we give her the money instead. 'So she doesn't have to worry about the tooth fairy going on strike anymore.' In 2010, a six-year-old girl sent David Cameron £1 she had received from the tooth fairy because she wanted to 'make the country better and create jobs' after listening to a speech he had made.","Isobel Wyatt's parents told her the fairy had refused to go to work .

The author of a cry for help tucked into a box of Halloween decorations from China has come forward to tell the story behind his desperate letter. The letter about horrendous working conditions at a Chinese labour camp was found by Julie Keith, a mother of two in Portland, Oregon, stuffed between the styrofoam headstones of the Totally Ghoul decoration box sold at Kmart. The unsigned note began: 'Sir: If you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to the World Human Right Organization' Plea for help: The letter, pictured, came in a box of Halloween decorations purchased at Kmart . Inside Masanjia: - One of the 're-education' lessons, which takes up the rest of inmates time when they are not working producing goods for virtually no pay . 'Thousands people here who are under the persicution [sic] of the Chinese Communist Party Government will thank and remember you forever.' There was some doubt as to the letter's authenticity when it was uncovered in October, but now a former inmate at the Masanjia camp in Shenyang, has come forward as the author. Mr Zhang, a 47-year-old from Beijing who can only be identified by his surname for safety, said he secretly wrote 20 letters over two years at the camp. Barred from having pens and paper, Mr Zhang said he stole a set from a desk while cleaning a prison office one day. He stashed his notes inside products with English packaging, hoping they would make it to someone who could come to the workers' rescue. 'Over time I just gave up hope and forgot about them,' Mr Zhang said in an interview with the New York Times. Mr Zhang wrote that labourers are forced to work for 15 hours a day without time off on the weekends and holidays. Hidden: The letter was folded into eighths and hidden amongst the the Styrofoam headstones in the Totally Ghoul product, pictured . Investigation: Despite the letter, Kmart said in a statement that none of the company's forced labour rules had been broken . In broken English he continued: 'Otherwise, they will suffer torturement, beat and rude remark. [sic] Nearly no payment.' His plea said workers at the labour camp make only 10 yuan per month - the equivalent to $1.61. Labour camps house petty . criminals, religious offenders and government critics, who can receive four-year sentences without trial. China's re-education through labour system of punishment allows for detention without trial. Other workers from the Masanjia Labor Camp and various camps from around the country have been joined Mr Zhang in revealing the conditions there. 'Sometimes the guards would drag me around by my hair or apply electric batons to my skin for so long, the smell of burning flesh would fill the room,' Chen Shenchun, 55, told the New York Times. She was given a two-year sentence for pursuing unpaid wages she was owed from her job at a state-owned factory. Many of the inmates, like Ms Shenchun, are sent there for lodging persistent complaints against the government. 'I still canâ€™t forget the pleas and howling. That place is a living hell,' said Liu Hua, 51, who was imprisoned at Masanjia on three separate occasions. It is believed Mr Zhang was imprisoned as a follower of the Falun Gong religious movement, which the Chinese government banned in 1999. Roughly half of Masanjiaâ€™s population is made up of Falun Gong practitioners or other religious groups. Masanjia labor camp is located in the industrialised capital of the Liaoning Province in northeast China. Sir:If . you occasionally buy this product, please kindly resend this letter to . the World Human Right Organization. Thousands people here who are under . the persicution [sic] of the Chinese Communist Party Government will . thank and remember you forever.This product produced by Unit 8, Department 2, Mashanjla Labour Camp, Shen Young, Liaoning, China.People . who work here have to work 15 hours a day without Saturday (or) Sunday . break and any holidays, otherwise they will suffer torturement [sic], . beat and rude remark, nearly no payment (10 Yuan/one month).People . who work here suffer punishment 1-3 years averagelly [sic], but without . court sentence. Many of them are Falun Gong practitioners who are . totally innocent people. Only because they have different believe [sic] . to the CCPG, they often suffer more punishment than others. Other prisoners agreed that the worst abuse was directed at Falun Gong members who refused to renounce their faith. Alongside the production work there are hours of 're-education classes' involving endless repetition of camp rules or singing of patriotic songs while standing in the sun. People like Mr Zhang who speak out about the cruelty of the camps can often find themselves severely punished. Journalist and former New York Times photographer Du Bin, who released a documentary on the Masanjia camp featuring interviews with former inmates has been detained by security officials since May 31, according to his sister. Most of the products are made for use in China, but inmates say they also made coat linings labelled 'Made In Italy' and Christmas wreaths for South Korea, among other items for export. Amnesty International believes there are more than 300 of these camps. Julie Keith said that when she first opened the box with her daughters and found the note, she was sceptical. It was only when she looked the labour camp up online that she began to worry about the its author. The camp drew press attention again in April when Beijing-based Lens Magazine published accounts by former detainees, in which they described being shocked with electric batons, starved, and beaten. The magazine quoted the diary of Masanjia inmate Wang Guilan as saying the camp accepted pregnant women and disabled individuals, forcing them to work for up to 14 hours a day, or risk being beaten. In an interview with Radio Free Asia's Mandarin Service in January, Ms Guilan said that guards at the Masanjia women's camp chained detainees up and tortured them in hideous ways, including sexually. A Kmart spokesman, said in a statement that an internal investigation uncovered no violations of company rules that bar the use of forced labour. The Chinese Communist Party announced this year that it would end the practice by the end of 2013, but said there has been no further public detail.","American woman found plea for help in Halloween decorations she bought .

When lottery winner Gillian  Bayford decided to spend some of her £148 million windfall on a fleet of luxury Audis, she wound up  taking more than the high-end cars away from the dealership. For the mother of two has split from her husband and started a  new relationship with the man who sold her the vehicles. Alan Warnock has quit his job  with the dealership and set up home with the multi-millionairess, telling friends he is ‘very happy’ with his new circumstances. Gillian Bayford, 41 (left), who split from her husband Adrian last month after suffering stress from their lottery win, is now dating Alan Warnock (right) who sold her a collection of Audi cars after her win . Last month, Mrs Bayford, 41, announced her separation from  husband Adrian – who actually bought the winning EuroMillions ticket last summer – with the couple blaming the stresses that their massive jackpot brought for the collapse of their nine-year marriage. At the time, there was speculation about a relationship between Mrs Bayford and married gardener Chris Tovey, 40, who worked on  the 200-acre East Anglia estate the  couple bought with their winnings – although she strenuously denied rumours of an affair. In a further twist, Mr Tovey claims that Mr Bayford injured him in a golf buggy collision, and is suing  the couple. Gillian Bayford won £148million on the Euromillions jackpot with her husband Adrian in summer last year . After announcing their split,  Mrs Bayford, who was a healthcare worker at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, left their £6 million Georgian mansion and has now bought a new house in an exclusive estate on the outskirts of her original home town of Dundee. Mr Warnock is helping Mrs Bayford settle in. The pair were spotted Christmas shopping together and  he has been seen helping with her eight-year-old daughter and six-year-old son. Mr Bayford is aware of his estranged wife’s new relationship and it is understood they have reached an agreement to split the lottery fortune, one of the biggest ever won in Britain. When they went public with their win, they insisted they would not  let their fortune change them. But last month Mr Bayford, 43, confirmed: ‘Gillian and I have split. When you win the lottery it’s so stressful.’ At the time he insisted there was no one else involved, saying: ‘There’s never been anything like that at all.’ Last night a friend of Mr Warnock said: ‘Alan and Gillian are an item and are serious about each other. He sold her the cars she wanted after the big win and romance has blossomed since then.’ The couple met in October last year, soon after the £148 million win, when the Bayfords visited Gillian’s parents in Scotland. They went to the John Clark Audi dealership in Dundee, where Mr Warnock was sales manager, and ordered five luxury cars. Mr Bayford does not drive and the vehicles – three Q7 SUVs worth about £60,000 each and two Q5s worth around £40,000 each – were bought for Gillian, her parents, her brother and his girlfriend. At the time Mr Warnock was quoted as saying: ‘They’re a very down-to-earth couple – they’re very grounded and easy to deal with. ‘It was good fun to do business with them and the buzz around the place was fantastic.’ Speaking outside her new house with Mr Warnock by her side, Mrs Bayford told The Mail on Sunday she had ‘moved home’. After scooping one of the biggest Lottery prizes ever to be won in England the Bayford's vowed the money wouldn't change them . She did not deny she was in a relationship  with Mr Warnock but declined to comment on the matter. Her spokesman Simon Garrett said: ‘She will not be discussing her private life now or in the future.’ Mr Bayford’s best friend Richard Hudspith, 40, confirmed that Adrian was aware that his estranged wife was in a relationship with Mr Warnock and had a new home  in Scotland. He added: ‘Adrian is not going to comment about that. He is away at the moment anyway.’ Mr Bayford and Mr Hudspith used to run a shop together in Haverhill, Suffolk, selling musical instruments and second-hand CDs and DVDs, but they closed the business soon after the Bayfords’ win . After their marriage fell apart,  Mr Bayford moved out of the £6 million family mansion and into a more modest £500,000, four-bedroom house back in Haverhill, ten minutes away. The Bayfords are not the only EuroMillions winners to suffer marriage difficulties in recent weeks. Days after the couple made their announcement, Dave Dawes, 49, and wife Angela, 46, revealed their split two years after bagging £101 million. Earlier this month it was revealed that Les Scadding, 63, and wife Samantha, 42, who won £45.5 million in 2009, have divorced.","Gillian and Adrian Bayford won £148million on EuroMillions last year .

England football captain Steven Gerrard will face a court battle in London just weeks before the 2014 World Cup Finals, it has been revealed. The Liverpool player, his girlfriend Alex, and their mutual friend Lee McPartland are all listed as defendants in a civil case at the High Court. A man named as Paul Alan Lloyd is bringing the action, which is thought to relate to a fight in the street near the midfielder's home in August. Steven Gerrard has been named as a defendant in a case at London's High Court along with his wife Alex (right) and close friend Lee McPartland . While reports at the time said Gerrard had been assaulted and verbally abused before the attacker ran away, Lloyd is thought to be claiming damages because his version of events differs. An unnamed source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Steven and Alex are both huge icons in Liverpool – but there have always been people jealous of their success. 'The pair of them have had no option but to call in lawyers over this matter. It’s a case of conflicting ­explanations as to what happened that night. 'Mr Lloyd believes he has a good case. Steven and the other two might see things one way. But it is certainly not how Mr Lloyd is explaining away events.' The case will be an unwelcome distraction for manager Roy Hodgson as the team fly out to Brazil for the tournament which starts in June. Gerrard was left 'badly shaken' after the attack which happened as the star got out of his Range Rover in an upmarket village near to his luxury home. At the time the 32-year-old sportsman was said to have been alone, but now it appears that his wife and close friend were also in the area. Attack: The claim is thought to be for damages relating to a street fight in August close to Gerrard's home where he lives with his wife and their three daughters aged nine, seven and two . McPartland runs a runs a corporate hospitality company whose clients include Liverpool FC. Soon after the incident, a female police officer was arrested in an investigation into whether an attempt was made to obtain CCTV footage of the attack taken from a nearby shop. PC Helen Jones has now been charged with misconduct in a public office and is due to face a hearing on January 6. Gerrard, who has been a target in other incidents, was raised in the city's notorious Huyton area. Last September a fan scaled a perimeter wall at Liverpool’s training ground and yelled threats against his family. The man sped away on a bike shouting: 'I’ll kill you and your f****** kids.' In December 2007, masked raiders burst in and confronted 31-year-old Alex as the couple’s children slept. In 2001, both Steven and Alex faced death threats from members of Liverpool’s underworld. After Gerrard was said to have been chased by a local criminal through the streets of Liverpool in his car, steel gates 10ft high and state-of-the-art security cameras were put up at the footballer's £3million home. Liverpool Football Club and the player's agent refused to comment on the allegations.","Papers at London's High Court list Gerrard as a defendant .

Immigration officials at one airport stopped more than 300 such health tourists over two years . Hundreds of pregnant foreigners are flying to Britain just days before they give birth so that they can receive free healthcare courtesy of the NHS, a report has found. The women are duping airlines - who normally forbid expectant mothers more than 36 weeks pregnant to fly - so they can receive the free service. Expectant mothers trick airlines in their home countries into letting them fly by showing staff forged doctors notes which conceal the length of their pregnancies. Most of the women who arrive at NHS hospitals then have to be admitted and allowed to give birth, the report found, because their pregnancies were too advanced for them to fly home. The average cost of a birth with no complications and one night's stay in an NHS hospital is £1,092. Immigration officials at one airport stopped more than 300 such health tourists over two years, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The revelations follow a worrying report in October, that warned that foreign visitors and short-term migrants cost the NHS £2billion a year . It concluded the Health Service has ‘some of the most generous rules in the world’. And it even found evidence of relatives of migrants taking advantage of visits to Britain to have free treatment. The bill was put at between £1.9billion and £2billion  – with only around 16 per cent of the money clawed back. The . Government said it would be ‘impractical or inappropriate’ to charge in . full some patients, such as students or those with infectious diseases. The study estimated that £388million goes on foreign patients who should pay for their care but are never charged. The statistics emerged from an old document on government plans to deny foreigners with unpaid NHS bills entry to the UK . Though the majority of NHS treatments will incur a cost for foreign visitors or short-term migrants, there are a handful of circumstances whereby they receive care for free. According to the NHS website, these include: . Though, officially, pregnancy or maternity treatments are not free of charge, patients who arrive in A&E who are ready to give birth must be treated. Health tourists – those who specifically travel to the UK for treatment – cost up to £300million more. The . addition of foreigners to hospitals whose resources already struggle to . cope with an increasing number British patients is bad news to . over-stretched staff. A spokesman for the Royal College of . Nursing and Midwifery said: 'There is no doubt about the pressures on . midwives and maternity services due to the increasing birthrate, the . increasing complexity of births and the shortage of midwives in England. Though the College . insists midwives are there to treat any pregnant woman who presents . themselves in need of care, there are concerns surrounding the added . strain on staff. 'The RCM wants to ensure that England's maternity services have the right number of staff and right resources to offer all women the safest and highest quality care.' The statistics emerged from a 2010 document on government plans to deny foreigners with unpaid NHS bills entry to the UK. The . first comprehensive assessment of ‘health tourism’ says the true cost . to taxpayers is up to 100 times bigger than some estimates.","Foreign women flying in to the UK to give birth days before due date .

Two border officials sacked over their alleged links to Islamist terrorists are suing the Government at the European Court of Human Rights. Kashif Tariq was suspended by the Home Office because of his cousin’s involvement in a transatlantic bomb plot. Bilal Gulamhussein was taken off duty because he was accused of being a ‘close associate’ of alleged insurgents fighting British troops in Iraq during the British occupation. Kashif Tariq was suspended from the Home Office after his cousin was involved in a bomb plot . Bilal Gulamhussein was accused of being a 'close associate' of alleged insurgents fighting British troops . The pair had their security clearances revoked but Government  lawyers used controversial ‘secret courts’ rules to stop them seeing the key evidence against them. Now they are claiming their rights to fair hearings were breached and have launched proceedings against the UK. Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab, a former Foreign Office lawyer, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘These individuals have enjoyed a series of appeals under the British justice system. 'It is a perverse waste of UK taxpayers’ money for these cases now to join the Strasbourg merry-go-round.’ Mr Tariq, 34, worked in Ports-mouth removing illegal immigrants. He was suspended from his post on basic pay in 2006 when his brother and cousin were arrested ‘during a major counter-terrorism investigation into a suspected plot to mount a terrorist attack on transatlantic flights’. His brother was never charged but his cousin, Tanvir Hussain, was jailed for at least 32 years in 2009 for his role in the liquid bomb plot. There is no suggestion that Mr Tariq was involved in the terror cell. Later . that year he had his security clearance withdrawn due to fears that . terrorists would try to use him to help their plans. This prevented him . continuing in his post. It is unclear when he stopped receiving pay. Mr Tariq sought  damages, challenging the decision to suspend him. Jailed: Tanvir Hussain, the cousin of Mr Tariq, was involved in a plot to blow up aircraft . However, the Home Office refused to let him see all the evidence against him on the grounds of national security, and the employment tribunal agreed to hear his case in private, with Mr Tariq shut out when the secret material was being discussed. He challenged this ruling, but in July 2011 the UK’s most senior judge ruled that the secret sessions were lawful. Mr Gulamhussein, 46, worked as an admin assistant in the Home Office’s immigration service from 1999. In 2005 he was suspended, accused of ‘association with individuals suspected of involvement and support for terrorism overseas, in particular the insurgency in Iraq’. He appealed but his hearing relied on evidence heard in secret. His appeal was rejected in early 2011 and the Home Office later terminated his employment. The Strasbourg court is considering their case. Their solicitor Fraser Whitehead said they want to make secret courts fairer by giving more support to security-vetted lawyers acting for claimants. A Home Office spokesman declined to comment.","Kashif Tariq is the cousin of a convicted bomb plotter .

Showers of sparks exploding above the world-famous clock face were arranged by London Mayor Boris Johnson to welcome in the ‘Olympics Year’ in 2012 – and were considered so impressive that they were reinstalled last December. But in what has until now been a closely guarded secret, the £17,000 battery embarrassingly failed to detonate.

He claims during the 'unconventional' arrest one officer turned up the music while his colleagues physically and verbally assaulted him, in a manner designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him. Scroll down for video . The Metropolitan Police is being sued by a man who was in a car officers smashed with bats arresting him . Jonathan Billinghurst has claimed that he was called a 'black b*****d' as he was arrested in North London . An Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation found the police officers had used excessive force. But the Met Police claimed in its defence to Mr Billinghurst's claim that 'officers were permitted to use such force'. The High Court papers, which were filed in October, have emerged after the six officers failed to sue Channel 4 News for libel after the programme broadcast footage of the arrest. Specifically, the six claimed journalist Simon Israel had insinuated they misled the IPCC panel on evidence they had against Mr Billinghurst. But the case was thrown out of the High Court. The video showed the men shouting ‘attack, attack’ before running at the suspect's car, smashing the windows and windscreen and telling him to ‘get out of the car’ before pinning him to the ground. The arrest took place in 2008 - but the IPCC investigation was not completed until three years later. All of the officers, part of the now-disbanded Enfield Crime Squad, kept their jobs. But they have come under further . pressure now after Mr Billinghurst claimed one officer turned up the . music in his car as others assaulted him physically and verbally after . they had pinned him down on the side of the road. The . suspect, who was later jailed for two months following the arrest, . believed the officers were ‘muggers’ because most of them appeared to be . wearing plain clothes. He said the unconventional manner of the arrest was designed to 'punish, demoralise and humiliate' him. Mr Billinghurst has said he believed officers were 'muggers' because they were mostly dressed in plain clothes . In the video, police shout 'attack, attack' before running to the car and telling the suspect: 'Get out of the car' He also claims police failed to say . who they were. In its defence, the Metropolitan Police said officers . shouted ‘police, police’ and put a blue flashing siren on one of their . cars. They said Mr . Billinghurst ‘was informed that he was under arrest and the grounds of . arrest as soon as was practicable’ - though it does not specify when . this was. Mr Billinghurst has also claimed the officers took and failed to return his iPod, CDs and mobile phone. After . going to Edmonton Police Station, Mr Billinghurst was taken to North . Middlesex Hospital and treated for a cut on his face believed to have . been caused by flying glass. In . its defence, the Metropolitan Police said Mr Billinghurst was suspected . of driving a stolen car while disqualified from driving. Officers also . claimed that intelligence suggested he would be carrying a knife. Police have denied Mr Billinghurst's claim that they did not announce themselves as Met officers . The arrest took place in 2008 - and the IPCC judged officers had used excessive force at a hearing in 2011 . They said smashing the windows was being used as a valid ‘distraction technique’. The defence also questioned the likelihood that Mr Billinghurst could win the action because the incident took place five years ago. Police said the arrest took place on the same road Mr Billinghurst's twin brother had died while being pursued by police - although the suspect, who was in the car at the time, has denied police were involved. In 2011, Mr Billinghurst told Channel 4 News: ‘I personally believe that they may have thought that I have… I may have links or connections. 'It could have been - not pulling the racial card or anything – but it could have been that because I'm a male, I'm a black male, they could have thought that I…or I must know somebody in a gang, or I must know who stole the vehicle or where it came from, but they were mistaken.’ The Metropolitan Police confirmed the claim had been lodged, but said: 'It would be inappropriate to comment further.'","Six police officers ambushed Jonathan Billinghurst's Mini Cooper, smashing the windows with baseball bats .

Wolverhampton City Council have been accused of wasting money after sending leaflets to residents telling them how to dispose of wrapping paper . Council bosses have been accused of wasting money and paper after sending thousands of leaflets to families asking them to sift through their rubbish for every scrap of wrapping paper. The festive memo warns people Christmas wrapping paper cannot be re-cycled because it is too shiny. Wolverhampton City Council's team of binmen delivered 166,000 warning letters commanding residents to put their festive wrapping in the ordinary household waste bin. The council said binmen do not have time to check through people's Christmas leftovers, so homeowners must do the job for them. But residents claimed the move was a 'waste of money' accusing the 'cash-strapped' council of spending a fortune producing the 166,000 leaflets, and would act to create a new mountain of paper thrown in the bin. Council spokesman Gurdip Thandi said: 'Residents are advised not to put wrapping paper in recycling bins as it is often covered in shiny or metallic covering that affects the quality of paper produced in the recycling process. 'However, natural paper without such covering and cardboard rolls can be recycled.' Early this year - as part of a Â£70,000 communications budget - the council launched a smiling cartoon drinks can called 'Stan Can', informing residents to put the correct rubbish in the correct bin. It emerged that 'binspectors' were . leaving on average 300 bins a day in Wolverhampton on the roadside for . having the 'wrong' waste inside. Mother-of-one Samantha Rogers, aged 27, from Oxley, Wolverhampton called the Christmas wrapping paper directive 'ridiculous'. The council's team of binmen delivered the 166,000 leaflets to residents asking them to sift through their Christmas waste for every scrap of wrapping paper, to ensure it is not recycled. The council said the shiny paper causes problems with the recycling process. File picture . She said: 'The household waste bin isn't the biggest, and over Christmas you accumulate more rubbish so with wrapping paper going into that bin it's going to be full. 'People should be entitled to recycle wrapping paper. It's ridiculous. 'With the bin days all over the place at Christmas it's just asking for problems.' In an online blog another resident, calling themselves 'funny old world', said: 'Cash-strapped... I don't think so. 'They have sent out 166,000 leaflets and they will just go in the recycle bin, it's like throwing money away.' And a blogger called 'Thehoffsleftsock' added: 'So we can not recycle paper cos (sic) it costs money, so i will send out 166,000 leaflets?, that's saving money isn't it (sic).'

'But a traveler said he had noticed Gupta swallowing something and assumed it must have been the chain,' police said. Sampat Nirmal, senior inspector, told Time Of India: 'We initially conducted a regular X-ray but it didn't detect anything.

Tessa Jowell's hopes of ousting Boris Johnson as London Mayor were hit last night after a shocking foul-mouthed outburst by the former Cabinet Minister. In an extraordinary interview, the MP – who was made a dame last year and is known for her ‘mumsy image’ – used the word ‘f***’ four times in addition to ‘s***’, ‘a******e’ and ‘penis’. Her comments came in an interview with the Labour-supporting Guardian intended to promote her campaign to become Labour’s candidate in the 2016 London poll. Back together: Tessa Jowell (left) split with her husband David Mills (right), but they have since got back together. They now spend weekends in the Cotswolds, where Mr Mills lives, and weekdays in North London . But it backfired badly as The Guardian attacked her, calling her a ‘broken model’ and accusing her of faking emotion when she burst into tears. Dame Tessa’s tirade came as she was asked about her split from her husband, lawyer David Mills, who was prosecuted in Italy for allegedly accepting a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi when Jowell was a Minister. She always said she knew nothing about it and the couple separated, prompting claims they had done so to protect her career. 'Broken model': Dame Tessa was accused of faking emotion when she burst into tears during an interview with The Guardian . They have since got back together and she was subsequently honoured for her work on the London Olympics. Dame Tessa, 66, who is to stand down as MP for Dulwich in South London for the mayoral challenge, attacked the way she was treated by the press, saying: ‘Those a******es are so f****** rancid that I just hope every morning they wake up and think, ‘‘I’m ashamed of the job I do.’’ 'To say that somehow I got up one morning and thought, ‘‘You know what I’m going to do today, I think I’m going to separate from my husband?’’ F*** off. ‘There was a toerag who slept in his little white van outside my house for six days... and for five days I was intimidated. And then I was coming out to go to the gym at eight o’clock on a Saturday morning, and there he was with his f******, you know, penis-like lens, waving out of the window. I banged on the roof of his minivan and I said, ‘‘You f*** off out of here in ten minutes or I’m calling the police.”’ In a cruel put-down, interviewer Decca Aitkenhead says: ‘When she tells me she wants to discuss the “broken model of politics”, she knows what she is talking about. 'But I confess the broken model I keep seeing in my head when we meet isn’t the one Jowell is worried about.’ Ms Aitkenhead continues: ‘Within minutes she is telling me about the woman who made the fabulous dress she is wearing. Her manner is both animated and amazingly intimate and, as she talks about the issues that have meant most to her, her eyes well up so many times that I lose count. Shattered hopes: Dame Tessa's hopes of ousting Boris Johnson as London Mayor have been hit after the shocking foul-mouthed outburst. Above, Jowell is pictured with Mr Johnson at the Olympic Stadium in London . Allegations: The dame's tirade came as she was asked about her split from Mr Mills (left), who was prosecuted in Italy for allegedly accepting a bribe from Silvio Berlusconi (right) when Jowell was a Minister . ‘Essentially, she is describing everything you would want a politician to be – idealistic, dedicated, emotionally engaged. And yet I can’t stop thinking about The Thick Of It, or picturing the BBC satire’s spin doctor, Malcolm Tucker, telling Jowell what to say. ‘So when a chat about her dressmaker segues into a wider conversation about ethics, it sounds suspiciously like code for “I’m not dodgy.” ’ Dame Tessa and Mills now spend weekends at their country house in the Cotswolds, where he lives, and during the week he visits Jowell at her North London home. ‘But nothing will ever be the same,’ the MP said. ‘Of course all that s*** still affects us all.’ But she insists fear of further press scrutiny will not stop her trying to oust Mr Johnson. ‘I will not be cowed by what people in the press who don’t like my politics decide to do to me.’ One of Mr Johnson’s allies said last night: ‘If poor old Tess can’t stand the heat, she should get away from the Aga. Boris has been on the rough end of far worse from the feral beasts of the Fourth Estate over his private life – and has never whinged, let alone sworn like a trooper.’ Dame Tessa was unavailable for comment.","Dame Tessa made foul-mouthed outburst in interview with The Guardian .

The shocking incident began about 4.30am Wednesday when an officer tried to stop the vehicle the teen was driving near North Grand Peninsula Drive and England Parkway in Grand Prairie because of suspicious activity. Barbour sped away in the stolen 1997 Honda, leading officers on a high-speed pursuit. The armed teenager then dumped the car in a field, firing a stolen Glock 9-mm pistol at the officers as he ran into a wooded area, The Dallas Morning News reported. For about 10 hours, police officers, a K-9 unit and a police helicopter searched the area from Grand Peninsula to Lynn Creek Marina for Barbour, NBC 5 reported. About 2pm, police officers swarmed the 600 block of Seeton Road after residents reported suspicious activity. That's when cops cornered Barbour and the teen exchanged gunfire with officers. Two cops suffered bullet wounds, but their injuries were not life-threatening. Barbour was struck by gunfire before being rushed to Parkland Memorial Hospital where he died.

One in three UK residents will have an immigration background by the year 2060 according to new predictions by EU forecasters. Up to 30million people will be first or second generation immigrants in 45 years a new Brussels report has revealed, with net immigration expected to rise to 12million. The news comes as England was revealed as the second most crowded country in Europe, second only to Malta which is the EU's most densely populated member. One in three UK residents will have an immigration background in 2060 new EU figures have revealed . The estimates, produced by the statistics agency Eurostat, are compiled in a report titled 'Fewer, Older and Multicultural? Projections of The EU Populations by Foreign/National background'. It says: From the results it emerges that the European Union is going to experience unprecedented changes from the point of view of population composition. 'In a few decades, several countries will have to deal with relevant social changes. UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall described the findings as 'startling' 'The growing diversity of the European population could therefore be considered a major socio-demographic challenge for the current century.' The findings have been met with concern just days after visa restrictions for Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants were lifted. Deputy leader of the UK Independence Party, Paul Nuttall, said: 'These projections are startling and just go to show that unless the Government gets serious about immigration the UK is headed towards severe overcrowding within 50 years. The MEP told the Daily Express: 'With people living longer, public services would face an immense and I dare say unsustainable strain if we continue with loose borders.' 'Unless we want the very social fabric of the UK to change, we must leave the EU and take back control of our borders.' Britain has the fourth-fastest growing population in Europe, with the second highest birth rate after Ireland. By 2046, an estimated 494 people will be squeezed into every square kilometre of England compared with 411 now and only 374 when Tony Blair took power in 1997. The equivalent figure for France will be just 115, for Germany 204 and the Netherlands 421.","One in three UK residents will have immigration background in 45 years .

Greggs the baker is being forced to change the name of its best-selling Cornish pasty under new EU laws because the product contains peas and carrots. The new rules mean manufacturers must follow the traditional recipe of beef, potatoes, onions, swede and seasoning, if they wish to use the name. Despite being one of the company's most popular products, Greggs have announced they will change their version to the beef and vegetable pasty in alignment with restrictions. The baker is being forced to change the name of its product as, unlike in the traditional recipe, it contains carrots and peas . Cornish pasties were awarded PGI status in 2011 after a lengthy campaign by the Cornish Pasty Association to see their delicacy's name protected. Protected Geographical Indication status prevents anything that is made outside the designated region from using the traditional name. A Greggs spokesperson said this morning: 'Our great tasting Cornish pasties are available throughout the country, subject to customer demand. 'The name will change in 2014 because Cornish Pasties have achieved PGI status.' They also prohibit anything that does not follow the traditional recipe of meat (no less than 12.5 per cent) and the selected vegetables (no less than 25 per cent). Though Greggs planned to buy stock from . suppliers in Cornwall, the addition of extra vegetables to the recipe . prevent them from using the name. The baker is due to change the name of the pasty in the near future . Traditional pasties contain only beef, onion, swede and seasoning and are crimped on the sides . The company's website describes the product as a 'controversial' take on a West Country classic. Other food and drink products that were awarded Protected Geographical Indication status in 2011 are Champagne and Parma Ham, as well as 42 other British delicacies. PGI status is one of three European designations created to protect regional foods that have a specific quality, reputation or other characteristics attributable to that area.","Baker to change the product's name to 'beef and vegetable pasty'

As millions of Brits flock to the shops and spend hours - or sometimes minutes - labouring over the perfect gift for their loved one, it seems that their efforts may well be futile. A new survey has revealed that nearly half of us are preparing to fake a positive reaction to an unwanted gift in order to avoid upsetting a loved one's feelings this Christmas. From the 'long-suffering' to the 'faking it face', FEMAIL and body language expert Judi James are here to help you decipher the 12 telltale faces you could be witnessing on Christmas morning. Not impressed: If your woman pulls the 'disappointed face' (left) she is not happy; while the 'long-suffering' face (right) says 'thanks for the socks...the same pair you've bought me for the past ten years' Fuming: Only 0.4 per cent of people have witnessed the 'rage face' but it is the worst of the lot - and quite easy to spot . Judi showed over 2,000 . people photographs of the twelve faces and asked them to pick the . ones they recognised most when giving gifts to friends and family. The 'happy face' topped the list, with 64 per cent recognising it, followed by the 'love face' (37 per cent) and the 'curious face' (19 per cent). Other popular faces were the 'OMG face', the 'disappointed face' and the 'fake it' face. Win! Men, if your lady displays this 'happy face' it means she is delighted with her Christmas gift . What does her face say? The 'love face' (L), which is the second most popular face, means she adores her present, while the 'curious face' (R) means she is intrigued . Oh em gee! The 'OMG face' means she is shocked, but in a good way . The research found that, surprisingly, mum is the most likely person to be on the receiving end of the ‘fake’ smile, with nearly 1 in 5 people claiming she is responsible for the majority of unwanted Christmas gifts. Thankfully, amidst the faking, there will be genuine delight with almost two thirds of people claiming to see happy reactions from their gift giving efforts, and a third seeing a love face. However, it seems there is a degree of awkward uncertainty among some gift recipients with one in five claiming to have witnessed a curious face as the reaction to their gift. Judi explains: 'Being put on the spot to open a gift in front of friends and family can be a stressful situation, so it’s natural for people to ‘fake it’ in order not to hurt a loved one’s feelings. Not convinced: The 'faking it' face (L) is one to look out for this year, and the 'styling it out face' (R) probably means she doesn't take your gift seriously . Behind the smile: The 'guilty face' (L) and the 'suspicious face' are two to look out for this year . 'A lot of time and effort normally goes into buying Christmas gifts, so it’s probably the one time of year that a white lie is OK!'. But how can you truly tell if someone is delighted or not? Judi maintains that it’s all in the smile. 'When it comes to knowing whether someone is truly happy with their gift look closely; the smile is usually spread evenly across the face, with a subtle display of upper and lower teeth and the eyes are narrowed slightly into a crescent shaped eye-smile. 'On the other hand, when we perform a white lie, we are often guilty of over-acting; look for over the top wide eyes and a wide open mouth displaying upper and lower teeth with a hand on the chest,' she advises. So how do you ensure you don't get a ‘fake smile’? Men, take note. Here are the year's most unwanted Christmas gifts. Topping the list is bubble bath (37 per cent), ill-fitting clothes (29 per cent), ornaments (27 per cent) and perfume or aftershave that smell awful (24 per cent). Women are more likely to want to bin the bubble bath than men, with over a third (39 per cent) saying it’s the item they’d least like to receive, compared to only 18 per cent of men. For men its socks that are the most undesired Christmas gift with 27 per cent listing this as the top no-go gift, compared to only 10 per cent of women, found the survey by American Express Gift Cards.

Madame Elsa Schiaparelli, the legendary Italian fashion designer and a deadly rival of Coco Chanel, was at the heart of avant-garde ideas in 1930s Paris. Known for her friendship and collaborations with artistic icons including Salvador Dalí, Man Ray, Christian Bérard, Jean Cocteau, Alberto and Diego Giacometti, and Marcel Vertès, Schiaparelli was a key trendsetter within the contemporary scene. And now Christie's Parisian auction house is hosting a sale of some 180 items from her personal collection, a landmark sale for the international world of fashion, style and design, and one expected to fetch in the region of £710,000. The collection comes to the market in the new year having . passed by descent to Elsa Schiaparelli’s granddaughter, the actress . Marisa Schiaparelli Berenson. Comprising approximately 180 lots, this remarkable private collection features fashion - a dynamic combination of Elsa Schiaparelli's own designs alongside other much-loved ethnic costumes and personal pieces - furniture, fine art and decorative arts which, together, evoke the unique inspirational sensibility adored by so many. The star lots of the sale are a bronze Alberto Giacometti 1936 floor lamp modelled with the head of a young woman (estimate: £54,000-71,000) and a violet silk blouse, 1939, from Schiaparelli's Astrologie Collection (estimate: £23,000-27,000). With estimates for individual lots starting at £450, the collection is expected to realise in the region of £710,000. The sale includes two elegant 20th century Hammamet robes which directly influenced her designs, £900 - 1,800, left, and a violet silk blouse, 1939, from Schiaparelli's Astrologie Collection, £23,000-27,000, right . Marisa Schiaparelli Berenson, the granddaughter of Elsa Schiaparelli said: 'My grandmother was an inspiration and always has been, and now I think it's very important for younger generations to know who she was, to have a taste of that wonderful world that she lived in, that she created, that she left behind her. 'I'm very much one of those people who lives in the present - obviously the past is precious because of everything it means emotionally and because of the legacy one has oneself in one's genes and the culture and the richness that it’s brought to one's life, but I think that's all inside of me and there are certain things that I don't need to carry around all my life. 'There comes a time when you want to let go of things, because life changes. I think my grandmother's personal belongings will inspire future generations; this is an extraordinary and fascinating legacy.' An unusual yellow linen blouse from 1940, points to Elsa Schiaparelli's interest in porcelain, £9,000-13,000, left, and afurther highlight is an intricately beaded waistcoat with 'Bucking Bronco' beadwork, £9,000-11,000, right . Pat Frost, Director of Christie's Fashion Department commented: 'To have the opportunity of cataloguing the personal wardrobe of Elsa Schiaparelli is, quite simply, a privilege. 'Not only is the experience like meeting old friends known intimately from books and photographs - such as the Astrologie blouse - but it is also a peek into the home life of a design icon, where Chinese robes, Ottoman gowns and Persian jackets hung in large numbers in her wardrobe next to couture. 'Elsa Schiaparelli wore them informally but with a connoisseur's appreciation of their worth. Many elements indeed are interwoven into her own Couture collections. 'It has been an added pleasure to have been working with Marisa Schiaparelli Berenson, Schiaparelli's granddaughter, whose memories of life with her grandmother have been both invaluable and illuminating. 'We look forward to sharing this fascinating view into the world of Elsa Schiaparelli in January 2014.' Lots from the personal collection include photographic portraits and paintings of the Italian designer and various members of her family . A chic, lilac-upholstered 'love-seat' is estimated to go for £540-710 . COLLECTIONS FAVOURED BY THE STARS . Worn by icons of the Golden Age of Hollywood such as Marlene Dietrich, the 'Astrologie' collection really had nothing less than a cosmic impact on 1930s fashion. The violet silk blouse from 1939 (estimate: £23,000-27,000) is an example of the marriage of Schiaparelli's interest in the Zodiac with the very finest embroidery Lesage could produce. A further highlight is an intricately beaded waistcoat with ‘'Bucking Bronco' beadwork, inspired by Elsa Schiaparelli's influential 1940's trip to Texas and recalling her earlier Circus Collection (estimate: £9,000-11,000). An unusual yellow linen blouse, with beadwork and black and white floral trim, from 1940, points to Elsa Schiaparelli's interest in porcelain, which translated to her designs through the use of subtle colours, textures and embroidery (estimate: £9,000-13,000). Injecting feminine evening elegance with the drama of the Spanish matador, a pink wool bolero, with jet bead trim, also from 1940, shows yet more influences which Schiaparelli drew upon (estimate: £11,000-14,000). Pink and blue wool boleros, with jet bead . trim, also from 1940, show Schiaparelli's Spanish influence (estimates: estimate: £11,000-18,000 each) The sale also features a similar version of the bolero jacket in ice blue crêpe, a key Schiaparelli silhouette that was featured in a Harper's Bazaar fashion illustration at the time (estimate: £14,000-18,000). The two colour ways of these jackets matched her perfumes Shocking Pink and Sleeping Blue. Glamorous to the hilt, signature pieces from Elsa Schiaparelli's personal wardrobe include a 1930s white mink stole, with her monogram 'E.S' embroidered into the lining, alongside many other such luxuries from the time. In the 1930s, Elsa Schiaparelli built a house in Hammamet, Tunisia. She spent a lot of time there entertaining, collecting and absorbing local colour. The sale includes two elegant 20th century Hammamet robes which directly influenced her designs (estimate: £900-1,800). A true 'Renaissance Woman', Schiaparelli literally drew inspiration from around the globe. She wore and was inspired by Islamic and Asian costume and the sale features a large collection of oriental robes, together with an assortment of North African, Chinese, Ottoman and Persian costume. The Personal Collection of Elsa Schiaparelli presents a veritable feast of artworks and objects that reflect their owner's significant role as a taste-maker. A key trendsetter in the 1930s, Schiaparelli not only contributed her own lively creativity and sponsorship to the contemporary scene in Paris but also enjoyed plundering the past to create baroque counterpoints to the modern. The star lot of the sale is a bronze Alberto Giacometti 1936 floor lamp modelled with the head of a young woman (estimate: £54,000-71,000) This is evidenced in her love of such eclectic delights as baroque furniture, the French Second Empire style - witness the chic lilac-upholstered 'love-seat' (estimate: £540-710) - and blackamoor figures, which all reflect her wonderful sensibility for all that was extravagant and evocative. Schiaparelli used the pieces, collectively, to create an engaging world of fantasy - environments that reflected the influence of Surrealists who prized the imaginative and irrational. She became an inspiration to many, at a pivotal point in the interwoven stories of art and design. Modernist ideas were confronted with alternative sensibilities - neoromantic, exotic, fanciful, and indulgent. The 30s witnessed a succession of magnificent costume balls that, brought together Parisian high society and high bohemia, and Schiaparelli lived the part - adding the spice of her own eclectic eye and inspiration. This very personal collection captures the essence of Schiaparelli - imbuing all of the lots offered with a unique aura. The 1936 bronze Alberto Giacometti floor lamp which leads the sale as a whole is emblematic of Schiaparelli's world, reminding us of her close working rapport with designer-decorator Jean-Michel Frank, who helped create her boutique and her apartment and who encouraged Giacometti, Dalí and other artists, with whom Schiaparelli was also close, to create artifacts that were at once functional and expressive (estimate: £54,000-71,000). The collection ranges from an atmospheric portrait of Schiaparelli's daughter - Countess Maria Luisa Yvonne Radha de Wendt de Kerlor, better known as 'Gogo' Schiaparelli - by Leonor Fini (1908-1996), who collaborated with Schiaparelli, notably designing the bottle for her famous perfume Shocking in 1937 (estimate: £27,000-45,000); to a group of three Louis XVI chinoiserie wool Aubusson tapestries, after François Boucher (estimate: £18,000-27,000). A series of ten photographic portraits by Man Ray (1890-1976) includes the solarised study Elsa Schiaparelli, circa 1928-30, a favoured image chosen by Schiaparelli to illustrate her memoir, Shocking Life (estimate: £9,000-13,000). Man Ray is a telling artist to associate with Schiaparelli: a Dadaist and a Surrealist, he was also, like her, completely at ease straddling the worlds of commerce and pure creativity. Further highlights include a delightful Marcel Vertès screen, most likely created for the presentation of Schiaparelli's 1939 Spring-Summer 'Commedia dell'arte' collection (estimate: £9,000-13,000). This screen reminds us of the fluidity with which artists in Schiaparelli's circle were happy to work across media and invest their skill and imagination in all they created - be it an illustration, an object, a piece of furniture, or an environment. In 1954 Elsa Schiaparelli published her autobiography ""Shocking Life"", which contains a list of 12 commandments (or guidelines) for women.

Women with type 2 diabetes are three times as likely to have an early menopause, say researchers. A study by a team from the University of Cartagena in Colombia showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years, as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women. This means a woman’s natural supply of oestrogen runs out much earlier than would normally occur, raising the risk of a heart attack, stroke and bone disease in later life. Acceleration: The authors of the study say that women with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have an early menopause . In the UK, the average age of the menopause is 51 years, when women’s ovaries run out of eggs and they can no longer have children. The research published in the menopause journal Climacteric (must credit) comes increasing numbers of younger women are developing type 2 diabetes, the most common type. It is strongly linked to lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese, leading a sedentary lifestyle and eating an unhealthy diet. A team led by Dr Álvaro Monterrosa-Castro, of the University of Cartagena, Colombia questioned 6,079 women aged between 40 and 59 years from 11 Latin American countries about the menopause, depression and diabetes. They analysed their responses, taking into account factors such as weight, blood pressure and use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). The study found menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes. But in contrast, women under 45 who have type 2 diabetes have almost three times the risk of an early menopause. The study showed the average age of menopause in women with diabetes was 48.5 years, as opposed to 50.1 years in non-diabetic women, with almost one-third of diabetic women aged 40 to 44 having already experienced the menopause. Risks: Diabetes is associated with a range of other difficulties . The study also showed women classified as obese were 57 per cent more likely to have diabetes, and high blood pressure also increased the risk. In contrast to previous studies, the study found HRT increased the risk of diabetes by 14 per cent. Dr Monterrosa-Castro said ‘The study shows several things. Firstly, menopause itself does not increase the risk of diabetes, but conversely having type 2 diabetes triples the risk of an early menopause. ‘Secondly, the associations between diabetes and menopause can be complex, which reinforces the message that women approaching the menopause need to be treated as individuals, and evaluated according to their own general health, background and risk factors. ‘Diabetes is also associated with a generally poor quality of life, so we should encourage women to avoid risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as being overweight or having high blood pressure.’ He said previous research found HRT cuts the risk for diabetes, but genetic differences or lower doses of oestrogen in modern drugs may account for the study’s result. The study also found a mixed result for the association of alcohol with type 2 diabetes, with those women taking lower or moderate doses of alcohol having a reduced risk, whereas high alcohol intake was associated with a higher diabetes risk. Climacteric editor Dr Nick Panay said ‘Premature menopause can impair health and life expectancy if poorly managed. 'This study reinforces the importance of early diagnosis to detect and treat associated conditions such as diabetes, thus optimising short and long term wellbeing.’","Study found average menopause age for diabetics is 48.5 years .

This time last year Carolyn Whaymand received a very special gift, one that was not just for Christmas, but for life. When the 43-year-old solicitor, who suffers from the degenerative disease cystic fibrosis, was told her kidneys were failing doctors said her only chance of survival was a transplant. It was then that David, her devoted husband of 15 years, stepped in to save her. He put his own health at risk by offering one of his organs, incredibly for the second time. Thirteen years earlier, City accountant David, 40, had given a portion of one of his lungs to Carolyn in a pioneering operation that was hugely controversial because so many patients had died . during it. Gift of life: Husband David Whayland was a donor for his wife Carolyn's kidney transplant just before Christmas last year . The proceedure was so risky, it has since been . suspended in Britain and Carolyn is regarded as . something of a medical miracle because she is one of only four patients to have survived it. Doctors and transplant experts also say David is the only known case in which a living donor has given up two organs. Not only are the risks of such surgery considerable, doctors said it is highly unlikely for a husband to be . able to donate to his spouse, as finding a suitable match for a . transplant is notoriously difficult. Twelve months on the couple, of Ingatestone, Essex, have been trying to get her lives back together - and Carolyn has a special message of thanks to her husband. 'Dave . and I recovered well after the operation, we managed to get out just . before Christmas, although had to go to clinic regularly between . Christmas and New Year,' she said. 'If . there was a husband of the century then he would win the award as he is . truly marvellous but he would not admit to that. In sickness and in health: David and Carolyn were childhood sweethearts before marrying in 1997 . 'The . kidney worked well straight away, but I did have problems with water . infections so they removed the tube that links the bladder to the kidney . early and I was then fine. 'The . operation was more traumatic than we had anticipated, because we had . not realised how much you use your stomach muscles, however we managed . and as each week went by we improved. 'Dave . went back to work on a phased return after six weeks and I went back to . work on a phased return in March being back full time in May. 'Generally . things were going very well and I had a routine biopsy in May when that . showed that I had infection and possible rejection which caused a scare . and meant I had to go back on steroids and have much more frequent . check ups until it cleared. 'We . had planned a short holiday so it was nail biting to know if we would . be able to go, but we did go to Portugal for a week and had a nice . break.  This made us feel like we were finally back to our normal lives. 'Things have been going well since and we went to Crete for a two week break in September for Dave’s 40th birthday. ' World class treatment: Carolyn received her transplant at Hammersmith Hospital in West London . About 1,000 people in the UK give up a . kidney for a friend or loved one every year. The Human Tissue . Authority, which regulates all donations by living people, must decide . who is suitable. Volunteers must prove they are in robust health and understand what the lengthy, physically arduous process will involve. There can be a 12-week recovery period, and a one-in-3,000 risk of dying while having a kidney removed. David, along with four members of . Carolyn's family, including her father and brother, volunteered to be . tested to see if they could donate. Unusually, David turned out to be a good match and Carolyn's cousin also offered a section of his lung. 'Having . a kidney transplant is nowhere near as serious as a lung transplant, . but from the patient perspective it is more complicated. With my lungs, I . know how they are on a daily basis, I can be wheezy or chesty and I . take the necessary medication. 'They . don’t mind what I eat or drink and providing I do not let myself get . cold and do a bit of exercise then they work well and look after me.  It . is much easier to tell if they are not working properly and I can sort . it out. 'With the . kidney, you have to make sure you drink two to 2.5 litres every day, be . careful with what tablets you take or anything you put into your body as . it could go through the kidney and you don’t want to damage it. 'Unless you have signs of a water infection early, by the time you get symptoms it is already taken a hold. 'So that makes me more conscience of everything and not able to completely forget that I have had a transplant. 'That . being said, I am much better in myself.  I am able to have a life, . work, do my hobbies, to the housework, go out etc,, which I could not do . when my kidney was failing. 'Both . employers have been extremely supportive, and my work have been . particularly good given the number of clinic appointments I have had to . attend over the year. 'I . am now down to once a month at the renal clinic which makes things a . lot easier. The staff at the renal clinic are outstanding. 'All . the nurses and doctors work so hard, people are always moaning about . the NHS but the staff at Hammersmith, Harefield and the Royal Brompton . as outstanding.'

Life-threatening: Lewis Smith, 12, thought he was concussed after knocking his head in a football match. But two weeks later, doctors discovered a life-threatening brain disease . A 12-year-old boy who knocked his head during a football match had part of his skull preserved in his stomach as doctors operated on a life-threatening infection in his brain. Lewis Smith thought he was concussed when, two weeks after a match with friends, his headache was only getting worse. But half-way through a family holiday in Cornwall, the pain was crippling, his forehead swelled, and his parents rushed him to hospital. To their horror, doctors discovered his brain was swelling up with a severe sinus infection. Lewis was rushed into the theatre for an emergency six-hour operation to open his skull and remove the disease. And in a bid to avoid any risk of worsening, they kept the severed bone clean by depositing it in his stomach. It meant his brain was able to swell without pressurising the skull, which would have rendered him unconscious. The bone remained in his stomach for two months before eventually being replaced the day before his 13th birthday. His mother, Nicki, 44, said: 'It was so scary. 'We were none the wiser about Lewis' condition until we set off on holiday and I noticed his forehead had started to swell up. 'He had suffered a knock on the head playing football a couple of weeks before, so we thought it might have been related to that. 'When it began to cover his right eye, giving him ongoing headaches, we visited two hospitals but both indicated it might be mild concussion. 'It was all such a sudden shock to us. One moment we were on holiday, the next our son was being taken into an operating theatre - it was a complete nightmare.' Lewis first developed a temperature and headache while on holiday with his family in Cornwall in August. Concerned, his parents Nicki and Danny, also 44, cut the holiday short and returned home. For fear of worsening the infection, doctors did not want to replace his skull with titanium after opened it up. So they deposited the severed bone in his stomach for two months before putting it back in . They took Lewis to the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire, for a CT scan. Doctors discovered it was not concussion but a severe sinus infection, which was spreading across his brain and eyes. He was immediately taken to nearby Southampton Children's Hospital for surgery. Lewis was suffering from common sinusitis - inflammation of small cavities behind the cheekbone and forehead. In most cases it can be cleared with over-the-counter medication or antibiotics. We couldn't risk the possibility of raised pressure in his skull as it would cause him to become unconscious so we had to remove a section of the skull and put it in the abdomen . - Chrissy Ward, neurosurgical nurse . But in around one in 10,000 cases, bacteria can spread to the eye, surrounding bone, blood or the brain and prove fatal unless treated quickly. The 12-year-old was showing signs of fever and sepsis as well as swelling of the brain. Advanced paediatric neurosurgical nurse practitioner Chrissy Ward said: 'When anyone has an infection to the brain it is very serious. 'The antibiotics must be strong enough to penetrate the blood brain barrier and kill it off. 'But, in addition to treating Lewis's infection, we had to contend with the swelling on his brain. 'We couldn't risk the possibility of raised pressure in his skull as it would cause him to become unconscious. 'Therefore, the neurosurgeons had to perform a craniectomy - removal of a section of the skull - to allow his brain to swell without pressurising the skull. 'They then cut open the stomach, clean up the bone to remove any infection and put it into the subcuaneous abdominal tissue, where the bone is preserved. 'They have to either do that with the bone or throw it away and replace it with titanium. He was on holiday in Cornwall when his parents took him hospital, where he was rushed into six-hour surgery . 'Replacing it with bone is more preferable and there is less risk of infection.' Lewis had the bone replaced the day before his 13th birthday in November. The youngster must now wait for the removed piece of bone and the rest of his skull to completely fuse together. But it means no contact sports for the teenager, who plays football and rugby, until the new year. Nicki said: 'He is sports mad and is itching to get back to football again. 'We just have to keep reminding him that he isn't quite ready yet. 'But he should be able to join for the new season in September. 'He can't wait.' The family have since raised 1,615 pounds for the hospital through fundraising events, including a sponsored football match. Mrs Smith said: 'This has been a real rollercoaster for the family and a very long recovery for Lewis. 'But he's doing really well and we are so grateful to the teams at both hospitals for what they did for him.' Mr Aabir Chakraborty, a consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at Southampton Children's Hospital, added: 'Sinusitis with secondary infection in the brain is a life-threatening condition that requires swift treatment. 'Lewis received this swift treatment from a number of specialist teams, including children's neurosurgery, ear, nose and throat and infectious diseases, and I am delighted he has made such a good recovery.'","Lewis Smith had a crippling headache two weeks after playing with friends .

An artificial heart has been transplanted into a patient for the first time in medical history, it was announced today. French medics said that a male patient was awake and responding well following Wednesday’s ground-breaking operation at the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris. Marcello Conviti, head of the Carmat biomedical firm, said: ‘We are delighted with this first implant, although it is premature to draw conclusions given that a single implant has been performed and that we are in the early postoperative phase.' Surgeons in France have transplanted the first ever artificial heart, pictured, successfully into a patient . French Social Affairs and Health Minister Marisol Touraine, left, and Alain Carpentier, surgeon and Carmat co-founder attend a news conference at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris . Mr Conviti said the artificial heart, which is three times the weight of a real one, would beat for at least five years. Heart-assistance devices have frequently been used for patients waiting for transplants, but the new bioprosthetic device will replace the real heart . It will help thousands of people who are die each year while waiting for a donor, including many in Britain. Surgeon Alain Carpentier said: ‘It's about giving patients a normal social life with the least dependence on medication as possible. ‘We’ve already seen these types of device of this type but they had a relatively low autonomy. This heart will allow for more movement and less clotting. The study that is starting is being very closely watched in the medical field.’ ‘This news brings great pride to France,’ said the Marisol Touraine, French health minister .’It shows we are pioneers in healthcare, that we can invent, that we can carry an innovation that will also bring great hope to plenty of people.’ In 2005 surgeons in France performed the first face transplant, and they are always trying to push back research frontiers. The male patient is said to be awake and responding well following the operation at the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris . Developed by a team of engineers from Airbus parent company EADS, the artificial heart weighs 2 lb - almost three times as much as an average healthy human heart. It is expected to cost around £150,000 if it is made widely available. The device mimics heart muscle contractions and contains sensors that adapt the blood flow to the patient's moves. The artificial heart is powered by external, wearable lithium-ion batteries. Inside the heart, surfaces that come into contact with human blood are made partly from bovine tissue instead of synthetic materials such as plastic that can cause blood clots. Heart failure affects more men than women, and the size of the artificial heart means it can fit in 86 percent of men but only around 20 percent of women. But Carmat says it can manufacture a smaller version to fit the smaller bodies of women as well as patients in India and China. The artifical organ replicates the heart muscles contractions to push blood around the body . Heart failure is when the organ is no longer able to pump blood around the body. It is commonly caused by coronary artery diseases and hypertension. Almost half of patients die within a year of first being hospitalised with the condition. For those suffering the most severe form of heart failure a transplant is the only option. But only around 4,000 hearts are available around the world each year - compared with around 100,000 people on the transplant list. Research into the artificial heart began in the US in 1963. It is a device which replaces the heart. It works by replicating the heart muscle to beat blood around the body, supplying other organs. In the past patients have had artificial hearts implanted as temporary measures, to bridge the gap until a live donor can be found.","Male patient is responding well following the ground-breaking operation at the Georges Pompidou Hospital in Paris .

They took action after concerns that a rising number of councils have been making the installation of CCTV a legal condition of granting licences to pubs. Under the new regime, local authorities will be subject to a stricter code of practice designed to strike a better balance between privacy and security. Ministers took action after concerns that a rising number of councils have been making the installation of CCTV a legal condition of granting licences to pubs . The change comes after the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s privacy watchdog, said that it was becoming seriously concerned by the profusion of CCTV even in trouble-free pubs. Surveillance camera systems are widely used in England and Wales, but community pubs minister Brandon Lewis said things had gone too far. He said the principle of surveillance by consent is at the heart of the new legislation, so the public can be confident that cameras are not there to spy on them but to protect them. He has laid a new code of practice before Parliament for approval, as part of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012. Mr Lewis said: ‘CCTV has a role to play in stopping and deterring crime in anti-social behaviour hotspots. Under the new regime, local authorities will be subject to a stricter code of practice designed to strike a better balance between privacy and security for drinkers . 'But well-run pubs that don’t have a public order problem shouldn’t be tarred with the same brush. ‘The public deserves to have a pint in peace without being snooped on. This government has called time on big brother’s secret, intrusive and costly rules that have forced pub landlords to pay to install CCTV where it was not needed. ‘The use of surveillance cameras should be used only if it is necessary and where it has public support.’ Last night Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘People should be able to enjoy a quiet pint without being constantly recorded on camera. ‘This announcement brings some long overdue common sense to a situation where councils were driving up the cost of a pint by demanding pubs spend thousands of pounds on CCTV where there are no problems to deal with. ‘Our privacy is too important to be undermined by a tick-box on a licensing form. ‘I’m sure landlords across the  country will join me in raising a  glass to Brandon Lewis for defending people’s local pubs from needless surveillance cameras.’","Councils will have to strike a better balance between privacy and security .

The first thing you notice as Charlotte Nott rides the tricyle she found under the Christmas tree is the sheer delight on her face. It’s only at second glance that her battle to do the things other children take for granted becomes apparent. Charlotte, five, beat incredible odds to survive meningitis almost three years ago. Scroll down for video . Triumph: Charlotte Nott, who lost both legs and arms after contracting meningitis, riding her tricycle Christmas present . But doctors had to amputate her arms and legs below the elbow and knees during her fight for life. After her ordeal there was no way she could ride the bike her parents, Jenny and Alex, had bought for her around the time she became ill. Only a month before she was rushed to hospital, the schoolgirl had fallen in love with a bike and Jenny, 32, and Alex, 32, had secretly bought it, hoping to surprise their oldest daughter on Christmas day. Full-time mum Jenny, who is now separated from Alex, said: ‘Charlotte had never had a proper bike of her own before she became ill. ‘But she’d fallen in love with cycling after being given a little tricycle by her cousin. She used to spend hours on it, pedalling for miles and miles. Strong support: After £400 was raised through a fund to help her through life after the 2011 operation, Charlotte is able to ride her very own first bike, specially made to her measurements, that works with her new prosthetic legs . ‘Before Christmas we took her on a . shopping trip and she set her heart on a little bike she spotted in one . of the shops. It was lovely – blue with yellow flowers and bees on it. ‘As . soon as she got on it she was zooming off all over the shop. She loved . it so much we couldn’t get her to leave. In the end we had to carry her . out kicking and screaming. ‘Alex and I bought it secretly and couldn’t wait to give it to her. We were probably more excited than her that year. ‘But we didn’t get the chance because Charlotte was rushed to hospital and she didn’t come out again until January.’ Charlotte had been a normal, healthy two-year-old before meningococcal septicaemia struck. Two weeks before Christmas Day 2011, Jenny discovered the purple marks associated with the infection on Charlotte’s chest and she was rushed to nearby John Radcliffe hospital. Within hours, the little girl suffered multiple-organ failure and doctors were fighting to save her life. As the infection spread, Charlotte developed gangrene from septicaemia and medics were forced to amputate her limbs in January 2011. Jenny said: ‘It’s hard to recall everything that happened because I was in shock. It was like I was on another planet. ‘One thing that I do remember doing is going to pick up Charlotte’s bike from the shop and taking it to the hospital on Christmas day. Joy: Charlotte Nott opening her Christmas tricycle last week at home in Oxford . Start of a dream: Charlotte Nott riding a tricycle during National Paralympic Day in London, England . ‘We got permission from the doctors to put it by her bed in intensive care. It was absolutely heartbreaking. ‘Charlotte was barely conscious and wasn’t really aware it was there - it was more for us. We wanted to see her with her present.’ Charlotte left hospital in January and, since then, she has shown incredible courage adapting to life as a quadruple amputee. But she has never been able ride the bike she had fallen in love with that Christmas three years ago. Jenny said: ‘Charlotte tried desperately hard to ride the bike. She would spend an hour just trying to cycle three metres. ‘It was incredibly difficult for her – no matter how much effort she put in, she struggled to turn the pedals with her prosthetic legs. ‘It was one of her biggest frustrations, but she was determined. She added: ‘In the years since, she has asked for a bike every Christmas and every birthday. It’s the only thing she really wanted. ‘We looked everywhere and Charlotte tried out so many bikes but nothing seemed to work. There was almost a point when I did feel like we’d have to give up.’ After years of searching, Charlotte’s dreams were finally answered this August when the family attended National Paralympic Day in London and Charlotte’s eyes fell on three-wheeled bike, made by Pashley. Jenny said: “The last thing we looked at was the bike area, which was run by Bikeworks. Support: Charlotte's mother Jenny, 32, was able to give her daughter the 'trike' thanks to her fund . “They were packing up for the day but we asked if Charlotte could have a go on a three-wheeler that she had spotted. “The next thing you know, she’s on the bike and she’s cycling up and down like there’s no tomorrow. “It was absolutely incredible. We’d waited so long but we’d finally found a bike that was the right fit for Charlotte.” After doing some research online, Jenny discovered a Pashley stockist close to her home. Using £400 raised through Charlotte’s trust fund, she was able to buy a three-wheeler that was custom made to her daughter’s measurements. Incredibly, she even managed to convince Pashley to break with tradition and make the bike pink – Charlotte’s favourite colour. The design was completed just in time to be wrapped and placed under the tree for Christmas. And today Charlotte can’t hide her delight as she zooms along the cycle path close to her home, turning the pedals with her brand new sparkly silver legs, which were also made just in time for Christmas by Dorset Orthopaedic. Jenny said: “Charlotte has waited so long and she’s been so patient so it was so incredible to be able to finally give her her first bike this Christmas. “The look on her face when she’s riding it is just pure delight. It’s so heart-warming to see. “It really has cheered us all up too.

Nasa’s Cassini probe has provided some holidays treats from the outer solar system just in time for Christmas. The bus-sized orbiter has unveiled new images of Saturn and two of its most fascinating moons, Titan and Enceladus, taken earlier this year. Saturn resembles an ornament in one image, with a jet stream swirling at its north pole along with a hurricane-like storm. The globe of Saturn resembles a holiday ornament in a wide-angle image overlooking its north pole, bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there . Cassini . also peered through the hazy atmosphere of Saturn's largest moon, . Titan, revealing hydrocarbon lakes. Two views of Enceladus are included and highlight the many fissures, fractures and ridges that decorate the icy moon's surface. Enceladus is a white, glittering snowball of a moon, now famous for the nearly 100 springs, also known as geysers, that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space. Most of these particles fall back to the surface as snow. Some small fraction escapes the gravity of Enceladus and makes its way into orbit around Saturn, forming the planet's extensive and diffuse E ring. A dynamic interplay between Saturn's largest moon, Titan, and its rings is captured in this view from Nasa's Cassini spacecraft. Titan's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of Earth . Winter is approaching in the southern hemisphere of Saturn and with this cold season has come the familiar blue hue that was present in the northern winter hemisphere at the start of the Cassini mission . Launched in 1997, Cassini has been exploring Saturn and its series of moons since 2004. On Saturn, a full year is the equivalent to 30 Earth years, meaning Cassini has only been able to observe a third of a Saturn year. Since 2004, Saturn and its moons have seen the seasons change from northern winter to northern summer. Cassini has studied the planet and its many natural satellites since arriving there in 2004, also observing Jupiter, the heliosphere, and testing the theory of relativity. Cassini is the fourth space probe to visit Saturn and the first to enter orbit, and its mission is on going as of 2013. Because scientists believe these geysers are directly connected to a subsurface, salty, organic-rich, liquid-water reservoir, Enceladus is home to one of the most accessible extraterrestrial habitable zones in the solar system. Along with Saturn and Enceladus is a group of natural-colour images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, highlighting two of Titan's most outstanding features. Peering through the moon's hazy, orange atmosphere, the Cassini narrow-angle camera spots dark, splotchy features in the polar regions of the moon. These features are the lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane for which the moon is renowned. Titan is the only other place in the solar system that we know has stable liquids on its surface, though in Titan's case, the liquids are ethane and methane rather than water. At Titan's south pole, a swirling high-altitude vortex stands out distinctly against the darkness of the moon's un-illuminated atmosphere. Using a special spectral filter, the high-resolution camera aboard the Cassini spacecraft was able to peer through the hazy atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan . A still and partially sunlit Enceladus is pictured here. Enceladus is a white, glittering snowball of a moon, now famous for the nearly 100 springs, also known as geysers, that are spread across its south polar region and spout tiny icy particles into space . Titan's hazy atmosphere and surface environment are believed to be similar in certain respects to the early atmosphere of Earth. But the planet that towers over these moons is a celestial wonder itself. The north and south poles of Saturn are highlighted and appear drastically different from each other, as seen in new natural-color views. The globe of Saturn resembles a holiday ornament in a wide-angle image overlooking its north pole, bringing into view the hexagonal jet stream and rapidly spinning polar vortex that reside there. And the planet's south pole, now in winter, looking very different than the springtime north, displays brilliant blue hues, reminiscent of a frosty winter wonderland. Saturn's moon Enceladus, covered in snow and ice, resembles a perfectly packed snowball in this image . ‘Until Cassini arrived at Saturn, we didn't know about the hydrocarbon lakes of Titan, the active drama of Enceladus' jets, and the intricate patterns at Saturn's poles,’ said Linda Spilker, the Cassini project scientist. ‘Spectacular images like these highlight that Cassini has given us the gift of knowledge, which we have been so excited to share with everyone.’ Launched in 1997, Cassini has explored the Saturn system for more than nine years. Nasa plans to continue the mission through 2017, with the anticipation of much more incredible science and imagery to come. Saturn's largest and second largest moons, Titan and Rhea, appear to be stacked on top of each other in this true-color scene from the Cassini spacecraft .","The images were taken earlier this year by the bus-sized orbiter .

Midwives will test women at antenatal appointments and those with high carbon monoxide readings will be given advice on how to quit smoking under the NICE guidelines . Mothers and midwives responded angrily last night to guidelines which will pressure all pregnant women to take breath tests to check if they have told the truth about smoking. In proposals due to come into force this year, midwives will be told to test mothers’ carbon monoxide levels at their first antenatal appointment. This will reveal if they are being honest about whether they smoke, with those found to have high readings given ‘appropriate support’ on how to quit. It follows concerns that while up to one-fifth of women smoke during  pregnancy, many feel too embarrassed to admit it to their doctor or midwife and miss out on help to quit. But mothers were furious at the change, proposed by health watchdog NICE, with members of website Mumsnet branding the plans ‘utter meddlesome nonsense’ and ‘intrusive nannying’. One member said: ‘I think this is  outrageous – why aren’t pregnant women being trusted to tell the truth?’ Another commented: ‘Really terrible idea. Women are not just baby incubators once they’re pregnant.’ Although the tests will not be compulsory, mothers may feel obliged to take them after being asked to do so in hospital. Last night midwives made it clear that the guidelines are unhelpful, saying having to carry out tests could undermine the trust between them and their patients. Louise Silverton, director of midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘It is a bit draconian. ‘They are asking us to test each pregnant woman for carbon  monoxide on their very first visit. ‘It is not allowing women to say no or midwives to use their judgment. And it puts pressure on the first visit when a lot of women are already dealing with a lot of information and stress. ‘Our concerns are they may just say no. All you can really do is make sure that women understand  the risks.’ Babies born to women who smoke during pregnancy are three times more likely to have a low birth weight, which is a leading cause of infant death . Smoking during pregnancy can increase . the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, stillbirth and sudden . unexpected death in infancy. Exposure . to smoke in the womb is also associated with psychological problems in . childhood such as lack of attention and hyperactivity. Children of smokers tend to suffer from more respiratory problems such as asthma or bronchitis and to have problems of the ear, nose  and throat. NICE – the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence – is concerned that women who do smoke during pregnancy may find it hard to admit to their habit because of social pressures. In its draft recommendation, the watchdog says: ‘This makes it  difficult to ensure they are offered appropriate support. A carbon monoxide test is an immediate and non-invasive biochemical method for helping to assess whether or not someone smokes.’ Simon Clark, director of smokers’ lobby group Forest, said all mothers should be encouraged not to smoke when pregnant, but warned against putting pressure on women to take the tests. He said: ‘This seems incredibly invasive. ‘If they are going to undertake any test then it has to be entirely voluntary. ‘Our concern is what happens if  a mother says no, will she be  pressured or penalised? This could be the start of a slippery slope and it is important not to breach an individual’s privacy.’ Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said a lack of midwives was a major reason why many women did not get proper help to give up smoking. ‘The real solution here in cutting the prevalence of smoking in  pregnancy is more midwives and more continuity of care from the same midwife,’ Mrs Warwick said. ‘The shortage of midwives, particularly in England, means that often a midwife does not have as much time as she would want with each pregnant woman in her care and that women often see a different midwife at each visit.’ She added: ‘We would like them to make clear in any advice to women that midwives should offer the test but that ultimately the final decision must lie with the woman.’","Women with high carbon monoxide readings to be given advice on quitting .

Balancing on its corner is achieved by two ‘jump up’ manoeuvres. The first one raises the Cubli from one of its faces so that it can balance on its edge, while the second one raises it from the edge to one of its corners. Cubli can detect disturbances to adjust its position while balancing on its corner, and also rotate on the spot. The miniature mechanical device is able to use a ‘controlled fall’ to travel in a certain direction and when it combines its jumping, balancing and falling moves, it can ‘walk’ across a surface, the scientists said. While the technology could be used in future space explorer vehicles and self-assembling robots, the ‘cool little cube’ was simply designed to ‘jump up, balance and walk,’ its creators said.

The mechanical device can detect disturbances to adjust its position while balancing on its corner (illustrated) and also rotate . As impressive as the Mars Curiosity’s findings have been, the rover just doesn’t have the brains to cut it further out in the solar system. This is because, at the start of each Martian day, Nasa has to deal with a significant communication delay when it sends its agenda to the Mars rover. Even moving at light speed, instructions from Earth take about 20 minutes to reach the surface of Mars. This 40-minute roundtrip makes real-time control of the rover impossible . On Jupiter's moon Europa, where astrobiologists suspect extraterrestrial life could exist, the delay balloons to over 90 minutes. But an ‘intelligent’ camera that can not only take pictures of alien rock, but also analyse them and draw intelligent conclusions about what to do next is hoping to change all that. Named ‘TextureCam’, the two-lens device snaps 3D images and a special processor, separate from the rover's main computer, analyses the pictures. By recognising textures in the photos, the processor distinguishes between sand, rocks and sky. The processor then uses the size and distance to rocks in the picture to determine if any are scientifically important layered rocks. When TextureCam spots an interesting rock, it can either upload a high-resolution image back to Earth or send a message to the main processor to move toward the rock and take a sample. It works similarly to the facial unlock feature available on smartphones and computers. The more examples of interesting rocks it was shown, the better it becomes at identifying the common features that make rocks scientifically important. Recently TextureCam was successfully run through its paces in the rocky landscape of the Mojave Desert in Southern California—a useful test environment for the Martian surface.","Engineers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Zurich, developed the 15cm mechanical cube that combines three moves to walk along .

For most people, Martin Scorsese’s latest offering, The Wolf of Wall Street, is nothing more than an entertaining film about glamorous and despicable con men - but for Christina McDowell it is a slice of her past that continues to haunt her. McDowell is the daughter of Tom Prousalis, a former business associate of Jordan Belfort, the self-described Wolf of Wall Street who is played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the new film currently out in theaters. In an open letter published in LA Weekly Thursday, McDowell condemned the makers of the film and its star, Mr DiCaprio, accusing them of glorifying fraud and celebrating greed with little regard for the consequences of the swindlers' actions. Scroll down for video . Under fire: Director Martin Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, pictured earlier this month at a screening of The Wolf of Wall Street, have been criticized in an open letter written by the daughter of a con man . Wrong message: Christina McDowell accused the makers of the film, which follows the rise and fall of penny stock swindler Jordan Belfort as played by Mr DiCaprio, of celebrating greed and crime . McDowell, who explained in the letter that she was forced to change her name after her father had stolen her identity, said that she was 18 years old in 2004 when Prousalis, then 55, went on trial for penny stock fraud. At the time, The Washington Post described the case as a postscript to the 'pump-and-dump' scandals of the previous decade related to several shell companies that cost unsuspecting investors millions of dollars in losses. Prousalis was the securities attorney for the bogus businesses, which were taken public by Stratton Oakmant, Inc owned by Belfort in order to defraud investors to the tune of some $200million. McDowell recounted that when her father first went into business with Belfort and his ilk, she and her family were living a charmed life. 'I drove a white Range Rover in high school, snorted half of Colombia, and got any guy I ever wanted because my father would take them flying in his King Air,' she said of the heady 90s. But for McDowell, her mother and two sisters it all came crashing down when the truth behind Belfort's scheme began unraveling. Stinging rebuke: McDowell wrote that Scorsese's film glorifies the same bad behavior that nearly brought American economy to its knees a few years ago . Landed on his feet: Real-life Wolf of Wall Street Jordan Belfort, pictured right with his wife, served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay $110.4million, but reinvented himself ans an author and motivational speaker . When her father surrendered to prison in the fall of 2004 after pleading guilty to securities fraud charges, his 18-year-old daughter drove him. When Christine returned home that day, she was inundated with phone calls from her father’s creditors and attorneys representing swindled investors threatening to sue the 18-year-old girl. 'He'd left me in nearly $100,000 worth of debt,' she wrote of her jailed father. 'He left and never told me.' Once all of Prousalis’ money was gone, much of it used to repay the investors, the family fell on hard times. McDowell’s 17-year-old sister ran away from home, while her older sibling struggled to finish school. Christine McDowell described it as a confusing experience, going from her father's private jet to waiting table for meager tips. 'I couch surfed for two years, . sometimes dressing out of my car and stealing pieces of salami out of my . boyfriends' refrigerators in the middle of the night, ‘ she wrote, . ‘because I was so hungry and so ashamed that I couldn't feed myself.' McDowell, . now in her late 20s, concluded her letter with a lengthy rant against . Scorsese and DiCaprio - 'Marty and Leo’ - calling them 'dangerous' and . rebuking them for making a film that turns financial schemes rooted in . greed into entrainment. Punishment: McDowell's father, a securities lawyer not portrayed in the movie, went to prison in 2004 for securities fraud in connection to Belfort's scam . Sexist: McDowell also railed again what she called blatant misogyny on display in the film . ‘We want to get lost in what? These phony financiers' fun sexcapades and coke binges? Come on, we know the truth,’ she said. ‘This kind of behavior brought America to its knees.’ She also accused the filmmakers of aligning themselves with Belfort  - in her words an accomplished criminal – who has yet to make full restitution to his victims. Belfort was indicted in 1998 for securities fraud and money laundering. After cooperating with the FBI, he served 22 months in prison and was ordered to pay back $110.4million – about half of the total losses incurred by his investors. Since his release from prison, Belfort penned two memoirs, including The Wolf of Wall Street which served as the basis for Scorsese’s movie, and has been touring the world as a motivational speaker. In her ire-filled letter addressed to the creators of the film and Belfort himself, McDowell drove the point home, saying that a man like Belfort does not deserve to be a protagonist in a movie. As a parting salvo, Prousalis’s daughter concluded her letter by urging 'every human in America' not to support Scorsese's film. ‘Because if you do, you're simply continuing to feed the Wolves of Wall Street,' she wrote. In a postscript, McDowell added that her father is now doing business with the Albanian government and is married to a 30-year-old translator.","Christina McDowell is the daughter of Tom Prousalis, a securities lawyer who helped swindler Jordan Belfort set up IPOs for shell companies .

Neanderthals liked to be close to their families - very close, a genetic study has shown. DNA from a Neanderthal woman's 50,000-year-old toe bone shows she was highly inbred. Scientists discovered that her parents were either half-siblings who shared the same mother, an uncle and niece, an aunt and nephew, or a grandparent and grandchild. The toe bone of a Neanderthal woman, recovered from a cave in Siberia. 50,000 year-old DNA extracted from the bone was used to produce the most complete sequence so far of the genome of this group of early humans . Alternatively, they may have been double first cousins - offspring of two siblings and their siblings. The inbreeding may have been the result of Neanderthal population groups being very small, experts believe. Analysis of the DNA also revealed evidence of interbreeding between Neanderthals, Denisovans - a Neanderthal sister group from Siberia - and early modern humans. Neanderthals were a human sub-species who lived alongside our own ancestors in Eurasia for thousands of years before vanishing about 30,000 years ago. Scientists discovered that the Neanderthal's parents were either half-siblings who shared the same mother, an uncle and niece, an aunt and nephew, or a grandparent and grandchild . The evidence of inbreeding was uncovered by an analysis led by Dr Montgomery Slatkin, a population geneticist at the University of California. His team sequenced the genome from DNA extracted from the toe bone of a Neanderthal woman whose remains were found in a Siberian cave in the Altai Mountains. 'We performed simulations of several inbreeding scenarios and discovered that the parents of this Neanderthal individual were either half siblings who had a mother in common, double first cousins, an uncle and a niece, an aunt and a nephew, a grandfather and a granddaughter, or a grandmother and a grandson,' he said. Neanderthals and Denisovans were found to be closely related, parting company on the evolutionary path 300,000 years ago. More than 100,000 years earlier, they and modern humans had a common ancestor. The scientists estimated that between 1.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the genomes of modern non-African people can be traced to Neanderthals. Although like early modern humans they made tools and weapons, their lack of inventiveness and social structure may have led to their demise. For many years scientists argued about whether Neanderthals and modern humans ever interbred. DNA studies have now proved that they did, and many people alive today still carry ancient Neanderthal genes. The new findings, published in the journal Nature, come from the most complete blueprint of a Neanderthal genetic code, or genome, ever constructed. Scientists sequenced the genome from DNA extracted from the toe bone of a Neanderthal woman whose remains were found in a Siberian cave in the Altai Mountains. Comparing it with the genomes of modern humans and Denisovans revealed some surprises.

The scientists estimated that between 1.5 per cent and 2.1 per cent of the genomes of modern non-African people can be traced to Neanderthals. Denisovans are also believed to have left their genetic traces, though only in some Oceanic and Asian populations. The study also identified at least 87 specific genes in modern humans that stand out as significantly different from any found in Neanderthals or Denisovans. They may hold clues to why the Neanderthals and Denisovans died out while modern humans survived. The list of genes contains a 'catalogue' of features setting modern humans apart from all other creatures, living or extinct, according to Dr Svante Paabo, from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who led the international team. 'I believe that in it hide some of the things that made the enormous expansion of human populations and human culture and technology in the last 100,000 years possible,' he said. Scientists sequenced the genome from DNA extracted from the toe bone of a Neanderthal woman whose remains were found in a Siberian cave in the Altai Mountains . Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. At various times over the past 50,000 years, three different groups of early humans - Neanderthals, Denisovans and modern humans - lived in the cave . In addition the genome comparisons showed that Denisovans bred with a fourth group of humans living in Eurasia that had an ancestry dating back more than a million years. The scientists believe this mysterious relation may have been Homo erectus, which fossils show inhabited Europe and Asia at least a million years ago. 'The paper really shows that the history of humans and hominins during this period was very complicated,' said Prof Slatkin. 'There was lot of interbreeding that we know about and probably other interbreeding we haven't yet discovered.' Professor Chris Stringer, a leading expert in human origins at London's Natural History Museum, said the inbreeding disclosed by the Neanderthal woman's DNA must have gone on 'for a number of generations'. He added: 'Despite the fact that her ancestors had ranged widely in Eurasia for tens of millennia, her genomic diversity was less than that found in a small population of hunter-gatherers living in the Amazonian rainforest today. 'This suggests that the historical population sizes of both Denisovans and Neanderthals in Eurasia were much lower than those maintained by ancestral modern humans in Africa.'","Discovery was made after DNA analysis on a Neanderthal woman's toe bone .

The key to beating one of the most common causes of stroke could be an umbrella-like heart implant, according to new research. About a quarter of the population are born with a minor cardiac defect – a hole in one of the heart chambers known as a patent formal ovale (PFO) – that usually causes no symptoms but increases stroke risk. The new procedure involves placing a tiny implant that looks like a two-sided umbrella, known as an occluder, to plug the hole. About 150,000 Britons suffer a first stroke every year, and in eight in ten cases it is due to the blood supply to the brain being blocked by a blood clot – an ischaemic stroke. In 60 per cent of these patients, the reason for the stroke can usually be linked to coronary heart disease, and the build-up of fatty deposits on the arterial walls. This furring – known as plaque – hinders blood flow and means clots are more likely to form, then break off and travel to the brain. Yet in half the remaining patients – for whom their stroke has no obvious cause – a PFO may be the trigger. Many stroke patients are young and seemingly fit, such as broadcaster Andrew Marr, who suffered a stroke aged 53 in January, though a PFO has not been suggested as the cause. In cases where a hole in the heart is suspected, the closure operation has now been found to reduce the risk of another stroke by up to 70 per cent. No rain on this parade: The 'umbrella implant surgery' only takes 45 minutes and could prevent thousands of strokes each year . David Hargreaves, a history teacher and housemaster at Westminster School in London, was one of the first people in the UK to have the device implanted to prevent a second stroke. He suffered his first one three weeks after his 50th birthday. At the time, he was fit – running 30 to 40 miles a week – but he was taken ill on the last day of the school term. After four days of investigation in hospital, David was found to have a PFO. ‘I was told that closing the PFO would significantly reduce the chances of a further stroke, so I decided to go ahead,’ he says. ‘The procedure took about 45 minutes and I was awake throughout.’ During the operation, an incision is made in a vein in the groin under local anaesthetic. The occluder device, which is made of two wire mesh discs encasing a polyester fabric, is folded and put into a tube (catheter). It is then inserted into the vein and manoeuvred into the heart via the circulatory system, and into the open hole. Broken heart: The surgery closes a hole in the heart which is a known cause of blood clots . Once in place, the device is released and unfolds so that there is a disc either side of the PFO. A small piece of linking material that connects the two discs is tightened so that the hole is sandwiched between them. The procedure can be carried out as a day case, but most patients are kept in for observation. Dr Iqbal Malik, consultant cardiologist and director of cardiac catheter labs at Hammersmith Hospital, who fits the devices, says the implant offers a ‘belt and braces’ approach, and is given alongside blood-thinning medication. ‘Statistics show that the operation will lower the risk of a second stroke from two to three per cent a year to about one per cent. But none of my patients has had a recurrence,’ says Dr Malik. ‘The procedure is safe and seems a good option for those who have recovered well from a stroke and have a large PFO.’ The new research shows that plugging the PFO is more effective than blood-thinning medication, such as warfarin or aspirin, in reducing risk of recurrent stroke. Patients in the multi-centre study, whose average age was 46, had a 51 to 73 per cent drop in risk. David recalls: ‘I was able to watch the operation as it happened on a TV screen in the theatre. It is quite interesting to see inside your own heart. ‘I had no side effects from the procedure, and nearly four years on I have had no further strokes or mobility problems, and I feel fine. ‘For me, the sealing of the PFO has been a success and I believe it is something anyone in the same boat should seriously think about doing. I went back to work full-time about five months after the stroke. ‘One odd effect of the stroke is that I have poorer visual recognition for faces and paintings. On the plus side, my brush with mortality has made me less prone to anxiety because it puts things into perspective. ‘I still have double vision, but that is corrected with special spectacles. It means I cannot  get the skis out any more, but  that is no great loss to me, nor to skiing.’","New research show 'umbrella' implant could save thousands .

The teenager was dragged into an empty outdoor theatre in her hometown of Molfetta, near Bari, in the south east of the country, and raped repeatedly, after the gang of ten assumed that she was ‘easy’, prosecutors say. The schoolgirl had trustingly left her Facebook page unlocked, allowing a school friend, reportedly acting in revenge for a petty quarrel, to paste pictures of her, along with her phone number. Horrific: The teenager was dragged into an empty outdoor theatre in her hometown of Molfetta (pictured), near Bari, and raped repeatedly, after the gang of ten assumed that she was 'easy', prosecutors say . Afterwards the teen was immediately besieged by phone calls harassing her. The alleged attack took place in April 2012 when the group, who she knew by sight, approached her and persuaded her to get on a scooter. They took her to the theatre where she was brutally assaulted by four of the men, while the others kept watch, prosecutors say. Deputy prosecutor Francesco Giannella called it  ‘a sordid, tragic attack’. Link: The schoolgirl had trustingly left her Facebook page unlocked, allowing a school friend, reportedly acting in revenge for a petty quarrel, to paste pictures of her, along with her phone number . He said: ‘It could be a random attack but some months ago somebody made a fake profile of the girl saying she was “very available”'. He added: ‘Young people don’t understand the dangerous consequences of the misuse of certain tools such as social networks.’ The girl was too distraught to go to the police immediately but threw away her phone SIM card to put an end to the harassment. She was then allegedly raped a second time by a boyfriend, which prompted her to report the alleged attacks. Four men aged between 20 and 25 have been arrested and are detained under house arrest in connection with the alleged assault, while a fifth, who was under 18 at the time, is under investigation. Earlier this year a 21-year-old man from Gloucester was jailed for four years for grooming and raping a 14-year-old girl after she put her number on Facebook. And last year a 19-year-old from Manchester who police called 'every parent's worst nightmare' was ordered to spend six years in a young offenders institution for befriending and raping girls as young as 12 on the site.","The girl was raped in an empty outdoor theatre in the town of Molfetta .

A Massachusetts mother found herself without propane to heat her family's home on Christmas day and reached out to her local community for help. The overwhelming support Danielle Ryder of Brewster received after creating a charity page amazed the married mother of two young children. Ryder wrote on her Go Fund Me page that she and her husband both work long hours to support themselves and their two-year-old daughter and four-year-old son. Young family: Both Ryder and her husband work long hours but often find it difficult to make ends meet . Cold comfort: 61 people have donated $1,995 to Ryder and her family so they can afford to heat their home . She said that between Christmas expenses, rent, food, gas for her car and health insurance, her 'take-home pay is minimal.' Her husband runs a flooring and construction business, but during winter work can be sporadic. Car troubles before Christmas cleaned the family out, so when their AmeriGas propane tank emptied, they faced a very cold Christmas. Ryder explained that the family's propane woes began the year before, when they ran out of propane. The company delivered propane after two chilly weeks, but it came with extra fees.'The company finally delivered to us after charging a ""transfer fee"" among ""emergency relief"" and ""restarting""... we did not have the money to afford it then. We got help from local organizations to cover the down payment. We were to be put on budget billing. We never received a bill. When AmeriGas finally called us about our account, our account was in collection,' she wrote. Sleepless: Ryder wrote that she has been unable to sleep or even smile for worry about how to keep her children warm without using dangerous space heaters . Now that the tank is once again empty, the company refused to refill the family's propane until their original bill was paid, in addition to the cost of the new one: a total of $2300. 'I have $40 in the bank. I have a $20 bill in my pocket to dump into my gas tank to get to work tomorrow night..to make $60.00 to buy food for my children to eat. I go countless nights without eating, sleeping, or smiling,' wrote Ryder. Desperate times: Danielle Ryder reached out for help and was overwhelmed by the generosity of her community .

'Last year we were told we would be put on budget billing but that the local office had no faith in us.. this was told to a local company helping us pay after two weeks of no heat or hot water with a 1 year old and a 3 year old. We then never received a payment plan contract, bill, no contacts were made. This same woman is now demanding all our past due amount plus this entire new delivery UPFRONT cost,' she said.

Tom Mayhew of East Hampton, New York told wavy.com that the family discovered the images on Christmas Day during a family party with several innocent children in attendance. 'He went to play his games, not knowing anything was on it,' Mayhew said. 'After a while, [the kids] took pictures of themselves and when the picture was taken it went to a file,' continued the boy's father. Tom Mayhew's 8-year-old son was shocked to discover pornographic photos on his new Christmas present . Upon opening the file, the children opened and saw over a dozen pornographic images. The children were shocked and utterly confused by the images depicting acts they'd never even had 'the talk' about. 'It was a shocker because we had family here, and there were a lot of kids here,' said Mayhew. 'The kids were the ones that discovered those pictures.' Mayhew has been trying to come up with an answer as to how pornographic photos somehow ended up on his son's Christmas present. At first he thought Nintendo was to blame but after some investigation, Mayhew came to the conclusion that he may have bought a used product that has been returned. 'There is no reason for them to be even really on there,' Mayhew said. 'It's disgusting for one. It seems that this was the only thing left on it.' The dates on the wuestiobale photos were from earlier in December. There was also a parental control setting account that already had a log-in and password. WAVY reports that Mayhew bought the game at the Walmart on Cunningham Drive on on December 23. Tom Mayhew thinks he may have accidentally purchased a used DSi that was marketed as new . Walmart sold Mayhew the product and gave him the impressions the product was brand new . 'It was possibly a bought item at one time and returned,' said Mayhew. 'Those things were not deleted from it, so it wasn't a new product. It was a used product.' The Huffington Post reports that the DSi has internet access and players can browse the web as well as play virtual games. It comes with cameras and can store downloaded materials from the web or elsewhere. The Huffington Post also reports that this isn't the first time a child has accidentally gotten porn as a gift.

In business you have to spend money to make money and apparently in law enforcement, you have to allow crimes to catch criminals. According to documents obtained by the Huffington Post in a Freedom of Information Act request, FBI agents authorized informants to break the law at least 5,939 times in 2012. The bureau was mandated to supply the Justice Department with these statistics annually more than 10 years ago after it was revealed that mobster Whitey Bugler was a snitch - but the numbers were never made public until earlier this year, when USA Today made the first FOIA request for the documents. Track records: When it was revealed more than 10 years ago that mobster Whitey Bulger was a snitch, the FBI was mandated to keep track of illegal activities they authorized informants to commit. Above, Bulger in court on November 13, 2013 . The national newspaper requested every report since 2006, but FBI officials were only able to locate 2011's report - which showed that agents authorized 5,658 'otherwise illegal' activities that year. The crimes range from bullying and selling drugs to planning robberies and agents authorize an average of 15 authorizations a day. 'It sounds like a lot, but you have to keep it in context,' Shawn Henry, a retired FBI employee who  used to supervise criminal investigations, told USA Today. 'This is not done in a vacuum. It's not done randomly. It's not taken lightly.' The FBI numbers are likely just a small part of the picture. The bureau accounted for just 10 per cent of the criminal crimes prosecuted in federal court in 2011 and most cases are filed by state and local authorities who have their own separate sources. Denise Ballew, a spokeswoman for the FBI, refused to answer questions from USA Today, but said that the circumstances around illegal activity authorizations are 'situational' and 'tightly controlled'. Allowing it: The FBI authorized informants to break the law at least 5,939 times in 2012 . For the most serious crimes, agents are first supposed to get permission from federal prosecutors before authorizing.

A web user believed to be a Californian man arrested over the murder of his army veteran roommate earlier this year was warned on a chat forum that his posts sounded suspicious. When 36-year-old Maribel Ramos went missing on May 2, her friend Emily C started a Yelp thread to try to find her. But according to Vice, when online comments allegedly coming from Ms Ramos's roommate Kwang Choi Joy, with the username KC, appeared it raised suspicions among others on the web forum. Accused: Kwang Choi Joy has been charged with the murder of Maribel Ramos . Ms Ramos, who served in Iraq before returning to Santa Ana to go to college, was reported missing after she uncharacteristically failed to attend several events. Right before Ms Ramos disappeared she had . asked Joy to move out, her family said. Neighbors had reported Joy . acting suspiciously since her disappearance. Her body was found two weeks after her family reported her missing. It had been left in bushes and was found after residents reported a foul odor. Joy, who had attended vigils for his roommate and spoke to several media outlets about the woman he described as his 'best friend', was later arrested and charged with her murder. But according to Vice, the 54-year-old had raised suspicions on Yelp that he knew something about the student's disappearance. An online user, named KC, claimed to be the missing woman's roommate and spoke of her in the past tense . A person named only as Grant K joined the thread to say he thought the post from KC was odd . In the thread started by Emily on May . 8, a person believed to be Joy joined the conversation, posting on May . 13 that they were 'Maribel's roommate. She is my bff and only family'. But . the person claiming to be the roommate, and with the username KC, . then started referring to Ms Ramos in the past tense, even though her . body had not been found. 'We had so much fun together. I miss her so much. She always knew that I will give my life for her,' the post read. The . comments led another user, Grant K, to point out that it was odd KC had . spoken of Ms Ramos in the past tense, and questioned why the roommate . was claiming to be close to her when it was known that she had asked him . to move out before she went missing. KC posted that Ms Ramos was the beneficiary to his life insurance, which further raised suspicions on Yelp . The last comment KC made on the site was to thank Daniel J, who had highlighted how his comments may appear to others. Joy was arrested the following day . The day of the arrest, Grant K returned to the Yelp thread to remind others that he had 'solved the case' days earlier . KC, who used a photo of Joy with the . victim as his profile picture, responded by saying that his grammar . wasn't good because English was his second language. He added: 'Please do not speculate or make a judgement on me ... I know that everyone is looking at me that way.' But the online user then heightened suspicions again when he returned to the thread a few days later, claiming that as well as Ms Ramos being his 'only family and bff' she was also the sole beneficiary to his '$250,000 life insurance' and bank account. That post, made on May 16, quickly led to another member of the internet forum reaching out to KC to suggest that he be careful about what he writes. The user, Daniel J, wrote: 'This is not an accusal, just a personal observance ... the stuff you write makes you susceptible to doubt.' He added: 'You may be outraged that I am pointing this out, but I'm just showing you what an uninvolved third party might think. The body of army vet Maribel Ramos, 36, was found nearly two weeks after she was reported missing . Maribel Ramos had allegedly asked KC Joy to move out of her apartment just before she disappeared . Maribel Ramos was last seen on May 2. Two weeks later her body was found in the brush near Modjeska Canyon . KC made one final post, thanking Daniel J for his advice. The following day - May 17 - he was arrested for murder. It is not clear if police were aware of the online conversation on Yelp, or if the person posting as KC really was Joy. However, Grant K returned to the Yelp thread after Joy's arrest to point out that he had accused the roommate of being involved nearly a week before his arrest.","Online forum user 'KC' warned on chat room that his comments made him appear guilty .

Amanda Knox has joined Twitter and says she’s accepted Meredith Kercher's family thinks she's guilty as the end of her murder retrial approaches. Knox tweeted a link to her blog: ‘With Respect to the Kercher Family’ on December 18, in which she writes:  'I hope that everyone can understand that this is an issue of perspective, and from mine and those who know my innocence, it’s clear that my actions are an attempt to show compassion and solidarity. 'I have to accept that the Kerchers believe I’m guilty and my attempts to honor her memory can cause them pain. I do not wish to antagonize their grief, even with my best intentions.' Moving on: Knox, 26, said that 'common sense' told her not to return to Italy for her trial in the murder of British student Meredith Kercher . The 26-year-old is currently being retried for Meredith’s murder in Florence, Italy, but is not attending the trial. It appears her outburst was triggered by being told to remove a link to the Kercher family fundraising page from her website www.amandaknox.com. The blog entry goes on to describe her pain at being asked to remove the link by the family’s lawyer.She writes: “It is with a broken heart that I acquiesce with the Kercher family’s attorney’s request to remove from my site the link to the Kercher family’s fundraising page and the page I have dedicated in memory of my friend, Meredith. 'I feel trapped in a position where any attempts I make to respect their grief from a distance are perceived as indifference, and any attempts to make a connection are perceived as antagonism and arrogance. 'Thank you to all who have supported me in wanting to keep Meredith’s memory as a friend alive in my heart.' Retried: In the midst of her retrial in Italy, Amanda Knox has launched a Twitter page . In closing arguments last week the Kercher family lawyer Francesco Maresca urged the panel of two professional judges and eight lay jurors to disregard Knox's claims of innocence. He said: 'She has become a well-known person. You know she signed contracts for millions of dollars for her book. She has someone who takes care of her public relations. 'She has a personal website where she invites people to collect donations in the memory of the victim, Meredith Kercher, which is an unbearable contradiction for the family.' He added that the world's attention has focused on Knox, while 'the victim has fallen into total oblivion, to the immense pain of the Kercher family'. Amanda had previously hit back at Maresca's claims as inaccurate. On December 17, she tweeted: ‘Support . Meredith Kercher’s family,’ and a link to another blog entry in which . she wrote: 'The Kercher family’s civil attorney, Francesco Maresca, in . his closing arguments yesterday, claimed I have been collecting . unspecified funds in the name of Meredith and her family.He implied that . I was deceiving the public and collecting those funds for myself. 'Please . visit the Meredith Kercher Murder page and scroll down to the Donation . section to discover that I have simply added a link to the Kercher . family’s own website where they solicit donations for their ongoing . struggle through this heartbreaking legal process. 'I . have been solicited by Mr Maresca to remove from my site anything I . have done to honor her memory or show support to her family. My response . was that no one but the Kercher family has any right to make such a . request. As I await direct contact from the family of my murdered . friend, I will continue to honor her and show support. Thank you for your support.' Knox returned home to Seattle on October 4, 2011, after four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Knox has a section of her website called: ‘Meredith Kercher Murder’, but there is no longer a ‘Donation Section’, so it appears she has now removed it. However - in a move that some may find distasteful - next to Knox’s blog entries about Meredith is an icon with credit card symbols in which she asks for donations for her own Knox Defense Fund. Knox joined Twitter on November 14 as @amamaknox, tweeting: '#RyanFergusonWelcome home!!! With love and support, Amanda and Madison.' She also posted a photo of herself with best friend Madison Pax, who moved to Italy to support her when she was in prison, holding up a sign saying ‘Welcome home Ryan.' Ryan Ferguson spent 10 years in prison wrongly convicted of second-degree murder and first degree robbery and was released last month after it was finally overturned. Knox has only tweeted 14 times and at the time of writing had just 97 followers – one of which is her co-accused Raffaele Sollecito who has been on Twitter for since November 2011. On her Twitter page she also has the Latin quote: 'Aequam memento rebus in arduis servare mentem,' a quote from ancient Roman poet Virgil meaning: 'Remember to maintain a calm mind while doing difficult tasks.' Knox sent an email to the Florence courtroom pleading her innocence last week in a move which appeared not to impress the judge. Judge Alessandro Nencini said such an email from a defendant was ‘irregular’, adding: ‘If you want to speak to the trial you have to come to the trial.' The trial is expected to conclude in mid-January.","Amanda Knox has linked to Meredith Kercher's family's fundraising page on her blog and Twitter account .

A nine-year-old boy from Southern California has become the youngest person in recorded history to reach the summit of Argentina's Aconcagua mountain, which at 22,841 feet is the tallest peak in the Western and Southern hemispheres. Tyler Armstrong of Yorba Linda reached the summit on Christmas Eve with his father Kevin and a Tibetan sherpa, Lhawang Dhondup, his team announced Friday. When they climbed back down to the base camp, Tyler was much less tired than his dad and their guide, said Nicolas Garcia, who handled the expedition's logistics from the city of Mendoza. Kevin Armstrong (left) sits with his son Tyler (right) at the peak of Mount Whitney in California - but they have just reached the summit of Argentina's Aconcagua mountain . 'It's a record. Never before has a child as young as nine reached the summit of Aconcagua,' Garcia said. There was one younger boy who climbed the lower slopes of Aconcagua, Garcia noted: An Inca boy was sacrificed some 500 years ago at 16,400 feet (5,300 meters) on Piramide, one of the mountain's lower peaks. Scientific tests on the mummy, recovered in 1985, put his age at about 7. Only 30 percent of the 7,000 people who obtain permits to climb Aconcagua each year make the summit, Garcia said, and no one under 14 is usually allowed. The Armstrongs hired a lawyer to make their case before an Argentine judge that Tyler could safely accomplish the feat. Argentina's Aconcagua mountain (pictured), is the tallest peak in the Western and Southern hemispheres at 22,841 feet . He had already climbed the 19,341-foot Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania at the age of 8, and with Aconcagua conquered, is determined to reach all 'seven summits', the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. Aconcagua can be deadly. Last year, three climbers died, although no one died the year before that, and no one has been killed so far this summer climbing season, Garcia said. Since the first climbers reached the top of Aconcagua in 1897, more than 110 people have died trying, he said. 'Tyler is a really happy kid, very open. And he's prepared for these climbs very carefully,' Garcia said. 'Neither he nor his father are in for 'adventure.' Their project is pretty conservative, with a guide who is very experienced, so from my perspective, their climb wasn't imprudent.'","Argentina's Aconcagua mountain is 22,841 feet tall .

A historic lighthouse, which has been divided into holiday cottages, situated on top of a Highland cliff has gone on the market for just £210,000. The keepers' accommodation at Stoer Head Lighthouse is to be sold by the Northern Lighthouse Board, as part of an assessment of the 'size and extent' of its estate. On a clear day views from the lighthouse, which enjoys a beautiful, isolated spot, can extend for miles. But prospective buyers who are used to being a little closer to civilisation should be aware the nearest shops are about 12 miles away. For sale: The keepers' accommodation at Stoer Head Lighthouse (pictured) has been put up for sale by the Northern Lighthouse Board and is expected to go for £210,000 . Idyllic: On a clear day views from the lighthouse, which enjoys a beautiful, isolated spot, can extend for miles . Historic: The former keepers' accommodation is currently used as two holiday cottages . The NLB, which has recently sold other assets at Strathy Point, Tod Head and Covesea Skerries, has said the accommodation is no longer required for safe navigation. The property, which sits in the most westerly point of Assynt in north-west Sutherland, is currently used as two holiday cottages. The sale includes a quarter of an acre of land, although the lighthouse tower is not for sale as it is being retained by the NLB. NLB chief executive Roger Lockwood said: 'The NLB is continually assessing the size and extent of its estate in order to ensure that it delivers a reliable, efficient and cost-effective network of Aids to Navigation for the benefit and safety of the mariner plying our waters. 'The former lighthouse keepers accommodation at Stoer Head Lighthouse and store near Rattray Head Lighthouse are no longer required for safe navigation. The NLB will continue to maintain over two hundred lights around the coasts of Scotland and the Isle of Man.' On a clear day, it is possible to see Harris and Lewis, North and South Uist, and south to Torridon and Skye. Closer to hand there are fine views of Suilven, Canisp, and Stac Polly, situated south of Lochinver.

Cosy: The inside of the cottage that is being sold because it is no longer needed for 'safe navigation' Staircase: The lighthouse tower is not being sold and is being retained by the Northern Lighthouse Board . The area is hugely popular with tourists and locals alike as the area is a great place to spot seabirds, whales and dolphins. Designed and engineered by Thomas Stevenson, the father of Robert Louis Stevenson, the lighthouse's beam of light helped those at sea steer a safe passage through the deep waters. The men given the difficult job of building the lighthouse stayed in a stone bothy which is now known as The Lighthouse Stores. It was not until 1870 that the light marking the headland of the Point of Stoer was finally built. Although the lighthouse at 45-feet is relatively short, its elevation above sea level is 177 feet. A principal lightkeeper and an assistant and their families lived at Stoer Head until the light became automated in 1978. They were quite self-sufficient and nearby are the remains of the former byre, stable, cow shed, pig house and cart shed all built for life at the lighthouse station. The lightkeepers' children were educated at Stoer Public School, however there were no senior schools in the county of Sutherland so the children had to continue their education away from the lighthouse at boarding school. It is also ideal for those who enjoy coastal walks, mountaineering, geology, kayaking, fishing or who simply take pleasure from being out and about in the great outdoors. Despite its isolated setting, the Stoer building is only around half a mile away from a scattering of houses at Raffin. The nearest shops can be found at Drumbeg, or Lochinver, about 12 miles away. DTZ Edinburgh has been appointed as property advisor and selling agent for Stoer's keepers' accommodation. Senior surveyor for DTZ Richard Cottingham said: 'We are delighted to be instructed to sell such a historic property and expect considerable interest given the previous popularity of the former lighthouse keepers accommodation as holiday cottages. 'The lighthouse tower is to be retained and operated by the NLB but the remainder of the lighthouse compound is being sold. 'A nearby walled garden of just over an acre, including a stone steading, is also for sale and presents a unique opportunity for those looking for a more substantial development project. 'Offers will be sought for the lighthouse compound and garden individually or as a whole.' The light is monitored from the NLB's offices in Edinburgh and is visited on a regular basis to carry out basic maintenance and cleaning. Once a year the NLB technicians visit the light to carry out maintenance. Although the Stoer building is only around half a mile away from a scattering of houses at Raffin, the nearest shops are about 12 miles away .

Phil Robertson will return to A&E reality show Duck Dynasty in 2014 following his brief suspension for infammatory comments about homosexuality in GQ. 'After discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,' the network said in a statement. Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus less than two weeks ago by A&E in response to the uproar following the interview. Reinstated: Phil Robertson won't miss a day of filming after his brief hiatus was reversed by A&E . The removal of the 67-year-old patriarch from the show was lauded by gay rights organizations, but fans of the show denounced it as a violation of Robertson's right to free speech. Conservative supporters include Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants’ hatin’ and taking on the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking on all of us.' A&E initially took action after Robertson's comments caused uproar, saying his views were 'disappointing' and that A&E has always been 'strong supporters and champions of the LGBT community.' Now, the network says the family has made it clear that they are sorry if they caused any offense with the patriarch's remarks. 'While Phil’s comments made in the interview reflect his personal views based on his own beliefs, and his own personal journey, he and his family have publicly stated they regret the “coarse language” he used and the mis-interpretation of his core beliefs based only on the article. He also made it clear he would “never incite or encourage hate.” We at A+E Networks expressed our disappointment with his statements in the article, and reiterate that they are not views we hold,' reads the statement. United: The Robertson family made it clear they did not want to continue filming Duck Dynasty without patriarch Phil . The homophobic comments from the born-again Christian included such insights as, ' 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man’s anus. 'That’s just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She’s got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I’m saying? But hey, sin: It’s not logical, my man. It’s just not logical.' He also grouped homosexuals in with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who’s going to heaven, hell. That’s the Almighty’s job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they’re homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I’m saying?' GLAAD hit back soon after the interview was released online, calling him a ‘stain’ on the network A&E which airs the show. GLAAD spokesperson Wilson Cruz told E! News: 'Phil and his family claim to be Christian, but Phil's lies about an entire community fly in the face of what true Christians believe. 'He clearly knows nothing about gay people or the majority of Louisianans - and Americans - who support legal recognition for loving and committed gay and lesbian couples. Disgusted: Reverent Jesse Jackson said Robertson's comments make him worse than the bus driver who infamously sent Rosa Parks to the back of the bus . 'Phil's decision to push vile and extreme stereotypes is a stain on A&E and his sponsors who now need to reexamine their ties to someone with such public disdain for LGBT people and families.' In addition to his anti-gay rhetoric, the duck hunter also made dubious remarks regarding Louisiana before the Civil Rights Movement. 'I never, with my eyes, saw the mistreatment of any black person. Not once. Where we lived was all farmers. The blacks worked for the farmers. I hoed cotton with them. I'm with the blacks, because we're white trash. We're going across the field,' said Robertson. 'They're singing and happy. I never heard one of them, one black person, say, 'I tell you what: These doggone white people'—not a word!... Pre-entitlement, pre-welfare, you say: Were they happy? They were godly; they were happy; no one was singing the blues.' For many, including Reverend Jesse Jackson, who compared Robertson to the driver who sent Rosa Parks to the back of the bus the attempts at damage control by A$E were insufficient. 'These statements uttered by Robertson are more offensive than the bus driver in Montgomery, Alabama, more than 59 years ago,’ Jackson said in a statement obtained by ABC News. ‘At least the bus driver, who ordered Rosa Parks to surrender her seat to a white person, was following state law. 'Robertson’s statements were uttered freely and openly without cover of the law, within a context of what he seemed to believe was “white privilege.”’ In his statement, the 72-year-old civil rights leader demanded to meet within 72 hours with A&E executives and Cracker Barrel’s CEO to discuss the future of Duck Dynasty memorabilia, which rakes in millions of dollars for the network and its star family. Jackson also urged the network to uphold Robertson’s indefinite suspension from the popular program. Stardom: Two of the unlikely reality TV stars of Duck Dynasty, brothers Silas 'Uncle Si' Robertson (left) and Phil Robertson . Robertson's many fans and supporters countered with an online petition, called I Stand with Phil, demanding A&E reinstate Robertson to the show. 'Mr. Robertson’s comments in GQ Magazine are simply reflective of a Biblical view of sexuality, marriage, and family – a view that has stood the test of time for thousands of years and continues to be held by the majority of Americans and today’s world as a whole,' reads the petition, launched by a conservative Christian organization. In addition to the petition, conservative Christians rallied behind Robertson by flooding the A&E New York offices with thousands of rubber duckies as part of the Mail The Duck campaign to reinstate the reality star to his show. Another show of support came in the form of a planned mass eat-in at chicken restaurant Chick-Fil-A. CEO of the fast food restaurant Dan Cathy faced his own scandal after making anti-gay comments. According to Fox News, supporters are planning a 'Chick-Phil-A' day, in which they don camouflage gear and gorge on poultry. The odd show of support is planned for January 21, according to a Facebook page dedicated to the event. Robertson supporters are encouraged to wear 'Duck Commander or camouflage gear' to their local Chick-Fil-A restaurant to 'stand for free speech' and 'sit for good food.' Fast food and freedom: The Facebook page for a planned 'Chick-Phil-A Day' in support of Phil Robertson . It so far has more than 25,000 'likes' and many have expressed their desire to go. 'IM [sic] with Phil. He is right in what he said and how he believes. I will be eating ckicken [sic] to show support for free speech,' wrote one. Another questioned the sudden fervency of the Christian right's support of free speech. 'How many of you ""free speech advocates"" stood up for the Dixie Chicks . when people wanted to kick them off the radio for using their ""free . speech""?' It's unclear what effect the mass consumption of fried chicken was intended to have on Robertson's suspension.The controversy did no damage to the Robertson coffers, either. Sales for the Duck Dynasty Christmas album soared during the holiday season.According to Nielsen, Duck The Halls: A Robertson Family Christmas sold 132,000 during the week of December 22, nearly twice the amount of discs sold since its first week on the shelves in October.Sales were high enough to claim the number four spot on the Billboard album charts.The definite end of the Duck Commander's 'indefinite' hiatus has been greeted without surprise by media pundits.Founder of Business Insider Henry Blodget tweeted, 'That Phil Robertson ""suspension"" was the most brilliant marketing stunt ever. Two weeks ago, I had never even heard of Duck Dynasty!'Funny or Die host Billy Eichner tweeted, 'Very excited A&E is resuming Duck Dynasty with Phil Robertson. We need more ignorant homophobic racists who probably hate women on the air.'The reality show - which follows the Robertson clan running their duck-calling business in the swampland of West Monroe, Louisiana - has been a runaway success for A&E, with a Christmas special recently pulling in 9 million viewers.The millionaire self-described hillbilly's suspension made no impact on the upcoming season of the show and he has missed no filming time.","A&E has announced Phil Robertson will return to Duck Dynasty .

An Ohio father allegedly fled the scene of an accident in which his own son died, after being hit by the minivan the father was driving, the day after Christmas. Authorities say the four-year-old son of Natividad de Jesus Hernandez, 30, fell from the minivan Hernandez was driving and was hit by the car. A witness to the incident says Hernandez stayed on the scene with the child until an ambulance arrived, then jumped back in the van and drove away. Father charged: Natividad de Jesus Hernandez, 30, is being held on a $500,000 bond after leaving the scene of an accident that killed his young son . According to NBC 4, the boy, identified as four-year-old Angel Gustbabo Hernandez, fell from a moving vehicle in Union County Thursday morning. The Associated Press reports that the boy opened the handle of the van's sliding doors and tumbled from the vehicle. His father was driving a 1997 Chevrolet Venture minivan from a construction site on Brock Road at about 11:05am when the child fell from the vehicle and was hit by the van. Died of injuries: Angel Gustbabo Hernandez died after he fell from a minivan his father was driving and was struck by the car . Bereaved: Hernandez does not speak English well and was confused and unsure of what to do after the accident . A 911 caller said Hernandez held the child tightly after the accident until emergency services arrived. He then immediately left the scene without speaking to police officers about the accident. According to the Arizona Star, Patrol Lieutenant Molly Clemems said Hernandez does not speak English fluently and was confused as to what he should do. His vehicle was later found at the Ohio Health Dublic Methodist Hospital, where the child had been transported by paramedics. He has been charged with leaving the scene of a crash, a felony charge.

According to ABC 6, Hernandez is being held on a $500,000 bond and must front the entire sum before he can be released. Authorities believe he poses a flight risk. The child was reportedly not wearing a seatbelt or child restraint when he fell from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital. Jail records said Hernandez is charged with failure to exchange information after an accident, a third-degree felony. A scheduled appearance Friday in Marysville municipal court was postponed because Hernandez doesn't understand English well enough, Trooper Jeremy Allen said. He'll remain jailed until the rescheduled Monday morning hearing. No attorney information was available.","Natividad de Jesus Hernandez, 30, struck and killed his four-year-old son when the child fell from a minivan .

While its been scientifically proven that smoking during pregnancy can lead to serious health problems for the child after birth, woman across the United States continue to puff while pregnant. A new CDC report reveals that a shocking 30.5 per cent of women in West Virginia continued to smoke into the last three months of their pregnancy. New York City, on the other hand, had one of the lowest smoking rates, with just 2.3 per cent of pregnant women admitting to the hazardous activity. Bad habits: A new report by the CDC shows that many American women are continuing to smoke while pregnant. The darkest colored states are the places with the highest percentage of pregnant smokers . For the love of the baby: The above graphs shows the overall trend that most female smokers quit when they become pregnant . Giving up: The number of mothers continuing to smoke while pregnant has been decreasing on trend with woman as a whole since the 90s . An earlier report compared pregnancy smoking rates among different ethnic and age groups. Around 30 per cent of American Indian women smoked while pregnant in 2000, but that number had nosedived by 2004, going below 20 per cent. However, the graph shows the rate shooting up again after that year. Alaskan Natives are the group that by far smokes the most during pregnancy, hitting a high of around 40 per cent in 2001, with Hispanics smoking the least. Age also seems to be a factor in whether women continue smoking into pregnancy. Ethnic breakdown: Alaskan Natives have one of the highest rates of pregnancy smoking in the United States . Too young to understand: Women younger than 20 to 24 have a higher percentage of smoking while pregnant . Perhaps unsuprisingly, the younger a woman is the more likely she is to continue smoking. Around 20 per cent of women younger than 20 to 24 continue to smoke while older women ages 25 to older than 35 hover around the 10 per cent mark. The CDC warns however that the numbers were self-reported which means pregnant women feeling guilty about smoking could have lied about continuing to smoke or quitting. The good news is, the percentage of women who smoke while pregnant is considerably less than those who smoke before pregnancy and after delivery. The trend as a whole is falling as well. From 1989 to 2006, the percentage of births where the mother smoked during pregnancy decreased by half, from 20 to 10 per cent.","A new report by the CDC revealed that 30.5 per cent of women in West Virginia continue to smoke after getting pregnant .

Ministers warned backbenchers that their careers would be ruined if they did not support gay marriage, it was claimed last night. Angry MPs have written to members of the House of Lords, telling them that the House of Commons did not have a truly free vote last week and that many felt coerced into the decision. Conservative backbenchers are furious at the pressure exerted by Number 10, ministers and whips to back the legalisation of same sex marriage - which sailed through its third reading thanks to the support from Labour. Rebellion: Some Tory MPs claim their political careers were threatened if they voted against gay marriage, something the party denies . Former education Tim Loughton (left) and former farming minister Sir Jim Paice are among the Tory MPs to sign the letter to peers calling on them to block the gay marriage legislation . They are now urging the Lords to vote down the legislation when it comes before them on Monday. It is convention for the Lords to ultimately bow to the will of the Commons - but MPs are now claiming that their will was ignored by the government. Some claimed they were warned they would lose financial backing and campaigning help before the next election if they refused to back the Bill - a complaint refuted by government sources. Despite being promised a free vote, backbenchers said they had had been advised not to defy the Prime Minister. Ultimately 130 Tories rebelled. Prime Minister David Cameron said he was 'proud' to back same-sex weddings . A letter signed by 15 Tory MPs said: ‘The main parties announced a free vote but we saw varying degrees of coercion, with threats made, for example, to an MP’s future political career or withdrawal of party support at future elections.’ The letter adds: ‘Regrettably our ability as MPs to oppose, amend or scrutinise this Bill was heavily constrained. ‘The Government presses on without any mandate from a party manifesto. We are all elected representatives by none of us was elected on a platform to redefine marriage. ‘Genuine concerns about the impact on society’s understanding of marriage and the Bill’s implications for free speech and civil liberty have been swept aside. ‘Our postbags testify to the deep unpopularity of this Bill. ‘Most of our constituents simply believe marriage is a unique institution that forms the bedrock of society and should be left as it is. ‘Millions of people with marriage certificates imprinted “Marriage Act 1949” are entitled to ask what right anyone has to redefine their own marriages over their heads.’ Signatories of the letter included Tim Loughton, the former education minister whose attempt to extend civil partnerships to straight couples was voted down, Jim Paice, the former farming minister Sir Gerald Howarth, the former defence minister. Sir Gerald told the Mail: ‘We are doing a really good job on the economy and Europe and cutting immigration but this is being obscured by this obsession with a massive social change that has no mandate. ‘I cannot understand why the Prime Minister is hell-bent on driving through this through. ‘It is gratuitously disrespectful to the party and the country.’ The former minister added that many of his local activists had quit his association while another Tory MP had told him a quarter of hers had deserted the party. Late night: The House of Lords is due to vote on same sex weddings on Monday night, but it could be delayed until 2am . David Burrowes, a ministerial aide who signed the letter, said: ‘The manner of the process of this bill as much as the substance has been causing great concern.’ He added that while he was not personally coerced by the whips, ‘I understand some colleagues may have felt the pressure from the Prime Minister and ministers about the impact on their careers.’ Michael Gove and Theresa May had also publicly urged Tory MPs to back the legislation. Other MPs to sign the letter include Glyn Davies, Fiona Bruce, Richard Drax, Karl McCartney, Therese Coffey and Stewart Jackson. Mr Jackson said: ‘My main issue is that there was not sufficient scrutiny of the Bill, and there was no mandate. It wasn’t in the Coalition Agreement, it wasn’t in the manifesto, it wasn’t in the Queen’s Speech. It is right that the Lords have the opportunity to vote on this.’ MPs said that the legislation was railroaded through, with backbenchers given just four minutes for speeches at second reading while the committee put in charge of scrutinising the bill had 15 MPs in favour of gay marriage and four against. However, the Conservative party strongly denied issuing threats to MPs who did not fall into line. A Tory party source said: ‘The Whips’ Office was strictly neutral and left it to the advocates on either side of the arguments to put forward their case.’ David Cameron has said he is ‘proud’ of the Bill going through its third reading in the Commons last week. Polls show that the public is broadly supportive of extending the right to marry to same sex couples. But a poll of MPs conducted by ComRes showed that almost three in ten Tories (27 per cent) did not feel they had a free vote on gay marriage, despite being promised one. One in ten Labour MPs expressed the same opinion. Angry MPs have pointed out that normally on conscience issues around 200 MPs would abstain. But on the second reading of the same sex marriage bill it was only 67. A crunch vote at the Second Reading in the Lords on Monday could be held after 2am as 80 peers have put their names down to speak.","Letter to peers claims MPs were warned opposing same sex marriage would end their career .

Israeli police on horseback charged Palestinians as tens of thousands marched in protest to mark the 65th anniversary of the Jewish state's creation. There were violent clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinians waving their national flag to commemorate 'Nakba Day' - or 'the day of the catastrophe'. Every May 15, Palestinians hold rallies to protest against their mass displacement during the Arab-Israeli war in 1948. Tension: Israeli police on horseback charged a group of protestors they said were taking part in an 'illegal march' Remembrance: Palestinians protest every May 15 which to mark their 'nakba' meaning 'catastrophe' when Israel was created . Clashes: Tens of thousands of Palestinians marched today to mark the 65th anniversary of the creation of Israel . The dispute over the fate of those . Palestinians and their descendants, now numbering several million . people, remains at the core of conflict in the Middle East. Israel views the possibility of Palestinians returning as demographic suicide and expects the displaced and their descendants to be taken in by a future Palestinian state. But intermittent Israeli-Palestinian attempts to agree on the terms of such a state have so far failed. Across the West Bank, sirens wailed at noon for 65 seconds to commemorate the 65 years since the 'nakba.' Thousands marched in Ramallah from the grave of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the city center. Many wore black in a sign of mourning, holding Palestinian flags and large keys symbolizing the homes they left behind. 'The right of return will not die,' chanted the protesters. Schools closed at midday and parents brought their children to the demonstration. Battle: Fourteen protesters were arrested by Israeli police in east Jerusalem . Emotions: A Palestinian man is arrested by Israeli police near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's old city . In Ramallah, 38-year-old Manwal Awad brought her 11-year-old twins to the protest. 'Every year I bring them with me to inherit the story of our nakba, and to keep the dream of return,' she said. Rallies were elsewhere in the West Bank as well, and in several places demonstrators throwing rocks clashed with Israeli security forces, who responded with tear gas, Israel's military said. Near the volatile city of Hebron, a fire bomb hit at an Israeli military vehicle, causing it to overturn and injuring four soldiers. In east Jerusalem, Israeli police used water cannon and officers on horseback to disperse an 'illegal march,' police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Fourteen protesters were arrested, as was a Palestinian suspected of attacking a Jewish man as he walked near the Old City, he said. In Gaza, around a thousand people marched to the U.N. headquarters in Gaza City, where the demonstrators chanted: 'We shall return. We will never give up or compromise over our land.' Militants in Gaza, which has been under the control of the militant Hamas group since 2007, fired a rocket into southern Israel that exploded in an open field causing no injuries, Israel's military said. In a speech televised last night, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian cause earned international acceptance last year with the United Nations' de facto recognition of a Palestinian state in east Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. 'We won the support of the world,' Abbas said, adding that Israel's policies toward the Palestinians are 'condemned internationally.' Conflict: Palestinians chanted 'the right of return will not die' during today's protests . Violence: Tear gas was fired and police charged on horseback during the clashes in Israel . Last year, Abbas created a stir when he told Israeli media that he himself has no wish to live in Safed, the city of his birth, in northern Israel. Although widely condemned by Palestinians, Abbas' remarks were seen as a reflection of a decades-old understanding among Palestinian officials that likely only a limited number of refugees would ever be able to return to their original homes in Israel as part of a compromise that would result in a future peace agreement. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been trying to renew Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which collapsed four years ago over the issue of Jewish settlements. Palestinians insist they will not resume talks unless the construction of settlements in territories they want for their future state ends first. Israel says negotiations should resume without preconditions and that settlements will be resolved through talks along with the other issues. In efforts to jump-start the talks, Kerry has managed to persuade Arab leaders to reissue their 2002 peace proposal with new incentives, including a suggestion that final borders between Israel and a future Palestine could be modified from the 1967 lines through agreed land swaps. The 2002 initiative, which at the time was endorsed by the Arab League and the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation, offered Israel normalized relations in exchange for a full withdrawal from territories captured in 1967. However, it was overshadowed by Israeli-Palestinian fighting and was greeted with skepticism by Israel. Israel has been mostly quiet on the proposal so far. The Palestinian statistics bureau in the West Bank says the number of Palestinians today has reached 11.5 million. Of those, 4.4 million live in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza; 1.4 million in Israel while the remainder live in the diaspora.","Palestinians mark May 15 as 'Nakba Day' - meaning 'day of the catastrophe'

Jen Arnold, the star of reality TV show Little Couple, bravely shared a candid picture from her hospital room as she began her second day of inpatient chemotherapy on Friday. The 39-year-old Houston-based neonatologist posted a snap shot on her Twitter page which showed her with no hair - a side-effect of the treatment she has been receiving since her shock diagnosis. The mother-of-two is fighting a rare form of cancer, but did her best to stay upbeat in her message to fans. 'Day2 inpatient chemo- sleeping a lot, liking new anti nausea med this time, & looking to get home today! #GetWellJen,' she wrote. She also told her fans that her chemotherapy had been postponed for a week because of low blood counts, but said the 'silver lining' was that she was able to have 'a better Xmas' with her family. She certainly made the most of it, baking cookies with her son Will, 3, and daughter Zoey, 2, while her husband Bill Klein cooked an Italian feast for Christmas Eve. She also shared pictures of her boy enjoying his presents on Christmas morning. The Houston neonatologist broke the news about her diagnosis earlier this month after she and husband, who both have dwarfism caused by a genetic condition, brought their second adopted child home to Texas. Arnold, who has been wearing a wig, detailed the terrifying moment that she learned something was wrong in an interview with  People magazine. 'There are moments I feel just . terrible,' she told the publication. 'I can't believe it is happening. Other times, I . feel like this is just a bump in the road.' The couple adopted son, Will, from China and they were in India to bring home their new daughter Zoey in October when Arnold began bleeding. Desperate to stay with her daughter but feeling increasingly faint, Arnold made the difficult decision to return home. Once back in the U.S., she was diagnosed with stage 3 choriocarcincoma, a cancer sparked by a non-viable pregnancy she had suffered. Her fertility issues have been well documented on the show, and she was shocked when she became pregnant in August - although she said she was not surprised that an ultrasound showed the baby had no heartbeat. 'I had figured it wasn't going to be viable,' she told People magazine. The . embryo was removed but cells were left behind and sparked the . quick-growing cancer. She began intensive chemotherapy while her husband . was still in India. But . the mass in her uterus failed to respond to the chemo and grew four . times its size - and then three tumors appeared in her lungs. Struggle: Jen and husband Bill have had a challenging few years as they tried to start a family . Family: Jen and Bill hold their son Will's hands as they walk to lunch. The couple adopted him from China last year . 'Sometimes I think, ""Seriously? Really? How can this be happening?""' she told People. Doctors were forced to give her a hysterectomy - which they saw as their last resort because of Arnold's small ariway. 'We wanted to avoid surgery in her case because of her shortened airway and the difficulties she has had in the past with surgeries,' said Dr. Concepcion R. Diaz-Arrastia from Baylor College of Medicine. Struggles: In her efforts to start a family Jen went through multiple grueling rounds of IVF egg retrieval and tried surrogacy.

Choriocarcinoma is a fast-growing form of cancer in the uterus that develops in women who are pregnant.It can occur after a normal pregnancy and it is possible for a healthy baby to grow at the same time.The cancer is most often caused by a hydatidiform mole, which is a tumor resulting from over-production of the tissue that is supposed to develop into the placenta - the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the fetus.Even after the mass is removed from the uterus, the abnormal cells can continue to grow and turn into cancer - as it did in Arnold's case.Choriocarcinoma is an uncommon, but very often curable. Most women whose cancer has not spread can be cured and will still be able to have children.One symptom is vaginal bleeding in a woman who recently had a hydatidiform mole or pregnancy, and chemotherapy is the main type of treatment.A hysterectomy and radiation therapy are rarely needed. Source . Doctors were also faced with the issue of her size because they were unaware of how much chemotherapy to give her. 'I called oncologists in Los Angeles, Baltimore, New York, Houston,' Dr. Arrastia said, 'and no one had experience with treating this type of cancer in a person with skeletal dysplasia. It was a very rare cancer, rare that it was found in a little person â€¦ a very rare situation.' Now doctors have upped her dosage and hope she will not suffer an infection that will set her back. If this is the case, doctor say her prognosis looks good. 'The treatment is rough,' Arnold said. 'But I have a chance of being cured. I just have to push through it.'

Bubble: The Chancellor risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the Help to Buy scheme, warns economists . Britain's economic recovery is under threat from inflated house prices and debt, a leading think tank has warned. In a gloomy New Year message, the Institute for Public Policy Report (IPPR) predicted a new 'debt bubble' is on the way as families continue to live beyond their means by taking out cheap mortgages under the Government's Help To Buy scheme. The policy was set up last year to help people get onto the property ladder, but the economists believe it could lead to an unmanageable level of demand for new houses and increasing levels of household debt. Economic growth in Britain, which is at its strongest since 2007, is being fuelled by higher consumer spending and increased rates of borrowing. This, in turn, is leading to an increase in household debt, which caused the recession to 'deepen' after 2008. Personal debt is expected to rise to 160 per cent of personal income by 2018, and could cause the bubble to burst. The chief economist of the Institute for Public Policy Report (IPPR), Tony Dolphin, took aim at the Help to Buy scheme. He said there was a 'fundamental flaw' in the way the economy was run and condemned Chancellor . George Osborne’s promise of a recovery led by the difference manufacturing and exports, which is running at a deficit . ‘The Chancellor risks pumping up a fresh housing bubble with the Help to Buy scheme’, he said. Some . economists, including Dolphin, are worried that this is pushing up . house prices to artificial levels, as demand outstrips supply of new . homes. Dolphin pointed . out that house prices have risen by 6.5 per cent across the UK in the 12 . months to November, and growth in London has hit double digits. The Bank of England has responded to these fears by promising to keep a close eye on the housing market. The . Office for Budget Responsibility believes debt will start to . increase again in relation to incomes. ‘In the global economy we are truly living beyond our means, and have been doing so for three decades,’ said Dolphin. Obstacles: People taking out cheap mortgages to buy homes is fuelling levels of household debt and could hamper Britain's economic recovery . He . also ridiculed the pledge by Osborne in his March 2011 Budget for a . ‘march of the makers’ – an economic recovery led by manufacturing . industry boosting exports and investment spending. It . comes after latest figures from the Office for National Statistics . revealed that a slump in exports had led to a huge increase in the UK’s . current account deficit – the difference between what Britain . earns from abroad and what it pays out to overseas countries.

Thousands of people living in the shadow of this looming Mexican volcano have been placed on high alert following a dramatic increase in seismic activity from the Popocatepetl crater. The 17,886ft active volcano near Mexico City, known as Popo, rumbled and shook during the night on Saturday, and has been spewing ash, lava and steam in recent days. Officials have closed off an exclusion zone around the cone of the volcano and are poised to evacuate towns in its foothills as experts warned of plumes of steam reaching more than half a mile into the sky above the crater.

'Increased activity': The National Center for Disaster Prevention has elevated its warning level to Yellow Stage 3 - the fifth rung on a seven stage scale - after the Mexican volcano began spewing lava, ash and gases . Authorities have alerted town in two central states as well as the capital, after Mexico's National Disaster Prevention Center elevated its alert level to Yellow Phase 3 - the fifth rung on a seven-stage warning scale. Should the alert level rise thousands of people could be evacuated from the most vulnerable villages in the shadow of the peak. Shelters have been set up in case authorities are forced to evacuate residents. A seven-square-mile exclusion zone has been imposed around the cone of the volcano, and soldiers and federal police have been deployed to the area amid fears of further, more violent eruptions from Popo.

A 22-year-old Connecticut man has admitted to police he used a fire poker and then a buck knife to ruthlessly gut his own mother and pull out her intestines on Thursday. A chilling police report shows that Robert Owen Rankin of Deep River didn’t know exactly what all the guts and gore he pulled from his mother Margaret Rohner, 45, were, but he knew why he was doing it. ‘I don't know exactly what the stuff was, like octopus tentacles,’ he would coolly recount to police. ‘I killed my mother because she is pretty much responsible for everything that has gone wrong in my life.’ Praying for help? Robert Owen Rankin, 22, confessed to police that he awoke Thursday morning and then viciously slaughtered his own mother. This is the last picture of the  Connecticut man, posted to Facebook on Christmas Day, on day before the alleged murder . Slaughtered: Margaret Rohner was allegedly disemboweled by her own son on the day after Christmas and found naked and sliced open at the bottom of the stairs of her own Deep River, Connecticut home . The gruesome events began to unfold Thursday morning at Rohner’s home. Rankin allegedly detailed the unfathomable act first to his father and then the state trooper who initially encountered the horrific scene. Rankin said he woke up with a plan to snap his mother’s neck, reports NBC Connecticut. He said she began to scream as soon as he'd wrapped his arms around her throat. When that didn’t work, he said he fetched a fire poker and hit or stabbed her in the neck before continuing to choke her.

He said he stabbed her at the belly button with a buck knife and sliced upwards. Once she 'stopped screaming,' Rankin said he then removed his mother's clothes. ‘I just want you to know that she put up a damn good fight,’ court documents say Rankin told his father. ‘ She is a strong woman.  I give her credit for that.’ Bizarre: Rankin said he pulled out his mother's intestines and stomach 'see if there was a baby' Police say Rankin coolly recounted the gruesome tale after first confessing to his father Robert Rankin Sr, who then called Connecticut State Troopers .

Conservators in the Antarctic have discovered a box full of negatives taken by the ill-fated Ross Sea Party between 1914 and 1917, preserved in ice. A team from the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust restoring an old exploration camp discovered the clumped-together cellulose nitrate negatives in a small box in Captain Robert Falcon Scott's Cape Evans hut. The Ross Sea Party was marooned in 1915 after their ship broke free of its mooring during a storm. They weren't rescued until 1917. Ross Island: Alexander Stevens, chief scientist and geologist looks south with Hut Point Peninsula in the background . On ice: This photo was taken from the deck of the Aurora looking South to Hut Point Peninsula . Stranded: This photo is from a group adhered together and found in Captain Scott's 1911 expedition base, Cape Evans, Antarctica, by Antarctic Heritage Trust (NZ) conservators . The hut was established by Scott for his . doomed Terre Nova Expedition to the South Pole. Scott and his team died . in 1913 of starvation and cold on their return trip. It was next used by the Ross Sea Party to leave supplies for famed explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. It's believed the Ross Sea Party's photographer took the photographs, which were never processed. That mission failed when their ship, the Aurora, broke free of its moorings and left 10 members of the Ross Sea Party stranded. Ill-fated: Members of the Ross Sea Party before they were stranded in Antarctica . Artist's interpretation: This depiction of Ross Sea Party members was drawn and painted, probably by George Marshall, from material supplied to the artist by surviving members of the Ross Sea Party . They were marooned until 1917, enduring illness, psychological trauma and extreme weather. Despite their misfortune, the team set about its work anyway, laying supplies down for Shackleton's crossing. What they did not know was that their efforts were in vain. Broke free: The Aurora was intended to be the Ross Sea Party's main accommodation but broke free of its moorings during a blizzard, stranding 10 men . Shackleton had been forced to abandon his crossing after his ship, the Endurance, was crushed in pack ice. Exhausted, frostbitten and suffering from scurvy, five members of the team became stranded at Hut Point after successfully depositing supplies for Shackleton's mission. The ice was too thin to risk a return to Cape Evans and they subsisted on a diet of seal meat until two of the team decided to risk the ice. The pair were never seen again. A third member succumbed to the conditions and was buried in the ice. The remaining three at last reunited with the other four party members and were finally rescued by Shackleton aboard a restored Aurora in 1917. It was only then that they discovered the futility of their efforts in laying the stores for the journey that never happened. The conservation team from the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust separated the negatives and discovered 22 images. Many of them were badly damaged but the Trust says many landmarks around McMurdo Sound are recognizable. Preserved: This photo of Alexander Stevens, Chief Scientist, on board the Aurora, as part of Ernest Shackleton's Ross Sea Party, had never been seen before conservators discovered century-old negatives in Antarctica . Nigel Watson, Antarctic Heritage Trust's executive director, said the new photos are a historic treasure. 'It's an exciting find and we are delighted to see them exposed after a century,' Watson said. The photographs show new views of Ross Island, McMurdo Sound, and two pictures of the expedition's chief scientist Alexander Stevens, linking them definitively to the Ross Sea Party expedition and not the earlier Terre Nova Expedition.","Conservators in Antarctica have discovered negatives almost 100 years old .

'a huge loss': Friend Harold Cook says the shooting death of Patti Wheelington (pictured) is a loss the community may never recover from . A community is reeling after jealousy led an Arkansas women to shoot dead the most popular member of the 300-person strong square dance club where both danced. Virginia Hyatt, 65, gunned down Patti Wheelington, 59, earlier this month after years of making accusations that the well-liked widow was making moves on her husband, sources said. A mutual friend who spoke MailOnline says Ms Hyatt was jealous of any woman who danced with her husband, and that jealousy came to a head shortly after husband James filed for divorce. Ms Wheelington was shot dead in her home by Mrs Hyatt, authorities told KSLA. The beloved woman’s body was found Dec 3 outside her Texarkana home. Authorities declined to go into further detail about how the two women knew each other, but did say evidence shows the slaying was planned in advance. ‘There appears to be a significant amount of premeditation and deliberation in this act they knew each other potentially socially and right know that is as much as I need to say about it,’ Miller County prosecuting attorney Carlton Jones told the station. Mr Jones said the death was the final act in a dispute between the two, but mutual friend Harvey Cook vigorously refuted those claims to MailOnline, instead saying it was all one sided. ‘There was not any kind of dispute between the two,’ said Mr Cook, ‘Patti did everything in the world to try to solve this problem she had.’ Better times: Ms Wheelington pictured with late husband Ray Wheelington . The problem, according to Mr Cook, was that Ms Hyatt became jealous of any woman that went near husband James. A call to Mr Jones' office seeking comment was not answered . That posed another problem, as the Guys n’ Dolls square dancing club the two women were members of paired experienced partners with novice partners of the opposite sex – leading to tension between the accused killer and most other female members. Ms Hyatt singled out Ms Wheelington, according to Mr Cook, because she was the most popular woman in the club. Her jealousy was kicked into overdrive after husband James filed for divorce earlier this year and moved in with his sister, Mr Cook noted. Accused killer: Virginia Hyatt, 65, has been charged with capital murder in the killing . Making matters worse, the group all socialized together. They played cards, went out to eat, went on outings together – they were very close, according to Mr Cook. James Hyatt was very close with Ms Wheelington’s husband, who died a few years ago. Soon after his death, suspicion began to creep in. Fellow dance club members tried to convince her otherwise, but she would not have it. The well-off Ms Wheelington was looked up to by many in the group for her extensive charity work and generosity in the community, said Mr Cook. ‘She donated to charities… she’d give you the shirt off her back, if you were hungry she’d feed you,’ he added. Instead, she’s gone, and Ms Hyatt is currently sitting in Miller County Correctional Facility facing a capital murder charge. If convicted, she could face the death penalty. ‘Patti is away from us way too soon,’ said Mr Cook. ‘I don’t know if our club will recover from it.’","Virginia Hyatt, 65, killed Patti Wheelington, 59, after accusing husband James Hyatt of cheating with the woman .

Games of naked tennis are played on the courts and there is a ‘dungeon’ in the cellar where guests are more likely to be found in bondage or fetish gear than in business suits or evening dress. The new role for Rockwood House was revealed as it is being offered for sale – with a plan to say goodbye to all the hanky-panky and build an ultra-modern, £8.9million home in place of the forlorn-looking mansion. Mrs Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari bought the house in 1995. It later embroiled them in controversy amid accusations it was paid for with money from illegal kickbacks Mr Zardari received from government contracts. Past owner: When former Pakistani president Bhutto owned the house it boasted a £120,000 Lalique glass table . Benazir Bhutto's £9million Surrey mansion is secret location for £450-a-couple sex parties with naked tennis and a dungeon . Mrs Bhutto’s government was dismissed for ‘corruption, misrule and nepotism’. She was assassinated in 2007. The mansion in Witney, near Godalming, was sold for £4million in 2004 and now has barely a trace of the Bhuttos’ residence there, save for some golden doorways and an ornate roof painted to resemble a night sky. The tenant of the house has been renting it out for sex parties, advertised only days in advance and with tickets costing up to £450 each. The most recent event, in August, was a two-day ‘mini festival of sin’ organised by events company Little Liaisons. It was billed as ‘a full weekend of activities and adventures for pure unadulterated hedonism . . . a walk on the wild side.’ The schedule of options listed naked tennis, sex in the pool, ‘naughty walks’ in the woods, plus open-air sex around a large bonfire, in the hot tubs or in the forest. Little Liaison, which organised last month's orgy, promised guests 'pure unadulterated hedonism' (posed by model) Yesterday the tenant, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This is not a venue. ‘This is a private home, where I occasionally hold private events for a range of open-minded and wonderful people. ‘The majority of events that I hold here are musical events, or wonderful charity events. Yes, there have been events of a sexual nature, but I don’t see why that is anything for people to be ashamed about. ‘Everything that takes place is within the law and the authorities have absolutely no concern. Why should shame be attached to sexuality? ‘These are happy events – not some of the cocaine-fuelled private parties that probably take place all over the county.’ The house is being marketed by Sotheby’s as a ‘development opportunity’. Projected plans suggest the new house is unlikely to have any secrets to hide. It appears to be made almost entirely of glass.","Rockwood House near Guildford was owned by Bhutto from 1995 - 2004 .
