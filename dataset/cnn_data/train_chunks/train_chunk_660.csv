Flashing a bra strap a bit risque for you? Then you might want to avert your gaze now - if the catwalks are anything to go by. Judging by the latest lines from top designers, next season the streets are going to be full of women wandering around in skimpy nighties, barely-there camisoles and all manner of lingerie-inspired looks. Louis Vuitton's new collection is influenced by 'hotel boudoirs', while Dolce & Gabbana's campaign features barely-clad models. Jean Paul Gaultier has sent girls down the runway in slips and corsets and Ellie Saab has dreamy white nightie-like dresses. Always at the forefront of a trend, Victoria Beckham showcased the look at the recent Wimbledon final (right). The fashionista sported one of those bedroom chic Louis Vuitton numbers: a black, lacy slip dress that looked as if it were suitable for only the most intimate of situations. It might be Mrs B's style - but can the rest of us really wear underwear masquerading as outerwear? Or will we always run the risk of looking as if we're emulating mid-Nineties Madonna - or have forgotten the rest of our outfit? While the High Street versions of the catwalk looks won't hit stores until autumn, we wondered if you could get away with wearing genuine underwear as outerwear.

The estranged wife of George Zimmerman faced news cameras with her lawyer on Wednesday to insist that she thought her husband had a gun when she called 911 during a domestic dispute on Monday. Shellie Zimmerman's lawyer also explained that she isn't pressing charges because she just wants to get a divorce and move on. 'Shellie Zimmerman wants this relationship to end with a whimper and not a bang,' Orlando attorney Kelly Sims said. Shellie stood quietly by her attorney's side for the 40-minute news conference. She did not speak at the request of Sims. The estranged wife of George Zimmerman, Shellie Zimmerman, faced news cameras with her lawyer (right) on Wednesday . Shellie Zimmerman's lawyer also explained that she isn't pressing charges because she just wants to get a divorce and move on. The news conference was held as MailOnline reported that George Zimmerman has been accused of cheating on his wife a second time since his acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin. The first woman was his ex-fiancée. The second woman, Samantha Scheibe, was by his side on Monday afternoon at the Zimmermans' marital home when Shellie confronted her husband over his serial infidelity as they split their belongings days after she filed for divorce. At the end of her 911 call she can be heard shouting: 'There's a woman in there!' A source close to the couple told MailOnline: ‘George took off after the acquittal and struck up an affair with his ex-fiancée but now he’s got a new girlfriend, a blonde woman who was there that afternoon. He brought her back to Shellie’s father’s place. Calm before the storm: Florida police today . released text messages between Zimmerman and his wife in which they seem . to be attempting to ensure they don't bump into each other in the hours . leading up to the incident . Former flame: Veronica Zuazo, 31, also rekindled . her romance with Zimmerman after their engagement broke off in acrimony . more than five years ago . Second affair? Police today said a woman called . Samantha Scheibe was in Zimmerman's car when he confronted estranged . wife Shellie on Monday . ‘She was there at the domestic [dispute]. The audacity of the guy is unbelievable. None of his friends know where his head is.’ MailOnline revealed earlier this week that Zimmerman had an affair with former fiancee Veronica Zuazo, 31, sometime after his acquittal in July. Injuries: David Dean, Shellie Zimmerman's father, sustained a cut nose in the altercation . The existence of a second lover emerged on the day that police revealed it could be months before Shellie and her husband learn if either of them will face charges in relation to the altercation. Surveillance footage taken outside the home - which the couple previously shared - shows George Zimmerman holding an iPad as he is approached by police. He then throws it to the ground. Officers believe it contains vital evidence and have handed it to experts to see what can be retrieved - causing the delay. In the hours following the dispute which, according to Lake Mary Police Department Officer Zach Hudson, rapidly deteriorated into a ‘typical “he said, she said” domestic’ conflicting versions emerged. The police report reveals that when Shellie had arrived to pick up her belongings, he started taking pictures, so Shellie started recording on the iPad. The meeting quickly escalated when Zimmerman stuck his hand in her father's truck, the report said. Shellie heard her father, David Dean, yelling and then found her 'father's glasses on the floor and a red mark on his nose'. It states Zimmerman then took her iPad and she felt 'shocked, powerless and shaken' when Zimmerman smashed the iPAd and used a knife to pry it open before throwing it on the ground. It went on: '(Zimmerman) reached his hand into his shirt to what she assumed was a gun when (Zimmerman) said to her father, ""step closer"".' The police were called and Mr Dean then said to Zimmerman: 'What are you going to do, shoot me?'. Evidence: Shellie Zimmerman's buckled iPad is believed to have captured footage of the dispute . Shellie’s initial panic-stricken 911 call also suggested that her estranged husband was threatening her and her father with a gun. Pictures have also emerged of Mr Dean with a cut nose. Shellie claimed in her 911 call that Zimmerman had punched him. However, Mr Dean has said he doesn't want to bring charges. In retaliation, Zimmerman has claimed that Shellie was the aggressor and she too could face charges. He claims in the police report that he was being hit with the iPad, so he snatched it away. The heated fight began after Shellie . and her father went to collect her belongings from the house on Monday, . just days after she filed for divorce, claiming the six-year marriage . was 'irretrievably broken'. On . Tuesday, a new video revealed the dramatic moment police swarmed . Zimmerman's car and ordered him to get down on his knees before taking . him into custody after the altercation. When police arrived on the scene of the argument, which had allegedly turned violent, Zimmerman was in the driver's seat of his car. Caught on camera: Surveillance footage shows George Zimmerman, left, speaking with officers before throwing his estranged wife's iPad to the ground. The device has been circled . Police ordered him out of his car and shouted for him to raise his hands, turn around and walk backwards toward them. By the time he appeared to be about 20 feet away, police shouted 'Get on your knees! Lock your feet!' Zimmerman dropped to his knees and two officers approached, one with his gun drawn, while the other handcuffed him. Then several other officers ran toward the house where the dispute allegedly took place. The video was first reported by TMZ. Caught: In this image from dash-cam video provided by the Lake Mary police, George Zimmerman is detained by officers outside the home on Monday afternoon. He walked back with his hands held up . Cuffed: Zimmerman is detained by police officers who questioned him before letting him go .

O'Mara . said that his client did nothing wrong on Monday afternoon but added that he was no longer going . to represent Zimmerman due to their impending divorce.

Network Rail was today found guilty of causing a fatal train crash at a level crossing after a signalman wrongly lifted the barrier - because he was distracted by a phone call. Jane Harding, 52, was killed when her car was struck by the passenger train at 61mph and dragged 150 yards down the track near Moreton-on-Lugg, Herefordshire. Her husband Mark, who was driving the black Volkswagen Touareg, suffered shoulder and pelvic injuries but survived the crash on January 16, 2010. Network Rail was today found . guilty of failing in its duty of care by not installing an approach locking . system which could have prevented the tragedy. Signalman Adrian Maund was also found guilty . of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other . people likely to be affected by his actions or omissions at work. Tragedy: Jane Harding was hit while crossing the track by car after Adrian Maund lifted the barriers too early . Birmingham Crown Court heard . how Maund had been distracted from his duties after he received a . phone call from a farmer who asked permission to herd his flock of . sheep across the tracks. It was then the 43-year-old wrongly . lifted the barriers because he thought the Manchester to Milford Haven . train had already passed the crossing. Maund only realised his fatal mistake . when he saw the train approaching at 80mph around the corner - when he . frantically tried to lower the barriers and change the signal. The court heard that while human error was to blame for the crash, Network Rail bosses . refused to spend £40,000 on a simple safety device that would have . prevented the crash but were too concerned about the cost. The company was today found . guilty of failing in its duty of care of the health and safety of . railway and railway crossing users by not installing an approach locking . system. Signalman Adrian Maund was distracted by a call from a farmer asking if he could herd sheep across the tracks at Moreton-on-Lugg . Meanwhile, Maund was also found guilty . of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other . people likely to be affected by his actions or omissions at work. During a three week trial, the jury were told Network Rail refused to install the safety system because it was too expensive. Prosecutor Phillip Mott QC said: . 'Network Rail took the decision not to install this device because it . would cost £40,000 - that device could have saved a life. 'An approach locking system has been . around since the 1960s and can be used to stop signals being changed . when trains are still coming through. 'In 2009 there was quite a lot of . work done at the Moreton crossing and the barriers were replaced because . the mechanism was getting old. 'There were discussions to have an approach locking device which were rejected. Smash: The court heard that a £40,000 safety device might have prevented the mother's death . 'Why not put in this approach-locking device? 'The reason was ""money"". Was the cost too great to avoid the cost of a human life?' The jury heard Maund became distracted when a farmer rang his signal box. Mrs Harding was travelling with her husband Mark when their car was hit by the train on January 16, 2010 . In a police interview Maund said he . lifted the barriers because he wrongly believed the train had already . passed as cars were waiting at the crossing. But tragically, train driver Andrew Robins had too little time to react and struck two cars at 61mph. Mother-of-one Mrs Harding, a hairdresser from Marden, Herefordshire, was killed but her husband survived. Carol-Anne Thornewell and her . 12-year-old daughter who were travelling in a separate gold Vauxhall . Astra also walked away from the smash. Speaking after the case, Jayne Salt, . Head of the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service’s Complex Casework . Unit, said: 'Adrian Maund and Network Rail both played very different . parts in the tragic death of Jane Harding. 'Mr Maund made a mistake in raising the level crossing barriers when a train was approaching. 'Whilst his was a momentary error, . his failure to follow procedures and checks, as he had been trained to . do, has rightly resulted in his conviction. 'His employers, on the other hand, . made a deliberate decision not to install a safety device which would . have detected the oncoming train and kept the barriers down. That . decision was based on cost. 'It is right that an organisation . that holds the safety of the public in its hands on a daily basis has . been held to account for its decision making. 'My thoughts are with Mrs Harding’s family and I hope that this result gives them some small measure of comfort.' Judge Melbourne Inman QC bailed Maund and ordered him to return to court for sentencing on April 10.

To borrow the vernacular of the high-powered Wall Street banking circles in which she now moves, Lauren Silverman bears the look of someone who has ‘bagged the elephant’. After all, the prospect of being the mother to Simon Cowell’s first child will, one imagines, open many doors in the glitzy social strata she has made it her business to frequent, not to mention access to the X Factor mogul’s £225million fortune. Certainly Florida-born Lauren gives every indication of knowing exactly where she is going: Upwards. Friends in the US describe her as ‘determined and ambitious’. Which, depending on whom you believe, could be a euphemism for a gold digger who’ll let nothing and nobody stop her rise to notoriety and money. Whatever the case, there are a couple of spanners in the works. Last night sources close to Cowell were making it plain that he has no intention of marrying her. One of his friends said: ‘Simon and Lauren are in a relationship, they are very happy – she’s been good for him. They are a couple and Simon will just pay for their child. He will step up and be a part of the life of the child… but Simon is saying privately that he has absolutely no plans to marry Lauren.’ Then there is the small matter of the fact she is still married to her banker and property developer husband of ten years, Andrew Silverman. But not for much longer. A furious Silverman has filed divorce papers in New York which name Cowell as her lover and accuse his wife of ‘cruel and inhuman treatment’. The prospect of an imminent divorce is, no doubt, a relief to 37-year-old Mr Silverman’s highly respectable and wealthy parents, . Eleonora and Allen. They were said to be so aghast at their son’s choice . of bride that they refused to attend the wedding in 2003 in the . fabulously elegant old-money confines of the St Regis hotel in . Manhattan’s Midtown. ‘Andrew’s parents did not approve of who she was,’ a source close to the Silvermans said last night.Allen Silverman is a chief executive officer of the family’s New York-based Andalex Group property company. His . company literature says he has ‘instilled his strong family values and . unimpeachable standards’ in his sons Andrew and Alexander. Sources close . to the family say it was just these morals that lay behind their . suspicion of Lauren. So what was it about Lauren that put . this well-to-do family’s teeth on edge? In a word, money. She seems to . have revelled in it, and the access to high society it brought her. But . undeterred by her in-laws’ disapproval, Lauren – who has a . seven-year-old son, Adam, with Silverman – continued her rise through . the ranks of New York’s wealthy and connected. Fears: . Simon Cowell could be forced to reveal financial details of his life in . his pregnant lover Lauren Silverman's divorce battle with her estranged . husband Andrew . She was brought up in comfortable, upper-middle-class surroundings. Her father, Steven Davis, 61, is an accountant, who lives with his new wife, Rosy, in Florida. Lauren’s mother is Carole Davis, 60, an estate agent who has also remarried. A rapid social climb such as Lauren’s is likely to rub some people up the wrong way. At the apartment on New York’s exclusive Upper East Side where she lived with Silverman until she moved out last month, she was, by all accounts, far from popular. Yesterday, one well-heeled neighbour dismissively described her as ‘a diva princess since she met Andrew’. Another resident at the £4million high-rise reportedly hissed: ‘She is the troublemaker. She is very insecure.’ Lauren’s mother Carole jumped to her defence yesterday, saying: ‘She’s a nice girl. Things happen in life. Her marriage was not a marriage made in heaven. My daughter is a wonderful girl and a wonderful mother.’ She spoke out after claims emerged that her daughter has already allegedly issued Cowell with a string of demands, telling him she wants marriage, her own reality TV show and – oddly – a house in the Cotswolds before she will allow him access to the child. Close: Simon Cowell appearing to kiss Lauren Silverman on a yacht off the coast of St Tropez, France in August 2012 . More than just friends? Reports claim the couple's romance has been going on since at least 2012. Her husband believed the romance started in the spring . Certainly, for all her soon-to-be ex-husband’s wealth – though significantly it is Andrew’s father who owns the Manhattan flat where the couple lived – it is clear Cowell is another large step up the financial ladder. Lauren grew up in a smart but less than grand £650,000 family home in suburban Hallandale Beach, Florida, and attended Miami Country Day School, which is private and costs £19,000 a year. Her desire to get on is, seemingly, in the genes. For several years her mother has taken a three-month summer rental on a seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom house in the upmarket enclave of Bridgehampton, in New York state. Lauren is currently holidaying there with her son. The Hamptons, where the likes of Sir Paul McCartney have homes, has given the Davis clan access to rich neighbours – rather higher society than the daughter of an accountant and estate agent might be expected to inhabit. What is confusing many of their friends is just how Silverman was able, apparently, to be so blind about the emerging relationship between his wife and Cowell. It was Andrew Silverman who introduced Cowell to her in 2006 at the Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados, where the 53-year-old music mogul spends every New Year, and the three struck up an instant friendship. In January 2012, Lauren and Andrew were photographed aboard Slipstream, the yacht Cowell rents for his twice-yearly holidays. Then in August 2012 Lauren joined Cowell on Slipstream again with his harem of women, including Lauren’s best friend, fashion designer Rachel Roy, and Cowell’s ex, the singer Sinitta, in St Tropez. Snapshot: A picture posted online by Lauren Silverman of herself in a bikini, snuggling with Simon Cowell on his yacht during a holiday . As they were: It appears that the divorce battle between Lauren and Andrew could turn into an ugly one . And a few months ago, Lauren posted photos of herself in a bikini on the yacht during another trip off St Bart’s in January. Yesterday, a close friend of Lauren’s blamed the breakdown of her marriage and her growing closeness to Cowell on her husband frequently travelling abroad for business. Mzia Shiman, who has known her for ten years, said Silverman and the pop mogul had been best friends for years but that their feelings for each other had only recently changed. ‘They were close friends and then one day it turned into something else,’ said Shiman. ‘Lauren didn’t plan any of this. It’s not some kind of trick. I know one thing for sure, they are in love with each other. I hope they will get married and be happy for ever.’ Shiman, who owns a day spa in Manhattan, said she saw Silverman a week ago. ‘She told me she was pregnant with Simon’s baby. She was glowing. ‘I said, “Lauren, are you happy?” and she said, “Yes, I’m thrilled”. She told me Simon is happy to have a child. She was a little bit stressed, of course, because it’s a difficult situation. But she is in love and she is happy.’ Shiman says her friend is different from the other women Cowell surrounds himself with. ‘Lauren never took anything from Simon, she never expected anything. I think that’s why, for Simon, Lauren is special,’ she said. ‘Women have always been jealous of her. She’s beautiful, she’s married to a millionaire. She has a driver, and a house here [in New York] and in the Hamptons. Andrew is a rich man and she is used to this life.’ Revelation: Lauren, seen here in Bridgehampton, New York, on Thursday . Blooming: Lauren is said to be around 10 weeks . into the pregnancy, and displayed he growing figure in a black maxi . dress as she headed out . Shiman added that her friend will be a ‘wonderful mother’ to Cowell’s baby. Be that as it may, only days before she conceived Cowell’s child he was still denying their relationship even existed. Two months ago, Cowell instructed his high-profile US attorney, Marty Singer, to issue a forceful statement to an American celebrity blogger denying a relationship. Singer wrote: ‘Any implication or statement that my client is engaged in adultery and has allegedly broken up the marriage of Ms Silverman is not only false but reckless.’ He added: ‘Stating my client’s relationship with Lauren Silverman has become more serious such that she is now getting a divorce so that Simon and she can be together ... is false and defamatory.’ All of which now makes Cowell look a bit silly. One thing that’s for sure, however, is that he will have his hands full with his social climbing and fiercely ambitious pregnant lover.","Lauren Silverman is a rapid social climber who doesn't mind 'rubbing people up the wrong way'

The two-year-old. the Queen's great-granddaughter, is the eldest child of Zara’s brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and sister to one year old Isla. Zara has given her two-year-old niece Savannah (right) a Shetland pony, perhaps hoping to pass on her own love of horses to the next generation . Zara checked that Savannah was enjoying herself at the Badminton Horse Trials earlier this month . Despite her young age, Savannah is apparently already enamored with her gift. According to reports in The Telegraph her father Peter said: ‘Zara was insistent on giving her a little Shetland pony. ‘Savannah loves riding him. So yes, it seems we’ve passed the 'horse gene’ on to the next generation.’ The Shetland pony is a miniature breed of pony originating in the Shetland Isles, ranging in height from around 28 inches to 11 hands, making them perfect for small rider. It is not clear exactly what prompted the 32 year-old royal to make such a generous gift, but a love of riding and horses traditionally runs right through the heart of the royal family, particularly the women. Zara’s nieces are already some of her biggest fans when it comes to her riding career. Both girls joined their parents at the Badminton Horse Trials earlier this month. The 31-year old equestrian's brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn took both their young daughters Savannah, two, and one-year-old Isla to watch their aunt compete . Savannah, two, looked particularly enamored as she watched her aunt ride, and now with her own pony she can begin to foster the 'horse gene' herself . Zara, who attended the Chelsea Flower show last week and cut the cake as the show celebrates its 100th birthday (right) is obviously very close to her niece Savannah (seen on her father Peter's shoulders, left) The girls, who are 12th and 13th in line for the throne, played in the sunshine as they watched their aunt Zara, compete. Zara, who is married to English rugby player Mike Tindall, posted a dressage score of 44.3 penalties at the event that kept her firmly in touch with the leading group. However despite her success in the sport, the young royal has not been shirking her other royal duties. The Shetland pony is a miniature breed of pony originating in the Shetland Isles, ranging in height from around 28 inches to 11 hands, making them perfect for small rider . She, like other members of the Royal family including Princes Charles and Harry and the Queen, attended the Chelsea Flower Show last week. Though she confessed she is not a big gardener herself, she spoke of how he grandmother is an inspiration to her . Zara says: ‘When you've got such inspirational ladies in your family, it's kind of hard not to be like that. My grandmother's like that, and her mother before her, and my mum.’ And now it looks like little Savannah is set to follow in the (pony) steps of the Windsor women.","Two-year-old Savannah is daughter of Zara's brother Peter and wife Autumn .

An innocent man spent five months in jail falsely accused of rape following a DNA blunder. Adam Scott, 20, was arrested after a plastic tray containing a sample of his saliva was re-used by a forensics company. It meant his saliva was wrongly linked to a violent attack on a woman in Manchester – carried out when he was hundreds of miles away in Plymouth. Yesterday a report by the forensics watchdog found he was the ‘innocent victim of avoidable contamination’. The Forensic Science Regulator said the lack of records meant it was impossible to work out which laboratory technician was behind the mistake – meaning they are likely to have kept their job. The watchdog has allowed the firm, LGC Forensics, to keep its licence despite fears of other miscarriages of justice. Mr Scott had been arrested and a saliva sample taken after a street fight. But the tray holding his DNA was re-used for the rape test and a positive match showed up. He was arrested by Greater Manchester Police, despite never having been to the city. The only evidence was forensic but despite his denials he was charged and remanded into custody on October 23 last year. He was only released on May 7 when the case was withdrawn following an investigation. Phone records showed he was 300 miles away on the south coast when the rape took place. Upon his release in May Mr Scott, from Exmouth, Devon, said he had endured a ‘living nightmare’. He said: ‘I am furious at the pain it put me and my family through.’ ‘They kept me in a segregation wing which was full of rapists and paedophiles. ‘I suffered lots of verbal abuse and other inmates spitting at us and shouting “paedos”.’ Mix-up: A saliva test from Mr Scott taken in Plymouth was re-used during an investigation of an attack on a young woman in Manchester . The blunder came despite the firm detecting an earlier, similar error. The real rapist has still not been caught. Regulator . Andrew Rennison said: ‘The contamination was the result of human error . by a technician who failed to follow basic procedures for the disposal . of plastic trays. ‘The . procedures themselves were not adequate, leading to no records . maintained by the technicians and nothing done to mark used trays. These errors were compounded by the failure at LGC to consider the . possibility of contamination despite concerns expressed by the . investigating officer.’ Ministers . have been criticised over the decision to close the Government-funded . Forensic Science Service and hand the work over to the private sector. Critics claim this will lead to more miscarriages of justice in future. Mr . Scott’s solicitor, Philippa Jefferies, of Rundle Walker Solicitors, . said she was ‘dumb-struck that this could happen’. She told the BBC . yesterday: ‘I’m sure [LGC] is very, very sorry it’s happened because . it’s a black stain – a terrible fundamental error. ‘Being . responsible for processing DNA material that may result in convicting . or acquitting a defendant, it must be of paramount importance . safeguarding issues [are taken seriously].’ LGC Forensics said it deeply regretted the incident.","Adam Scott was arrested over an attack in Manchester, despite never having been there .

"PUBLISHED: . 01:02 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:02 EST, 4 August 2013 . A former employee of Florida State Attorney Angela Corey's office is suing the prosecutor, claiming he was illegally fired after he testified on behalf of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin murder trial. Ben Kruidbos, the former director of information technology for Corey's office, is seeking more than $5million in damages in the lawsuit filed in Jacksonville, according to a legal documents. Kruidbos was fired after testifying at a pre-trial hearing June 6 that he believed prosecutors had failed to turn over to the defense, as required by evidence-sharing laws, potentially embarrassing evidence extracted from Martin's cell phone. Wrongful termination: Ben Kruidbos (left) is suing Florida State Attorney Angela Corey (right) for more than $5million in damages, claiming that he was fired after he testified on behalf of George Zimmerman . His lawyer, Wesley White, said last month that he would file a whistleblower action. This week he filed a separate complaint to the Florida Commission on Human Relations seeking whistleblower status, which could result in the second lawsuit, White said. White said the lawsuit against Corey, which was filed on Thursday, cited a statute that makes it illegal to fire someone for their testimony when it is given under subpoena. Kruidbos was subpoenaed by the Zimmerman defense team. ‘I cannot find a single other case of that statute being litigated,’ said White. ‘Normally people wouldn't do something like that, fire somebody as a result of testifying pursuant to subpoena,’ Said White, a former prosecutor who worked with Corey. Under fire: Corey has been criticized by legal experts for unsuccessfully prosecuting Zimmerman, whose defense team also called for sanctions against her . The action is expected to add to pressure already on Corey, who has been criticized by legal experts for unsuccessfully prosecuting Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer acquitted July 13 of murder and manslaughter charges in the shooting death of the unarmed teen. Zimmerman's defense has also called for sanctions against her and her prosecution team. Corey's office said it would not comment on the lawsuit but re-issued Kruidbos' termination letter, in which her office accused him of hacking confidential information from state computers. The six-page letter, dated July 11, charged Kruidbos with ‘deliberate, willful and unscrupulous actions’ that make him untrustworthy and ‘a shallow, but obvious, attempt to cloak yourself in the protection of the whistleblower law.’ Photos from Trayvon Martin's cell phone showed the slain Florida teenager blowing smoke rings, a gun and what appears to be a marijuana plant . He testified during a hearing on June 6 that Martin's cell phone contained images of the 17-year-old blowing smoke, images of marijuana and deleted text messages regarding a transaction for a firearm and that those images had not been given to Zimmerman's defense team. He received the termination letter the same day jurors began deliberating Zimmerman's case. The letter states: 'It has come to our attention that you violated numerous State Attorney's Office (SAO) policies and procedures and have engaged in deliberate misconduct that is especially egregious in light of your position.' George Zimmerman with his defense team, Mark O'Mara, left, and Don West, while waiting for jury arrival in the courtroom on Saturday morning . Attorney Wesley White said Kruidbos wasn't surprised by the firing. He had been on paid administrative leave since May 28 from his job as director of information technology for the State Attorney's Office. Kruidbos said that, when he printed a 900-page Florida Department of Law Enforcement report from Martin's cell phone in late 2012 or early 2013, he noticed information was missing. Concerned that attorneys did not have all the information they needed to prepare the case, he said, he reported his concerns to a State Attorney's Office investigator and later to prosecutor Bernie de la Rionda. Kruidbos said he generated a report that was more than three times the size of the one that had been handed over. For example, Kruidbos said that 2,958 photos were in the report given to the defense but that his report contained 4,275 photos. Gun: A photo of a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun was retrieved from Martin's cell phone . The images on Martin's phone included this photo of what appears to be a marijuana plant . Through his attorney, Wesley White, Kruidbos informed Zimmerman's defense team that the information existed. In court, Kruidbos testified that he was concerned that he could be held liable if all information wasn't shared. 'All the information is important in the process to ensure it's a fair trial,' he said. In a six-page dismissal letter, the State Attorney's Office, Fourth Judicial Circuit, blasted Kruidbos' assertions and motivations. Managing Director Cheryl Peek accused Kruidbos of having erased data from a laptop in violation of the Public Records Law and derided his concern about being held liable as 'feigned and spurious' and 'nothing more than shameful manipulation in a shallow, but obvious, attempt to cloak yourself in the protection of the whistleblower law.' Trayvon Martin's cell phone which he was using to speak to Rachel Jeantel when he was attacked . She concluded, 'Because of your deliberate, willful and unscrupulous actions, you can never again be trusted to step foot in this office. Your have left us with no choice but to terminate your employment.' Zimmerman's attorneys were seeking sanctions against the state for not properly turning over the evidence from Martin's phone. O'Mara and co-counsel Don West argued that they needed more time to go through the information found on Martin's phone and asked for a delay, which was denied. Judge Debra Nelson said she would revisit the possibility of sanctions at the trial's end.","In his termination letter Ben Kruidbos was accused of violating state attorney office policies and procedures .

The auction takes place before the ponies swim back to Assateague Island later this week.

The short burst of stormy weather stopped just in time for the pony parade carnival, which saw them trek two miles down the street to their corral . Several devastating fires had occurred during the early 1900s, and since Chincoteague Island was isolated from the mainland with no bridges, the town needed protection. They were able to raise money for fire equipment by holding the pony auction. The swim and auction also help to manage the number of wild horses on Assateague and prevent them from adversely impacting on the sensitive barrier island ecology.                                                                                                                      Source: www.assateagueisland.com .","Event marked 88th Chincoteague Pony Swim off the coast of Virginia .

A Pittsburgh zoo where a two-year-old boy died after being mauled in a wild African dogs exhibit has accused the toddler's mom of being at fault for the tragic death. Maddox Derkosh died on Nov. 4 when he fell over a 4-foot-tall railing into the exhibit after his mom had lifted him up to get a better look. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium has accused mom Elizabeth Derkosh of negligence in a claim filed on Monday in response to a lawsuit brought by her and husband Jason Derkosh seeking unspecified damages from the zoo for their son's death. Scroll down for video . Tragic accident: Maddox Derkosh, two, was killed after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium last November . At fault? The zoo claims mom Elizabeth Derkosh, center, was at fault for her son's death and that she shouldn't be allowed to sue them . The zoo said in the court filing that Maddox's death was 'caused solely by the carelessness, negligence and/or recklessness of Elizabeth Derkosh,' and that she shouldn't be allowed to sue them. The parents' attorney, Robert Mongeluzzi, said in a statement on Wednesday that 'the zoo's position is dead wrong and shameful.' Allegheny . County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. had determined in November that Elizabeth Derkosh wouldn't be prosecuted and that Maddox's death was a 'tragic accident.' Zappala . said the boy had vision problems and wore glasses, and that's partly . why his mother had lifted him onto a . railing to view the pack of dogs. Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as they savagely attacked the two-year-old (file image) The wild dogs attacked the child so quickly at the zoo exhibit that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers had arrived it would have been futile to try to rescue the boy . Zappala said witnesses described the boy lunging forward, as if he . thought there was some sort of clear barrier to stop him. The boy fell . and the animals immediately pounced on the child, who bled to death. Witnesses say he had 'no chance' of surviving after falling 11-feet into the pit while his horrified parents looked on helpless. Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers . and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as . they savagely attacked the two-year-old. Barbara Baker, CEO and . president of the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium said there is a net . below the rail, but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure. At rest: At Maddox's funeral his parents asked friends, relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy's name, to be given to a children's charity . The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern. These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests. They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious reputation. They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals. Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil. They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent. There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries. She . said the animals attacked the child so quickly that by the time a . veterinarian and other zoo staffers arrived seconds later, they . determined it would have been futile to try to rescue the child. Authorities . said that zoo staff and then police responded 'within minutes' but . visitors described that time as being filled with screams for help. Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building. Three more eventually were drawn away from the child, but one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking the boy. It was shot dead by an officer. The other dogs were put in quarantine, not euthanized. The family's neighbor Rachel Majcher told the Tribune Review: '(Jason and Elizabeth) went nowhere without Maddox. I cannot imagine the dark cloud that is following them.' 'I can’t imagine as a mom myself what tragedy that would be, Your heart stops when your kid skins a knee.' She said her father saw Maddox . trick-or-treating in a Superman costume, and he could often be found . playing on a swing set with his cousin, who lives nearby. 'The hardest part is going to be to explain to my kids that their playmate is no longer here. His life will be celebrated.' Experts said the death is highly unusual. Steve . Feldman, a spokesman for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no . one he's spoken to can recall any deaths of children at an accredited . zoo over the last 40 years or more. Feldman said the Pittsburgh . Zoo successfully completed its five-year review in September, which . means it meets or exceeds all safety standards.

Residents in a street in Bangor, Maine, have got themselves in such a flap over birds appearing on their street that authorities have had to step in with an ordinance to limit out of control bird-feeding. Some residents  of Drew Lane in Bangor like to feed bird seed to the pigeons that regularly congregate around their homes. However others say the creatures are a plague that leave droppings and feathers and cause disruption around the area. Besieged: Residents of Drew Lane in Bangor have to clean piles of pigeon poop off their cars each morning to prevent the corrosive droppings damaging the paint jobs on their cars . After 'angry exchanges' and years of . neighborhood clashes over the issue authorities have now stepped in - . warning the feeders that they face fines of up to $200. Resident Steve Coleman, who is legally blind, is in the anti-bird camp. 'My deck gets nailed all the time,' Coleman told Bangor Daily News.

John Bruneel says verbal exchanges over the issue have taken place over the years leading to authorities need to weigh in. Frenzy: Feeding pigeons at the same time every day causes them to gather in ever larger groups and to nest nearby, which can mean neighborhood disturbance and hygiene issues for locals . They say one particular unnamed man is responsible. Neighbors say he dumps piles of birdseed on his driveway every morning, leaving the atmosphere filled with floating feathers and houses, cars and driveways caked in pigeon droppings. Hunger games: The ban in Bangor won't prevent people having bird feeders in their backyards or from throwing bread to ducks in the park, but it will stop feeding practices that cause wildlife to become a nuisance . Drew Lane residents had ended up with a . situation reminiscent to Hitchcock's 'The Birds', and felt there was little choice . but to take the matter to the City Council. Bruneel and Coleman spoke about their . ordeal at a Government Operations Committee in May to plead with the . city to do something about the bird feeding in Drew Lane. The City Council passed an ordinance . in May 29 that prohibits people from feeding birds or other animals in a . way that creates a 'disturbance or unsanitary condition.' 'The sheer number of birds located around Drew Lane at some times is pretty out of control,' Assistant City Solicitor Paul Nicklas told Bangor Daily News. Fines for violating the ordinance begin at $50 for the first offense, then $100 and $200 for subsequent offenses within a year. Bruneel and Coleman are likely to be hailed neighborhood heroes for the ordinance, which will bring relief to Drew Lane residents, with perhaps one exception. 'I’m just glad the city stepped in and did something about this,' Bruneel said. Coleman, himself a bird-lover, says he's looking forward to the neighborhood returning to normal and living in Drew Lane 'without this issue hanging over our heads.' The marauding birds won't go hungry, and it's likely the flock will spread its wing and disperse to other areas of the city and leave Drew Lane residents to enjoy a pigeon-poop-free existence.","Drew Lane in Bangor has had an ever-growing population of pigeons for the past eight years .

The number of Americans struggling to buy food is on the rise, and the ranks of the starving may get considerably worse. Five years after the start of the Great Recession, one in five Americans struggle to afford food, according to a new Gallup poll. The 20 per cent who struggled to buy food in August come close to numbers seen during the darkest days of the economic downturn. With funding set to be cut from the food stamp program in November, more people may be unable to buy food. The recession peak of 20.4 per cent was recorded by Gallup in November 2008, the firm said.The staggering number of Americans unable to buy food is on the rise despite bold proclamations the recession is over amid improving unemployment numbers now below eight percent. They can't afford food: Many Americans are lining up at food banks and relying on food stamps to feed themselves . ‘These findings suggest that the economic recovery may be disproportionately benefitting upper-income Americans rather than those who are struggling to fulfill their basic needs,’ said Gallup. The unemployment rate, now at 7.3 per cent, has widely been criticized as an inaccurate picture of the current jobs crisis since it does not count people who have given up trying to find jobs. A more accurate number, many would argue, is the Labor Force Participation Rate, which is at a shockingly low 63.2 per cent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the lowest number recorded in the past decade. The Labor Force Participation Rate is a measure of all people ready, willing and able to work – the Unemployment Rate is simply a measure of people collecting unemployment benefits, which have long-since expired for millions of Americans out of work. Starving: The percentage of Americans who can't afford food jumped alarmingly last month . Dropping, that's good right?: The unemployment rate is now down to 7.3 per cent, and is on a downward trend, but that doesn't tell the whole story . Where the problem lies: The labor force participation rate, a measure of all people ready, willing and able to work, is at an all-time low 63.2 per cent . Stagnant, and in some cases falling, wages are also contributing to this perfect storm of poverty.With many Americans not seeing raises in a difficult economic climate, the average hourly pay for non-governmental, non-supervisory workers has dropped from $8.85 in June 2009 to only $8.77 in July 2013, according to a Wall Street Journal report quoted by Gallup. ‘Depressed wages are likely negatively affecting the economic recovery by reducing consumer spending, but another serious and costly implication may be that fewer Americans are able to consistently afford food,’ Gallup said. This latest poll comes just over a month after an Associated Press poll showed that four in five Americans experience poverty at some point during their lifetime, with some rural area experiencing almost 99 per cent poverty. Staggering: One in five Americans can't afford food now, but that number may rise as expanded food stamp benefits will likely expire in November . No jobs, or poor wages: Job fairs all over the country are jammed with people looking for work despite the false optimism provided by a lowering unemployment rate . That 80 per cent of Americans need government assistance at some point in their lives, and a near-record high 20 per cent couldn’t buy enough food last month is alarming. The number of Americans unable to nourish themselves may rise further, as recent reports suggest the federal government is set to slash funding to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) aimed at helping poverty-stricken families put food on the table - this despite rising numbers of families joining each month, according to the USDA. ‘Republicans in Congress are proposing substantial cuts and reforms to the program…  food stamp benefits are set to be reduced in November after a provision of the 2009 fiscal stimulus program expires,’ Gallup said. Senate Republicans are standing firm on a proposed $40billion in cuts to the SNAP food stamp program, according to Reuters, a move opposed by Democrats. Almost 48million Americans rely on SNAP to put food on their table. Messages left for further comment with both Gallup and the USDA were not immediately returned.","The number of Americans unable to buy food is approaching recession highs seen in 2008 .

'She’s got the sweetest little face, you can’t not feel for this dog,' Lucas County dog warden Julie Lyle said. She is working with Ohio University's vet department to find a way to treat the wound, with the medical bills being covered by the animal charity Cutie's Fund. The dog, renamed Princess P, has a wound 3in wide and 5in deep, according to the Toledo Blade. 'It is so deep that you can see her trachea,' Ms Lyle said. 'It surpasses any wound we’ve ever dealt with here.' She added: 'She was in such horrible shape, I wasn’t sure if she was even going to make it through the night.' Princess P's face is so swollen because the lymph nodes are unable to drain properly. Because of her injuries, no one is sure what type of dog she is. Saved: Despite her horrific injuries Princess P is a friendly dog wanting attention, dog wardens say . Dog wardens plan to place her with a rescue group once her initial injuries have been dealt with, so she can fully heal and be found a new family. Cutie's Fund, a charity that helps pay for emergency care for rescue animals, is helping to pay for Princess P's treatment.

But Jose Mourinho has said his famous grey trenchcoat won't be making an appearance at Chelsea this time around. The Portuguese said he doesn't want to look back to past successes in his new role, but forge ahead and determine the club's future. Familiar: Jose Mourinho's long trenchcoat was a staple of his first spell at Stamford Bridge . No more: The coat, which spurred chants from opposition fans, is now on display in the Chelsea museum . Then and now: Mourinho, on this summer's pre-season tour, says the coat will not make a comeback . 'I don’t have it now, it is in the Chelsea Museum,' he told the club's official magazine. 'I don’t think it’s good to be nostalgic about it, to think about things that happened in the past. I did that a lot with coats and watches I wore during some seasons. 'When it’s over, it’s over and we look forward to a new season and project. So, not the same coat, that’s for sure.' Young guns: Mourinho says he wants to look to the future of Chelsea, with Nathaniel Chalobah in action . Talent: 21-year-old Oscar and 22-year-old Eden Hazard (below) are already Chelsea regulars . In keeping with this mindset, . Mourinho also said his main priority is to develop players at the club, . while still retaining his famous winning mentality. 'Normally, . people measure success with trophies. 'They’re very closely related, but . I don’t think it is so linear like that – especially in a squad like we . have, which is a squad for the future,' he said. 'We have to work to improve a big percentage of these players who are very young, preparing the future of this club. 'I’m . very, very focused on this, but at the same time always trying to get . results, even knowing the best time will arrive in a couple of years.'

The Blues triumphed 2-0 in a match which was overshadowed by a horrific challenge on John Terry, which saw Inter's Hugo Campagnaro see red. Mourinho's coat was a constant throughout his first spell at Stamford Bridge, prompting opposition fans to taunt him with chants like 'Your coat's from Matalan.' Mourinho also revealed that coming back to Stamford Bridge was easy because of his love for the club. 'I love the football in this country but, of course, Ialways felt this respect from the fans; even whenI was coaching other clubs, especially last season when I felt – even by not being at Stamford Bridge – many supporters wished me to be back,' he said. 'That was important . 'The best thing is that I don’t have to learn how to love my club. When I came for the first time, and to Inter and Madrid, I had to learn, and now it’s the same club I already love. That’s very important. 'When you have big emotional connections with a club you become easily a top professional,somebody who gives everything and cares for the club without a selfish vision of his job.

Lance Armstrong has returned his Olympic bronze cycling medal, the latest fallout from his confession to using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong won the medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. The International Olympic Committee in January vacated the medal Armstrong won in the road time trial. Armstrong tweeted Thursday that he gave it back and a U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman released a statement confirming its return. Armstrong's tweet included a photo of the medal and its blue ribbon along with the message: 'The 2000 Bronze is back in possession of @usolympics and will be in Switzerland asap.' It was all a lie: Lance Armstrong has returned the bronze medal he won at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . Mark Higgins, who has been a manager and spokesman for Armstrong for several years, gave the medal to USOC chief executive officer Scott Blackmun at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport on Thursday. Armstrong declined further comment. The IOC has said it will not reallocate Armstrong's bronze medal, just as cycling's ruling body decided not to declare any winners for the Tour titles once held by the American. Spanish rider Abraham Olano Manzano, who finished fourth in Sydney, will not be upgraded and the bronze medal will be left vacant in Olympic records. Not alone: Mr Armstrong (pictured) was not the only American cyclist cheating, Tyler Hamilton was stripped of his gold medal from the 2004 Olympics as well . I did it: Mr Armstrong admitted to doping during his career in an interview with Oprah Winfrey . Armstrong denied doping for years until his confession in January in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The confession came after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by Armstrong and his U.S. Postal Service team. Armstrong also has been stripped of the seven Tour de France titles he won from 1999-2005. The IOC previously stripped Tyler Hamilton, a former Armstrong teammate, of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Olympics after he acknowledged doping. Prolific: Mr Armstrong inspired millions by winning a record seven Tour de France races during his storied career after beating cancer, only to admit he cheated in the end . Armstrong won his medal two months after winning his second Tour de France title. His U.S. Postal Service teammate, Vyacheslav Ekimov of Russia, won the gold and Jan Ullrich of Germany won silver. Ekimov was Armstrong's teammate during the time period in which USADA outlined widespread doping on the team. Ullrich, who was a chief rival of Armstrong and finished second to him in the Tour de France three times, confirmed in an interview with a German magazine in June that he used blood-doping treatments during his career. The IOC has not brought charges against either Ekimov or Ullrich.","The medal was returned this week to the US Olympic Committee .

Tears: Gascoigne is remembered for crying during the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany . By TOM WHITE, PRESS ASSOCIATION . Widely regarded as one of the most gifted English footballers of his generation, Paul Gascoigne has long fought an all-consuming battle with alcoholism. Known for his genius on the pitch, his chaotic life has been dogged by a constant tendency to self destruct. While he enjoyed many highs on the pitch, there have also been many lows, including struggling with mental illness, bulimia, panic attacks, addictions and domestic violence. This came to a head when earlier this year he was placed in intensive care in a hospital in the US while he was being treated for alcoholism during a rehabilitation programme. At the time he was said to be close to death and it was reported that he was revived a number of times. At first, his antics in bars and clubs across Europe had looked like the result of the overblown enthusiasm and thirst for the high life which rapidly became his off-the-pitch trademark. But the excesses that have marred his life for so long eventually led to his exclusion from the England World Cup squad in 1998. Other high profile alcoholism incidents included being sacked from managing Kettering Town FC in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games and appearing at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010. Arriving at the scene in Rothbury, Northumberland, Gazza claimed he was a friend of Moat and said he had brought him 'a can of lager, some chicken, fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'. He was also sectioned under the Mental Health Act twice in the space of six months in 2008 and admitted in his autobiography to headbutting his wife Sheryl and throwing her to the floor. Known for his genius on the pitch, his chaotic life has been dogged by a constant tendency to self destruct . First thrust into the national consciousness after a number of brilliant performances at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, he quickly became a household name. From there he would play for such teams as Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, and Rangers and became loved by fans as a talented joker. Born in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, on May 27 1967, he also starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, the highlight being his magical goal against Scotland. He is also remembered for crying after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany, as he knew the booking meant he would be suspended for the final if England got there.","Gascoigne, 46, called guard a 'c***' before grabbing him around throat .

Dr Georges Bensimhon, 66, an anesthesiologist from Allentown, Pennsylvania, allegedly drove six hours through the night to Dr Seth Alan Hoffer's Cleveland Heights, Ohio home to attack him. Once there, he hid in bushes outside the home and when Dr Hoffer emerged just before 6am, the older doctor allegedly pounced on him. But Dr Hoffer, 39, had heard rustling in the bushes behind him and footsteps and turned to see a figure wearing a black ski mask and blue surgical gloves. Arrest: Dr. Georges Bensimhon, 66, faces felony assault and kidnapping charges after he allegedly beat his son-in-law with a pry bar outside his Ohio home earlier this month . His attacker allegedly hit him across the forehead with the pry bar before continuing to beat him several times on the head and bite him, police said, ABC News reported. But Dr Hoffer was able to overpower his attacker, breaking his arm and forcing him to the ground. At that point he heard his alleged attacker scream: 'Alan, get off of me! I can't breathe' - and he knew the man behind the mask was his father-in-law, police said. Police said Bensimhon had a backpack filled with syringes, different . types of anesthetics, a screw driver and additional surgical gloves when he approached the house.

Hurt: Bensimhon, pictured with his granddaughter, was overpowered by Hoffer, who broke his arm . Police arrived on the scene after multiple neighbors called 911 hearing someone screaming for help and seeing a man covered in blood. Officers found Hoffer pinning Benhimhon to the ground. Hoffer, who suffered wounds to his head, was leaving the home for the airport to fly to Florida, where his estranged wife, Danielle Bensimhon, is living with their one-year-old daughter Lila. ABC reported that Danielle Benhsimhon and Hoffer are going through a bitter divorce and custody battle for the little girl. He also has a seven-year-old daughter from his first wife, who died in 2007. The girl was being looked after by a sitter while her father was being attacked outside.

The four men convicted of killing a 23-year-old medical student they raped on a bus in New Delhi should face the death penalty, a prosecutor said today. The men are set to be sentenced on Friday after they were found guilty of rape and murder yesterday in the case which shocked the world and prompted a widespread movement for women's rights in India. 'They showed no mercy even when she prayed for mercy,' Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the court. 'There should be no mercy for merciless convicts. 'The sentence which is appropriate is . nothing short of death. The common man will lose faith in the judiciary if the harshest . punishment is not given.' Judgement day: A police van carrying the four men convicted of murder in the Delhi gang rape case arrives at court for the killers' sentencing . Plea: One of the men shouted out 'I am innocent!' as the bus passed reporters on its way into court . He . added that 'there can be nothing more diabolic than a helpless girl put . through torture', saying that the crime had shocked India's 'collective . conscience'. As the killers arrived at court in a police van ahead of the hearing, one of the men called out, 'I am innocent! I am innocent!' The men - bus cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh, . gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, and unemployed . Mukesh Singh - are widely expected to be sentenced to death by judge . Yogesh Khanna in a final hearing on Friday . Defence lawyer Vivek Sharma today called for the defendants to be given life in prison - the most lenient sentence possible - and said that the different roles each of them played in the crime should be taken into account. He said that judges should not be 'bloodthirsty', adding: 'You can't give capital punishment on demand.' Sentence: Prosecutors are urging the judge to impose the death penalty on the four murderers . Queue: Police stand guard as members of the public wait to enter the courtroom for sentencing . The four men showed no emotion as lawyers laid out their arguments - it is unclear whether or not they understood the proceedings, which were held in English. The family of the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, sat a few feet away from her killers. They were among six people accused of tricking the woman and her male companion into boarding an off-duty bus on December 16 after they had seen a matinee showing of Life of Pi at a shopping mall. They then raped her using a metal bar to inflict massive internal injuries before beating her friend. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside and the woman died from her injuries two weeks later. 'Hang them': As the four men listened to their verdicts inside the courtroom, chants of 'hang them' could be heard outside as demonstrators called for the death penalty and staged mock hangings . Guilty! Indian policemen look out from a van carrying the four convicted men . One of the other suspects apparently committed suicide while in prison, and a 17-year-old boy convicted of . involvement in the attack was sentenced to three years in prison. Speaking outside court yesterday, the . father of the victim said: 'Now the court has held them guilty, we want them hanged. We expect nothing else but the death sentence.' As the men were told the verdicts in the courtroom, chants of 'hang them' could be heard echoing outside. One of the four is to launch an appeal over his conviction claiming he was simply driving the bus when the attack took place and was unaware of what was happening inside. Guilty: A van carries the four men to court in New Delhi. They face the death penalty following the verdict . A mother's tears: The mother of one of the four convicted men cries upon seeing the news on a court verdict on a TV inside her house at a slum in New Delhi . The crime, which left the victim with . such extensive internal injuries that she died two weeks later, sparked . widespread protests across the country and led to reforms of India's . antiquated sexual violence laws. Their conviction comes a week after their teenage accomplice was jailed for three years for his part in the atrocity, escaping with a lenient sentence because he was under 18 at the time of the attack. The sixth accused, bus driver Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March. Reading out yesterday's verdict, Judge Yogesh Khanna said the men had committed 'murder of a helpless person.' Convicted: It comes after a teenager was convicted in August following a separate trial . Anger: Indian women participate in a silent procession to mourn the death of the gang rape victim .

A former SAS sniper - known only as Soldier N - believes the Princess of Wales' death was carried out by British special forces . David Cameron and the head of the army, General Sir Peter Wall, both received letters in February containing a claim that the SAS killed Princess Diana – but neither alerted the police to the matter. Diana, Dodi and their driver were killed when their Mercedes crashed in the Pont de L’Alma underpass in Paris in August 1997. A former SAS sniper - known only as Soldier N - believes the Princess of Wales' death was carried out by British special forces who then 'covered it up'. Soldier N claimed driver Henri Paul was blinded by an intense flash of light moments before he lost control of their Mercedes. The wife of soldier N wrote to the Prime Minister, General Wall and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, voicing fears that her husband might kill her, according to the Daily Express. This letter, the paper says, also contained the allegation that the SAS were involved in Diana’s death. It’s claimed that both No 10, which receives thousands of letters a year, and General Wall wrote back to soldier N’s wife expressing their concern. A Downing Street official is said to have written: ‘I was sorry to hear of the difficulties you are experiencing. Mr Cameron appreciates you taking the time and trouble to share your concerns.’ It's claimed General Wall wrote: ‘I have been in touch with [soldier N's] regiment to see what measures can be taken to address this situation.’ Neither mentions the allegation about the SAS and Diana’s death, the Express claims. A Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to MailOnline. The claim about the SAS and Diana's death was brought to the attention of the Army's Service Prosecuting Authority in September 2011, didn't come to the attention of a senior member of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Army or government until this summer. Prime Minister David Cameron is said to have been sent a letter in February detailing claims about the SAS being involved in Diana's death . A senior defence source told the Daily Express: ‘The handling of this very serious allegation could not have been worse. The question is, was this failure to act due to incompetence or a cover-up?’ However, an MoD spokesperson told MailOnline: ‘We don’t comment on Special Forces matters and as far as we’re concerned it’s a live police investigation, so we wouldn’t comment on it for that reason, too.’ An inquest in 2008 found that Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who had been drinking. But the families of Dodi and Mr Paul have long claimed it was a murder. Soldier N's credibility has been called into question, with Royal bodyguards and Met experts calling it a  'mystifying stunt' based on 'nonsense' evidence. He is currently in jail for illegally keeping guns at home, and was described by those who know him as a  'loose cannon'. As well as hiding weapons in his house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked his son after mistaking him for the Taliban. The damaged car in the Pont d'Alma tunnel in Paris in which Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed were travelling . Soldier N is also accused of saying he could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother of his two children and the woman who defended his theory to police – would ‘disappear’. His allegations surfaced in a letter linked to the trial of former sniper Danny Nightingale. The document was written by the mother-in-law of 'Soldier N', Nightingale's housemate, in September 2011 and sent to military prosecutors. The eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’. Sergeant Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N. Soldier N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from whom he is now separated. The letter was sent to Soldier N’s commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial. All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA. The paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that has been covered up.’ The letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of his unit use for private jobs’. ‘They put in the box the name, address and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to earn extra money does that job.’","The PM knew about the allegation in February, according to a newspaper report .

The 40-year-old Canadian Borders Services guard owes his life to his cell after he used it as a last ditch attempt to scare of a raging polar bear. Lucky escape: Garret Kolsun, 40, was trapped in a door way by a raging bear biting and scratching him . New to Churchill in Hudson Bay, Manitoba, Mr Kolsun was not aware of its sizable polar bear population. Known as 'the polar bear capital of the world', it has numerous sanctuaries - and even a prison for the arctic creatures. On his way home from after-work drinks last Friday, Mr Kolsun, from Winnipeg, would be made well aware. As he made his way through the main town in the early hours of Saturday morning, a 28-stone animal appeared out of nowhere. Hearing a muffled noise, the worker looked over his shoulder to see the creature charging towards him. Screaming, running, and shielding his face, Mr Kolsun was not quick enough. The bear sunk its teeth into his hip, wildly hitting and scratching. In a desperate bid to get away, he flashed the screen of his mobile phone. It gave him a second to run . In the tussle, he managed to break free and run for a nearby bakery. But the door was locked. The predator caught up and pinned him against the door. With a similar IQ to apes, polar bears are ranked as some of the planet's most intelligent creatures. Their hunting techniques are calculated and fast. They can grow up to 71 stone - and even before they are fully grown, most can run up to a speed of 45kmph. Polar bear hunting in Canada became a popularised sport in the mid-1980s. Despite the common misconception, polar bears are not left-pawed. A terrified Mr Kolsun instinctively reached for the only thing he had: his phone. 'At that point the bear was basically right on top of me,' he explained to CTV News. 'The bear's nose was inches away from me. I didn't know where else to . go. I didn't want to be a stat. 'I was yelling and screaming, trying to keep it away from me. Throughout all this it had swatted at me a few times and it had bit me. 'So I pulled my cellphone out of my pocket, turned it on and the screen lit up. I turned it towards the bear, put it in his face.' It was a move that would save his life. One look at the screen baffled the animal, which stumbled and hit a plant pot. 'When it stepped back, luckily it knocked over a planter. It startled the bear and it turned its head. So when it did, I just ran.' He scarpered towards a group of people sitting on a deck. But, turning around, the bear was nowhere to be seen. Exhausted, he got a taxi to the health centre, where staff treated two bite wounds on his leg and hip. He is now in a stable condition, and ecstatic to be alive. 'I'm just a lucky guy who got away from a bear,' he said. 'It pawed at me. It ripped my shirt a few times. 'I have scratches on my chest, some going down and a couple going sideways. 'When you're in Churchill, take a cab. Or drive. Don't walk after dark.' Manitoba Conservation caught the bear on Saturday. It is now being assessed. According to a government spokesman, bears are known to be more active in the months before the ice freezes. People are advised to avoid walking alone or going out after dark.","Garett Kolsun, 40, was walking home from after-work drinks at 1.30am when the animal charged .

It is the world’s largest social networking site, used by children, parents and grandparents alike. But Facebook’s popularity is dwindling dramatically, figures suggest, as it loses millions of users every month. In Britain alone, 1.4million fewer users checked in to the site last month, an example of what is being described as ‘Facebook fatigue’. 28-year-old Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's current net worth is more than $16 billion. He is working to stop the network's falling numbers of users . Users in Facebook's biggest markets are deleting their accounts and swapping to newer social media . In the last six months, Facebook has lost nearly 9million monthly visitors in the US and 2million in the UK. Experts say as new social media sites grow, Facebook's users are deserting the network. They say that figures aren't helped by the lack of new Facebook members. It is believed that most people who want to sign up to the site have already done so. New media specialist Ian Maude said the fall in numbers was due to 'a boredom factor'. It is believed there is stagnation as most people who want to join the site have already done so . 'The problem is that, in the US and UK, most people who want to sign up for Facebook have already done it. 'People like to try something new. Is . Facebook going to go the way of Myspace? 'The risk is relatively small, . but that is not to say it isn't there.' Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg is said to be introducing new features in order to win members back.

A severed goat’s head has been delivered to Wrigley Field, addressed to Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts. The horrific prank recalls the team's infamous 'Curse of the Billy Goat' in which a local bar owner said the Cubs would never win the World Series after the team barred him from bringing his goat into a game in 1945. The latest incident occurred Wednesday at about 2:30 p.m. when a man in an unmarked truck dropped off the ‘intimidating package,’ to a security guard. Goats have been part of Cubs folklore since the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern placed a curse on the team during the 1945 World Series . Hate mail: Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts was sent a severed goat's head at the stadium on Wednesday. Ricketts is trying to renovate the historic Wrigley Field and increase the number of night games played . Cubs spokesman Julian Green said an unidentified person dropped off the goat’s head at Gate K of the ballpark. Chicago police are now investigating the incident. The Cubs are in the middle of highly publicized negotiations with city officials and neighborhood interests regarding proposed $500 million renovation plans at the famed and historic ballpark, which first opened in 1914. The proposed renovations include install a Jumbotron-like scoreboard and increasing the number of night games from 30 to as many as 55, reports The Chicago Tribune. The Cubs’ game Wednesday against the Brewers was postponed, but due to rain rather than the goat’s head incident. A spokesman for Ricketts did not comment. Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis apparently placed a curse on the team during the 1945 World Series when his pet goat Murphy was denied entry into Wrigley Field. He even asked the owner of the Cubs, P.K. Wrigley for admission. Wrigley replied, 'Let Billy in, but not the goat.' The story goes that Sianis became enraged, threw up his arms and vowed, 'The Cubs ain't gonna win no more. The Cubs will never win a World Series so long as the goat is not allowed in Wrigley Field.' Bad call: This is the moment when enraged Cubs fan William Sianis put a curse on the Cubbies, vowing they would never win the World Series again because the team denied entry to his beloved pet . The Cubs went on to lose that World Series - and have never even been back to the Fall Classic since. The Cubs, who became known as 'Lovable Losers,' have since been known as a cursed franchise, known for incredibly bad luck on the field. In 1969, the Cubs jumped out to huge lead and looked like they were headed to their first World Series in 24 years. Curse continues: Fan Steve Bartman reaches out and interferes with Cubs outfielder Moises Alou during the playoffs in 2003. Many Cubs fan blame the team losing this game on the Curse of the Billy Goat . But a late season collapse, combined with the 'Miracle Mets' overtaking them, meant they had to 'wait till next year.' In 1984, then Cubs owners, the Tribune Company, tried to reverse the curse and invited the goat to opening day at Wrigley Field. They won the division that year and were just eight outs away from winning the National League Championship Series and playing in the World Series. But they were unable to claim victory in that game and lost the next two, and the curse continued. The team has only had 15 winning seasons between 1946 and 2003, when they suffered perhaps the most memorable collapse in baseball postseason history. After winning the first round, their first playoff series victory since 1908, they were just five outs away from clinching a World Series birth against the Florida Marlins. When a pop out was hit towards shallow left field, it appeared the team would be one out closer from finally ending the curse. But fan Steve Bartman also reached for the foul ball, and outfielder Moises Alou was unable to make the play. Despite leading 3-0, the team quickly unraveled, losing the game and then the following night, and once again the curse lived on. Bartman became a citywide pariah and was been forced to change his name and leave Chicago for fear of his safety. A goat's head was delivered to the home of the Chicago Cubs on Wednesday afternoon, addressed to baseball team's owner Tom Ricketts .","Cubs owner Tom Ricketts has been sent a goat's head in a box .

There was a time when films stood little chance of success unless there was something steamy going on at some point. These days, however, it seems movie moguls find sex one big turn-off. Experts say intimate love scenes have been vanishing from movie scripts in the last 18 months. Sexually explicit movies like Basic Instinct, starring Sharon Stone, are no longer popular . Special effects, such as in the film The Day After Tomorrow, are much more likely to appeal to viewers . This is not only because producers . want to avoid an adult-only rating, but also because women are . increasingly the ones who choose what film to watch when they go to the . cinema with their partner. It marks a huge shift from the days when films deliberately courted controversy with their sex scenes. Among the most famous examples of this . were Sharon Stone uncrossing her legs in Basic Instinct and 9½ Weeks, . which starred Kim Basinger. Vincent Bruzzese, president of the film . division of market research company Ipsos, said sex scenes were now . regularly removed from scripts by producers. The executive, whose company looks at . scripts for studios and filmmakers, said: ‘Sex scenes used to be . written, no matter the plot, to spice up a trailer. 'But all that does today is get a film . an adult-only rating and lose a younger audience. Today such scenes are . written out by producers before they are even shot.’ He told the Sunday Times: ‘They ask: . do we really need the sex? Can we fill the space with dazzling special . effects instead and keep the family-friendly rating.’ It was pointed out how this year’s best picture hopefuls at the Oscars contained a lot of violence but no explicit sex scenes.

A friend of killer Adam Lanza's mother has said the gunman may have launched his murder spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School as an 'act of revenge' after suffering years of bullying as a student at the Connecticut school. Family friend Marvin LaFontaine said Lanza, who killed 26 people during one of the worst school shooting in America's history, had been harboring resentment towards the Connecticut school for years. And he said mother Nancy Lanza was so angered by the school's inability to protect her son, she would sometimes sit in his class to make sure nobody touched him. He told the New York Daily News: 'I think Adam felt betrayed by the school and this was his act of revenge.' Mr LaFontaine, who was also Lanza’s Cub Scout leader when he was a young boy, said he was told by the killer's mother that he was picked on at school. He said: 'Adam was an easy target. He was quiet and he would never fight back.' On December 14, the 20-year-old shot his mother then went on to spray 155 bullets at innocent children and educators during a five-minute, bloody rampage that ended with 20 dead school children and six dead staff members before Lanza shot and killed himself. Bullied: Lanza family friend Marvin LaFontaine (pictured) says Adam Lanza was bullied throughout his years as a student at Sandy Hook Elementary . Mr. LaFontaine said Lanza's childhood experience of Sandy Hook centered around bullying. He said this angered his mother, who would sometimes attend the school unannounced to act as a her son's 'bodyguard'. 'Adam didn’t like her showing up,' he said. 'She would sometimes sit in the . back of the class and make sure no one would touch him.' She also moved him in and out of the school and sometimes home schooled him, according to the report. At . the same time, Nancy was amassing an arsenal of weapons at the house, . where investigators found more than 1,600 rounds of ammunition, two . rifles, a BB gun, a starter’s pistol, nine knives, a 7-foot spear, a . bayonet and three samurai swords. Grief-stricken: Children wait outside Sandy Hook Elementary School in the aftermath of the shooting . Documents . released as part of the investigation noted that the avid gun collector . mom may also have been facilitating her son's fascination with weapons. The mother and son reportedly 'bonded' during several sessions spent together at a shooting range. According to the investigation, which . is ongoing and may not be complete until June or later, each of the . weapons used in the attack was legally licensed to Nancy Lanza. They also found that Adam Lanza possessed articles on other . shootings and a holiday card containing a check made out to him . for the purchase of a firearm, authored by Nancy Lanza. Despair: Carlee Soto receives the news that her sister, Victoria Soto, a teacher at the school, is dead. Documents indicate that authorities . found Nancy's gun safe open with shotgun shells and numerous boxes of . bullets. A family friend told the Daily News . that, in the months leading up to the shooting, Lanza would dress up in . military camouflage and target shoot in his basement with a pellet gun. The family friend said Lanza's dream was to become a Marine like his uncle Jim. However, a man with mental health issues as marked as Lanza's is all but guaranteed to be turned away from serving in the armed forces. That may have also contributed to an emotional break in Lanza that led to his killing spree.

Just six months after resigning as director of the CIA, David Petraeus is back in the public eye. The retired military general has joined New York-based private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR) as chairman of a group that will ‘study macroeconomic trends and government policies to assess their implications on the firm's investments.’ Once a national hero for saving the . United States from humiliation during his 2007-2008 stint as the . commander of coalition forces in Iraq, Petraeus resigned as CIA director . in disgrace in November after revealing an affair with his biographer . Paula Broadwell. Six months after resigning as director of the CIA, David Petraeus has joined New York-based private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. It was a stunning downfall for a revered military man who was seen as one of the top American leaders of his generation and was once considered a potential contender for the White House. Petraeus was credited with helping pull Iraq from the brink of an all-out civil war as commander there and President Barack Obama turned to him to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan before moving to him to the CIA in 2011. KKR, which has more than $78 billion in assets under management, has been involved in some of the biggest private equity buyouts in history including the $45 billion takeover of Texas power producer TXU, now known as Energy Future Holdings, in 2007. KKR's other investments include hospital operator HCA Holdings, retailer Toys R US, and internet domain registration company Go Daddy Group. Petraeus met Broadwell when she was a graduate student at Harvard University and working on a dissertation about him . Private equity still accounts for most of KKR's assets under management, but the firm has been diversifying into credit and hedge funds. In a statement, Petraeus said: ‘I am very pleased to join such a great team. I have watched KKR evolve as it adapted to the post-financial crisis world and became a go-to partner for companies worldwide. 'I look forward to supporting the investment teams in their pursuit of the best opportunities for clients and also being a part of a new initiative to provide additional insights to KKR's clients and companies.’ Petraeus and KKR co-founder Henry Kravis have known each other for years via the Council of Foreign Relations, and reportedly have been in talks since early this year about how they might work together. In 2008 KKR hired former Republican National Committee chair Ken Mehlman to lead its public affairs effort. Petraeus will also support KKR's investment teams in the diligence process, particularly in considering investments in new geographies, KKR said on Thursday. Earlier this month biographer Paula Broadwell finally issued an apology for the first time since her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus was exposed six months ago . Still together: David Petraeus stands alongside his wife Holly during his swearing in ceremony as the new CIA Director in September 2011. The couple are still married . KKR currently has investments in more than 80 companies operating in 19 countries. Earlier this month, Paula Broadwell finally issued an apology for the first time since her affair with former CIA director David Petraeus was exposed. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station WSOC in Charlotte. 'I'm very blessed.  Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. 'Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Broadwell met Petraeus, 60, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University and working on a dissertation about him. She then wrote his biography called All In: The Education of General David Petraeus, for which she was able to spend large portions of time with him. Out in public: Petraeus worked out on Venice Beach with veterans last month . Although Mr. Petraeus is far better known for his accomplishments on foreign . battlefields than for his time in classrooms, but he graduated in the . top five percent of his class at the United States Military Academy. Mr. Petraeus will be a busy man. Last month it was announced that starting in August he will also serve as a visiting . professor of public policy at CUNY's Macaulay Honors College. In March he made a speech at the . University of Southern California where he apologized to those he'd hurt . with his affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 'I join you keenly aware that I am regarded in a different light now than I was a year ago,' he said. 'I . know that I can never fully assuage the pain that I inflicted on those . closest to me and on a number of others,' Petraeus said, according to . news reports. 'I can, . however, try to move forward in a manner that is consistent with the . values to which I subscribed before slipping my moorings and, as best as . possible, to make amends to those I have hurt and let down' He has signaled he’s ready to move on: 'One learns after all that life doesn't stop with such a mistake. It can and must go on.'

Thirteen Cabinet ministers could face bitter rows over fracking in their constituencies, it emerged last night. Companies involved in shale gas drilling have exploration licences in areas represented by Chancellor George Osborne, a vocal supporter of the technology, and Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey. Education Secretary Michael Gove, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude are among those whose constituencies are in a shale belt that stretches across southern England from Dorset to Kent. Controversy: Thirteen Cabinet ministers could face bitter rows over fracking in their constituencies, it emerged last night. Police are pictured escorting a lorry past protestors at a proposed Fracking site in Balcombe, West Sussex . While the firms cannot go ahead with fracking before seeking permission from the local council, it raises the prospect of more fierce protests from residents concerned that it carries environmental risks and will destroy the countryside. There have been angry clashes between campaigners and riot police at Balcombe in West Sussex, where exploratory drilling started last week. Other members of the Cabinet who have seats in the South, where limestone rocks are believed to contain a plentiful supply of gas trapped thousands of feet underground, are Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Culture Secretary Maria Miller, Science Minister David Willetts, Chief Whip Sir George Young and Oliver Letwin, a Cabinet Office minister. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has joined Mr Osborne in championing shale gas and both have constituencies within the Bowland-Hodder shale area in northern England. Hot spots: This map shows the constituencies of Cabinet ministers which could face rows over fracking . The constituencies of Foreign Secretary William Hague and Minister without Portfolio Ken Clarke also fall within its boundaries. According to the British Geological Survey, it could have reserves of up to 1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas – enough to power Britain for decades. Mr Osborne has said that it would be ‘a real tragedy’ if Britain did not capitalise on this source of energy. ‘It would mean we would have much higher energy costs than other countries, it would mean jobs would go to other countries and we would lose out,’ he said. Cuadrilla Resources, which is carrying out the drilling in Balcombe, began fracking in Lancashire three years ago. Other fracking firms, including Celtique Energie, Alamo, iGas and Magellan Energy, have licences for unconventional oil and gas in other areas of the North. Potential battle: Companies involved in shale gas drilling have exploration licences in areas represented by Chancellor George Osborne, left, and Education Secretary Michael Gove, right . Greenpeace, which is opposed to fracking, used maps of shale resources produced by the Department for Energy and Climate Change to compile a list of ministers who stand to be affected by the industry. Its energy campaigner, Lawrence Carter, said: ‘Senior Tories have thus far been the most vocal cheerleaders of fracking. It will be very interesting to see if the ministers who have talked up shale gas will be so happy when it’s in their backyard. ‘They are beginning to recognise that they could pay a price at the polling booth if they lend their support to it. Tricky: Foreign Secretary William Hague, left, and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, could also face battles in their constituencies . ‘Balcombe is just the beginning – people won’t take the disruption to their communities and countryside lying down.’ The Daily Mail revealed earlier this year that 35 Tory MPs have constituencies in areas that could be licensed for fracking. Greenpeace’s research shows several marginal seats in shale-rich areas, including four held by the Tories and two by the Lib Dems. Deep divisions have emerged within the Coalition over fracking, which involves pumping water and chemicals at high pressure into bore holes to crack open the shale rock and release trapped gas.","Firms involved in shale gas drilling could work in Tory and Lib Dem areas .

Firefighters worked into the night to control a massive blaze that ravaged the iconic boardwalk of Seaside Park, New Jersey starting Thursday afternoon. Officials said said that 80 per cent of the Seaside Park boardwalk had burned by the time firefighters finally began to win in the struggle against the blaze late Thursday. The town still reeling from Hurricane Sandy has now been dealt another fearsome blow just a year after the nearby pier became the poster image of the superstorm when its roller coaster was swallowed by the ocean. The fire broke out near a frozen custard stand in Seaside Park rapidly spread north into neighboring Seaside Heights, the former home of MTV's 'Jersey Shore' reality show. Scroll down for video... Blaze: The iconic beach boardwalk of Seaside Park, New Jersey as it looked Thursday afternoon from above after a 6-alarm fire broke out in an ice cream shop . 'Wrench in the recovery': Seaside Park and neighboring Seaside Heights were hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Some of the now decimated boardwalk had only just been replaced after the storm ahead of this year's beach season . Blaze: Aerial footage shows the thick smoke of the massive blaze that forced officials to evacuate residents in the line of fire Thursday . Inferno: Firefighters are seen pulling back Thursday afternoon during the height of the inferno, which at one point became too hot to approach . Shock: Onlookers watched smoke pour out from the virtually decimated Seaside Park boardwalk. FunTown Pier only last year gained notoriety as the place where Hurricane Sandy caused a roller coaster to be swallowed by the ocean . 'The threat of it moving at this point is minimal and . emergency workers did an amazing job,' John Camera, an official at nearby . Seaside Heights, said according to ABC News Radio. ‘The fire appears to be under control,’ Camera said. ‘They'll . be people stationed there probably for another day or more and they expect that . there may be controlled burning.’ With a stiff wind whipping the flames and driving them from block to block, the rest of the iconic boardwalk was in danger of going up in flames. Seaside Heights officials tried a Hail Mary: they ripped out a 25-foot swath of the boardwalk they had just finished rebuilding five months earlier. They filled the void with giant sand piles - makeshift dunes designed to halt the spreads of flames and save the northern portion of the boardwalk upon which the community relied for its financial survival. It worked. In much the same way as forest fire crews rip out vegetation to deprive an advancing fire of fuel, the boardwalk gambit succeeded in halting the fire's extension any farther into Seaside Heights.

Unthinkable: Onlookers gathered as their beloved boardwalk and 20 of its businesses burned . 'That appears to have done the trick,' said Seaside Park Mayor Robert Matthies. Authorities had not officially declared the fire under control shortly before 10 p.m., but firefighters had made significant progress: flames that had leapt 50 feet into the afternoon sky were gone; only small pockets of fire remained to be doused. 'It certainly looks like it's been suppressed,' the mayor said. Where Seaside Park was largely spared from Sandy's wrath compared to its neighbor, now Seaside Heights is the lucky community. 'It's devastating; I've been crying all afternoon,' said Shirley Kreszl, who has rented a summer home in Seaside Park for decades. 'Haven't we been hit enough? We try to rebuild and just when we think we saved a little bit of our town, this happens. It's just not fair.' Calamity: A roller coaster in Seaside was swallowed by the ocean thanks to Superstorm Sandy. Now fire, not water, has decimated the city's main attractions .

Now, it is Seaside Park's turn to suffer . Can't get a break: Seaside Heights got its facelift just days before beach season began but now a black, burnt scar will mar its close neighbor Seaside Park . USA Today reports that the fire began at Kohr's Frozen Custard around 2:30pm and quickly began to spread into what’s left of the boardwalk’s FunTown Pier, where Sandy’s wrath saw a roller coaster swallowed by the ocean a year ago. Hundreds of overwhelmed firefighters from six counties battled the inferno with help from water pumped in from the Barnegat Bay. Around 20 of the boardwalk's businesses have been decimated, but no injuries have been reported. However, fire fighters were ordered to pull back for a time because of the extremely intense heat of the blaze in the afternoon. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was on the scene Thursday evening in order to survey the damages . alongside Seaside Park Mayor Robert Matthies, where he officially declared a state of emergency for the town. The . Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential contender was a . media staple in the wake of Hurricane Sandy with his frequently . emotional reactions to the devastated Jersey shoreline. 'I feel like I want to throw up,' said Christie. 'After all the effort and time and resources that we’ve put in to help the folks of Seaside Park and Seaside Heights rebuild…it’s just unthinkable.' Governor Christie tweeted that approximately 400 firefighters were on the scene. 'For all the people in the area right now, I ask you to stay away from the boardwalk,' he wrote. Fire fighters struggled to contain the . blaze that engulfed at least four town blocks by early evening as strong . winds hampered their efforts. 'We’re looking at winds here…anywhere from 20 to 30 miles an hour out of . the south heading north, and that’s our biggest enemy right now are . these winds,' Christie told NBC. The fire was still out of control Thursday as the sun set but had slowed somewhat . New Jersey firefighters work from above to control the fire, which raged into the evening on Thursday after claiming most of the boardwalk newly built after Hurricane Sandy .

'We can't catch a break': Flames engulf a building on the boardwalk in the resort community of Seaside Park. The town was hit hard by Sandy and already experienced a difficult summer season thanks to the storm . Decimated: Seaside Park Councilwoman Nancy Koury said Thursday that virtually all the 32 businesses on the town's boardwalk are now gone . 'It's raging': Lashing winds with gusts as strong as 20mph hampered efforts to put out the blaze and helped push flames progressively further down the boardwalk . Devastating: Billowing black smoke rises as firefighters try desperately to put out the flames that had destroyed 80 percent of the iconic boardwalk by Thursday evening . 'It's raging,' said area real estate agent Michael Loundy. 'It is absolutely raging. The wind is blowing something fierce, making it very difficult for firefighters to fight.' The flames were destroying new boardwalk wood that had just been replaced days before Memorial Day weekend as both towns raced to recover from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy. Much of the boardwalk had only just been . replaced ahead of Memorial day weekend and most of the rides on the . pier, where a roller coaster was famously swallowed by Hurricane Sandy . last year, had finally reopened. Sad: The devastating fire started in the vicinity of an ice cream shop and burned several blocks of boardwalk and businesses . Residents could do nothing but watch in horror as their town took yet another hit less than a year after Sandy all but destroyed their beach front . 'We're going to be here for several days,' one firefighter said as he rushed toward the flames. A line of powerful thunderstorms that battered part of New Jersey swung north of Seaside Park, offering no help to some 400 firefighters battling the flames. The livelihoods of the two popular Jersey shore resort communities depend on summer tourism and they had just spent millions of dollars rebuilding their boardwalks, arcade games, pizza stands and bar and grills to be ready for the summer season. 'It's a great place to live, and I'm praying the firefighters can get this under control as soon as possible,' said Seaside Park resident Janet Meisner as she watched the flames and smoke rapidly devour the boardwalk. 'We had to deal with Sandy last year and now this happens. We can't catch a break,' she said. Evacuated: Smoke rises in the distance as firefighters battled a fire raging in Seaside Park. Officials forced some residents out of homes and workers to flee from business that stood within the giant black plume of smoke . Seaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd said a section of boardwalk was being removed to create a fire line to keep the blaze from spreading. He said the fire created embers the size of a fist. For hours, two boardwalk businesses, an arcade and the popular Saw Mill Cafe, escaped the flames. But shortly before 7 p.m. the arcade was engulfed in a huge orange fireball that rolled into the darkening sky, and flames licked against the side of the Saw Mill; it could not immediately be determined how badly damaged the cafe was. 'I can't believe this is happening,' Koury said as she watched the flames devour boardwalk structures. 'Our small business people went through so much in the storm to get ready for summer and stay open all summer, and now it's all gone. I just can't believe it.' Officials said the fire got underneath the boardwalk, making it even more difficult to extinguish. 'It's underneath the boards, and its coming up through the cracks,' Koury said. 'It's making it harder to get water on it.' Matthies said the businesses were primarily wood with tar roofs and shingles, which accelerated the fire.","The fire appears largely contained after 80 percent of the Seaside Park, New Jersey boardwalk burned .

Hillary Clinton has been awarded an honorary doctors degree from one of the UK’s oldest universities to celebrate her success as a politician and diplomat. The former US secretary of state attended a graduation address at a ceremony marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of St Andrews University in Scotland. It is Mrs Clinton's first foreign visit since her term as secretary of state ended in February, which saw her join a group of over a dozen honorary graduates in the picturesque Fife coastal town. Scroll down for video . Honoured: Former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton received an honorary doctor of law degree from St Andrews University . She was conferred with a Doctor of Laws degree by Liberal Democrat politician and chancellor of St Andrews, Sir Menzies Campbell, alongside other honorary doctors, including former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams and inventor of the world wide web Professor Sir Tim Berners-Lee. As well as her achievements in politics, the degree also celebrates her efforts to champion the causes of education, human rights, democracy, civil society and promoting opportunities for women around the world, according to the university. The former US first lady, whose husband Bill was president for eight years between 1993 and 2001, later delivered a impassioned . defence of human rights and equality to an audience of education . leaders, university staff and students. ‘We need more voices speaking up . for universal human rights. ‘We have honoured some of the great advocates here today who have spoken out courageously for women's rights, gay rights and religious understanding, showing us that our communities and institutions are strongest when equality and opportunity are open to all people and freedom of conscience is respected. Mrs Clinton was one of a handful recipients of honorary degrees at the ceremony to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University . 'It is important that as we chart our way forward in this new century, we . bring with it the enlightened view that every individual around the . world regardless of gender, religion, race, ethnicity or orientation, . should be able to contribute to their societies and to have the chance . to live up to his or her God given potential. ‘We . are confronting deep cultural and political differences. Change can be . very wrenching and it is difficult to bridge the gaps between and within . societies. ‘We will never . agree on everything, but spirited and principled debate is the . lifeblood of democracies and today our democracies are under stress. ‘It . is more important than ever that we rally behind what started here and . elsewhere, where the individual was endowed by his creator with those . rights that enabled first men and slowly women and others to be full . participants in their society. ‘Now . we need in this new age participation on a much grander scale to make . the case for the importance of those fundamental values.’ Royal approval: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met when they were studying at St Andrews University . The Duke of Cambridge congratulated the university on its 600th anniversary in a letter which was read out by Sir Menzies at the beginning of the ceremony. Prince William, who met his wife Catherine while studying at St Andrews, wrote: 'As a proud new father, I have come to think more than ever about the world our children will inherit; and the role of education, research and intellectual courage in our society has never seemed so important. 'For Catherine and me, the University of St Andrews is an emblem of these virtues. Cheered: Mrs Clinton, picture din her black ceremonial gown, received the degree as a recognition of her achievements as a politician and diplomat . 'As proud patron of the Anniversary Appeal, I am delighted to offer my congratulations to all the university’s honorary graduates today and my warmest congratulations to an institution that may be 600-years-old but which has never been as vital. Happy birthday, St Andrews.' As he welcomed guests and graduates, Sir Menzies also read out a letter from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone which passed on the congratulations of Pope Francis. 'His Holiness Pope Francis was pleased to be informed of the celebrations marking the 600th anniversary of foundation of the University of St Andrews and he sends cordial greetings to all taking part,' the cardinal wrote. 'His Holiness is confident that the noble work of education and research in a wide range of academic fields will continue to flourish in the city that bears the same name of Scotland’s patron saint.' St Andrews principal and vice-president, Professor Louise Richardson, said the university has lasted so long because of it’s 'enduring value'. She said: '600 years is a very long time. How many institutions can you think of that have been around that long? Not many.' Honorary degrees were also bestowed on the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, classicist Professor Mary Beard, inventor of the world wide web Professor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, particle physicist Professor Peter Higgs - who could not attend - anthropologist Professor Dame Marilyn Strathern and philosopher Professor Nancy Cartwright. The university, said to be the third oldest in the English-speaking world, has historic links with the US as three of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson and John Witherspoon, studied at or held degrees from St Andrews.","Former First Lady presented with honorary degree at St Andrews .

Paul Brockmann, 78, wanted wife Margot, 76, to have a different dress every time they went ballroom dancing. And his relentless desire to deck her out in a beautiful frock led to him buying dozens of gowns a week over the decades. But following a bout of ill-health and expensive storage costs - the dresses took up six full storage containers - the couple from L.A. are now selling off the impressive collection. Scroll down for video . Belle of the ball: Paul bought wife Margot a new dress every time they went dancing . German-born, Paul, a general contractor, started dancing at the age of 13 and has enjoyed the pastime ever since. But he became as obsessed by the beautiful dresses worn by the female dancers as he did by the dance moves. He met Margot at a dance and said she 'changed his life' after they fell in love. He writes on his website: 'Margot is the love of my life and has remained so to this very day. I followed her to the United States and was disowned by my own family for doing so back in the 50's. 'We first lived in the Midwest and with time travelled West and settled in Los Angeles, California. The dress collection grew as I searched far and wide at estate sales, department stores, yard sales and antique shows. Always looking to buy more dresses for Margot, everywhere and anywhere I went.' Walk-in wardrobe: Paul has bought 55,000 dresses for his wife over the decades . On sale: Margot sifts through rails of her own dresses, gifted to her by her husband over 56 years of marriage - they will keep a couple of their favourites . Strictly come dancing: Paul discovered the pastime at the age of 13 and has loved it every since . Paul explains how his love for Margot resulted in the huge vintage dress collection that's now on sale via their website. He said: 'I loved seeing her dance and began collecting dresses for her. I would envisage Margot dancing in the dress, the look of it, the sound of it, and buy dress after dress for her to wear when we danced.' The 55,000 dresses were bought across the decades - sometimes as many as 30 at a time - but it was always the 50s styles that Paul likes best. 'I was fascinated by the dresses from . the 50s. The petticoats and the wide skirts made a woman look real . feminine. And that is what I really liked. When I seen a gal with a . dress like that,' Paul tells LA Weekly. 'I wanted to get her on the dance floor.' '[Margot and I] went ballroom dancing every week, and I wanted her to have a different dress for every dance.' But Paul's fascination with the dresses went far beyond him just buying them for Margot to wear once a week. He bought a total of 55,000 - many of which his wife has never even worn. Paul told LA Weekly he would buy the . dresses 'before work, after work, sometimes during work' raiding . department stores and yard sales so he would sometimes come home with 30 . dresses in one day. Dancing through the decades: Paul and Margot met at a dance and enjoyed the hobby together every week . Never have enough dresses: The collection grew as Paul searched estate sales, department stores, yard sales and antique shows . Spoilt for choice: Paul wanted his wife to have a different dress for every dance. He loves how they make a woman look . The most he ever spent on a dress was $300 (nearly £200) and he would buy them regardless of size - meaning they often didn't fit his wife. He explained: 'If there was a dress that I liked, I could visualise what she would look like in it. And I had to have it. Even if it was the wrong size. 'You know, it's a crazy idea, but I kept thinking maybe my wife grows into them, whether losing weight or gaining.' Two children, five decades of marriage and 55,000 dresses later, they have reached a point where they want to sell off their astounding collection. But not entirely. 'I do have some of my favourites that aren't for sale,' he tells HuffPost UK Lifestyle. 'From the very first one I bought my wife to the one that makes the perfect swoosh sound.' 'At the time of purchasing the dresses I really had no idea about designer names, but I am discovering dresses that date back to the 1940s from designers such as Oscar de La Renta and Vera Wang.' Vintage finds: He had no idea of designers at the time, but the collection boasts Oscar de La Renta and Vera Wang .","Paul, 78, and Margot Brockmann, 76, married in the 1950s .

A gang of squatters have been accused of making their neighbours lives 'a living hell' for four years - but can't be evicted because of a legal loophole. The squatters, believed to be eastern European, keep locals up all night by playing bongo drums and dump piles of rubbish in their street in Streatham, south London. But police have been left powerless to boot them out because the building is classed as commercial property. Neighbours say the squatters sit on the roof and make noise, making their lives a misery . New laws introduced last year which allow squatters to be jailed for six months only cover residential properties. Angry locals have branded powers to evict squatters 'pointless' and 'stupid' and demanded the government reform the law. Richard and Philomena Chadwick, whose house backs on to the squat, have lived in the road for 40 years but say their lives have been blighted by the constant noise coming from the property. Mr Chadwick, 71, a retired local government housing officer, said: 'They have made our lives a living misery, we hear banging and crashing all through the night. The squatters keep locals up all night by playing bongo drums and dump piles of rubbish in their street in Streatham, south London . Developer and architect Mike Moxley, whose company owns the site and still pays rates on it, cannot enter the property legally after squatters changed the locks . 'It is a living hell. My wife and I are pensioners now and we have to put up with all the rubbish they dump outside. 'They play their bongo drums into the night and sunbathe on the roof overlooking our garden. It's a massive invasion of privacy. We can't even go into our back garden anymore. 'The whole area is being held to ransom by these squatters. The council, the police, there is nothing they can do. The squatters have more rights than we've got.' Last August the law was changed to make squatting a criminal offence in residential properties, but not commercial ones. Mr Chadwick said the squatters were well versed in the legal loophole and were 'playing the system'. Philomena and Richard Chadwick say the squatters sit on the roof (pictured) of the building next door that overlooks their back garden and make a lot of noise . He said: 'The law is an ass. It is totally toothless. We pay our taxes but they don't. If they want to stay somewhere they should pay their way. 'These squatters are mainly eastern European and they have convertible cars out the front. They have money. They are playing the system. 'I think the government is embarrassed because the law is stupid. But we need action.' Around 15 people live in the ex-factory, where they blare out loud music, drum all night long and loiter on their neighbours' garden walls. Mr Chadwick's son, Paul, 36, who lives with his parents while studying for a Masters degree in music, said: 'They have caused quite a lot of aggro. 'They bang on their tribal drums beyond midnight. 'They should pay their way like the rest of society, I don't see any reason why they should get free room and board. 'They get up on the roof and sunbathe and drum. It is not the kind of thing you want to see from your bedroom. It's a nuisance.' Susan Bristol, 53, who lives opposite, said: 'You can hear the music through my double glazing. It's not even our own people who are using it.' Constituency Labour MP Chuka Umunna has called for a change in the law and said it was 'unfair' for the squatters to be living there for free during a 'cost of living crisis'. Developer and architect Mike Moxley, whose company owns the site and still pays rates on it, cannot enter the property legally after squatters changed the locks. He said: 'I want them out.' But the squatters remain defiant, with one saying: 'We're not doing anything wrong. This is commercial property.'","Squatters play bongos and dump piles of rubbish in their Streatham street .

Stoke City midfielder Steven Nzonzi can be revealed as the Premier League star whose car was involved in a smash with a cyclist now being investigated by police. The incident has led to an amazing Twitter campaign backed by Sir Chris Hoy to identify the player, who urged his 520,000 followers: 'please find him'. Nzonzi is alleged to have laughed at the cyclist and told him ‘good luck finding me on foreign plates’ before driving away from the accident in his luxury car last week. The star was unavailable for comment but MailOnline can confirm he is the player involved.

It is understood the 24-year-old French . midfielder, who joined Stoke from Blackburn for £3million last summer, . has been advised by lawyers not to speak out in case it becomes a police . matter. Rob Lockhart said the driver refused to swap insurance details after the incident last week because 'it didn't apply' when an accident involves a bike and a car .

The cyclist, Rob Lockhart, claims the . player’s matt-black Audi Q7 braked suddenly in Hale, near Manchester, . last Thursday night and he bruised his face and damaged his bike after . smashing into the back. Mr Lockhart said: ‘He pulled away and . then pulled over sharply to park on double yellow lines outside a cash . point. It was dangerous. ‘I hit the back window with my head, helmet and face. I had mild concussion for two to three days afterwards. ‘He got out of his car and said, . “Sorry, I didn’t see you”. Then he just walked to the cashpoint.

He then left the scene. ‘I called the police when I got home. I . don’t know who he was, he had a foreign accent. I don’t follow . football.

Karen Welsh, pictured, was strangled in her home by paranoid schizophrenic John Constantine . A damning investigation into the killing of a nurse by a paranoid schizophrenic has revealed a series of blunders by the NHS, police and probation service. Karen Welsh, 52, was strangled at home by John Constantine, 33, who had been discharged from a psychiatric hospital. Constantine beat Mrs Welsh and cut her wrists in March 2010 – while he had already breached the conditions of a suspended prison sentence. Mrs Welsh, a nurse, had let Constantine, stay in her Cardiff home as he was homeless after being let out. At the time he was only receiving treatment for depression. But a report into her death by Healthcare Inspectorate Wales has said that he was misdiagnosed by doctors, and should also have been arrested by police years earlier. It said that his hospital treatment was ‘inadequate’, and that he was only properly diagnosed as a ‘floridly psychotic’ paranoid schizophrenic after killing Mrs Welsh. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which initially assessed Constantine, was criticised for underestimating the risks he posed. The report said: ‘Had there been a more assertive and less fragmented attempt to gain a better understanding of the risks that he posed, it is possible the killing may have been preventable.’ It also revealed that police and probation officers repeatedly failed to arrest Constantine - who breached the conditions of his suspended sentence for a hammer attack, burglary and car theft in 2008. Karen Welsh, pictured right with her daughter Joanne, left, might not have died if police and doctors had acted properly, a report said . It said: ‘On more than one occasion opportunities were missed to apprehend him and bring him back under the supervision of the probation service or the courts.’ Her daughter Joanne Welsh described her heartbreak on finding out that her mother’s death was preventable. She said: ‘It is extremely upsetting to hear the conclusions. ‘My mother could still be alive had it not been for misdiagnosis, failures in communication between the relevant agencies and a lack of mental health awareness. ‘These failings meant that a very dangerous and unwell man was let down and allowed to commit such a devastating crime.’ When Constantine was tried in court for Mrs Welsh’s murder, it emerged that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who had been fit and well until suffering a mental breakdown in 2008. He denied murder but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was sent indefinitely to a maximum security hospital. The court heard that he had changed his name from Kevin Astley to John Constantine after a Keanu Reeves character. Reeves played the occult detective in Constantine, a 2005 occult thriller in which his character can talk to demons. Ruth Walker, head of nursing at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, said: ‘It is clear that communication between statutory agencies fell short of expectation. ‘Both patients were let down by that failure, with tragic consequences.’ Dr Ruth Hussey, chief medical officer for Wales, said: ‘In this complex case, there were several key findings of concern. ‘The Welsh Government expects the local health board involved to work with other partners to take the appropriate actions and learn from this tragic case. ‘On behalf of the NHS in Wales, I would like to apologise sincerely to everyone affected by this tragedy.’","John Constantine, 33, strangled Karen Welsh at home in Cardiff in 2010 .

Authorities have found a body inside the perimeter of a wildfire that destroyed 30 homes and forced the evacuation of 300 others in Northern California. The burnt body of Brian Stanley Henry, 56, was found inside a motor home that was destroyed by the fire, Shasta County coroner's Lt. Mark Lillibridge said on Wednesday. Sheriff's deputies discovered Henry's body late Tuesday while checking his home in the community of Igo. Beginnings: The fire broke out August 17 in a remote area of Stanislaus National Forest near Jawbone ridge . The Clover Fire broke out Monday afternoon in the community of Happy Valley, about 150 miles north of Sacramento, and winds sent it spreading at 500 acres an hour. Residents were given just minutes to grab their belongings and leave, as the fire jumped roads and engulfed homes. The fire burned nearly 11 square miles. Cooler weather has helped firefighters contain 40 per cent of the blaze. Evacuation orders remained for the 300 homes, though at least some might be lifted later in the day, state fire spokesman Mike Witesman said. 'Things are looking good,' he said. Thomas Texeira said he initially battled the flames but left when the fire came within 200 yards of his home. 'I drove through a wall of flames,' Teixeira told the Record Searchlight of Redding about his narrow escape. Redding Fire Department firefighters Bryan Gibbons (left) and Justin Smith mop up hot spots on the Clover Fire in Happy Valley, California today . Meanwhile, the Rim Fire in and around Yosemite National Park was 80 percent contained, with full containment expected Sept. 20. That blaze burned nearly 400 square miles. Firefighters also gained ground on a wildfire burning in a San Francisco Bay Area wilderness park. Containment of the Morgan Fire at Mount Diablo State Park in Contra Costa County increased to 70 percent overnight. The fire has burned a little less than 5 square miles. All evacuations had been lifted, and full containment was expected by Friday. The Rim Fire, named for a popular local lookout spot called Rim of the . World, has charred more than 237,000 acres, or 370 square miles (958 . square kilometers), of timber and chaparral since it erupted August 17 . in an area known as Jawbone Ridge in a remote corner of the national . forest. The precise origins of the so-called Rim Fire, which erupted nearly . three weeks ago in the Stanislaus National Forest west of Yosemite, . remained under investigation, and no arrests have been made, the U.S. Forest Service said. Jeremy Ward, captain of California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, investigates the cause of the so-called Clover Fire in Happy Valley, California . Officials have said the Rim Fire was caused by a hunter. The causes of the other two fires remain under investigation. Beyond saying the fire began 'when a hunter allowed an illegal fire to escape,' authorities declined to comment on evidence linking the hunter to the blaze. The individual has not been publicly identified. Word that investigators had traced the fire's origins to a hunter's campfire came a day after authorities ruled out the possibility that the Rim Fire somehow began from an illegal marijuana cultivation site in the national forest. Speculation that a pot farm might be to blame grew out of videotaped comments made by a local fire department chief during an August 23 community meeting, but fire officials again denied any such connection to the blaze, or to the hunter in question. 'There is no indication the hunter was involved with illegal marijuana cultivation on public lands and no marijuana cultivation sites were located near the origin of the fire,' the Forest Service said in its statement.","Brian Stanley Henry, 56, was found inside a motor home in Igo .

The two-year-old boy who died after falling into a pit of African wild dogs on Sunday bled to death after he was mauled by the animals, a medical examiner said. Police and officials at the Pittsburgh . Zoo and PPG Aquarium are continuing to investigate the death of Maddox . Derkosh after he fell from a wooden railing . overlooking the painted dogs exhibit. Witnesses say he had 'no chance' of surviving after falling 11-feet into the pit while his horrified parents Jason and Elizabeth Derkosh looked on helpless. Maddox's funeral will be held on Friday and his parents are asking friends, relatives and other mourners to donate toy construction trucks in the boy's name, which will be given to a Christmas children's charity. Scroll down for video . Victim: Maddox Derkosh, two, 'didn't stand a chance' of surviving after falling 11 feet into the dog pit at the Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium while his horrified parents Jason and Elizabeth Derkosh looked on helpless . Maddox Derkosh's home: Outside the front door, bouquets of flowers, a toy truck and a pumpkin rest in memory of the two-year-old . Deadly hunters: The Pittsburgh Zoo and Aquarium has housed a pack of 11 African Painted dogs, one of which is seen here in 2009, for several years . Scene: The overlook platform where the boy fell into the exhibit that was home to a pack of African painted dogs is seen through a window from another observation area at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium . Where: This is the overlook platform where two-year-old Maddox fell into the dog enclosure. He bounced off the net, which is there to save small items like cameras and phones . Desperate rescue attempts by zookeepers . and armed police officers could not deter the 11 aggressive beasts as . they savagely attacked the two-year-old. Barbara Baker, CEO and president of . the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium said there is a net below the rail, . but the boy bounced off it and into the enclosure. She said the animals attacked the . child so quickly that by the time a veterinarian and other zoo staffers . arrived seconds later, they determined it would have been futile to try . to rescue the child. Authorities said that zoo staff and . then police responded 'within minutes' but visitors described that time . as being filled with screams for help. Zookeepers called off some of the dogs, and seven of them immediately went to a back building. The African wild dog is an endangered species which typically roams the open plains and sparse woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. The dog's Latin name Lycaon pictus means 'painted wolf' because of the animal's patchy colored coat of red, black, brown, white and yellow fur, each with their own unique pattern. These dogs are very social, and packs have been known to share food and to assist weak or ill members. In fact after a successful hunt, the dogs regurgitate meat for those that remained at the den. They hunt in packs of six to 20 and despite their small size they prey on large animals like antelopes and wildebeests. They kill the larger prey by disemboweling, a technique . that is rapid but has caused this species to have a negative, ferocious . reputation. They are often hunted and killed by farmers who fear for their domestic animals and are susceptible to diseases spread by domestic animals. Its large teeth allow it to consume a lot of bone in the same way a hyena does and it has a bite force quotient - BFQ, the strength of bite relative to the animal's mass -  measured at 142, the highest of any carnivore, except for the Tasmanian devil. They are extremely aggressive and nearly 80 per cent of their hunts end in a kill - as opposed to a lion with a success rate of just 30 percent. There were once approximately 500,000 African wild dogs in 39 countries, and packs of 100 or more were not uncommon. Now there are only about 3,000-5,500 in fewer than 25 countries . Three more eventually were drawn away . from the child and one especially aggressive dog refused to back down and stop attacking . the boy. It was shot dead by an officer.  Experts said the death is highly unusual. The zoo will reopen today for the first time since the attack and though the dogs are currently in quarantine, they will not be euthanized. The observation deck exhibit area will remain off limits to visitors while the dogs will be able to roam some sections of the African savannah closure, according to CBS Pittsburgh. The family's neighbor Rachel Majcher told . the Tribune Review: '(Jason and Elizabeth) went nowhere without Maddox. I cannot imagine . the dark cloud that is following them.' 'I can’t imagine as a mom myself what tragedy that would be, Your heart stops when your kid skins a knee.' She . said her father saw Maddox trick-or-treating in a Superman costume, and . he could often be found playing on a swing set with his cousin, who . lives nearby. 'The hardest part is going to be to explain to my kids that their playmate is no longer here. His life will be celebrated.' Steve Feldman, a spokesman for the . Association of Zoos and Aquariums, said no one he's spoken to can recall . any deaths of children at an accredited zoo over the last 40 years or . more. Feldman said the Pittsburgh Zoo . successfully completed its five-year review in September, which means it . meets or exceeds all safety standards. The zoo was immediately closed, and it was not clear when it will reopen, authorities said. The so-called painted dogs are about . as big as medium-sized domestic dogs, and 37 to 80 pounds , according to . the zoo. They have large, rounded ears and dark brown circles around . their eyes and are considered endangered. The attack happened in a 1.5 acre . exhibit called the Painted Dog Bush Camp that's part of a larger open . area where elephants, lions and other animals can be seen. Visitors walk . onto a deck that is glassed on the sides, but open in front where the . roughly four-foot railing is located. In May, some of the dogs crawled . under a fence and escaped into a part of the exhibit that's usually . closed. The zoo was on lockdown for about an hour as a precaution. Kraus said there was nothing to prevent visitors to the painted dog exhibit from jumping into the exhibit area. He described the accident as 'horrific'. 'Unfortunately, . the dogs were in pack mentality and not responding to zookeepers' efforts to control them,' the zoo said in a statement. Police and the Allegheny County . medical examiner's office are investigating, and they haven't yet . interviewed the mother or father, who are receiving grief counseling. Baker said the zoo, which has never . had a visitor death, will also investigate. She said no decision has . been made yet on the future of the exhibit. Emergency: Now closed, the Pittsburgh Zoo's entrance is seen after the young boy was killed after falling into the exhibit around noon . Lock-dock: The zoo immediately closed and patrons were hurried inside buildings during the attack . Deadly: The dogs, which are smaller than Labrador retrievers, can be dangerous on their own by are deadly killers when hunting in packs . Zoo officials said there is a mesh . barrier beyond the railing, but Lt Kraus said it was designed to catch . small objects such as cameras, and not humans. Investigators have not determined the exact cause of death, he said. 'The screams just kept coming and coming: ""Someone help. Someone has to do something,''' witness Angela Cinti, 20, who was visiting the zoowith her boyfriend told the Pittsburgh-Post Gazette. 'We were on our way to the polar bear exhibit when we heard the most horrible piercing screams,' Ms Ciniti recalled. 'Someone was begging for help, asking someone to do something.' Guests recounted being hurried into the nearest building for safety, waiting for a half an hour according to Ms Cinit. 'We were locked down in the building . and told to stay inside,' Ms Cinit told the paper. 'We thought it was a . problem with one of the animals that got loose. Then we were told it was . an incident with the wild dogs and that a child had been hurt.' Uncertainty: A security guard closes the gate to the park though it's not yet clear whether he died from the fall or the attack . Reaction: The boy was pronounced dead at the scene as guests were hurried into the nearest buildings as a safety precaution, ushered under zoo officials like Ms Baker, pictured . In May, 200 patrons were rushed inside buildings and the zoo was put on lock-down when nine of the dogs sneaked out of the exhibit and found its way into a secondary holding pen. Alone, the dogs, which weigh up to 80 pounds, can be formidable, but in packs they are vicious -- capable of hunting and killing prey many times their size. They have been known to kill wildebeest and zebras, though they usually pursue less dangerous prey. The dogs, which are endangered, are among the most deadly predators of the Serengeti Plain. Their hunts end in a kill 80 per cent of the time. Lions have a success rate of just 30 per cent.

America’s richest family – the Waltons – is using a tax loophole related to charitable giving to ensure that large chunks of their enormous wealth can be passed on tax free to their heirs. The dynasty behind the Walmart retail chain has a combined wealth estimated at more than $150 billion and retains a 48 percent stake in the world’s second largest publicly listed company. Since 2003, charitable trusts setup in the names of two deceased family members have donated more than $9 billion to their charitable arm - the Walton Family Foundation. Keeping it in the family: Jim Walton, left, Alice Walton, and Rob Walton have given considerable amounts to charity but those same trusts are also helping to keep their fortune tax free for future generations . However according to tax experts these massive donations will also benefit future generations of the family by ensuring that they inherit a tax free fortune. The world’s largest retailer was started by Sam Walton in 1950 when he opened ‘Walton's 5 & 10’ store in Bentonville, Arkansas. In 1953 the business was still very much in its infancy, the Walmart brand didn’t launch til the early 1960s, but Sam Walton decided to divide the business in order to avoid a potential estate tax bill. He have each of his four children - Rob, John, Alice and Jim - received 20 percent, while he and his wife Helen kept the remaining 20 percent. Family portrait: This photograph of Sam Walton, wife Helen and their four children Rob, John, Alice and Jim is displayed at the Walmart museum, in Bentonville, Arkansas . The world's largest retailer: The Waltons retain a 48 percent stake in Wal-Mart Stores which is the world's second largest publicly listed company . His oldest child, Sam, was only nine-years-old at the time, but the unusual decision was a calculated move he revealed in his autobiography, ‘Made in America.’ ‘The best way to reduce paying estate taxes is to give your assets away before they appreciate,’ he wrote. Although he liked to cultivate an image as an ‘ordinary fella,’ Walton had shown great foresight about estate planning, which his family members are continuing to show today. The Walton Family is the richest family in the world. Sam Walton’s children have consistently been in the top ten of the Forbes 400 since 2001, although Christy Walton took her husband John's place after his death in 2005. The current Bloomberg Billionaires Index has Christy with a fortune of $36.5 billion, making her the 9th richest person in the world, Jim has a fortune of $35.2 billion and is 10th, Rob has $34.3 billion and is 11th, while Alice has $33.6 billion and is the 12th richest person in the world. According to court records and Internal Revenue Service filings obtained by Bloomberg, the family is using a number of complex tax avoidance practices to maintain their wealth and avoid paying large inheritance taxes. One practice in particular relates to placing large sums of money in charitable trusts so they bypass estate tax laws. Christy Walton, left, inherited husband John's fortune when he died in 2005, while Alice, right, is an avid art collector and has established the Crystal Bridges Museum in their home town of Bentonville, Arkansas . The Walmart dynasty: Sam and Helen Walton had four children, three of whom are still alive and amongst the richest people in the U.S. The family of co-founder Bud Walton hasn't been included . The trusts are often referred to ‘Jackie O.’ trusts after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the former First Lady who died in 1994 and whose will requested the creation of one in her name. According to IRS data seen by Bloomberg, the Waltons are by far the biggest users of these ‘Jackie O’ trusts, which are increasingly being used by the very wealthy to safeguard their money. Wealthy families held a record $20.9 billion in Jackie O. trusts in 2011, almost twice the amount they held in 2000. Although it can be claimed that the money put into ‘Jackie O.’ trusts is ostensibly for charity, they have another desirable feature and if the assets appreciate substantially over the years, then they can pass money tax free to heirs. Because assets must be locked up for several decades, such trusts are attractive only to the wealthiest families. ‘You have to be someone who’s willing to say, “I don’t need this extra money,’” John Anzivino, a principal at Kaufman Rossin & Co. told Bloomberg. “‘At the same time, we hope to shift it down a generation, without tax.’” Three cheers: Jim Walton (left), Alice Walton and Chairman of the Board of Directors Rob Walton recite the Walmart cheer at the annual shareholders meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas on June 7, 2013 . The Walton family’s main charitable arm - the Walton Family Foundation - is funded mostly through 21 of these trusts. Helen Walton established 16 such trusts before her death in 2007, while the other five trusts are in the name of her son John, who died in an ultra-light plane crash in 2005. The 21 trusts hold more than $9 billion, some of which has been used to help pay for Walton Family Foundation projects such as the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville. It was opened by Alice Walton, 63, in 2011 and houses her art collection in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home. She is a former money manager who founded and ran her own financial firm, Llama Co., and now lives on a ranch in Texas known as the Rocking W., where she raises award-winning cutting horses and collects art. Alice has spent as much as $35 million on some of the art work in the gallery. Walmart heiress Alice Walton founded Crystal Bridges in 2011 in a wooded ravine next to her childhood home, it has been bankrolled by more than $1 billion in donations from her family . Walmart workers protesting for better jobs and higher wages marching in L.A. last Thursday . Bankrolled by more than $1 billion in donations from her family, the gallery has attracted tourists to the local area and provided jobs, but is also help to preserve the family’s fortune for generations to come. The Waltons’ example highlights how billionaires – and their accountants – can deftly bypass estate laws intended to ensure that the nation’s wealthiest contribute their fair share to government as well as provide for their heirs. Last year only $14 billion was raised through estate and gift taxes. That equates to just one percent of the $1.2 trillion passed down in America each year. ‘I hate to say it, but the very rich pay very little in gift and estate tax,’ said Jerome Hesch, a lawyer at Berger Singerman who reviewed some of the Walton family’s trust filings for Bloomberg. ‘At the Waltons’ numbers, the savings are unbelievable.’ A family spokesman, Lance Morgan, said in a statement that ‘any charitable or estate planning practices employed by the Walton family are broadly available and commonly used.’ The trusts are often referred to 'Jackie O.' trusts after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the former First Lady who died in 1994 . A donor locks up their assets in a Charitable Lead Annuity Trusts (CLATs) for a lengthy period of time such as 20 or 30 years. A set amount is then given away each year to charity. At the end of the time period whatever is left goes to a beneficiary - the donor’s heirs - without any tax bill. The trusts are often referred to 'Jackie O.' trusts after Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the former First Lady who died in 1994 and whose will requested the creation of one in her name. The type of Jackie O. trust used by the Waltons doesn’t generate a break on income taxes, instead the potential big saving is on gift and estate taxes. When a donor sets one up, the IRS assesses how much gift or estate tax is due, based on how much of the trust’s assets will end up benefiting charity and how much will go to heirs. The IRS makes an estimate using a formula tied to the level of U.S. Treasury bond yields during the time when the trust is set up. If the trust’s investments outperform that benchmark rate, then the extra earnings are passed on to the designated heirs free of any estate tax. That rate has been hovering near an all-time low since 2009 and is currently 1.4 percent. With a big enough spread between the actual performance and the IRS rate, a Jackie O. trust has the potential to save so much tax that it leaves the family richer than if they hadn’t given to charity. A trust can only save taxes if they beat that 3.6 percent rate, which they would have done at any stage over the past five years. The trusts returned about 14 percent a year before taxes during that period, according to a Bloomberg analysis of IRS filings. That growth means the four Helen Walton trusts have been accumulating assets faster than they give them away. As of 2011, they held a combined $2 billion, up from $1.4 billion in 2007. Barring a stark reversal of fortune, at least that much money will probably pass to Helen Walton’s heirs.","America's richest family is using a tax loophole to ensure that large chunks of their wealth .

The Acer Iconia W3 - which appeared briefly on amazon.com before being removed  - is the first small tablet seen running Microsoft's Windows 8 software. Microsoft is also believed to be developing its own tablet, based on the larger Surface, which is to be unveiled next month at the firm's Build developer conference. Acer's W3 tablet: The Amazon listing said the W3 would cost $379.99 for the 32GB model, and come with a dual-core Intel Atom . processors to do battle with Apple's iPad mini . The listing was quickly removed from amazon's US site . The listing said the W3 would cost $379.99 for the 32GB model, and come with a dual-core Intel Atom processor. It will launch with a screen resolution of 1280 x 800, although there was no date specified on the listing. Earlier this month French site minimachines.net revealed more pictures of the gadget, which is set to come with a keyboard addon turning it onto a laptop. Microsoft is rumoured to be announcing its two small-screen Surface tablets at the Build Developers Conference in June. According to French site minimachines.net the gadget will come with a keyboard add on to turn it into a mini laptop . Is this the first Windows 8 8.1inch tables? Minimachines.net claims this is another shot of the Acer W3 . One of these is expected to be its own -  a smaller version of its Surface tablet with a 7inch screen. The tablets are expected to go on sale later this year, and will go head to head with Apple's iPad Mini, Google's Nexus 7 and the Amazon Kindle Fire in the lucrative small tablet market. It is hoped the devices could reverse the disappointing sales of the larger Surface tablet which Microsoft launched this year. The Surface tablet was unveiled earlier this year to a lukewarm reception - Now Microsoft is believed to be developing a smaller version to take on Apple's iPad mini . Samsung's new Galaxy Mega has a 6.3-inch HD screen - although the firm claims it is 'ultra-thin and portable enough to put into your pocket.' The Mega comes with an enhanced 8 megapixel rear-facing camera with a 1.9 megapixel front-facing camera, and runs Google Android software. 'The software giant is developing a new lineup of its Surface tablets, including a 7-inch version expected to go into mass production later this year,', The Wall Street Journal said people familiar with the company's plans had claimed. It claims the 7-inch tablets weren't part of the company's strategy last . year, but Microsoft executives realized they needed a response to the . rapidly growing popularity of smaller tablets like Google 7-inch Nexus, . which was announced last summer, and the 7.9-inch iPad Mini introduced . by Apple last October, along with Amazon's Fire HD. Separate reports have speculated the new tablet could be designed primarily as a games and media device, and be branded as an 'Xbox tablet' to accompany Microsoft's hugely successful games console. It comes amid growing concern for the future of the PC industry as consumers move towards tablets. PC sales have have gone into freefall with a 14 per cent drop last year - the biggest slump in history. HP, the world's largest PC maker, saw the sharpest decline with 24 per cent fewer machines sold in 2012 compared to 2011. Dell also saw an 11 per cent slump and even Apple, which saw a seven per cent fall, was unable to buck the trend. Research firm IDC said it was the biggest decline overall since it began began tracking this data in 1994. Analysts . said that ‘the days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’ and that in . the future we would all be using portable devices. Even . the launch of Windows 8 failed to stop the trend with some saying the . negative response to the software may have exacerbated the trend. PC . makers have in recent years tried a string of innovations to breathe . life into the market including Ultrabooks which were poorly received. How the competition stacks up . Experts say the success of the iPad and smartphone has led to the slump in PC sales, with people preferring gadgets they can carry with them . Windows 8 was also criticised for making too many changes and getting rid of the iconic start button. The figures show that the late Apple founder Steve Jobs’ prediction that we are headed for a ‘post-PC era’ is coming true. Bob . O’Donnell, program vice president for clients and displays at IDC, said . that what he called the ‘radical changes’ made to the PC in recent . years had done it more harm than good. He . said: ‘At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 . launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but . appears to have slowed the market. ‘Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market’. Microsoft also came under fire for the slump, with critics saying its Windows 8 software confused users . Some 350 million personal computers are sold each year, but the numbers are nothing compared to more portable options. Some 919 million smartphones will be sold this year and 200 million tablets, taking their total comfortably over one billion. Research firm Gartner also released similar figures which showed a 11 per cent decline in PC sales, the biggest drop since 2001. The company has already predicted that by 2017 the main operating system for all computing devices will be Google’s Android. Marcus Jewell of tech company Brocade said: ‘The days seem to be numbered for the humble PC’.","Acer Iconia W3 believe to be one of several Microsoft-powered gadgets similar to the iPad mini in development .

Edward Snowden has highly sensitive documents on how the National Security Agency is structured and operates that could harm the U.S. government, but has insisted that they not be made public, a journalist close to the NSA leaker said. Glenn Greenwald, a columnist with The Guardian newspaper who first reported on the intelligence leaks, told The Associated Press that disclosure of the information in the documents 'would allow somebody who read them to know exactly how the NSA does what it does, which would in turn allow them to evade that surveillance or replicate it.' He said the 'literally thousands of documents' taken by Snowden constitute 'basically the instruction manual for how the NSA is built.' During Friday's meeting Edward Snowden told human rights activists he plans to stay in Russia temporarily, but officials say they haven't received any request . 'In . order to take documents with him that proved that what he was saying . was true he had to take ones that included very sensitive, detailed . blueprints of how the NSA does what they do,' the journalist said Sunday . in a Rio de Janeiro hotel room. He said the interview was taking place . about four hours after his last interaction with Snowden. Greenwald . said he believes the disclosure of the information in the documents . would not prove harmful to Americans or their national security, but . that Snowden has insisted they not be made public. Media frenzy: Russian lawyer Genri Reznik (C) speaks to journalists after arriving at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow on Friday for a meeting with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden . 'I . think it would be harmful to the U.S. government, as they perceive . their own interests, if the details of those programs were revealed,' he . said. He has previously said the documents have been encrypted to help ensure their safekeeping. Snowden . emerged from weeks of hiding in a Moscow airport Friday, and said he . was willing to meet President Vladimir Putin's condition that he stop . leaking U.S. secrets if it means Russia would give him asylum until he . can move on to Latin America. Greenwald . told The AP that he deliberately avoids talking to Snowden about issues . related to where the former analyst might seek asylum in order to avoid . possible legal problems for himself . Guarded: The world's media were eager to get a glimpse of the fugitive whistleblower who remains at the police guarded transit area of the airport, where the meeting took place . Snowden . is believed to be stuck in the transit area of Moscow's main . international airport, where he arrived from Hong Kong on June 23. He's . had offers of asylum from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia, but because . his U.S. passport has been revoked, the logistics of reaching whichever . country he chooses are complicated. Still, Greenwald said that Snowden remains 'calm and tranquil,' despite his predicament. 'I . haven't sensed an iota of remorse or regret or anxiety over the . situation that he's in,' said Greenwald, who has lived in Brazil for the . past eight years. 'He's of course tense and focused on his security and . his short-term well-being to the best extent that he can, but he's very . resigned to the fact that things might go terribly wrong and he's at . peace with that.' Greenwald . said he worried that interest in Snowden's personal saga had detracted . from the impact of his revelations, adding that Snowden deliberately . turned down nearly all requests for interviews to avoid the media . spotlight. Asked whether Snowden seemed worried about his personal safety, Greenwald responded, 'he's concerned.' Stranded: Mr Snowden arrived at Sheremetyevo airport on June 23 and has remained in the transit lounge ever since . He . said the U.S. has shown it's 'willing to take even the most extreme . steps if they think doing so is necessary to neutralize a national . security threat,' Greenwald said. 'He's aware of all those things, he's . concerned about them but he's not going to be in any way paralyzed or . constrained in what he thinks he can do as a result of that.' Asked . about a so-called dead man's pact, which Greenwald has said would allow . several people to access Snowden's trove of documents were anything to . happen to him, Greenwald replied that 'media descriptions of it have . been overly simplistic. 'It's . not just a matter of, if he dies, things get released, it's more . nuanced than that,' he said. 'It's really just a way to protect himself . against extremely rogue behavior on the part of the United States, by . which I mean violent actions toward him, designed to end his life, and . it's just a way to ensure that nobody feels incentivized to do that.' He declined to provide any more details about the pact or how it would work. Greenwald said he himself has beefed up his own security, particularly since a laptop went missing from his Rio home. Attack: U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns (left) criticised China for failing to extradite Mr Snowden when he was in Hong Kong following two days of high-level talks between the US and China on security and the economy . 'I . don't really feel comfortable discussing the specific measures, but one . would be really irrational and foolish to have thousands of top-secret . documents from the most secretive agency of the world's most powerful . government and not be thoughtful about added security,' said the . 46-year-old former constitutional and civil rights lawyer who has . written three books contending the government has violated personal . rights in the name of protecting national security. Greenwald . has also co-authored a series of articles in Rio de Janeiro's O Globo . newspaper focusing on NSA actions in Latin America. He said he expected . to continue publishing further stories based on other Snowden documents . over the next four months. Upcoming . stories would likely include details on 'other domestic spying programs . that have yet to be revealed,' but which are similar in scope to those . he has been reporting on. He did not provide further details on the . nature of those programs. It . was not immediately clear whether Russia would take Snowden up on his . latest request for asylum, which could further test U.S.-Russia . relations. Following . Friday's meeting between Snowden and human rights activists, U.S. officials criticized Russia for allowing a 'propaganda platform' for the . NSA leader. White House . spokesman Jay Carney said Russia should instead send Snowden back to the . U.S. to face the felony charges that are pending against him. Carney . said Snowden is not a human rights activist or a dissident. 'He is . accused of leaking classified information, has been charged with three . felony counts and should be returned to the United States,' the . spokesman said. The escape route is fraught with problems for Snowden, and would mean him having to gain access to Russia and then taking a huge detour .

The National Trust is under fire after announcing it is to open up the Big Brother house to the public. Visitors will be able to have a look around some of the UK's most important properties during two days this month. However, the plan to open up the Big Brother house has been criticised by former MP Ann Widdecombe who said she was 'saddened' by the move. The former politician believes the Trust should concentrate on properties which had 'stood the test of time'. Scroll down for video . Brush with fame: The Big Brother House will be open to visitors thanks to the National Trust . The National Trust admitted the scheme to open the house up was just a bit of light-hearted fun . The property with its ever-changing decor has been home to figures such as Vinnie Jones, Ivana Trump and Alex Reid who have taken part in Celebrity Big Brother over the years. It is currently being used for the latest series which is due to end later this week. The property, housed on a plot at the Elstree TV studios, has been seen by millions during the many series on Channel 4 and more lately on Channel 5. It will open to the public on September 27 and 28. The National Trust’s London director Ivo Dawnay said: 'The fact that the housemates’ residence is not, say, a sublime late Robert Adam country house does not necessarily make it less interesting. The house has undergone many changes during its 13-year history . 'The great houses of our past reflected the tastes of the day and so does the Big Brother House.' He added: 'Our tongues are not a million miles from our cheeks - unusual for an organisation not most famous for its sense of humour. We hope that by opening the Big Brother house we are paving the way to an altogether wittier future.' But Miss Widdecombe - a former contestant on BBC1’s Strictly Come Dancing - told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: 'I’m rather saddened by this. 'I’m a member of the National Trust and I’m not going to be burning my membership card because of this, but I don’t think it’s part of the National Trust’s mission.' Traditional: The recently-restored Castle Drogo in Devon is the kind of property people normally associate with the National Trust . Echoes of history: Dunstanburgh Castle in Northumberland has been selected by National Trust experts as one of the top ten secret walks that can only be accessed by foot . Miss Widdecombe said she accepted that the Trust should update its portfolio and not 'just wholly go for historic homes', but questioned whether it should be getting involved with the Big Brother house, rather than BBC Television Centre, which is due for redevelopment. 'I do think something has to stand the test of time before you can seriously call it heritage,' she said. 'I don’t think it needs to be tawdry and celebrity-obsessed. There’s lots of candidates around that I think you could choose for this sort of exercise.' The move would do the Trust 'no favours' she said and warned: 'Even Prime Ministers have discovered in their time that trying to make things look more trendy can upset people who are pretty loyal.'","Visitors invited to look around some of the UK's most important buildings .

Super tax: Lib Dem president Tim Farron has called for a tier structure for its flagship mansion tax policy . Britain’s most expensive homes should . be hit with a ‘super mansion tax’ to help raise billions in tax . revenues, according to a senior Liberal Democrat. The . party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than . £2million, but party president Tim Farron said those worth more should . face an even higher rate. He . said yesterday: ‘You could have various rates within the mansion tax. A . £4million property, for example, paying a higher rate.’ A . tax on expensive properties is also backed by the Labour Party, . suggesting it could become a reality if the two parties form a coalition . after the next general election. Mr Farron told the Evening Standard he wanted . to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than . £2million 'a higher proportion' instead of lowering the threshold to . catch more properties. He . said: 'I do take the point that in London there are many homes that are . worth a significant amount of money which would be seen as not . exorbitantly luxurious properties. 'It’s important that taxation should be progressive. ’You . could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth . £4million, for example, paying at a higher rate, as well as a higher . global sum, than those with smaller properties. ’There is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position.' Mr . Farron’s proposal comes just days after Knight Frank, the estate agent, . warned that under the current plans the Lib Dems will fall short of . raising their target of £1.7billion a year from the mansion tax. Its research suggested the levy would need to be extended to all homes worth more than £1.25million. A . mansion tax would be levied overwhelmingly on London and the South . East, where eight out of ten £2million-plus homes are located. Near the capital: This four-bedroom detached home in St Albans is on the market for £1.35million, enough for the mansion tax if it was reduced to £1.25million. The . plans are also opposed by the Conservatives, which believe that while . the  initial threshold of any mansion tax would  be set very high, it . would be progressively brought down until eventually it hits ‘ordinary . family homes’. Grant . Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, said: ‘Families who live in . suburbs [will] discover they are living in mansions, not ordinary homes. 'They start off . calling it a mansion tax but [it] will gradually bear down on . hard-working families as the threshold comes down further.’ The Lib-Dems unveiled their original . mansion tax policy in 2009 but were quickly forced to raise the . threshold from £1million to £2million amid concerns about the number of . homeowners who would be affected, particularly in London. █ Nick Clegg’s fiercest Liberal Democrat critic has said he should be . ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as Labour’s least . successful leader, Michael Foot. As party members gather for the . start of their annual conference in Glasgow tomorrow, Lord Oakeshott, . who warned that the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the . next general election, added: ‘It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look . at the facts.’","Party president Tim Farron called for tiers of tax on homes today .

The home of the late Michael Winner is going on sale for £17.5million, a staggering sum for most people – but less than a third of what the late film director and critic believed it was worth. Michael Winner, who bought the 47-room mansion in West London's Holland Park from his parents, was convinced the house was worth £60million and even put it on the market for this price in 2011. Following the larger-than-life legend’s death in January, Woodland House, the home he shared with wife Geraldine – and several girlfriends before her, is being sold. Price is right: The opulent home of the late Michael Winner and his wife Geraldine will go on sale this week for less than a third of the prize he had predicted . Wrong number: Michael Winner had previously put the house on the market for £60million, but nine months after his death it is going on sale for £17.5million . Extravagance: The house was initially three flats, but Michael Winner converted it into a mansion . Following his death, it emerged that . on top of substantial debts, Mr Winner had taken out several mortgages . against Woodland House to secure flats for his former girlfriends. Winner . spent millions renovating Woodland House after buying it as a set of . flats in 1978 and reinstating the building to its former grandeur. These . pictures reveal the palatial size and extravagant luxury with which the . residence was decorated - a real reflection of the larger-than-life . personality of Winner. The . house sits on the bend of a leafy crescent in Kensington and was built . in the Queen Anne style by Richard Norman Shaw for a Victorian artist . called Sir Luke Fildes. The . house was originally three flats, which were bought by Winner's . property magnate father, George, and it remains leasehold. The . freeholder is Charlotte Townsend, one of Britain's richest women. Like its master: The extravagant luxury of the mansion is a real reflection of the larger-than-life personality of Winner, who passed away in January this year . No-holds-barred: Michael Winner took over the flats from his father in 1978 and spent millions on the conversion, building a swimming pool, cinema and extensive gardens . Staying British: According to his wife Geraldine it was the wish of Winner, who died in January this year, that the flat be sold to a British family who would not cut it up into flats . Little palace: Winner would hold extravagant parties at Woodland House, a large part of which he had decorated himself . Winner . took possession of the house in 1978 when it was still flats and spent . millions creating an opulent home, complete with swimming pool, cinema . and extensive gardens, which he loved. Despite . making the Victorian marvel a regular feature in celebrity and . architectural magazines down the years, Winner was looking to sell the . house in his later years. Attempting a sale in 2011, Winner set the price at £60million, despite protests from the estate agent. It . was originally his wish that it be taken over by the local council and . become a museum, but the council declined, saying they could not afford . to run it. Although it is . possible the sale will follow the recent West London trend of being . snapped up by foreign buyers, this is not the desire of the late .

With its glorious garden, thatched roof and an out-of-the-way location in rural Hampshire, Home Farm Cottage couldn’t be further from the Hollywood Hills. But this quintessentially English country cottage was once home to the acclaimed film director Ronald Neame who worked with names such as Noel  Coward, Alec Guinness and Judy Garland. ‘Not a lot happens here,’ says current owner Brian Morris of the sleepy hamlet of Quarley that includes just 60 homes, a Saxon church and a community hall. Idyllic: Home Farm Cottage, located in Quarley, Hampshire, is on the market for £545,000 . ‘It’s an 18-mile round trip to the nearest shop,’ he laughs. Ronald Neame bought the house shortly after making his fortune on The Poseidon Adventure, so perhaps it was just the peace and quiet that he craved. The director, who started his career as a runner at Elstree  studios at the age of 12, was the third choice to direct The Poseidon Adventure. Two earlier directors had walked off set leaving the production in a state of near collapse. A disaster movie about a capsized luxury cruise liner whose passengers have to escape from the upside-down vessel, it was his biggest  commercial hit and made him more money than any of his other projects combined. He had already directed Maggie Smith in The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie and collaborated on the screenplay of Brief Encounter. Hollywood home: Ernest Borgnine and Gene Hackman in the 1972 blockbuster The Poseidon Adventure, directed by former Home Farm Cottage owner Ronald Neame . Home Farm Cottage, once owned by the neighbouring farmer, was originally built in the 1500s. It was completely renovated and extended in 1971 and owned briefly by an Army officer and his wife before Ronald Neame bought it in 1972. Brian’s neighbours, who have had a home in the village since the 1960s, recall that Neame appeared to have left his wife and would spend weekends there with his beautiful girlfriend and her sister, all arriving in his Mercedes. Tragically, his girlfriend was to become ill with cancer and died, leading a heartbroken Neame to sell the cottage in 1975 and move to Los Angeles where he lived until his death in 2010 at the age of 99. ‘He became quite integrated in village life, by all accounts,’ says Brian, 78. ‘He went round taking photographs of all the houses, which he printed and mounted for an exhibition in the community hall. ‘Presumably after his girlfriend died it was too sad for him to stay here and he moved to America.

Brian adds: ‘They had created a beautiful Italianate garden of rose trees. Sadly that had died off by the time we came to live here in the 1980s, but my wife was a keen gardener and planted the garden so that there is always something in bloom from March onwards.’ Brian, a retired insurance broker who used to commute from the cottage to the City, has lived in Home Farm Cottage for  26 years and is now selling up for £545,000. He is moving to a retirement village in  Tunbridge Wells, following the death of his wife Valerie last year. Amazingly, the same estate agent who sold him the property in 1987 is now selling it on his behalf. According to Mark Fry of Evans & Partridge, the area is still popular with commuters, attracted by the proximity to Andover station and the journey to Waterloo, which is just over an hour. He says that prices in the area dropped down to 2006 levels after the housing bubble burst in 2008 and that the increase currently seen in the London area has yet to filter down to Hampshire. ‘It could be another couple of years before prices catch up, but things are certainly  getting a lot better. We’ve had a phenomenal summer of instructions and sales,’ he says. The three-bedroom cottage has lots of original features including beams, an inglenook fireplace and a wood-burning stove that was once a bake oven used communally by the village at the beginning of the last century. Brian says: ‘I have to admit, I have sat here by the stove and watched The Poseidon Adventure.

Mrs Cook claimed that in the summer of . 2007 she was one of 100 Scientology executives imprisoned in a large . trailer known as The Hole. Describing the conditions, she said: 'It had bars on the windows and the one entrance was guarded by security 24 hours a day.

She accused him of turning the Church . into a tyrannical regime in direct conflict with the doctrine laid down . by founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. Writing under a banner of 'Keep . Scientology Working', Mrs Cook called out Mr Miscavige for 'hoarding' more than $1billion acquired through fundraising and then spending . millions on building unnecessary, lavish facilities that lie empty. The Church applied for an injunction, . claiming this email breached a confidentiality agreement she signed when . leaving the organisation with a $50,000 (£32,000) pay-off in 2007. But Mrs Cook told the court this had been signed under severe emotional duress, so broken was she after her treatment.

In her New Year's email, Mrs Cook . confirmed her continued commitment to the Church and called on her . fellow worshippers to usher in an era of change.

Service Organization spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. She . left that position a few years ago but remains a highly-respected member . of the Church. The Church has explained its reason for withdrawing its application for an injunction against Mrs Cook and her husband.

Somersaulting over a Formula One car on a BMX, bunny hopping over train tracks and using a giant Dandy comic as an over-sized cycle ramp, a stunning new stunt video could easily have been conceived in the mind of an over imaginative child. But Scottish stunt cyclist Danny MacAskill dreamt up the skilfull display in a giant play room himself for a Red Bull sponsored video released yesterday. The 27-year-old daredevil's latest clip begins with a younger version of the biker playing in his room in a remote cottage on the isle of Skye - where Danny himself was brought up.

But when the camera zooms in, the toy figure on the miniature bike comes to life in the form of renowned stunt cyclist Danny, and what follows is a staggering array of tricks. The former bike mechanic jumps over and somersaults off a series of oversized props made to look like toy building blocks, Rubix cubes and even flipping over the top of a Red Bull Formula One racing car. But one of the props was not just made to look life-size - Danny is seen riding along the top of and performing a series of tricks on the end of the gun of a real Army tank. Although the inspiration for the Imaginate video came from Danny's own childhood dreams, making the short clip itself was anything but child's play - it took two years to put together.

Apple may have given the world a glimpse of the iWatch - or played an elaborate practical joke on millions of iFans.

Apple's latest TV commercial shows and iPhone user wearing a mysterious gadget on his wrist - and it resembles artist's impressions of what a much-rumoured iWatch could look like . The user is shown drumming on a table, and the gadget appears to have rounded edges similar to tan Apple product, and a mysterious circle on its 'face' The so-called 'iWatch' is set to take on Google's Glass eyewear in the wearable computer market. The speculation has let to hundreds of Apple fans creating their own mockups of an iWatch. However, some onlookers have also pointed out that the device looks uncannily like Apple's current iPod Shuffle, which has wrist mounts available for it it turning into a basic watch. The advert comes just weeks before Apple's WWDC event for developers, where it tradictionally reveals new products. This year it is expected to reveal a major overhaul of its iOS software, which reports claim will replace the current software with a 'flat' design being overseen by the Sir Jonathan Ive, the firm's London-born design boss. However, it has also been rumoured the firm could also reveal details of its much rumoured TV service - and even unveil the iWatch. Recently MacUser magazine revealed its idea for the watch, shown below. 'We worked with 3D artist Martin Hajek to conceive, design and construct a plausible Apple watch,' said Adam Banks, Editor in Chief of MacUser magazine. 'The brief we gave ourselves was that it had to feel like something we could actually imagine buying from an Apple Store. 'We came to the conclusion that . Apple’s most likely play would be to keep its watch as conventional as . possible, with the feel of something classic rather than excitably . innovative.' This ruled out the ‘slap wrap’ design featured in a recent Apple patent, which harked back to the 1980s toy craze. 'We came back to the classic leather . strap, something Apple could make well – like the iPad Smart Cover, for . example – but for which third parties could also offer alternatives. MacUser magazine's vision of the iWatch: It believes the watch would look similar to the iPhone 5, and work with Apple's handset to display information . The iWatch will have a leather strap rather than the 'slap wrap' band recently revealed in a patent application, the magazine reveals . The magazine also believe the watch will look similar to Apple's current iPhone 5 design. 'We based the body of the watch on the iPhone 5, because its jewel-like bevelled finish seemed ideally suited to a device in the form of jewellery,' said Banks. The team believe a first generation iWatch may not include a webcam, and will rely on an iPhone for its data connection. It also believes Apple may come up with a clever solution for conserving battery life. 'Apple would surely find a nice solution: it has numerous patents on motion and position sensors, and could come up with a way of guessing when you're going to look at your watch. 'A simpler solution might be to formalise the wrist-twisting gesture that typically accompanies checking the time.' However, Banks also admits the magazine has no insider knowledge. 'Anyone who tells you they know what Apple is planning doesn’t know Apple’s planning. 'But anyone can guess, and those who know Apple best can guess better.' Figure one of Apple's U.S. Patent Application no. 20130044215: It describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap . Earlier this year it was revealed Apple had patented several technology that could be used in a watch. U.S. patent application no. 20130044215, filed by Apple in August 2011, specifies the technology for . a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'. It . describes: 'A wearable video device ... comprising: a flexible . substrate having a flat state and a curled state [and] a flexible . display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate.' The . wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach . to users' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy. Unexpected: The design, published for the first time today, shows that even without Steve Jobs at the helm, Apple still has the ability to surprise . Popular among youngsters in the late . Eighties and early-Nineties, slap wraps are bracelets consisting of . layered, flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a . fabric or plastic cover. The . bracelet can be straightened out, causing tension within the springy . metal bands, then slapped against a wearer's forearm, causing the bands . to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist. As . expected by many Apple observers, the iWatch-like device described in . the '44215 patent app would be 'configured to display information . wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device', most likely . an iPhone. As well as the . touch-sensitive display, the application says it would include 'a . communication link, allowing two-way communication between the slap . bracelet and the portable electronic device.' 'Information . generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device . display or the flexible display,' the application says. Some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered. 'The . battery can take many forms,' it suggests. 'For example, the battery . can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the . battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory.' It . also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended, . including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory . device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some . wristwatches.' 'An . accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly . benefit from this sort of power generation, and could lengthen the . amount of time between charging,' the application says.

A stream of good news for the economy yesterday gave hope that Britain is finally emerging from the downturn. Figures showing that house prices had risen by almost £10,000 in a year were just one part of a wider economic recovery alongside improved orders for manufacturers and a revival on the high street. It also emerged that new car sales surged by 12.7 per cent in July compared to a year ago, with a total of 162,228 registrations. And the National Institute of Economic and Social Research said the economy grew by 0.7 per cent between May and July as the recovery picked up pace – double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first three months of the year. House prices rising by almost £10,000 in a year were just one part of a wider economic recovery, say experts . The raft of data led to renewed optimism from economic analysts. ‘Wow,’ said Rob Wood, chief economist at investment bank Berenberg. ‘There isn’t really another way of describing the data coming out of the UK at the minute.’ And Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said it was ‘another very good news day for the UK economy’. He added: ‘It is striking that the improved news on the UK economy is coming across a wide range of sectors, which lifts hopes that the recovery is broadening as well as deepening.’ Sales of new cars from Britain’s resurgent motor manufacturers have now risen for 17 months in a row, with Ford’s Fiesta and Focus proving the most popular. And official figures showed total factory output jumped 1.9 per cent in June with all 13 sectors of British manufacturing – including food and drink, computers and aircraft – expanding in a single month for the first time since June 1992. Halifax's house price graph index graph shows . how prices are rising by above four per cent over last summer (Quarterly . annual % change along the top; quarterly year on year price change on . the left) Recent rise: House prices have risen for six months in a row but average house prices to earnings are also on the rise . The latest figures reveal that house prices are 4.6 per cent higher than a year ago – and are rising at their highest rate for three years, according to the Halifax. Months of steady rises mean the national average property price stands at £169,624, which represents a sharp rise on the £160,428 of a year ago. However, the findings confirm recent studies from Nationwide building society and estate agents which suggested that London and the South are driving the market. Workshop: A technician assembles a car on the production line at Nissan's Sunderland plant in Sunderland. British manufacturing rose two per cent . Motoring along: New car sales surged by 12.7 per cent in July compared to a year ago, with a total of 162,228 registrations . Many analysts also fear the increase is not justified in terms of what buyers can afford and the state of household finances. First-time buyers, for example, will need to take on bigger mortgages if they are to get onto the property ladder. House prices now stand at 4.62 times average earnings, which is up from the 4.34 times in 2009 when the market hit a trough following the banking crisis. Industry experts say two Government schemes, Funding for Lending and Help to Buy, which have cut interest rates and allow people to buy with small deposits, are largely responsible for the increases. Martin Ellis, Halifax’s housing economist, said: ‘House prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year, with only modest economic growth and still falling real earnings constraining housing demand and activity.’ Property economist Matthew Pointon, of Capital Economics, argued that house prices are overvalued. ‘Evidence that house prices are in the midst of a steady recovery continues to accumulate, which is bad news for first-time buyers,’ he said. ‘That said, it is unlikely that house prices will continue to show such strong gains. Poor fundamentals will help keep a lid on demand, as will the fact that the market is still overvalued. Wider recovery: Economists said the better than . expected growth in manufacturing and industrial output in June pointed . to a broad based recovery in the economy . ‘There are also some signs that the supply of housing is now picking up, which should take some of the heat out of price gains.’ A report from property website Rightmove earlier this week found that six in ten people who rent their home feel ‘trapped’ because they cannot afford to buy. Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘This will be a long, slow recovery. Much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom.’ Alexander Gosling, director of online estate agent Housesimple.co.uk, said: ‘In many areas, prices are still way off their peak, although London remains the star performer with gravity-defying price rises thanks to the influx of foreign buyers. 'Surprisingly, we are seeing strong activity during the summer, which historically tend to be quieter. This momentum needs to be carried through into September and October if the property market is to continue on the long road to recovery.’","House prices rise sharply to 4.6 per cent higher than a year ago .

The free test version of the update is available to download now and the full version will be released to Windows 8 users later this year.

Microsoft has officially released an update to its latest operating system called Windows 8.1 during a keynote speech at its developers conference in San Francisco. A preview download is available now and the full version will be rolled out to Windows 8 users later this year . The lock screen is being turned into a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that will shows photos stored on the device and in SkyDrive. Windows 8.1 also includes a vastly improved 'search' function, which allows a user to search for documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar. It also allows users to see all their applications immediately in a grid by swiping down or pressing a button on-screen. There are new personalisation options for tiles including colours and fonts. Users can also customize the start screen much more easily; changing sizes of app icons or controlling which apps appear. For the first time, it will be possible to open two windows simultaneously in the new-look interface. Windows 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view. ‘Let’s make it easier to start applications in the way we . are used to,’ said Ballmer, to cheers from the audience. ‘We will bring back the start button, and you can boot . straight to the desktop if you want to.’ ‘We have refined the blend of our desktop experience and . our modern app experience.’ The firm came under fire for its controversial ‘start . screen’ in Windows 8, which gave users a series of tiles instead of a traditional desktop PC . menu with a start button. This left many confused, and caused a slower than . expected uptake of the new software -  which also faced increasing competition . from Apple and the tablet market. However, Ballmer said the firm was not abandoning its . start menu and said it was slowly beginning to attract app developers to . Windows 8. ‘Within this month we’ll pass the 100,000 app mark in the . Windows store,’ said Ballmer. Flipboard, Facebook and the NFL all revealed new apps. The new Windows 8.1 includes a . vastly improved 'search' function, which lets users search for . documents, apps, or items on the Internet from a single search bar. The feature resembles Apple's Spotlight feature. Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, pictured, announced the Windows 8.1 update at the Build developers conference in San Francisco. He also unveiled a new range of Windows Phone handsets and touchscreen Windows 8 laptops and notebooks . Another new feature in Windows 8.1 also allows users to easily see a list of all their apps simply by swiping up on the screen. ‘This update shows how much more responsive our engineering has become,’ said Julie Larson-Green, head of Windows at Microsoft. ‘We’ve had over 800 updates to Windows 8 since we launched it.’ Larson-Green showed off a new Acer 8.1inch tablet running Windows 8.1 - designed to take on the iPad mini. It uses new gestures such as being able to slide along the screen's space bar to select menu items. Larson-Green also showed off a range of touchscreen PCs running Windows 8.1. ‘Pretty much every screen you own is going to be touch,’ she said. She demonstrated a convertible Windows 8 laptop that also works as . tablet, and large touchscreen machines. There were also laptops with touchscreens plus an 18inch tablet from Dell that doubles as a desktop computer when docked. Speaking at the developer conference, Microsoft's head of Windows, Julie Larson-Green, pictured, announced that the Xbox Music app has been redesigned. The music-streaming service is now available for all versions of Windows 8 . A screenshot of the new Xbox Music app. The app lets owners stream and buy music from anywhere in Windows.

A preview video earlier this month suggested that the update would reinstate the Start button, pictured. The button was removed from Windows 8 . ‘Rapid release is the new norm for everything we do, from Windows to hardware,’ he said. Windows . 8.1 includes Microsoft's latest browser, Internet Explorer 11, and lets . the user restore the address bar and tabs to the screen view. Earlier this month Microsoft released a preview video showcasing all these new features. Microsoft . removed the button from the Windows 8 operating system when it was . released last year but many customers complained and demanded it was put . back. Screenshots leaked in May suggested that Microsoft would be reinstating the button and an official preview video at the start of June confirmed it - albeit not directly.

That . feature was missing in the initial version of Windows 8, which was . designed to make the most of limited screen space on a tablet but tended . to disorient traditional mouse and keyboard users. Executives say the plan is now to update Windows periodically, rather than waiting three years or so between big releases. The world's largest software company is . hoping to kickstart sales of its latest Windows version, which has not . made the splash with computer users it was hoping for. The lock screen on Windows 8.1 is being replaced by a 'cloud-powered photo frame' that automatically pulls in images from SkyDrive accounts . Although . Microsoft has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses since . October, broadly in line with Windows 7 three years ago, the company . must tackle a dwindling PC user base and its inability to make a mark in . the exploding tablet market. Shipments . of traditional PCs - the most reliable gauge of Windows' popularity - . are expected to fall almost 8 percent this year, while Microsoft's . Surface has taken less than 2 percent of the tablet market. Windows 8 was designed to be used both on touch-screen tablets and traditional PCs. But while touch-screen users tend to . like the new 'tile'-based interface, many mouse and keyboard users . complained that the new design was confusing. Windows 8 was launched in October last year. Microsoft chose to remove the start button as part of the interface overhaul. This angered many users who said the new software was too complicated to use.

Sent home: Mildred Stokes, 79, broke her shin in a fall but medics failed to diagnose it because they x-rayed the wrong one before she died . A pensioners admitted to hospital with a broken leg died after hospital staff X-rayed the wrong limb and sent her home. Mildred Stokes, 79, was seen by four different doctors, but all failed to notice that her healthy left leg had been X-rayed, when in fact she had broken her right leg in two places. The dementia sufferer died of a severe infection similar to blood poisoning caused by the break eight days later. Her sister, Irene Martin, 75, criticised Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester yesterday after a coroner was told it was ‘possible’ that Miss Stokes would have lived had it not been for a ‘series of mishaps and errors’ in her care. ‘I’m still very angry,’ said Mrs Martin. ‘It’s not rocket science to X-ray the correct leg. Her right leg and foot were swollen and inflamed. Yet no one thought to X-ray it for days. ‘If they had treated her properly from the start she would not have died.’ An inquest was told that Miss Stokes was admitted to hospital on November 30 last year after falling at Allingham Care Home in Timperley, Cheshire, where she was a resident, and injuring her right leg. But there was confusion over the X-ray at Wythenshawe Hospital because a doctor hit ‘left’ instead of ‘right’ when inputting instructions to the radiology department on a computer. Despite the right leg being red and swollen, radiologists went ahead with X-raying the incorrect limb. When no break was found, Miss Stokes was discharged. However, the pensioner was re-admitted . the next day in severe pain. She was seen by four medics, who each . failed to notice that the X-ray was of the wrong leg. Even . when they realised the mistake a series of errors and poor . communication between staff meant it was a further four days before Miss . Stokes’ right limb was X-rayed. It revealed she had fractured her shin and calf bone but by then she was already suffering an infection as a consequence. Disappointing: Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester said their care 'fell below the standards we would expect' after the inquest into Ms Stokes' death . A . further delay meant she was not put on a drip to treat the problem for . 24 hours. Surgeons realised Miss Stokes needed surgery but by then she . was too ill to undergo an operation. She died on December 8. Dr . John Crampton, a consultant at Wythenshawe Hospital, started an . internal review after being left ‘incredulous’ at some of the errors in . the treatment. He told the . hearing at Manchester coroners’ court: ‘It was entirely clear that there . had been a series of mishaps and errors in her care.’ He said it was ‘possible’ that Miss Stokes would have lived had the fractures been identified sooner.Recording . a narrative verdict, coroner Sara Lewis said Miss Stokes died of . sepsis, a severe reaction to infection, brought on by the fractures. She said it was not possible to say whether Miss Stokes would have lived had the ‘systemic’ errors not been made. The . Daily Mail reported yesterday that almost 13,000 patients die . needlessly of sepsis each year because of delays in diagnosis or . treatment, according to the Health Service Ombudsmen.

These are the incredible scenes faced by the nation's 4,600 fearless water rescue volunteers every day. In a collection of more than 400 photos offering a rare glimpse behind the scenes of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, men and women dart, dive and crash through the British seas. The remarkable pictures follow the volunteers around the clock - from storm-ridden night rescues to their mid-morning cup of tea. Accompanied by a foreward from Prince William, the images, captured by crew member and professional photographer Nigel Millard, have been hailed as a unique snapshot of a long-standing institution. Powerful: Ireland's first Tamar class lifeboat, the Kilmore Quay Killarney has been braving the waters off the south-east coast of Ireland since 2010 . Battling the British seas: Volunteers for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) have been captured working around the clock in harsh conditions for a new book . Veteran: Ned Dillon is the Coxswain at Arklow, the oldest RNLI station in Ireland. Nigel Millard spent two years charting the work of some of the longest-serving volunteers . Makeover: Porthdinllaen's new all-weather 'Tamar class' lifeboat, John D Spicer, gets its first coat of paint in RNLI colours. In the early years of the RNLI lifeboat hulls were painted in pale blue, later changed to the dark Royal Blue seen on today's lifeboats. They are a far cry from oar boats used before the 1890 steam ship came in . Calm: Alderney Trent lifeboat Roy Barker motors off in unusually kind conditions. The waters here are known to be difficult, with severe winters and fierce running tides .

Penlee's Severn class lifeboat Ivan Ellen. The £1.8m boat was a gift to the RNLI in 2003 from Harold Ivan Ellen, the father of a former worker . Ready for next time: The Achill Island lifeboat is called to sea, the crew's all-weather gear is stowed in the boathouse. They are nothing like the 19th century cork jackets . Tough: The lifeguards face conditions of all kinds. These workers are up early for a morning's training session on Perranporth beach before going on duty for the day . Putting training into action: Hours later, at Tenby in South Wales, the lifeboat and lifeguards from across the region come together to provide safety cover for the annual Ironman triathlon event. Under their watchful eyes, more than 1,300 athletes undertook a 2.4 mile swim, before setting of on a 112-mile cycle and a full marathon . The view from the wheelhouse of the Hoylake lifeboat, Lady of Hilbre, as the crew search for a casualty in the water near the North Hoyle wind farm . The . RNLI, a charity that saves lives at sea, was set up in 1824 as the . National Institution for the Preservation of Life at Shipwreck. In . 1838, Grace Darling, 22, became a celebrity of the day by rowing one of . the organisation's boats out to sea single-handedly to save a crew . wrecked on the Farne Islands. In 1854 the name was changed and volunteers were given lifejackets made of cork. During the Second World War, they moved from sail and oar power to petrol-run boats. The change coincided with women joining the force. Mr Millard, who has worked for the . RNLI for seven years, said he hopes the images will give people a better . understanding of their work. For him and his 4,600 colleagues, who man 235 lifeboat stations across Britain, sailing stormy seas is all in a day’s work. Mr Millard, who lives in Brixham, Devon, with wife Caroline, said: ‘I was taking pictures of the RNLI crew in 2005, and ended up volunteering myself. I’m on call 24 hours a day. I see people in the very worst situations, and I also see the best in people. 'When a yacht capsized and 21 crew had to be rescued from the sea off the coast of Baltimore in Ireland, we battled for hours to get everyone safely on the lifeboat. As we sailed back, there was a huge crowd waiting. 'The villagers had bought dry clothes and found houses at a holiday park for the survivors to stay in. It was wonderful to see.’ Mr Millard added: 'My favourite photo is a casualty's eye view. I've been a man overboard on exercises - once in the water, you see nothing, then just a tiny bit of orange, and it's not the sun, it's a lifeboat. It epitomises the work I do and the work of the RNLI. 'I hope the exhibition will raise awareness of the charity. People who don't know anything about rescue at sea will get to hear about it, they will know we're here to help. 'Someone might be inspired to volunteer - not necessarily on the crew, but maybe as fundraiser. Or some might wish to donate.' The Lizard's all-weather 'Tamar class' lifeboat, Rose, launches off the slipway. Slipway launching looks spectacular but is an incredibly precise and controlled process . The images will appear in a book published by Conway on 30 September and a touring exhibition, set to hit London, Southampton, Manchester and Edinburgh. Dr Huw Lewis-Jones, historian and author of the book, The Lifeboat: Courage on our Coasts, said: 'It's a show of great photos that represent the best of the RNLI. It's a way of reminding people they are only ever 70 miles from the sea - we may all need the RNLI's help. 'We've joined crews all around the country on shouts, but also for a cup of tea. The photos are a collection of what the RNLI family means, the true spirit of the RNLI - ordinary people doing extraordinary things.' The RNLI operates 237 lifeboat stations in the UK and Ireland and has 200 lifeguard units on beaches around the UK. On the Isle of Man, Rebecca Kilip supports the lifeboat in her own way, by knitting cuddly lifeboatman mascots. They are a regular feature on lifeboats across the country .

King was sentenced to a community order for one year and told to complete 40 hours of unpaid work. He will also pay costs of £1,240 and a £60 victim surcharge. A third assault charge against the hotelier was dismissed. His attack is similar to the fits of anger fictional hotel owner Basil Fawlty would fly into with his waiter Manuel. Fawlty, famously played by Monty Python John Cleese, also lost his temper with his temperamental car - giving it 'a damn good seeing to' with a tree.","Stuart King, 47, attacked two workers after they made mess in new spa .

The highest EU court has overturned a decision by member states to scrap pay rises for union officials because of the absence of 'exceptional economic circumstances'. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) said in a non-binding legal opinion that it will increase EU workers' wages by 1.7 per cent, despite the ongoing financial crisis. The document, which was published yesterday, suggests that the ECJ has sided with the European Commission in its decision to annul the Council of Ministers' rejection of the pay hike. Opinions from the court's advocate general aren't binding for its judges - however, they often give an indication of the court's final decision. The European Court of Justice has sided with the European Commission in Brussels (pictured) in its decision to increase union officials' wages by 1.7 per cent, despite the ongoing financial crisis . The member states rejected a pay rise for EU officials in December 2011 based on a formula that uses the average of civil servants' purchasing power in a group of reference member states and an indexation for the cost of living in Brussels. They declared that 'exceptional economic . circumstances' justified changing the formula previously agreed with . staff unions for calculating the workers' annual pay rises. However, the opinion has agreed with the Commission that, although the EU's rules do allow for the suspension of the pay formula, such economic circumstances have not been met, according to EuropeanVoice.com. An EU employee (pictured) holds a flag during a wage-related protest outside the European Commission in November 2012 . Therefore, the Council is legally obliged to stick to the original formula and propose a pay rise. Yves Bot, an advocate general of the court in Luxembourg, said the judges of the ECJ are expected to annul the Council of Ministers' decision. His prediction is based on three cases that have been brought before the court concerning the formula for pay increase - however, the opinion is not binding on the judges.","The European Court of Justice has published a non-binding legal opinion .

Controversial Tory MP Nadine Dorries has landed signed a ‘six-figure’ book deal to write three novels. The outspoken backbencher who stunned Westminster with an appearance on I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! hopes to build on her profile by becoming an author. She told the Mail her book would be offer ‘shock’ value but would not be ‘chick-lit’. Author: Tory MP Nadine Dorries, a former nurse-turned politician, is adding another skill to her CV . Known for her ability to craft sharp . political soundbites and putdowns – notably ridiculing David Cameron and . George Osborne as ‘posh boys’ – her publisher hailed her for a . ‘heart-stopping way with words’. The Tory MP for Mid Bedfordshire, who appeared on last year's I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here!, is expected publish the first part of the trilogy next year. Mrs Dorries told the Mail: ‘I was blown away by the response. It is just something I did in my downtime. It may surprise people to know that I am not an MP 24/7. I wrote the first book in recess last year and am half-way through the second. I have had time to do it since my daughters have flown the nest, nobody is dependent on me.’ She dismissed critics who queried how she had the time to pen novels between her parliamentary and constituency duties. ‘Lots of male MPs have written books, including William Hague. Nick Boles has written two. Why does no one ever ask how they manage it?’ High profile: Miss Dorries became one of the best known politicians in the country after taking part in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here . Born in in 1957, one of three daughters, Nadine Dorries grew up in Liverpool, attending  Halewood Grange Comprehensive before training as a nurse. Writing for the Mail on Sunday in 2010, she revealed her childhood memories which will form the basis of her novels: . 'I spent 25 years in a council house, and whenever I think of my childhood in Liverpool the memories are set in relief against the backdrop of my family home. I think of Thursday nights, when the week’s pay had run out and how the mothers in my street used to group together and cook a pan of scouse and feed the streets kids, in one kitchen. The pan was big, having at some time, I am sure, fallen off the back of a ship moored in Liverpool docks. We were the originators of the Big Society. We lived and breathed it. I may have lived on a council estate but I also lived in a neighbourly community. It came as a shock, when I reached my teens, to discover that all the neighbours I had referred to as auntie and uncle were not in fact related to me. Our council house was our home and it meant as much to us as Blenheim does to the Duke of Marlborough. An Englishman’s home is his castle but castles come in all shapes and sizes. Publishers Head of Zeus said the . novel, called The Four Streets, is one of three ‘set in 1950s Liverpool . about Irish Catholic families struggling against poverty, hardship and . abuse’, and will be published in April. Editor . Rosie de Courcy said she 'had to have' the book on her list of new . releases: ‘I absolutely adored this novel from first word to last. Nadine is one of the most naturally gifted storytellers I have ever come . across, with a magical ability to create characters you believe in and a . heart-stopping way with words. Mrs . Dorries has often spoken of her life growing up in Liverpool in the . 1950s and 1960s, living in a council house which formed the backdrop of . her childhood memories. She was suspended from the Tory . party in November last year after jetting off to take part in I’m A . Celebrity without permission. Defending her decision to take part in the show she claimed she would be able to reach an audience of millions, discussing important policy issues like lowering the abortion limit. She said at the time: 'If that is where sixteen million people are, it's where politicians need to be too.' Instead she was pictured performing jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather and eating camel toe and ostrich anus in a challenge against ex-Coronation Street star Helen Flanagan. It took until May until Tory bosses were satisfied that she would fall into line, and she had the whip restored in time for the Queen’s Speech. A former nurse, she worked in business and as an adviser to Conservative MP Oliver Letwin before being elected to Mid Bedfordshire in 2005. In recent years she has been a constant critic of the Prime Minister and Chancellor. Last year she declared: 'The problem is that policy is being run by two public schoolboys who don't know what it's like to go to the supermarket and have to put things back on the shelves because they can't afford it for their children's lunchboxes. 'What's worse, they don't care, either' A month later she stepped up the attack, claiming: ‘Not only are Cameron and Osborne two posh boys who don't know the price of milk, but they are two arrogant posh boys who show no remorse, no contrition, and no passion to want to understand the lives of others - and that is their real crime.' However, amid claims she could defect to the UK Independence Party,  the Tory leadership agreed to let her return to fold as long as she agreed to toe the line. In June she announced she would stop claiming parliamentary expenses and insisted all MPs should be paid one flat-rate fee. In a posting on her website, she said her decision would mean she would effectively be working for her constituents for free. 'I have long said that under the present system, before long, Parliament will be a place of millionaires or paupers. I loathe the expenses system and believe it should be scrapped and MPs paid one flat-rate fee,' she said. 'Whilst I draw personal expenses, I cannot argue for reform of the system or put forward the case to scrap expenses. Not drawing expenses puts me in a stronger position to be able to do this.'","Mid Bedfordshire MP lands deal to write trilogy on 1950s poverty .

A jealous ex who cut off his former girlfriend’s hair and then stripped her naked in the kitchen after she returned late from a night out has been jailed. Jay Peeks, 27, waited at his former partner’s flat and then launched the savage attack when she arrived at 4am on May 6. Manchester Crown Court was told that Peeks, who did not live with his victim but had a key to her flat, had shouted: ‘Where have you been, you slag?’ Manchester Crown Court heard that Peeks launched the attack when his former girlfriend returned from a night out . He then grabbed scissors from a kitchen draw and cut off a big clump of her hair. Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, said: ‘She was crying hysterically. She tried to get away from him, but he grabbed hold of her and started to tear off her clothes. She pleaded with him to stop. ‘She was naked at that point and sat in a corner crying. She describes herself as being petrified.’ The court heard that Peeks went out of the room and returned with a pair of hair clippers and shaved off part of her eyebrow. He then took photographs of her before she managed to find some other clothes and escape into the street, where she flagged down a taxi. The next day Peeks sent her the photographs in a series of abusive text messages. Peeks admitted admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage . When she finally returned home, she found that Peeks had cut up her £1,000 handbag, had destroyed a pair of shoes and had left her torn up clothes on the kitchen floor. The victim said in a statement read out in court that the incident had been terrifying and humiliating and the relationship with Peeks was now over. She said he had never previously been violent towards her and the incident had shaken her confidence. Peeks, of Mallow Street, Hulme, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage when he appeared at Manchester Crown Court. The court heard he had previous convictions, but none of them were for violence against his partner. The couple had been together for seven years and had a five year old son, but had split up before the attack. They had agreed to meet at her flat on the night of the attack. Ms Thomas said the victim believed Peeks had now ‘learned his lesson’ and she did not want a restraining order to be placed upon him as she still wanted him to have access to his son. Robert Lancaster, defending, said: ‘What Mr Peeks did that night was appalling. His behaviour was about exerting power and humiliation. It must have been an entirely frightening and demeaning incident and there is nothing I can say on his behalf that can justify that type of behaviour.’ He said it would be better for Peeks’ issues of paranoia and jealousy to be dealt with by probation service, rather than for him to be sent to prison. Miss Recorder Barrie, sentencing, jailed Peeks for 14 months for the assault. She jailed him for two months concurrently for the damage he caused and he was ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge. She told Peeks: ‘The facts of this case are disturbing. You proceeded to humiliate and terrorise her and you cut off her hair. ‘There were a number of aggravating factors. She was particularly vulnerable having been stripped naked. This was gratuitous degradation.’","The victim was stripped naked during the attack by ex Jay Peeks, 27 .

Neighbours hoped a court order to keep Mrs Griffiths quiet would work, but they have been forced to complain again. She was hauled before the courts yesterday because she was still going berserk at her husband and she claimed she didn't realise the ASBO meant she had to calm down. Griffiths said she had not understood the conditions of the . ASBO and pleaded guilty at North Staffordshire Justice Centre to breaching the order between April 18 and August . 27 this year.

'They are in the main during the day, with just one incident in the early evening. 'This is not related to drink, she works long shifts. She argues with her husband. 'I don't think there is any intent to cause problems to neighbours.' Speaking after the hearing, councillors from Newcastle-under-Lyme Borough Council branded Griffiths' behaviour as 'dreadful'.

A middle-aged couple have been jailed for conning car buyers out of £120,000 with a string of fake websites. Paul Humphries, 51, and Linda Holden, 55, advertised fake cars on websites including Auto Trader and made potential buyers pay upfront for cars which never arrived. They were jailed this week at Worcester Crown Court for the fraud, which they used to fund their life of luxury. Paul Humphries (left) pleaded guilty to fraud and Linda Holden (right) to money laundering . Humphries pleaded guilty to fraud, and was jailed for four years, while Holden pleaded guilty to money laundering and received a sentence of eight months. The couple, from Lytham St Annes, . Lancashire, using a string of false names, and would agree prices with buyers over the internet. They even arranged deliveries of the cars - which would never arrive. Holden would then make excuses to their angry victims, before eventually ending contact altogether. The money from the fake cars funded them ‘living the high life’ in luxury rented homes and hotels. They spent months on the run, leaving a trail of unpaid bills and furious customers. The coucple used the website for Castle TT Ltd to con used car buyers . The fraud began with a company the pair founded called Castle Prestige Ltd, which offered vehicles in the Worcester area and made them £46,891. They listed their non-existent cars . in the specialist section of the Auto Trader website, where it is common . practice for buyers to pay up front for cars. Even . after police arrested the couple in July last year, they brazenly set . up another fraudulent website, Castle TT, while on bail, claiming they . ’will not be beaten on price, quality and service’. The site said: 'For fantastic offers and great choice Castle TT is your number one secondhand car dealer. 'Here at Castle TT we pride ourselves on sourcing and offering a fantastic range of cars to suit every need and pocket.' Then . in October and November of last year they returned to Auto Trader, and . pulled off six more bogus sales for between £4,500 and £10,500. They . went on the run before being arrested again in Manchester this May. They claimed to be legitimate traders with years of experience . After the sentencing, Detective . Constable Gary Scales of Lancashire Constabulary said: ‘Victims of this . crime lived all over the UK and have been left out of pocket by these . people. ‘This couple took . advantage of the trust that most motor dealers place on each other and . have left many feeling like they committed a schoolboy error. ‘They were living the high life staying in luxury houses and hotels all paid for by the money they stole.’ Humphries and Holden agreed price online and arranged deliveries, but the cars did not exist . But police believe the fraud could have been even larger than expected, as many victims may not yet have come forward. In . an appeal released while the pair were on the run, a spokesman said: . ‘The fraud has been carried out systematically and there are probably . victims out there that we are not aware of. It is a large amount of . money and that’s just what we know about. This might be the tip of the . iceberg. ‘Cars . were advertised via the trader’s section of Auto Trader, and apparently . it is quite common for traders to ask for payment up front. Because it . is through the traders’ section there is a degree of trust. ‘It . could be that there are more victims and people might not have come . forward through embarrassment, because there’s some degree of error on . the victim’s part for paying up front for goods they have not received.’ Auto Trader said it advises all customers not to part with cash until they have seen the vehicle, and to carry out thorough checks on the vehicle before agreeing to a deal.","Paul Humphries, 51, and Linda Holden, 55, posed online as car traders .

Suspicisons were first raised when irregular activities were reported in her deceased parents’ bank account in 2009. But since then extensive inquiries around the world, including in Thailand, have drawn a blank. Ms Brown, who worked on the ITV show Distant Shores, never made a claim for her parents’ inheritance after they died.

Guilty: Donald Fortin was convicted of engaging Zumba prostitute Alexis Wright in Kennebunk, Maine . Of the 68 men charged with having sex with a Maine Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute, the first john was found guilty on Thursday. Donald Fortin, 59, of Turner, was convicted of engaging prostitute Alexis Wright, 30, after a two-day trial. The married man was fined $610, less than the maximum $1,000. Fortin will not face jail. He claimed that he paid Wright for a massage and nothing else but the jury in York County Superior Court found him guilty after an hour of deliberation. Wright is currently serving a ten-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to 14 prostitution charges and six other misdemeanors in March. Her scandalous case received international attention after she was charged with running a prostitution business out of a Zumba studio in the sleepy community of Kennebunk, Maine. Fortin is owner and founder of Fortin Construction Inc, a company that boasts of being 'Number one Maine Home Builder for over 20 years,' and advertises itself online as 'A Christian Family Owned Company.' As previously reported, Fortin is a staunch advocate of conservative family values. According to state records, he donated $1,000 to Protect Maine Marriage and organization set up to 'defend' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from 'gay rights activists' and 'radical judges' seeking to 'redefine marriage.' Behind bars: Wright is currently serving a ten-month jail sentence after pleading guilty to 14 prostitution charges and six other misdemeanors in March . He also made a donation of $350 to Senator Garrett Mason, a conservative opponent of the state's same-sex marriage ballot. During his trial, prosecutors showed Skype screenshot images from October 24, 2011, of him engaging in sexual contact with Wright. Deputy District Attorney Justina McGettigan said Kennebunk Police Officer Audra Presby testified that Fortin called her in October of 2012 asking if he was on Wright’s client list. Fortin reportedly told Presby that he had visited Wright and only paid for a massage. He also said that Wright appeared aroused during his visit and came onto him. Wright didn't testify during Fortin's court appearance. Fortin is second of Wright's alleged clients to be taken to trial. Former Kennebunk High School hockey coach Don Hill was acquitted due to a lack of evidence. Justice Roland Cole ended Hill's trial in August after barring prosecutors from entering Wright's business ledger into evidence. Acquitted: Donald Hill, the former Kennebunk High School hockey coach was acquitted of paying for sex with the Zumba instructor-turned-prostitute . Mr Hill, who has been divorced for years, was one of 68 people charged with paying for sex with Wright. At least 58 have pleaded guilty or no contest. Wright pleaded guilty, but that didn't stop her from giving her husband an entirely different story. She told him that she had sex with more than 100 men for money because she believed she was working as an undercover agent for the State of Maine investigating 'sexual deviancy' in the postcard town of Kennebunk. Wright gave her married name in court . in August, Alexis Sandra Trowbridge. It appears her husband, Jason . Trowbridge, believes her story and is taking her back. Wright now maintains she was a . pawn all along. It has emerged that Wright claims that Mark Strong, her . business partner who was found guilty of promoting prostitution, told . her that he was on special assignment for the state of Maine and that he . had hired her as his undercover agent. Different defense: Hill (left) said that he had a relationship with Wright (right) and that he did not pay for sex, though her ledger was not allowed to be submitted as part of the evidence against him . Wright . claimed that Strong, a licensed private investigator, told her that the . brothel she operated out of her Zumba studio was really an elaborate . sting operation backed by the state of Maine.

A woman serving a 22-year sentence for her role in a deadly attack on an elderly man when she was just 14 years old has had her sentence reduced. Washington state's clemency board recommended on Friday that Marriam Oliver should be released in three years. Oliver, who is now 26, has already served 12 years for her part in a group attack on a 64-year-old man who was beaten and stabbed to death in his Everett home in 2001. Rellief: An attorney hugs Marriam Oliver's sister as a prison board recommends reducing her sentence . After a two-hour hearing that was packed with family members and supporters of Oliver, the state's Clemency and Pardon's Board unanimously voted that Oliver should be released in three years, as long as she doesn't have any infractions on her prison record during that time. The recommendation will be sent to Governor Jay Inslee, who will have the final say but it is not known when he will make that decision. Oliver was one of five teenagers and an adult, Barbara Marie Opel, who pleaded guilty or were convicted in the trial for the fatal attack on Jerry Heimann in his home. Although she was 14 at the time of the . attack, Oliver was tried as an adult and received the lower end of the . sentencing range for first-degree murder. She was found guilty of taking part in the attack, helping her friend and Opel's daughter Heather, stab Mr Heimann, who had cancer. As the teenagers stabbed and beat their victim, Opel was said by prosecutors to have waited in the basement with her two youngest children, shouting encouragement, according to Komo News. Joy: Friends and family celebrate on learning Oliver could be released in three years . Support: Bracelets are worn by those backing Oliver, who was 14 when she took part in a deadly attack . At the trial of Opel in 2003, prosecutors said the 38-year-old had promised the teenagers, including her own daughter, money and gifts if they attacked her landlord, so she could steal $40,000 he had made from the sale of a house. Opel's daughter Heather was to be given a dirt bike and her friend, Oliver, skate money, according to Seattle Weekly.

Missing documents: Shadow Attorney General, Emily Thornberry, said she was shocked to hear the lost documents had been found in the same place as a cannabis farm . Thousands of confidential documents lost by the Serious Fraud Office have turned up at a cannabis farm, it emerged last night. The fraud squad last month admitted it had lost 32,000 documents, 81 audio tapes and other electronic media from 59 sources after accidentally putting them in the post. The data included the identity of a major prosecution witness in a £43billion fraud case against defence giant BAE Systems. But now it has emerged the files were put in a self-storage warehouse in London’s Docklands, which was also used to house stolen goods and grow cannabis. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said she was ‘profoundly shocked’ after being told about the epic blunder. It is the latest in a long list of episodes that have called into question the competence of the fraud office, which receives £31million of taxpayers’ money annually. Mrs Thornberry, the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, said: ‘They sent it to the wrong person, who put it into storage. 'I understand there was stolen property in the warehouse, and there was also a cannabis factory. You couldn’t make it up.’ In a written parliamentary answer to Mrs Thornberry, solicitor general Oliver Heald revealed the SFO had spent more than £10,000 finding the files. It claims it has recovered 98 per cent of them. Officials are now contacting all of the individuals affected by the loss and have ensured the same mistake will not happen again. Last month, the SFO said 98 per cent of the material had been found and were quick to emphasise . that none of the data which had been lost between May and October 2012 . related to national security. Ms Thornberry said the SFO had been . riddled with problems for a number of years, as she blamed the . Government for cutting the SFO’s budget by 27 per cent. Arms : The mislaid material formed part of an investigation looking into alleged international dealing by the defence giants . Warehouse: The documents were found in a facility which was also being used as a cannabis farm . She added: 'I want the SFO to succeed and this is another dreadful mistake. Scandal: David Green, the director of the SFO, asked for urgent review of the incident after the files were lost last year . 'I understand that they are doing their utmost to make sure something like this never happens again. 'I’m really shocked, I’m profoundly shocked by this, and I am quite sure that members of the public who were giving assistance to the authorities, they certainly never expected their identities to be abused in this way. 'If (the identities are) found in this paperwork and it ends up in a storage facility which is being used for crime I think it just makes it so much worse. I am almost lost for words.' 'The fact of the matter is we get one huge mistake after another. I don’t think it makes life any easier for them also to be subjected to 27 per cent cuts - I point the finger of blame at the Government. 'They are the ones that have made the decision. I don’t think that makes their functioning any easier. I don’t think it makes the new person in charge’s job any easier at all. 'Clearly that doesn’t help them.' The SFO’s investigation into BAE began in 2004, prompted by allegations concerning the company’s dealings with Saudi Arabia. Eventually it was looking into contracts between BAE and a number of other countries including the Czech Republic, Romania and South Africa. The Saudi Arabia investigation was discontinued in December 2006 in the interest of national security. Business: The files were from an investigation into international dealing between the defence giants and Saudi Arabia. One of the deals involved a £1.6billion contract to supply Hawk jets (pictured) BAE was also under investigation in the US in 2010, but reached a settlement with the American Department of Justice, paying £255.7 million and pleading guilty to one charge of conspiring to make false statements to the US government. The FTSE 100 giant was also fined £500,000 at Southwark Crown Court in December 2010 after admitting it had failed to keep adequate accounting records in relation to the defence contract for the supply of an air traffic control system to the government of Tanzania. An SFO spokesman said: 'The SFO has been taking this matter very seriously since identifying the loss and is in the process of contacting all the affected parties. 'We have ensured no further material can be wrongly returned to a source in an investigation and are implementing the recommendations from an independent review.'","32,000 documents were found in London facility next to a cannabis farm .

Thug: Mark Phythian, 42, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who punched his girlfriend's face so hard that her eye 'exploded' A violent boyfriend who punched his girlfriend’s face so hard that her eye 'exploded' has been put behind bars for four years. Sandra Banks said she heard a 'massive pop' before blood started pouring down her face after the blow by 'evil' Mark Phythian during a row at his home on her birthday. Miss Banks told Newcastle Crown Court she has lost total vision in her right eye, which is now 'dead' and she may lose it completely. Phythian, of Washington, Tyne and Wear who has convictions for attacks on Miss Banks in the past, denied causing grievous bodily harm, assault and acting in breach of a restraining order but was found guilty by a jury of all charges after a trial last month. Judge Paul Sloan QC said the 42-year-old, who screamed foul language and said ‘you might as well hang me, just execute me’ as he was sentenced, posed a danger to women and extended his licence period by 12 months. The judge told Phythian the attack on Miss Banks was a 'gross breach of trust and power'. Judge Sloan added: 'As she described, her eye exploded and then poured blood. She experienced excruciating pain. 'As a result of the blow you struck she sustained a penetrating injury to her right eye and she has lost sight in her right eye. 'There is no chance of her regaining sight in that eye ever again. 'I am satisfied there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by you of further specified offences. 'There is clearly a significant risk, to Miss Banks in particular, but also to future partners in general.' Miss . Banks told jurors during the trial Phythian had ordered her to get back . with him when he was released from prison for a previous attack on her, . despite a restraining order being in place to keep him away. Phythian was found guilty and sentenced to four years at Newcastle Crown Court . She said the first six weeks were 'alright', but he soon started acting violently again. Miss Banks said on February 22, which was her birthday, a row at his home quickly escalated into violence. Miss Banks said the initial assault on her happened in the bathroom where she was punched and hit with a towel rail before he followed her out of the room. She said: 'He just looked at me, really evil, and just punched me in the face, really hard. 'My eye exploded, I just heard a massive pop and my eye started pouring with blood, I was screaming. 'I started screaming, crying, I had never felt pain like it in all my life. 'My eye was pouring with blood.' Miss Banks told jurors Phythian had locked her in the house after the attack. She said: 'I was screaming, crying, I was scared out of my wits, I wanted to die.' Miss Banks was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for surgery. She told the court: 'That eye, they told me it’s dead. 'There is no chance I will regain my sight ever again.' Phythian told jurors it was Miss Banks who attacked him that night and he had lashed out to get her off him. He denied forcing her to go back with him after his release from prison and said: 'I told her I was in love with her. She came with me.' Phythian said he had bought Miss Banks a card and flowers for her birthday and had fallen asleep on the sofa while she was out. He told jurors Miss Banks was crouched down in front of him when he woke. Phythian said: 'I woke up, I was half asleep, I said ""hi precious, happy birthday darling, I’ve got you some flowers"". 'I put my hand on her cheek and went to give her a kiss. 'She spun around and latched onto my little finger, practically biting my little finger off. 'I didn’t have a choice, I hit her with my left hand, it was self defence, otherwise she would have bit my finger off. 'I didn’t have a choice.' Phythian said there was a struggle in the bathroom afterwards when he feared she was going to harm herself with a razor.

Former Lord Mayor of Liverpool Eddie Clein said some poor families find the money for gadgets but not food . People who use food banks would rather spend their money on iPhones than feeding their families, a former city Lord Mayor has claimed. Lib Dem Eddie Clein accused people in Liverpool of always having money for the ‘non-necessities of life’ but then struggled to put meals on the table. The comments sparked a fresh row about why poor families turn to food banks, after Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested they have only their own bad financial ‘decisions’. More than half a million people across Britain have turned to food banks to stave off hunger, according to charities. Mr Clein, a former councillor for four decades and ex-Lord Mayor of Liverpool, said that those struggling financial still found the money for expensive gadgets. The pharmacist told BBC Radio Merseyside: ‘I go to some of these homes, I do prescriptions for them ... and what makes me feel uncomfortable is they’re all standing their with their iPhones. ‘This is what Michael Gove was talking about. They don’t seem to have a shortage of money for the non-necessities of life, but when it comes to choosing whether to put food on the table or buy some stuff to make some meals ... I don’t know.’ He later added: ‘What I can’t come to terms with is that I see so many people who are claiming poverty, and may well be using food banks, who are standing their using an iPhone, even when you are talking to them.’ But the remarks were condemned by Labour MPs in the city. Luciana Berger said: ‘Eddie Clein’s comments are an absolute disgrace. ‘I have visited several food banks in Liverpool and across the country and had many conversations with people who’ve been forced to turn to them. ‘I vehemently disagree with Eddie Clein that food bank users are making a lifestyle choice. No-one goes into a food bank with their head held high.’ Demand: Charities say there has been a sharp increase in people turning to food banks, including this one in Southwark run by Felicia Boshorin . Row: Labour MP Luciana Berger has challenged criticism of people who use food banks, including Education Secretary Michael Gove who blamed bad financial 'decisions' Walton MP Steve Rotheram added: ‘How does he know people haven’t been given these iPhones as Christmas or birthday presents. He’s incredible.’ A furious political row erupted this week after Tory Education Secretary Mr Gove argued that people who find themselves unable to buy essentials, including food and school uniforms have themselves to blame for being unable ‘to manage their finances’. Speaking in the Commons he said: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband condemned the minister as an ‘absolute disgrace’.","Eddie Clein accuses people in Liverpool of buying 'non-necessities'

European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told MEPs that Euroscepticism could lead to the same divisions that sparked the Great War . The president of the European Commission made an astonishing attack on the Tories last night, warning that those who want to ‘roll back Europe’ risked returning it to the time of ‘war and trenches’. Criticising David Cameron’s promise to claw back powers from Brussels, Jose Manuel Barroso suggested that his tough line on Europe was an insincere attempt to counter the rise of the UK Independence Party. Despite being a supposedly neutral public servant, Mr Barroso – a former prime minister of Portugal – suggested Ukip would beat the Conservatives in next year’s European Parliament elections because ‘when it comes to being against Europe, people prefer the original to the copy’. But a source close to Mr Cameron said Mr Barroso should ‘respect the views of the governing party elected by Britain’. He suggested it might be ‘more convenient’ for Mr Barroso if Ukip did well, because he could ignore them, adding: ‘The Prime Minister will continue to stand up for the British people, fighting to ensure they get the best deal in Europe and have a say on it in a referendum by 2017.’ Mr Barroso’s comments came in his annual address to the European Parliament. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Cameron, he insisted Europe needed ‘more integration’, not less. He said: ‘Let me say this to all those who rejoice in Europe’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation – the pre-integrated Europe of the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire and deserve. Speaking in possibly his last state of the union address to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Mr Barroso said the pre-integrated Europe of 'the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire or deserve' UKIP leader Nigel Farage criticised the comments and national democracy will not lead to 'the Western Front or 1914' ‘The European continent has never in its . history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the . European Community. It is our duty to preserve it and deepen it.’ In exchanges with Martin Callanan, the . Tory leader in the European Parliament, Mr Barroso said: ‘Your party is . looking like Ukip. ‘Ukip may finish first in Britain. I . have some doubts whether you are going to be elected or if it is not . Ukip that will be the first force in British elections. That is probably . why they are going to vote for [Nigel] Farage.’ Mr Callanan last night condemned the . intervention as ‘outrageous’, adding: ‘He is effectively a civil . servant, but he has turned it into an increasingly political role. ‘The idea that the alternative to . greater EU integration is a return to us fighting each other in the . trenches of the First World War is just risible. ‘David Cameron has got him rattled. He . thought he could isolate Britain, but there is growing support for the . Prime Minister’s ideas in Germany, the Netherlands and others.’ EU residents should pay the same for all international phone calls across its 28 nations, Brussels said last night. Mr Barroso also wants to abolish mobile roaming charges in the EU. Proposed legislation would stop customers paying for incoming calls when travelling in the EU from July 2014. It would end all roaming charges two years later. The plan, which must still be approved by the EU Parliament and all EU governments, also aims to cap EU-international fixed-line call costs the same as domestic long-distance calls.","Jose Manuel Barroso warned Euroscepticism could lead to divisions that sparked the First World War .

Six Flags announced yesterday that the notorious 153-foot tall roller coaster will reopen this weekend with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar pads following an internal investigation. While the company maintains a . mechanical failure was not to blame for Esparza's tragic fall, her family have . accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride. The $1 million lawsuit, filed yesterday, names Six Flags . Entertainment Corporation, Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc, Texas Flags, Ltd. and Six Flags Over Texas as defendants. According to the suit, Esparza, who . also went by the surname Ayala-Gaona, was in the front left . seat of the train’s second car behind her daughter and son-in-law. The . car had no seat belt or shoulder harness, only a single lap or 'T-bar' to restrain passengers, Star-Telegram reported.

Everybody else is like, 'Click, click, click.' ' a witness told The Dallas News. 'Hers only clicked once. Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe, but they let her still get on the ride.' Ominous: Witnesses said they heard Rosa Esparza complain about her harness before she fell . The suit states Esparza's daughter and son-in-law were forced . to complete the ride for 'what seemed like an interminable time knowing . that Rosa Esparza had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing . whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate . medical attention'. It also claimed Six Flags employees initially refused to believe that Esparza had been thrown off the ride. 'It’s a tragedy of the highest order,' Dallas attorney Frank Branson, who filed the suit in . Tarrant County yesterday on the family’s behalf, told Star-Telegram. 'I believe it should have been . avoided and could have been avoided.'

Taxpayer-paid executives running the Sellafield nuclear power plant billed £714 to chauffeur-drive a cat, expense claims revealed today. Bosses at consortium Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) also used the perk to pay for flights to the US Masters golf tournament and Amazon purchases submitted without receipts. NMP were brought in to decommission a nuclear plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, but senior staff have now been forced to hand back thousands of pounds after an audit of their claims between 2008 and 2012. From more than 606 expense documents it emerged £236,781 of claims were requested without a proper description, £30,557 worth were purely for personal expenditure and £42,711 should not have been claimed at all. Shocking: Executives brought in to decommission part of the Sellafield Nuclear plant in Cumbria put in a series of problematic expense claims, including £714 to taxi a cat . One executive claimed £714 for a 'repatriation' by taxi for themselves 'and the cat', another claimed £719 for Amazon buys without receipts and an £82-per-head gourmet dinner in France. Other claims included a £2,795 on flights to the US Masters golf . tournament in Augusta, Georgia, and a £2,316 Apple desktop computer. Jamie Reed, Labour MP for Copeland in Cumbria, which contains Sellafield told City AM: 'A workforce that is being asked to accept many changes – including pay restraint – will have many questions. 'Taxis for cats and flights to the US Masters simply beggars belief.' Anger: Local Labour MP Jamie Reed says that the cat claim 'beggars belief' NNP said in a statement its management id not 'understand' a 'complicated and bureaucratic' expenses systems. It came the day after it was revealed the same senior managers have pocketed more than £6million in bonuses over the last three years, despite a series of failings. Executives seconded to Sellafield Ltd to have received bonuses ranging from £2 million to £2.5 million since 2009. The taxpayer-funded bonuses for senior staff at the Sellafield site were paid for using funds from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), the public non-departmental body which agreed the terms of the contract under which Sellafield Ltd operates. Energy Minister Michael Fallon revealed that a total of £6.6 million was paid out in bonuses. In the financial year 2009/10, NMP executives received £1,999,192; in 2010/11 the figure was £2,451,269 and in 2011/12 the executive bonus pot totalled £2,148,035. The bonuses are likely to be the subject of much scrutiny after a series of setbacks at the site, which according to the firm's deputy managing director George Beveridge houses the most hazardous industrial building in western Europe. A contract was awarded to NMP to run the Cumbrian site for up to a maximum of 17 years starting in 2009 - including a break clause after the first five years - in the belief that the private sector would be able to manage the site more efficiently. But a report by the National Audit Office found that costs had spiralled from £47 billion, when it first started work on the site in 2009, to £67 billion by 2012 after key deadlines were missed. In June, the company was fined £700,000 and ordered to pay more than £72,000 costs for sending bags of radioactive waste to a landfill site in Cumbria. Taxi! The executive claimed the taxpayer should fund a journey for him 'and the cat' (file picture) The bonuses were disclosed in answer to a parliamentary question from Margaret Ritchie, former leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The South Down MP, who is also the SDLP's shadow spokewoman on energy, said: 'The Government and the NDA have serious questions to answer about this. 'It is unacceptable for this amount of public money to be paid in bonuses to a private consortium whose management of the decommissioning process at Sellafield has been so appalling. 'This is a consortium who in 2010/11 failed to meet targets in 12 of 14 major projects, yet in the same year senior executives received over £2 million in bonuses.' The NDA is currently reviewing the performance of NMP and a decision on whether or not to extend the contract into its second term or make use of the break clause will be decided in due course. A spokeswoman for NMP said: 'Whilst we do not disclose information on the private financial arrangements between Nuclear Management Partners (NMP) and its personnel, the bonus levels of Executive Directors seconded to Sellafield Ltd reflect the fee that NMP earns, based upon meeting performance targets agreed annually with the NDA. 'There is therefore a clear link between the payment of bonuses and performance. 2012/13 bonus levels - not included in the data quoted - were lower to reflect this year's performance in that financial year. 'The bonuses of NMP seconded Sellafield Ltd Executive Directors are included in the overall executive remuneration costs which are published each year in the Sellafield Ltd Annual Report and Accounts.'","Executives at Nuclear Management Partners consortium widely criticised .

Proof: Barbara Mohler (pictured) told her brother-in-law Paul Gilkey before he shot her that she had evidence he killed wife Carolyn Gilkey in 1972 . A woman gunned down in a triple murder last year had accused her killer just minutes earlier of shooting her sister to death decades ago, records show. Barbara Mohler told the gunman, who was her brother-in-law Paul Gilkey, that she had proof he had killed wife Carolyn Gilkey in 1972, according to police records obtained by The Associated Press. Carolyn's death had been originally ruled a suicide. A few minutes later after Mohler made the accusation, Gilkey killed her at his home in rural Hocking County along with two other people: another sister-in-law, Dorothy Cherry, and his adult son Leroy Gilkey. He then killed himself. The documents shed new light on the chaotic final moments before the shootings on Jan. 9, 2012, and suggest a possible trigger for the killings. The documents also confirm what investigators have long said, that Gilkey, 63, was upset that day about so many people being in his house and grew agitated. The documents also underscore tensions in the family and its complicated relationships over time, which included Paul Gilkey marrying his deceased wife's sister shortly after her 1972 death. That sister, Darlene Gilkey, was not wounded in the 2012 murder-suicide but had been sick and died a few days later. She had divorced Paul Gilkey after he killed a cousin with a metal fence post in 1974, but remarried him when he was released from prison 10 years later. Horrific: Paul Gilkey shot and killed two of his sisters-in-law and his son before killing himself at his home in Logan, Ohio in January 2012 . Victims: Leroy Gilkey, 38 (left) and Dorothy Cherry, 63 (right) were gunned down by Paul Gilkey . An account of the murder-suicide came from Ralph Sowers, Paul Gilkey's stepson, who told authorities Gilkey let him go free that day because he had children. He witnessed the shootings and then fled, according to Hocking County Sheriff's Office records obtained late last month after requests dating back more than a year. The tension that day ratcheted up when Mohler told Paul Gilkey she had proof locked away that he killed Carolyn. 'Paul told Barb, 'I don't care what you have,' and said, 'You can't prove it,' ' the records say. A few minutes passed, during which Mohler told Paul Gilkey to cool down, and that she and Dorothy were there to care for Darlene. 'Barb then started getting started again with the same stuff,' the records show. Around the same time, Leroy Gilkey told his father he had power of attorney over his mother and threatened to take her from the house, according to the records. Moments later, Paul Gilkey walked into a bedroom, returned with a gun and began firing, according to the police documents. Sowers, who told police what he witnessed, did not return calls seeking comment. A month after the murder-suicide, the coroner changed the cause of Carolyn Gilkey's 1972 death from a shotgun wound to undetermined, saying evidence now appears the shooting was staged. Coroner David Cummin said the shotgun wasn't in the right place for her to have been able to shoot herself. Massacre: This Ohio home was the site of a brutal rampage that left four people dead . Cummin said recently that he wasn't aware of the reports about Mohler's confrontation. 'I don't doubt that he did it – it can't be proven,' Cummin said. 'Unfortunately, I don't think with everybody dead it's going to come to any kind of conclusion beyond what I did.' Sheriff's investigators say they couldn't find evidence to back up Mohler's claim. 'If anybody knew anything, they took it with them,' said Hocking County Chief Deputy David Valkinburg. Family members said they'd never heard the story of Mohler's confrontation and didn't know what evidence she might have been speaking of. 'There was never anything that we would have had that would have proven he killed Carolyn,' said Mohler's husband, James, who added that family members had long suspected Paul Gilkey of killing Carolyn. 'If Barb would have had that, I'm sure she would have made that known to the authorities,' Mohler said. The couple was married 50 years. The AP's request was delayed while the lone detective on the case transcribed hours of interviews while working dozens of other cases in the rural southern Ohio county, Valkinburg said.","Paul Gilkey murdered sister-in-laws Barbara Mohler and Dorothy Cherry, and his son Leroy Gilkey, before killing himself in Ohio last year .

Tragic: The family of Rosa Esparza, 52, (pictured) is suing Six Flags Over Texas for negligence after the mother of two fell to her death from the ride in July . A Texas amusement park this weekend reopened the roller coaster from which a 52-year-old woman fell to her death as her family sues the company for negligence.

Six Flags announced last week that the notorious 153-foot tall roller coaster will reopen this weekend with new seat belts and redesigned restraint bar pads following an internal investigation. While the company maintains a . mechanical failure was not to blame for Esparza's tragic fall, her family have . accused the park of negligence and operating a faulty ride. The $1 million lawsuit, filed yesterday, names Six Flags . Entertainment Corporation, Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc, Texas Flags, Ltd. and Six Flags Over Texas as defendants. According to the suit, Esparza, who . also went by the surname Ayala-Gaona, was in the front left . seat of the train’s second car behind her daughter and son-in-law. The . car had no seat belt or shoulder harness, only a single lap or 'T-bar' to restrain passengers, Star-Telegram reported.

Everybody else is like, 'Click, click, click.' ' a witness told The Dallas News. 'Hers only clicked once. Hers was the only one that went down once, and she didn't feel safe, but they let her still get on the ride.' Ominous: Witnesses said they heard Rosa Esparza complain about her harness before she fell . The suit states Esparza's daughter and son-in-law were forced . to complete the ride for 'what seemed like an interminable time knowing . that Rosa Esparza had been thrown out of the ride and not knowing . whether she was dead or seriously injured and in need of immediate . medical attention'. It also claimed Six Flags employees initially refused to believe that Esparza had been thrown off the ride. 'It’s a tragedy of the highest order,' Dallas attorney Frank Branson, who filed the suit in . Tarrant County yesterday on the family’s behalf, told Star-Telegram. 'I believe it should have been . avoided and could have been avoided.' Following a nearly two-month investigation by the 'ride train manufacturer, internal engineers and external experts', the Texas Department of Insurance has given the park approval to start up the ride again.

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 06:14 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:06 EST, 13 September 2013 . A vicar has stopped serving wine during holy communion because of the growing number of alcoholics in his congregation. The Reverend Paul Filmer said he didn’t want the ‘four or five’ addicts who attend his church to feel isolated during his services. He took the unorthodox step for the first time last Sunday, using grape juice instead of red wine for everyone. The Reverend Paul Filmer started serving grape juice at St Peter and St Paul Chuch in Yalding, Kent, last week . He decided against using separate wine and non-wine chalices because he wanted everyone in his 70-strong congregation to feel they were 'together' during communion. Mr Filmer, vicar at St Peter and St Paul Church in Yalding, Kent, said: 'This is a very new thing for us and quite rare in the Church of England. 'I didn’t feel like it was fair that some of our congregation may feel excluded from everybody else. 'The feedback has been positive so far. People feel like they are doing something to help others. 'To go from a strong communion wine to grape juice has been a bit of a shock for some of my congregation, but we want to be in communion, we want people to come together with us.' Mr Filmer, 55, has been at the small village church for four years and has seen his congregation grow. Altar wine has been served in churches for centuries but Mr Filmer stopped after talking to a local rehab centre . His action has been prompted by the church’s close association with the Kenward Trust, which runs a nearby rehab centre. The Church of England’s Canon Law states that the drink used for communion should be '....wine, the fermented juice of the grape, good and wholesome'. A Church spokesman said there was nothing wrong with Mr Filmer's decision to not serve alcoholic wine, but said that official advice suggests it should be fermented first and then have the alcohol removed afterwards. Mr Filmer admitted that some of his congregation had voiced concerns that his changes had devalued the communion. But the vicar, who was ordained in 1997 after a career in industry, argued that Jesus would want to make everyone feel welcome. He added: 'Some of my congregation have quite a devout ideology and I have spoken to a few who I thought might have a problem. 'They asked me ""Why can’t they just drink from a separate cup?"" and I asked them what they thought about drinking from a separate cup themselves. 'Their response was that they would feel isolated and that sort of proved my point. 'There is the argument that Jesus used wine to deliver his communion, but my faith tells me that if Jesus was here he would want to make everybody feel welcome.' Wine has been served at Christian services for more than 2,000 years, but some churches disapprove of the consumption of alcohol and serve non-alcoholic wine or juice instead. Methodist Church: Usually serves non-alcoholic wine at services in the UK.  A spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are committed to church being a safe space for people, and one way is by ensuring they don't encounter alcohol.' Baptist Church: Usually serves grape juice at communion. Roman Catholic Church: Always serves (alcoholic) wine at communion.  A spokesman said: 'There are very clear directions on this and the wine must be pure, unadulterated and straightforward, as it has been for more than 2,000 years.'","The Reverend Paul Filmer says he has 'four or five' recovering alcoholics in congregation at the C of E St Peter and St Paul Church in Yalding, Kent .

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 05:25 EST, 15 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:52 EST, 15 September 2013 . A mother-of-two who is accused of murdering her husband has said she would rather die than face serving 30 years in a Dominican prison if she is convicted. Nicola Reyes, 37, has described the horrific condition in which she has been kept for 14 months, allegedly without charge. Even her own lawyer in the Caribbean fears she will be convicted, and her parents Micheal and Jeanette Clements claim the British Embassy and Foreign Office have failed to provide assistance. Nicola Reyes ran over and killed her husband as he drove his motorbike alongside her SUV after a night out . They have now started a petition asking for Prime Minister David Cameron to intervene. Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Nicola, a former holiday rep from Cardiff said: 'If I am convicted - and I truly think I will be - I will get 30 years. I will kill myself. I have worked out a way to do it.' In one incident inside the prison dubbed Devil's Hotel she says she listened as guards beat a man to death in the cell next to hers, then watched in horror as they dragged his body out and left it in full view of the other inmates until morning. She said: 'I saw other male prisoners chained up so high by their hands they were forced to stand on tip-toe. 'Guards would beat them with sticks until the sticks broke.' Even though she was moved to a private prison after six weeks her health has suffered due to the appalling conditions and she complains of intestine and bladder infections which mean she cannot eat the porridge served each morning. She also worries she might have cancer after two smear tests carried out by the prison doctor showed something was wrong. She said: 'I share a cell with two other girls. I have the top bunk and water drips on to my bed when it rains. 'There's a bucket behind a screened off curtain for a toilet and rats the size of cats in the corridors. 'In the mornings I cry in the shower - it is the only privacy I get.' Jorge's family initially demanded £360,000 blood money but dropped the amount to £40,000 'compensation', a deal which the district attorney refused so Nicola remains in jail . Her time in the Devil's Hotel haunts Nicola. She received death threats and feared she would be killed after Jorge's brother said he would offer male inmates money to do it. One night the power went out. Huddling together in the dark with the 15 other prisoners sharing her 12ft by 12ft cell, they told her that means either a breakout is happening, or a contract killing is being carried out. In an ironic twist Nicola used to point out the prison on her tours while working for Thomas Cook, telling holidaymakers to avoid renting a car because the police would arrest you for merely witnessing an accident. Nicola spent several hours in prison once before when she called the emergency services after she saw a drunk man knocked down. Her parents, who moved back to Cardiff last April with her two children, Leah and Luke, have spent more than £100,000 on the case. Nicola's mother, Jeanette, says she has emptied her pension and savings of more than £100,000 to pay for legal costs and accommodation . Nicola's mother and brother, Dean, even flew out to . see her in July after they heard she was due to appear in court, but the . hearing was postponed after she arrived. Her lawyer, Eduardo Trueba, has been trying to have the case moved to another town over fears she will not get a fair trial. He also blames the British Embassy for not helping, saying the case could have been moved with ease if they had cooperated. A spokesman for the Foreign Office said they were aware of the arrest and had been providing consular assistance. 'Live Life To the Best' - how an argument over a T-shirt meant whirlwind romance ended in tragedy . When Nicola first visited the stunning Caribbean isle of the Dominican Republic in 2000 she fell instantly in love with the country's white sands, palm trees and glorious sunshine. She loved it so much that just three years later she moved there along with her two children, Leah and Luke, and her parents Jeanette and Micheal. Jorge used to visit the family to help them out with their garden and pool. After a whirlwind romance Nicola married him in 2007 and the couple made a home for themselves in Puerto Plata. Paradise: 150,000 Britons holiday on the tropical isle, famous for its white sand and palm trees, every year . But one night last July that was all due to change as the couple argued over money while out with friends. Struggling to get by, Nicola became angry with Jorge when she spotted him wearing a T-shirt she didn't recognise with 'Live Life To the Best' written on the front. She accused him of spending money on extras that they couldn't afford and a 'minor argument' happened. Afterwards the couple drove home, Nicola in her jeep and Jorge riding beside her on his motorbike without wearing a helmet, the norm in the Dominican Republic. After swerving to avoid a group of people Nicola says she heard a 'horrible bang' and jumped out to search of Jorge in the dark. Police arrived at the scene, threw Jorge's body into the back of a van and told Nicola they were taking her to hospital, but actually to her to jail. Once there she was told Jorge's family were accusing her of murder and demanded £360,000 in blood money. Four months ago, after Nicola said she couldn't pay, Jorge's parents dropped the amount to £40,000 'compensation' but the district attorney refused the deal. Having already spent 14 months behind bars she could now face a wait of up to two years before the case even reaches trial, and a potential 30 year sentence if convicted.","Nicola Reyes, 37, ran over her husband Jorge last July .

Leah Albright-Byrd, now 29, spent her teenage years trapped in the sex trafficking trade, but the tragic death of a friend has helped her turn her life around and she now helps save other victims . ‘What I wanted to tell Bridget I now tell other girls to help them get free,’ she recently told Katie Curic. 'You [the girls] deserve so much more than being sold on the streets.' Like many of the young girls who are manipulated into a life of prostitution, Albright-Byrd came from an abusive family background. At the age of just 14, she ran away from home and while on the streets met a man in his 60s who said she could stay at his home provided she continue to attend school. Bridget Gray, right, was found strangled in a Las Vegas hotel room on her 22nd birthday, James Flansburg, left, is currently in prison after being convicted of her murder . But soon after, he insisted that she start contributing to the household and she was given a choice - either sell drugs or herself. ‘You are sold a dream and concept that ""this is glamorous life,"" but you’re being accosted by men twice your age and you start to lose confidence, hope and humanity,’ she told Katie Curic. Albright-Byrd describes being caught in a psychological trap which she felt she couldn’t leave. She even started to recruit other underage girls, including a 14-year-old girl called Bridget Gray. ‘I had no idea what I was helping her get involved in,’ said Albright-Byrd, who spent four years working for a series of pimps in and around Reno, Nevada. Gray was in foster care and dating Albright-Byrd’s cousin when the girls first met and Albright-Byrd introduced her to 'the life.'

They later went there separate ways, but kept in touch and Albright-Byrd recalls Gray's unsuccessful attempt to leave prostitution behind. ‘Recidivism is high with the girls,’ she told REJ.com. ‘Most get out and get back in. ...There’s a lot to overcome. You’ve messed up your credit, have no financial literacy, no ID, basic stuff.’ On March 3, 2006, the day of her 22nd birthday, Gray's body was found in a Las Vegas hotel room. She had been strangled by a client - James Flansburg – who claimed she was trying to steal from him. He was convicted of her murder and is serving a 10-to-life prison sentence. Albright-Byrd had already left prostitution by then, but the shocking news set her back. ‘I went into the worst grief,’ Albright-Byrd said. ‘I was so angry and I felt responsible.’ Leah Albright-Byrd appeared on a recent episode of Katie Curic's show to talk about her experience of being trapped in the sex trafficking trade . It took years of intensive therapy and medication to help her recover from the trauma of living 'the life.' In 2009 she graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree in Theology and Counseling Psychology from William Jessup University. She is now executive director and founder of 'Bridget’s Dream,' an organization dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking. The group provides crisis care and family support in the Sacramento and Reno area and according to Albright-Byrd the most important thing they can offer is love and not judge the girls that they help.","Leah Albright-Byrd ran away from home at 14 and soon found herself being pimped out for money .

For a start, that sports-luxe will yet again dominate next summer for what feels like the hundredth time running. But also that Zoe Jordan really is something quite special. This, and it's easy to forget it, is only her fifth outing but she already has a grasp of tailoring and colour of the sort that would make more established names proud. And she showed both off to the full in a collection that combined a pitch-perfect palette with sleek silhouettes and wearable separates. Scroll down for video . Sport meets street: Structured sporty silhouettes were lifted with flashes of colour and graffiti print . Minimal: Clean white or blush flatforms added glamour without overwhelming the excellent collection on show . Like Stella McCartney, like Phoebe Philo, like Balenciaga head honcho Alexander Wang, Jordan has an innate grasp of what women want before they know themselves. Like them, she understands that a carefully calibrated palette of shimmering grey, delicate blush pink and fiery crimson lifts excellent tailoring out of the office and into must-have territory. And like them, she does it beautifully. A case in point were the lovely dove-grey chiffon trousers  teamed with a rugged waffle knit in muted oatmeal and given a fashionable edge with the help of a perfectly-tailored thigh-length white coat. The blazer, a recurring piece, appeared in scarlet, paired with a delicate multi-layered minidress in a soft ombre that transitioned from black to grey to white before ending with bright crimson. Showstopper: A column dress in pale grey and tomato red . In the pink: Blush gave the sporty look a shot of femininity . Accomplished: Jordan showed off her grasp of tailoring . Wearable: Jordan's perfectly chosen palette and well-executed styling brightened a gloomy Saturday morning . Delicate blush and dove-grey ombre . popped up again and again, most daringly on a beautifully tailored . slouchy trousers and blazer combo. Inevitably, Jordan's trademark graffiti print put in an appearance: scaled down and mixed with charming doodles on a grey silk shirt dress and loud and proud in bold black lines on a body suit worn with a delicate pair of silvery shorts. A robust sportiness kept dresses from becoming too girly, with a striped column in tomato and pale grey benefiting from discreet sheer panels and flashes of print. Most . of what appeared was thoroughly wearable but more than that, everything . was utterly wantable and deserving of more than a rainy Saturday . morning slot. Although sports-luxe has become something of a recurring S/S trend, Jordan showed that repeats don't always have to be boring. Her graffiti splattered, soft-hued vision for summer was proof that sporty summer separates still have fashion mileage, while her wonderful all-red finale did an excellent job of brightening up a gloomy Saturday morning. Roll on next summer.","Jordan's new collection included plenty of well-tailored separates .

Shock appointment: Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Khan is set to take on an advisory role for the Serbian Government . Sex-crazed former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn is set to become an economic adviser to the Serbian government. Strauss-Khan - who is due to stand trial in France for pimping and faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted - is set to be announced in the role next week, according to an official in the Serbian Deputy Prime Minister's. 'The exact details still have to be worked out, but we will have more information on Tuesday,' the official told CNN. 'Mr Strauss-Kahn will come to Serbia from time to time, but I don't think he will live here.' Asked why the government had chosen Strauss-Kahn, she said: 'Because he is an expert in the field of economics.' The government declined to give out any more details ahead of Tuesday's announcement. Strauss-Kahn, once considered a likely candidate for the French presidency, resigned as head of the International Monetary Fund in 2011 after being charged with sexually assaulting a New York City maid. All sexual assault charges against him related to the maid were later dismissed at the request of a prosecutor. More than a year later, in December 2012, Strauss-Kahn reached a settlement with the maid, the terms of which were not release. But earlier this years judges announced they believed he was ‘King’ of the orgies he attended at glamorous hotels all over the world and that he was the ‘central pivot’ in a well organised vice ring is what has led to him being prosecuted. He admits attending swingers' parties over many years, but insists he did not know the women were prostitutes. Strauss-Kahn is known to give advice for free to less economically developed countries and had recently been working with the government of South Sudan.

A girl born with no eyes or nose is just days away from a surgery that will give her a nose. Born with no eyes and no nose, Cassidy Hooper, 17, of Charlotte, NC, will have an operation that will graft bone or cartilage from another part of her body before stretching skin over the area to create a nose. The final surgery is scheduled for Sept 18. The high school senior has already gone through two other surgeries this summer that prepared her for the final step, after which she will finally have a nose. Scroll Down for Video . Surgery in June: Cassidy Hooper underwent surgery in last month that heralded her final operation to have a nose attached to her face . Almost finished: Ms Hooper's brave journey through a dozen surgeries meant to construct her face is almost complete . Ms Hooper told ABC News she is excited that she will soon be able to breath and smell through her nose. 'I'll have a real nose like everyone else's,' the brave girl said. Her father couldn't be happier. It's been a long process, but the day has finally come,' her father, J. Aaron Cassidy,48, told ABC. 'Cassidy is certainly excited for this day to be here.' Ms Hooper has had numerous procedures performed since she turned 11-yeard-old, but the courageous girl has kept a positive spirit thoughout. 'Things always may be hard,' she told ABC. 'But here's what I think: I don't need easy, I just need possible.' An operation in June moved Cassidy's eyes closer together while taking a section of her forehead bone, folding it down and also pulling enough skin downwards to create enough necessary for the bone to be implanted and create a nose at the end of the month. Her prosthetic eyes, which she's had since birth, need to be replaced, but they will not happen right away, her mother told ABC. 'Insurance didn't pay one cent,' her mother lamented. 'We had already started the process to do her nose, moving her eyes closer together and having her skull reshaped. We were not going to pay for it then have to pay again.' The prosthetic eyes cost $10,000 per pair, according to ABC. Ready for One More Operation: Cassidy talks to a reporter from WBTV - clearly visible is the patch of skin surgically pulled down from her forehead - at the end of July bone from a rib will be inserted as the final piece of her new nose . Slightly Tender: Cassidy Hooper described her boneless nose as slightly painful and described her excitement that the whole process is almost over . The young role model and her family spoke to a local television station earlier this summer. Telling WBTV that the surgery has left her in some pain, a bandage-covered Cassidy said that she was looking forward to her years of surgery coming to an end. 'I was actually thinking of what the reaction of everyone would be when that last surgery finished,' she said. 'And I think everyone's going to be so excited.' Friends of the Hooper family have recently established a website to help with Cassidy's mounting medical bills. Susan says insurance covers 80% of what's 'reasonable and customary'.  The other 20% is left to the Hooper family.  To get more information or help, go to www.CassidyHooper.org. And the good news has left the energetic teen ecstatic because for the first time she will be able to smell and breathe through her own nose. Cassidy Hooper is preparing for surgery to give her a real nose built from cartilage and bones from her ribs after five-years of preparations . When she was born, her condition left doctors baffled, especially since had no other medical problems and leads a healthy life. 'Her heart and brain are normal,' said her mother, kindergarten teacher, Susan Hooper to ABC News. 'Nothing else is going on with her.' The inspirational teenager has been going through skin graft surgeries to adapt her face since she was 11 years old and is pleased to be entering the final straight. 'I'll have a real nose like everyone else's,' said Cassidy of her July surgery. Born with no nose or eyes, doctors have never answered why she was born that way - but believe that she did not develop them in the first two weeks of pregnancy in her mother's womb . Her surgeon, Dr. David Matthews has worked for the past five years expanding her face to create a bony opening. Experts who spoke to ABC News explained how the surgery to replace Cassidy's nose will be completed. 'The nose is a little like the ear -- . what you see isn't functional,' said Dr. Sherard A. Tatum III, director . of facial and reconstructive surgery at Upstate Golisano Children's . Hospital in Syracuse, N.Y. The surgery will take place at Levine Children's Hospital in Charlotte and will be overseen by Dr. David Matthews (right) 'A lot of people have noses they lost to trauma and cancer and breathe fine and have a sense of smell. The nose is something we expect to see in its conventional place and it's good to put glasses on, but it's not 100 percent necessary.' 'The soft tissues that make up the inside and the outside skin and mucus membrane don't have a lot of strength to stick out of the face like the nose does. You can't just slap some skin up there and make it look like a nose.' Cassidy's doctors have taken a layered . approach - placing the inside membrane first, then using cartilage and . bone from her skull create a nose structure and then cover it with skin. Cassidy hopes one day for a career in radio and has recently spent time at her local radio station for experience . The hardest part for Cassidy has been overcoming the social difficulties. She has been attending Governor Morehead School, a specialist school for the blind since the fifth grade and deals with taunts from children well. 'Honestly, there's been a bit of teasing, but not more than any other child on a regular day,' said her mother.","Cassidy Hooper has already had 11 surgeries, the final one will be Sept 18 .

Comedian Russell Brand has described the moment his jokes about Hugo Boss and its historical links to the Nazis disrupted the 'illusion of sophistication' at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards. The comic, who was allegedly thrown out from the after-show party after he made the jibes, has said his jokes were 'not intended to herald a campaign to destroy' the fashion firm. Brand joked about the German company, who had sponsored the show, for making uniforms for Hitler's regime. Comedian Russell Brand has said his jokes about Hugo Boss and its historical links to the Nazis were 'not intended to herald a campaign to destroy them' Writing in The Guardian today, Brand has put forward his version of events and described the moment he could sense divisions forming in the room as he made the joke. The comedian, who picked up the 'oracle' award at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, took to the stage after Boris Johnson at the event at the Royal Opera House in London last Tuesday. The mayor, who received GQ magazine’s award for Politician of the Year, had allegedly made jokes regarding the chemical attacks and subsequent deaths in Syria during his acceptance speech. After picking up his award Brand said: 'Glad to grace the stage where Boris Johnson has just made light of the use of chemical weapons in Syria. 'Meaning that GQ can now stand for genocide quips. 'I mention that only to make the next comment a bit lighter because if any of you know a little bit about history and fashion, you'll know Hugo Boss made the uniforms for the Nazis. Rita Ora, Noel Gallagher and Russell Brand at the GQ Men of the Year Awards . 'But they did look f****** fantastic, lets face it, while they were killing people on the basis of their religion and sexuality.' Writing in The Guardian, the comic says the jokes 'were not intended to herald a campaign to destroy' Hugo Boss, who he describes as 'an irrelevant menswear supplier with a double-dodgy history'. He also describes how the comments appeared to disrupt the 'illusion of sophistication' at the event, before questioning why the event had been attended by the the Mayor of London as well as Foreign Secretary William Hague. Brand made jokes about Hugo Boss, who had sponsored the show, for making uniforms for Hitler's regime . Commenting on the relationships between the government, the media and industry, Brand asks, 'if you can't criticise Hugo Boss at the GQ awards because they own the event do you think it is significant that energy companies donate to the Tory party?' He goes on to say: 'When you take a breath and look away from the spectacle it's amazing how absurd it seems when you look back.' According to The Sun, Brand was kicked out of the aftershow party in central London. The comic took to Twitter to tell his fans about an exchange he said he had with the magazine's editor Dylan Jones, writing: 'GQ editor: What you did was very offensive to Hugo Boss. 'Me: What Hugo Boss did was very offensive to the Jews', which was accompanied by the hashtag '#nazitailor'. The fashion firm backed the event to the tune of £250,000, and would no doubt have been left reeling by Brand's tirade which included him putting a finger under his nose to mimic Hitler's moustache and goose-stepping on stage. It isn't the first time Brand has run into trouble at the annual bash. In 2006 he was involved in a row with Rod Stewart after telling guests at the event he had slept with his daughter Kimberly. In 1999, GQ editor James Brown resigned after the magazine published a list of of the 200 most stylish men of the 20th century, which included the Nazis and Field Marshal Rommel alongside Humphrey Bogart and John F Kennedy. During the awards last week Noel Gallagher, who was sat with Brand, also criticised William Hague, who presented an award, for being 'here with all the s*** going on around the world you should be sorting out'.","Russell Brand has spoken out about the jokes he made at event .

The Texas middle school student is in intensive care after suffering a severe allergic reaction to ant bites he received on a football field Wednesday afternoon. Cameron Espinosa, an eighth grade student at Haas Middle School in Corpus Christi, was huddled with fellow players during halftime of a game with nearby Hamlin Middle School, when he began to scream, ‘Ants! Ants!’ Fighting for his life: Cameron Espinosa, 13, (left) is in critical condition after he was bitten by ants on Wednesday . Football player: The young teenager was bitten while playing a school football game . 'Ants! Ants!': The high school student screamed when he was bitten by the ants . A coach ran over and attempted to squirt . the ants off Espinosa's legs using a water bottle shortly before he lost . consciousness and collapsed on the field, according to KZTV. The coach called 911 while an assistant coach ran to a nearby gym to find a defibrillator, which they used to restart the boy's heart. Paramedics arrived shortly afterwards and transported the boy to Bay Area Hospital in Corpus Christi. He was later transferred to Driscoll Children's Hospital, also in Corpus Christi, where he remains in critical condition. The school had extra counselors on hand on Friday to counsel students who were at the game, which typically draws a crowd of 100. The principal told KZTV that the football field would not be used until it had been treated for ants. It is likely that the ants were fire ants, given the boy’s reaction, said Dr Stanley Fineman, an allergist with the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic and immediate past president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Student: Espinosa, 13, studies at Haas Middle School (pictured) in Corpus Christi, Texas . Hospitalised: He is still in critical condition at the hospital . Deadly insects: Around 40 people die every year in the country from allergic reactions to insect bites and stings such as from wasps . Fire ants can be red or black. They're the only ants that inject venom, which is what prompts an allergic reaction that can vary from a single itchy, red bump to hives or anaphylactic shock, he said. ‘In some patients only one sting could trigger a life-threatening reaction,’ Fineman said. Insect stings send more than 500,000 Americans to emergency rooms every year, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and more than 40 people die annually from insect sting anaphylaxis. Typically, insects which generate allergic responses are either stinging insects like wasps, bees, hornets and ants, or biting insects such as mosquitoes and ticks.","Cameron Espinosa from Corpus Christi was playing a football game when he was biten .

'We . thank you father for the tremendous progress we have made in 50 years, . that we can sit in the safe confines of this sanctuary being protected . by the city of Birmingham when 50 years ago the city turned its eye and . its ears away from us,' she said.

There were performances from Jill Scott and Charlie Wilson. Awards were presented to Elder Bernice King, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Myrna Jackson, and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, according to al.com. Reverend Lowery established the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr King in the late 1950s and led the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. In his acceptance speech, the Reverend paid tribute to the four girls killed in the bombing. Earlier this week, Condoleezza Rice recalled her own personal experience of the tragedy. Rice was friends with 11-year-old Denise McNair who died in the blast.

The former Secretary of State has a treasured photo of her friend accepting a kindergarten certificate from Rice's father, who was a pastor at another church. McNair had gone to preschool there. McNair's father was the community photographer, documenting birthday parties and weddings in happier times. 'Everyone in the black community knew one of those girls,' Rice said. Her father told her the bombing had been done by 'hateful men', she said, but it was an act that later uncovered something ultimately good. 'Out of great tragedy, people began to recognize our humanity, and it brought people together,' said Rice.

A young mother and three teenage boys have been found shot dead in their car in a former mountain resort in Tennessee after they were deliberately targeted. A resident came across the murdered bodies of Rikki Jacobson, 22, Domonic Davis, 17, John Lajeunesse, 16, and Steven Presley, 17, in Crab Orchard on Thursday. It was not clear when they were shot dead, but investigators believe they were killed in the 24 hours before they were found, investigators said. Police said Jacob Alan Bennett, 26, is a suspect in the murders but has not yet been charged. Killed: Young mother Rikki Jacobsen, 22, and her 17-year-old nephew Domonic Davis (both pictured), were shot dead in a car that was found parked along a secluded track in a Tennessee mountain town . Close: The victims, who were found on Thursday morning, are pictured with Rikki's four-year-old son . He . was picked up in Dayton, Tennessee at around 1am on Friday by the Rhea . County Sheriff's Department on unrelated charges. He remains in custody at the Cumberland . County Sheriff's Office and is being held on a parole violation warrant. He has a lengthy criminal history and has been in prison five times, police said. 'The suspect knew the victims to some degree,' District Attorney General Randy York said at a press conference on Friday but would not provide further details. During a news conference on Friday, . prosecutors and police gave no indication of a possible motive. Asked if . the crime was drug-related, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director . Mark Gwyn said that most crimes of this type involve drugs. Arrest: Jacob Bennett, 26, is suspected of shooting dead a woman and three teen boys in a rural Tennessee town. He has not yet been charged and is being held on an unrelated parole charge . Found: The bodies were found inside this blue Dodge Neon that was abandoned at Renegade Mountain . Concerns: Residents were suspicious of the car as the former mountain resort is not densely populated . A Facebook post by a close friend of . Rikki and Domonic suggested the killings could have been related to . drugs. The friend refers to Domonic as Rikki's nephew. On . her own Facebook profile, Rikki, who worked as a cashier at WalMart, . wrote a heartfelt letter to her young son, who is believed to be four . years old. 'On the day . you were born to forever and a day I have and will always love you,' she . wrote to him. 'Nothing can and will separate the strong loving bond of a . mother and her son!' A . resident came across the blue Dodge Neon that was parked on an unpaved . road off one of Renegade Mountain's main streets at 7am on Thursday. 'They knew that nobody lives on that . street, and [the car] just looked odd sitting there,' Cumberland County . Sheriff Butch Burgess told WATE.

He added: 'Knock on wood, we've not had any [cases] gone unsolved. And we don't want this to be the one that does.' The . community, which was a former ski resort and golf club, is 50 miles . west of Knoxville. It is now home to just 43 residents, most of which . are young families. Burgess and other officials contacted . the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, which sent a specialized crime . lab from Nashville. The TBI is still working at the scene. John . Moore, the president of the Renegade Mountain Homeowner's Association, . told the Associated Press that there have only been minor crimes in . recent years, including drugs and break-ins. 'I . believe it was just somebody doing something that required an isolated . place and it just happened, unfortunately, to be our sub-development,' Moore said. 'There are 10 miles of road on 3,000 acres. It's easy to get lost or be invisible once you get past the gate.' Probe: Officials with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigate the discovery of four bodies in a vehicle at the former Renegade Mountain resort community near Crab Orchard . Grim discovery: The bodies were found by a resident who saw the car parked on the isolated gravel road . The medical examiner's office will conduct autopsies on the bodies. 'I know this really affected a lot of the high school age kids,' said Cumberland County Sheriff Butch Burgess. 'This is something that's very traumatic and it's never happened in our county before, to this extent.' Cumberland County Superintendent Donald Andrews said grief counselors have been made available at all three area high schools for both students and staff. Davis had been a sophomore at Cumberland County High School, where he'd been 'well-received' by other students after moving there from another state, Andrews said. Lajeunesse had attended both Cumberland and Stone Memorial High Schools before being home schooled, Andrews said.","Bodies of Rikki Jacobson, 22, John Lajeunesse, 16, Steven Presley, 17, and Domonic Davis, 17, found by resident on secluded track on Thursday .

PPQ's Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker have never had a shortage of stars decorating their front row but now it seems the designers have decorating them in their sights. For this was a collection that screamed old-school Hollywood glamour, awash with starlet scarlet and frocks that practically demanded a red carpet. Gone were the pop prints and candy colours and in their place were magical chiffon gowns for grown-ups (were you watching Kate Middleton?) as well as neat nipped in dresses that barely touched the tops of models' thighs and are a dead cert for the red carpet at next year's BRIT Awards. Scroll down for video . Grown-up glamour: This was a collection made for the A-listers watching the frocks stream past . This was a collection made to impress the assorted celebrities lining the runway - and it deserves to succeed . But as the gowns streamed past, it became clear that Molyneaux and Parker, being Molyneaux and Parker, couldn't resist the odd quirky detail or, indeed, a touch of print. This time around, there were Prada-esque pop art florals given a touch of London grit by being set against gothic black. They were splashed over tiny dresses, on neatly wearable A-line skirts and all over the skirt of a fabulous gown, slashed to the thigh and given drama with flamenco-style ruffles. There were even a few polka dots, although unlike in seasons past, these were subtle and barely registered. But although the tropical print florals caught the eye, it was the jewel-coloured frocks in shiny silky purple, chiffon cadmium yellow and devilish crimson that were the real winners on the night. Low key: For once, prints didn't take centre stage . Gothic: The PPQ duo plumped for a distinctly wintry palette . Frock n' roll: Separates were few and far between . Detail: Vast flamenco style ruffles gave minidresses a modern edge, as did sheer chiffon and clean lines . Star-studded: Jo Wood, Chris Pine, Gabriella Cilmi, Lilah Parsons and Ellie Goulding look on during the show . Kept modern with puffed hemlines, vast flamenco style ruffles and the odd discreet sheer panel, this was a master class in the art of dressmaking. Separates were few and far between but this was one collection where it didn't really matter -  certainly not to the A-listers looking on. Sitting watching the gowns go by was, as is usually the case with PPQ, a veritable galaxy of stars, among them singer Ellie Goulding, a puff-ball skirted Olivia Grant and Star Trek actor Chris Pine. But stellar though the front row was, the really out-of-this-world sight on offer were the clothes themselves. Grown-up, glamorous and very, very well executed, this was a collection teed up to impress the celebrities front row - and it deserves to succeed. Taking her inspiration from the deadly Atropa Belladonna flower, Maybelline makeup artist Karina Constantine created a striking beauty look for PPQ this season. She started by blending vivid purple cream eyeshadow over the eyelids of her models and then added a strong statement brow (Cara Delevingne inspired, anyone?). Using the new BrowDrama mascara is, she gave the girls a gothic lash look and slicked a thick line of eyeliner over their lids too. She coated lips with a dark shade of plum (Maybelline's Midnight Plum #338), before using a soft makeup brush to rub the colour into a velvety finish, a look we have spotted everywhere so far. The beautiful shades of mauve and indigo came together for a romantic, gothic s/s14 make-up look - time to start playing with purple!

North Korea is risking potential 'man-made catastrophe' by turning on an ageing nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium for weapons and bombs, Russian sources have warned. A U.S research institute has captured images of steam apparently rising from the five megawatt reactor at the Yongbyon complex which was closed in 2007. But a senior Russian diplomat has claimed that the outdated reactor is in a 'nightmarish state' and that the nation could face a potential nuclear disaster if it has been made operational again. Full steam ahead? This satellite image of the five megawatt (electric) reactor at the Yongbyon facility was taken on August 31. Steam is seen coming from the electrical power generation building . Satellite imagery has captured steam rising from the nuclear facility, suggesting its reactor has restarted, according to a U.S. research institute . The source told the Interfax News Agency: 'Our main concern is linked to a very likely man-made disaster as a consequence. 'The reactor is in a nightmarish state, it is a design dating back to the 1950s.'For the Korean peninsula this could entail terrible consequences, if not a man-made catastrophe.' The reactor, which was completed in 1986, was decommissioned as part of a disarmament agreement six years ago. But North Korea vowed to restart the . facility, around 50 miles north of Pyongyang, in April amid a series of . threats towards the U.S. and South Korea over its latest nuclear and . rocket tests. Now, satellite imagery from August 31 has . captured steam rising from the nuclear facility - suggesting the . reactor has restarted, according to the U.S.-Korea Institute at John . Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. The U.S envoy on North Korea said that the reported restart of the reactor would be a 'serious misstep on the part of North Korea.' He added that such an action would breach the United Nations Security Council resolutions. The reactor produces 6kgs of plutonium a year, which could be used by North Korea to make nuclear weapons. 'The white coloration and volume are . consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating . system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or . nearing operation,' said a report published on the Washington-based institute's website, 38 North, yesterday. North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 - however, the Yongbyon reactor, that yields weapons and bomb-grade plutonium, has been technically out of operation for years. In 2008, the North destroyed its cooling tower as a . confidence-building step in the six-nation talks. However, in April, North Korea announced that it . would revive the aged reactor, but stressed it was seeking a deterrent capacity. North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear complex (pictured) is situated about 55 miles north of Pyongyang. The country is suspected of restarting a five megawatt reactor capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium . Pyongyang (pictured) has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 - however, the Yongbyon reactor has been technically out of operation for years . North and South Korea have agreed to reopen the Kaesong Industrial Complex on a trial basis next week . At the time, nuclear . experts said it would probably take about half a year to . get the reactor up and running if it had not suffered significant damage . from neglect. However, the report, written by Jeffrey Lewis and Nick Hansen, suggests that the reactor has been started already and may, in fact, be nearing completion. 'Acknowledging that we are not completely . certain yet, this is very disappointing but not at all unexpected,' said James Acton, an . analyst for the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for . International Peace, a Washington-based think tank. 'It's not . unexpected because we've been able to see for months through satellite . imagery that North Korea has been working on repairing the five-megawatt . electric reactor. 'Restarting it is . another slap in the face to the international community, indicating that . North Korea has no intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear . weapons.' The U.N. nuclear watchdog has said today that it is aware of the report, but it does not yet have a 'clear understanding' of the situation. This week, the U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Joseph Macmanus, said the IAEA board of governors had 'reiterated overwhelmingly' that North Korea must cease all nuclear activities immediately and refrain from taking any steps to restart its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon. North Korea said in July it would not give up . its nuclear deterrent until Washington ends its 'hostile policy' towards . Pyongyang, although it was ready to revive nuclear talks. The . country tested a nuclear weapon in February and spent the first three . months of 2013 issuing bellicose threats, including a warning that it . would launch a nuclear attack against the United States and South Korea. Recently, . however, Pyongyang has been on what analysts describe as one of its . 'periodic charm offensives' - agreeing with Seoul on Wednesday to re-open a . shuttered industrial park on a trial basis. The Kaesong industrial zone, which . lies inside North Korea, was closed when Pyongyang pulled its 53,000 . workers out in April amid rising tensions. But now, North and South Korea have agreed to restart operations at the joint industrial park, which will be opened on a trial basis next week. South . Korea's National Intelligence Service has said it can not confirm the suspected restarting of Yongbyon's nuclear reactor . because it involves confidential intelligence.","The Yongbyon nuclear facility in North Korea was closed in 2007 under the terms of a disarmament agreement .

"By . David Martosko . PUBLISHED: . 15:15 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:05 EST, 13 September 2013 . Former presidental adviser David Axelrod was the victim of a putsch within Obama's re-election campaign inner circle, according to a new book . The man most responsible for getting Barack Obama to the White House – the man who had 'crafted his ads since 2004' and 'had cowritten his narrative' – was forced out of the president's inner circle during the 2012 re-election campaign, a new book reveals. Obama's two main campaign generals marginalized David Axelrod, the campaign strategist behind Obama's 1990s rise to power from local organizer to president. White House communications director David Plouffe and re-election campaign manager Jim Messina were in open conflict with 'Axe' throughout much of the re-election push. Axelrod, insiders said, referred to them as 'two strongmen running the Kremlin.' He believed Plouffe, busy in the White House, wasn't plugged into the campaign enough. And he thought Messina, whom Obama had trusted to 'run a business' in getting him re-elected, was insecure and lacked strong leadership skills. MSNBC online editor Richard Wolffe interviewed political insiders about the campaigns for his book, 'The Message.' The Daily Beast published an excerpt on Thursday. He details how Axelrod tried to muscle Messina out of his job entirely, but ended up as the odd man out himself. Obama For America director Jim Messina (L) got tired of Axelrod agitating to get him fired, writes Richard Wolffe. Ultimately it was Axelrod who was ousted. Messina has stayed on, and now runs the campaign's successor organization, Organizing for Action . David Plouffe, who ran Obama's first presidential campaign, inherited Axelrod's White House job hear the Oval Office. There was no love lost between the two . Richard Wolffe, formerly of Newsweek magazine but now in charge of MSNBC.com, got access to many of the major players behind Obama's political successes . 'Axelrod repeatedly tried to convince other senior aides to bypass Messina,' Wolffe writes, 'and they believed he was trying to oust Messina altogether. Axelrod had never wanted him to get the job in the first place. Now he was complaining to others inside Obama’s inner circle about Messina’s shortcomings, but there was no support for a change of campaign manager.' 'Axelrod knew that Plouffe had confidence in Messina, and nobody could come up with a good candidate to replace him. ""For a good six months of that campaign, they were trying to wedge him out, which created all of the divisions,"" said one senior Obama campaign official. ""But there was no one else, and Messina had positioned himself with Plouffe. Axe had tried a long time to prevent him from getting that job."" The affable Axelrod ultimately left the operation after he left his job managing messaging from a perch near the Oval Office, along with White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. 'There never was another serious candidate for the position' of campaign manager, other than Messina, Wolffe relates. 'Plouffe had handed him operational control of the 2008 campaign. And the following year, in the White House, Plouffe had once again told Messina to run Chicago.' 'Implicit in that offer was the notion that the two operatives could maintain their working alliance: Plouffe would set the course and steer the strategy, while Messina would run the machine. Plouffe could stay inside the White House, close to POTUS, while still controlling a headquarters 700 miles away. Hands-off: Barack Obama stayed away from the palace intrigue and stayed focused on retail campaigning, leaving his inner circle to fight among themselves . Plouffe (L) remains an integral part of the Obama White House, determining the course of the administration's external communications -- a job Axelrod held until 2011 . The campaign itself never really . stopped, as political observers noted during Obama's first term. Obama . For America, his campaign committee, continued to operate hundreds of . field offices in key swing states while the president was busy . governing. And the ad buys continued long before Obama was renominated as the Democrats' 2012 candidate. 'The Message: The Reselling of President Obama' by Richard Wolffe is due in stores on Sept. 19 . All that continuous campaign muscle needed leadership. And all the jockeying for position brought tension on a grand scale. When 'Axe' left the White House late in the re-election season, he soon after left the campaign operation. That, Wolffe writes, was just the way Messina and Plouffe wanted it. Plouffe, for one thing, had already inherited Axelrod's White House job, and his office near Obama's. Axelrod brought some of the resentments upon himself by hiring an attorney to negotiate a sweetheart deal that made him rich by taking what he called 'a very, very small percentage' of the cost of every TV ad the campaign ran -- in addition to his monthly fees. 'Messina told friends that he was acting under the president’s direction,' Wolffe writes, 'which he characterized like this: ""I want everybody treated fairly, but I don’t want anybody to get rich on this. They’re gonna get rich on the books they write afterwards.""' 'Many of those who worked with Messina doubted his accounts of conversations with Obama or Plouffe. But he acted as if he was empowered by them, and he was. Messina and Axelrod negotiated hard, as Messina hacked away at Axelrod's demands.' Meanwhile, Obama himself stayed above the fray. Axelrod, now without his trademark moustache, has retained a silent consultant's role with Obama, but no longer wields serious power inside his political organization . It's a 'business': Obama offered Messina the top campaign job, telling him he could run what amounted to a giant business venture from the headquarters in Chicago . No love lost: Axelrod and Plouffe reportedly worked together but tussled in a power struggle that left Axelrod without a formal campaign role . 'Obama kept a close team of younger male staffers to manage his immediate needs,' Wolff writes, 'and that was all he needed. ""He needs the guys to play cards and golf, and tell him where he’s going next and why,"" said a former aide.' '""But beyond that, it’s what function you have. And if you can’t fulfill that function anymore, or someone can do it better, you’re gone. That’s hard for those of us who really believe in him. He expects full loyalty. But you need to have your eyes open.""' A hands-off manager, the president didn't like mixing it up between disagreeing staffers, according to the book. '[A]dvisers suspected he knew about the conflicts but pretended they didn’t exist because he had no desire to resolve them, and because he hoped they might peter out. Obama wanted consensus on communications and strategy, not personal conflict.' That left the big guns to fight it out among themselves. Behind Plouffe's and Messina's 'intensely competitive exteriors, they nurtured intensely competitive interiors' as well, the book recounts. But unlike Axelrod and Gibbs, they 'were still on the inside ring of Obama’s circle of confidants' and survived.","Axelrod wanted campaign manager Jim Messina fired, but he wound up the odd man out himself .

"By . Hannah Ellis-petersen . PUBLISHED: . 16:02 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:02 EST, 14 September 2013 . Nicky Clarke (pictured here with girlfriend, Kelly Simpkin) has admitted to his past as a heroin addict, saying the troubled time was the worst of his life . He has styled the tresses of scores of celebrities and Royals, from Princess Diana to the Duchess of York. And he still counts the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie among his clients. But behind Nicky Clarke’s perfectly preened locks and boyish charm, he has been hiding a dark secret. ‘It’s my biggest regret, and it horrifies me even now, but I have been in rehab for heroin addiction,’ he admits. ‘This is the first time I’ve ever spoken about it. ‘It was a very short period of  my life and I went in with a small  but regular heroin habit that I had  for a year. I am sickened when I  look back.’ The £500-an-hour hairdresser, who since his early 20s has become as famous as the celebrity clientele of his Mayfair salon, developed his addiction while embroiled in the New Romantics music scene of the 1980s. He was part of a crowd that included Boy George and Steve Strange, who both almost died from drug addiction years later. Though his years in the spotlight have been punctuated with accusations of infidelity and links to prostitutes, it is this brief dalliance with drugs that he laments the most. It was only after his then wife, Lesley, threatened to ‘kick me out or call the police’ that Nicky was forced to face his demons. But 27 years later, it is a subject that he still struggles to speak of. He has  not even confessed to his grown-up children, Harrison, 27, and Tellisa, 24. Nicky, 55, says: ‘I was secretive about it because they were very young children at the time,’ he says. ‘Harrison had just been born. I had a picture  of him with me almost as a newborn that I kept with me while I was in rehab. ‘Mine had been a very private habit, it was small but regular. I never mainlined heroin [he smoked or snorted it] – I can’t bear all that dirt. ‘I was there for ten weeks and they gave me nothing, so I had to go cold turkey. I absolutely hated being there. ‘I was silent and huddled  for a week. I felt like my life was being taken over because everything you do becomes psycho-analysed, and I just had to get out of there. The celebrity hairdresser found fame in the 80s after opening his Mayfair salon in London . ‘When people came out they would go to those narcotics anonymous meetings. I went to about four and  I hated it. It was a lot of euphoric recall, and it was so not me. ‘I never touched it ever again but I can’t erase the past. Just remembering the smell made me feel sick.’For a man who has lived his life in the public eye, it is hard to believe he was able to keep this dark chapter of his life buried for so long. Clarke’s life story makes colourful reading. His relationships were played out in public, as were the break-ups. However, it was his affair with prostitute Natalie Springer that  generated his most vitriolic press coverage – and signalled the end of his relationship with millionaire interior designer Kelly Hoppen, who now stars on Dragons’ Den. Five years on from the furore, the stylist says he still has the ‘utmost respect’ for his ex-girlfriend, the so-called ‘Queen of Taupe’. ‘It might seem odd after everything that was reported but I have fond memories of my relationship with Kelly. I’m not someone who remembers the bad times, so all I will say is that I think she is brilliant.’ The prostitute, however, he concedes was a mistake. ‘Aah yes, I will admit I wasn’t thinking in the best sense when I turned to a prostitute and yes, maybe you could call it a moment of madness,’ he says, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. Though he is refreshingly honest in his answers, he talks of the  incident with a noticeable lack of remorse. ‘It certainly isn’t going to go down as one of my best decisions and I’m not going to sit here and  ask for sympathy because, let’s be honest, I did do it.’ Royal favourite: Nicky Clarke styled the tresses of the late Princess Diana in the 80s, and more recently The Duchess of Cambridge . The hairdresser still counts Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie among his most well known customers . His main gripe with the story lies not with the accusations – ‘the bulk of which are true’ – but with what he says are smaller inaccuracies in Miss Springer’s account of their brief liaison. ‘The thing I was most annoyed about was that it said I had Primark sheets,’ he says laughing. ‘I certainly don’t have any bed linen from there, I’ve never been to Primark in my life.’ He may laugh it off now, but it was not the first time his infidelity had led to a painful break-up. An affair with model Susie Bick led to the collapse of his marriage of 20 years to Lesley Clarke. She was so devastated that she suffered a nervous breakdown. ‘To an outsider it may look like I was a serial adulterer,’ Clarke admits. ‘But I don’t think that is the case. When Lesley found out we tried to make it work for three or four months, but the damage was done.’ Clarke maintains a relationship with Lesley, though it is somewhat unconventional, with the pair living four doors away from each other in St John’s Wood, North London. They have remained ‘great friends’ despite his betrayal. Lesley is the powerhouse behind the £50 million Nicky Clarke brand and still has joint control of the empire. Another one of his long term clients is TV presenter Selina Scott, pictured here with the hairdresser in the 1990s . He admits he wouldn’t be where he is today without Lesley. So successful was the brand they built that the hairdresser spent much of the early 1990s dividing his time between his Mayfair salon  and Buckingham and Kensington Palaces – a long way from the small council flat in Elephant and Castle, South London, where he grew up. ‘I was doing mostly the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, and the Duchess of Gloucester. I did Princess Diana as well, though only a couple of times,’ Clarke recalls fondly. ‘There was one particular time where Princess Diana was going to Pavarotti in the Park and I went to Kensington Palace. It was when Sarah and Diana were very close and going to the event together, so  I did both of them. Diana was just lovely, very friendly, and we were laughing and joking and she even made me a cheese sandwich. She was just very charming.’ While he is still privy to the salon confessions of the rich and fabulous – Cate Blanchett, Sharon Stone  and Elizabeth Hurley are all recent clients – the millionaire stylist claims to have put his philandering behind him and has remained loyal to girlfriend Kelly Simpkin for more than four years. At 31, Kelly is 24 years his junior. She was a trader in the City before she joined Clarke’s salon as a trainee hairdresser and later became his personal assistant. Their love, he says, grew out of that friendship. However, the relationship is far from blissful, as the couple have been forced to grapple with Kelly’s worsening health issues. She was recently diagnosed with lupus, an auto-immune disease that has left her with crippling arthritis and constant exhaustion and she can now only work in the salon part-time. And his own brush with serious illness in January this year, when he was diagnosed with a ‘grapefruit-sized cyst’ on his liver, gave Clarke a rare time for reflection. After a major operation to remove the mass, he was put on a strong course of antibiotics that caused him to lose a stone in weight. ‘The medicine just stopped my appetite and I was drained of all my energy – I felt like an old man.’ It was a ‘frustrating’ reminder of his own mortality for a man who has worked flat-out since the age of 17 and professes to have ‘done the hair of all the major divas of this world’. But despite his wild past and celebrity credentials, there is still an endearing humility to Clarke. ‘I’m still just the son of an electrical engineer who grew up in a council flat on the Old Kent Road,’ he says, getting up to leave. ‘Yes, there has been some stuff I would like to rewind or erase from my past. ‘But there have been so many moments in my life, for example when I’ve been kneeling over a bath washing Elizabeth Taylor’s hair or even when I just walk into the salon, where I can hardly believe the life I’ve had. ‘I am so grateful for everything. Life really has been good to me.’","Hair stylist to the stars reveals heroin addiction which led him to rehab for the first time .

"By . Neil Ashton . PUBLISHED: . 09:59 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 14 March 2013 . Is England boss Roy Hodgson right to recall Rio? Roy Hodgson admitted Rio Ferdinand has every right to feel a . 'grievance' towards him as he ended the Manchester United defender's . international exile. Ferdinand, who has not played for England since a Euro 2012 qualifier . against Switzerland in June 2011, returns for the World Cup qualifiers . against San Marino and Montenegro. England head coach Hodgson has dropped Joleon Lescott from the 26-man . travelling party, which includes the recalled Ben Foster, Michael Dawson . and Scott Parker. Rio returns: Manchester United defender Ferdinand is back in the England squad. His last game for the Three Lions was in June 2011 . GOALKEEPERS Hart (Man City), Foster (West Brom), Forster (Celtic). DEFENDERS Baines (Everton), Cahill (Chelsea), A Cole (Chelsea), Dawson (Tottenham), Ferdinand (Man United), G Johnson (Liverpool), Smalling (Man United), Walker (Tottenham). MIDFIELDERS Carrick (Man United), Cleverley (Man United), Gerrard (captain, Liverpool), Lampard (Chelsea), Lennon (Tottenham), Milner (man City), Osman (Everton), Parker (Tottenham), Oxlade-Chamberlain (Arsenal), Walcott (Arsenal), Young (Man United). FORWARDS Defoe (Tottenham), Rooney (Man United), Sturridge (Liverpool), Welbeck (Man United). Hodgson, who has yet to speak with the Manchester United defender about his selection, said yesterday: 'If Rio has a grievance and does hold it against me because I haven't previously selected him there's not much I can do about that. It's a concern, but I can't do more than I am by giving him a chance to come back and making it clear I would like to use him. I can't do more. 'I like to do my talking to players face to face. The telephone sometimes is not the greatest of instruments, especially if you don't know people extremely well.' Hodgson has always quoted footballing  reasons for Ferdinand's omission and inadvertently appeared to end his England career in an unguarded conversation with a fellow passenger on a Tube train last October. The defender is understood to have been shocked by yesterday's announcement, but honoured to be playing for his country again. Ferdinand has had an uneasy relationship with Ashley Cole after the Chelsea defender gave evidence on behalf of retired England skipper John Terry in his court case with Anton Ferdinand last July. Rio was fined £45,000 by the FA over his infamous 'choc ice' tweet after the trial, a slang reference to Cole's ethnicity. Cole was later fined £90,000 for calling the FA a 'bunch of t****' when Terry was banned for four matches and fined £220,000 after he was found guilty of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand. Recalling Rio: Hodgson has brought back Ferdinand . England manager Roy Hodgson and Under 21 counterpart Stuart Pearce will go head-to-head at the Madejski Stadium in May as the Football Association help celebrate 125 years of football in the British Army. A line-up of FA legends, managed by Hodgson, will take on the current British Army team who will be bossed by Pearce. The likes of Jens Lehmann, Gary Neville, Gareth Southgate, Paul Merson, Ledley King, Matt Le Tissier and Dietmar Hamann will line up for the FA Legends. The FA have donated £10,000 to help get the event off the ground with ticket sale proceeds going to service charities that promote sporting opportunities for soldiers, including wounded servicemen who play sport as part of their rehabilitation. The fixture also forms part of the FA's 150th anniversary celebrations and chairman David Bernstein said: 'We at the FA greatly value our close relationship with the Armed Forces and believe that we should celebrate their work whenever possible. 'In fact, the Army has a proud heritage with the Football Association going all the way back to our formative years in the 1860s. This match will be more than fitting, especially with the Army FA marking their 125th anniversary.' However, Cole and Rio Ferdinand shook hands before Sunday's FA Cup clash . between United and Chelsea and it is understood they are prepared to . put their differences behind them in the interests of the national team. Hodgson added: 'They were very good friends, but we are talking about England as a football team and not purely individuals. 'I expect the pair of them to do their job with England. Ashley has to . do his job at left back and Rio has to do his at centre half. 'I don't expect any problems. If there are any I will have to deal with . them, but I'm rather hoping the long-term friendship can re-emerge and . the unfortunate incident along the way can be forgotten. The spirit in . the group is good and they do seem to care about each other. 'I would be unhappy if there were tensions between players in a group, . but this is an  England team and these players are fierce rivals . sometimes on the field of play. 'We are talking about two very experienced professional players here and . we are talking about the England football team. I don't envisage any . problems.' England's head coach watched Ferdinand, who has 81 caps, play against . Real Madrid in the Champions League at Old Trafford last week and again . in the FA Cup quarter-final with Chelsea. Hodgson added: 'If he is still . playing in 2014 like he is now then there is no reason why he cannot be . part of the squad in 2014 for the World Cup.' Football reasons: Hadgson said it was a no-brainer to recall Ferdinand . England play San Marino a week today  and then travel on to Montenegro . for a World Cup qualifier that could shape Hodgson's destiny. England go into the game behind  Montenegro in second place in Group H, . knowing they need a win to put automatic qualification for Brazil 2014 . back in their own hands. The big test for the squad will come in Podgorica, when Wayne Rooney . will return to the stadium where he was sent off in a Euro 2012 . qualifier against Montenegro. Together again: Ferdinand and Cole have not played with each other since June 2011 . At arm's length: Hodgson insists Cole and Ferdinand are good friends but it will be interesting to see how they get on . Glove story: West Brom goalkeeper Ben Foster has ended his international sabbatical and returns to the squad . Hands on: Manchester City's Joe Hart is expected to be first choice with Celtic's Fraser Forster challenging him . How it stands: Group H . Hodgson added: 'You don't forget  a sending off but his disciplinary . record, ignoring the occasion when he  paid dearly against Montenegro, . has been very good. I will be speaking to  all the players. 'Away matches at this level require a  lot of discipline, but I won't . single  out Wayne. He has not let me down as  a player, so I have no . reason to  doubt him.' Dawson, who has won only four caps,  is back in the squad for the first  time since his appearance against Wales in March 2011. Hot spurs: Tottenham's Michael Dawson and Scott Parker (R) are back in the England fold . National service: Chelsea defender Gary Cahill keeps his place in Hodgson's squad . Leading the way: Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard will captain England . Centre of attention: Chelsea's Frank Lampard and Manchester United's Michael Carrick are options in midfield .

"By . Deborah Arthurs and Bianca London . PUBLISHED: . 07:35 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:55 EST, 13 September 2013 . Her baby is not yet two months old. But last night as the Duchess of Cambridge made her first appearance on the red carpet since she gave birth, she showed the world she was ready to cast off her dressing gown and step back into the spotlight. She is, after all, the new jewel in the Royal family's crown, partly behind their sharp rise in global popularity. And certainly worth a designer frock or two. The frock of last night - a gold, floor-length sequin gown from Jenny Packham's current collection worth around £2,500 - was certainly a showstopper. Dazzling Duchess: Kate arriving at the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards at the Royal Society in London . Her shoes - the £484 Vamp style from Jimmy Choo - were about as far from the standard issue ballet pump favoured by the yummy mummy Sloane set as they come. She accessorised with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet, which was reportedly a wedding gift from Prince Charles. The message she was sending out was clear: I am a glamorous woman who can do it all: Be a mother, a fashion icon, a charitable ambassador, and a wife. Oh yes - and I can be slim, polished, beautiful and cheerful while I'm doing it. As far as we know, Kate may well have been furiously pumping milk for George moments before she stepped out the door. She might have been in agony from overfull breasts as George's feeding times slipped by. And she may have suffered the very real fear that one of her breast pads might slip loose on the red carpet. Perfect in Packham: Kate's sleeveless . gown flattered her already-slender post-baby body. The high neck and . draped back added another layer of dimension and dram . All of these things can be issues for new mothers and, at less than two months in, it's rare for a mother to feel entirely comfortable about slipping back into her old role. But whatever she may have been feeling under that newly tanned, line-free, smiling face of hers - maybe the fear that a mewling baby might wake her every hour during the night when she got home - she let none of it show. Here we look at the detail that went into Kate's debut red carpet look. HAIR . While last week some picky observers . mentioned her hair was lacklustre, . last night her newly tinted chestnut locks looked like something straight . out of a L'Oreal ad. Her hair looked to have been tinted and cut ahead of the event, likely by her trusted stylist Amanda Cook Tucker. Amanda is the hair stylist who arrived at the . hospital with an assistant to give Kate perfect glossy locks for her grand departure after giving birth to George in July. Frock star: New mother Kate chose a dazzling gown by British designer Jenny Packham for the event . Natural beauty: The Duchess wore her hair loose around her shoulders, with understated make-up save for her dramatic smoky eyes . Amanda Cook Tucker, 50, . often styles Kate's hair at home and has been cutting William and . Harry's hair for years - since they were children, in fact. Amanda Cook Tucker has been . Kate's hairdresser since the couple visited the Far East on a Diamond . Jubilee Visit in September last year. The stylist was credited with . giving Kate heat-proof hair that defied the humid Asian weather. Amanda (L) is the hair stylist who arrived at the hospital with an assistant to give Kate perfect glossy locks for her grand departure after giving birth to George in July . Bad hair day: Kate had been criticised for her unusually lacklustre locks when she stepped out in Anglesey recently . Amanda and Kate are said to have become close, the stylist is known for her discretion and has always kept a . low profile. Her ex-husband Neville Tucker also has Royal connections: his . Knightsbridge salon held the Royal Warrant from 1980 to 1994 and he . worked closely with the Queen’s longest-serving hairdresser, Charles . Martyn. Kate added to her dazzling look with diamond drop earrings and a diamond bracelet. The bejewelled bangle is said to have been a wedding gift from Prince Charles. The Duchess accessorised her gorgeous dress with a pair of diamond drop earrings and matching bracelet . SHOES . She was once criticised by shoe designer Nicholas Kirkwood for her fondness for a demure LK Bennett heel. 'Why . can't she be more ""princessy"", he railed. And last night, with her . spectacular silver Jimmy Choo heels (she won't be wearing Nicholas . Kirkwood any time soon, we're guessing) Kate proved she could dress to . impress as well as any Royal. Dressy: The Duchess wore her trusty silver crackled leather shoes by Jimmy Choo, which retail for £484 . But Kirkwood should note . that this was not the first time Kate has worn designer shoes - in fact, she often steps out at red carpet events in the dazzling £484 heels. The Duchess wore the . sparkly Jimmy Choos for a red carpet appearance in L.A. last . year, when she paired them with a lilac Alexander McQueen gown. She slipped them on again in May the same year at Claridge's . hotel in Mayfair for a meeting of the Thirty Club, whose members are . some of the most powerful men and women in advertising and the media. Deja-vu? The Duchess has stepped out in the dazzling shoes many times before, usually at high-profile red carpet events and premieres . Careful: She was sure to slightly pull up the front of the Packham gown to avoid disaster as she took the stairs in the floor length gown and towering heels .

Ellie Cole, 35, had no idea she was being filmed while she bopped away waiting for her bus . But she went viral after thousands took a liking to her impromptu routine . She has been invited to take part in AH Men, a play showing at The Point Theatre in Eastleigh tonight. She was given the role after Lynne Paris, who wrote the play, which has been performed on the West End stage, after the writer saw her video by chance. Miss Cole studied performing arts for a year at Eastleigh College, but had to drop out after she lost her job and could not afford the fees. She said this was a chance to fulfill her stage ambitions after attending rehearsals in London, adding: 'It's very flattering and humbling. 'There's no doubt it's very exciting.' Ms Paris, who is also directing AH Men, said she spotted the video online and resolved to track Miss Cole down after learning she was from Hampshire.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 01:06 EST, 14 September 2013 . A Florida judge ruled today that 'Hiccup Girl' Jennifer Mee can share her story with the public and the media ahead of her murder trial. Earlier this week, Pinellas County prosecutors had asked Judge Nancy Moate Ley to bar any interviews Mee had planned to give before her trial, which gets under way Tuesday. The sheriff's office will now have to determine if it can accommodate the interviews at the jail, where Mee is being held. Tearful: An emotional Jennifer Mee, known as 'Hiccup Girl,' appears in court at the Pinellas County Justice Center Friday . Media blitz: Mee and her attorney (right) were able to convince the judge to allow the 22-year-old to sit down for interviews with several media outlets before her trial begins next week . Looming trial: Jury selection in Mee's murder trial is set to take place on Monday . Drawing a line: Judge Nancy Moate Ley refused a request from the Dr Phil talk show to have a small camera in the courtroom for the purpose of interviewing the defendant during breaks . The 22-year-old woman is one of three people accused in the 2010 killing of Shannon Griffin during a burglary gone awry in St. Petersburg. The case has attracted national attention because Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop. If convicted of murder, Mee could face a life sentence. A number of national and local news outlets are waiting their turn to talk to the defendant, including the Today show, Dr. Phil, Inside Edition, Bay News 9 and the Tampa Bay Times. The media's access to Mee was temporarily blocked this week after prosecutors voiced their concerns that the coverage would make it difficult to find 12 impartial jurors. While the judge today sided with Mee's . defense team by allowing her to speak to the press, she balked at an . unusual request from the Dr Phil talk show to have a small video camera . in the courtroom for the purpose of interviewing the defendant during . breaks. ‘If your question . to me is, “Judge Ley, can we have Dr. Phil's little camera or recorder . in the courtroom for breaks in the trial...” my answer is no thank you,’ Ley told Mee's attorney, John Tervena Friday. The . judge, however, expressed confidence that despite the publicity . surrounding the case, both sides will be able to select unbiased jurors . Monday. Charged: Jennifer Mee, 22, is accused of luring Shannon Griffin (right)into a robbery in 2010, which ended in him being shot dead . Co-defendnats: Mee's then-boyfriend Lamont Newton, right, is still awaiting trial, while his friend Laron Raiford, left, was sentenced to life in prison August 30 . Two weeks ago, Mee's co-defendant Laron Raiford, 23, was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of first-degree murder. Mr Raiford was the first of the three suspects to go to trial. During a tearful prison interview on . the Today show in 2011, then-19-year-old Mee blamed her short-lived fame . for taking her down 'the path of the devil' and drawing her into bad . company. Mee's lawyer has . claimed that at the time of Griffin's murder, his client suffered from . Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing. When . Mee was 15 years old, she became known as 'hiccup girl' when she began . hiccuping 50 times a minute. Her condition left doctors baffled and . earned her international publicity. Three . years later, she appeared in the news again - this time charged with . first-degree felony murder after police claimed she acted as bait to . lure Shannon Griffin, 22, into a robbery. Mee . is not accused of firing the gun, but under Florida law a defendant can . be charged with murder if they willingly take part in a felony which . then leads to someone's death. She has been held in Pinellas County jail ever since she was charged. Talking from the prison, she told NBC's Amy Robach in 2011 she cannot bear to . think about the possibility she could spend the rest of her life behind . bars. Fifteen minutes of fame: Mee had gained notoriety in 2007 when she had a case of hiccups that wouldn't stop . Downward spiral: Mee is accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old victim to an empty house where he was robbed and killed . She said: 'I’m scared. I want to go home; I can tell you that. My . sisters are growing up, my mom is missing me. The teenager said at the time she thinks about Mr Griffin's death every day. Prosecutors claim Mee plotted with her boyfriend, . Lamont Newton, and his friend, Laron Raiford, to rob Mr Griffin. Newton is still awaiting trial for first degree murder. She is . accused of using a social networking site to lure the 22-year-old on October 23, 2010, to . a dark alley in St Petersburg, where the two men robbed then shot him, getting away with $50. Initially Mee told police the shooting happened because Raiford found out Mr Griffin had been romantically involved with his girlfriend in the past. But later she changed her story and allegedly confessed she lured Mr Griffin to his death. Defense strategy: Mee's lawyer said his client had suffered from Tourette's syndrome and didn't know what she was doing . Blame game: Mee contented that her short-lived fame led her astray and drew her into bad company . Mee left home at 17, two years after she became known as 'hiccup . girl'. She claims her short-lived celebrity 'went to her head' and made . her go off the rails. Months of incessant hiccups left her temporarily unable to attend school as she disrupted other students. She tried home remedies and consulted medical specialists, a hypnotist, a . chiropractor, and an acupuncturist, until the hiccups finally just . stopped on their own a few weeks later. Her lawyer, Trevena, said her hiccups stemmed from her Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder whichcan cause involuntary movements and speech problems. He said: 'If you really believe her story, she’s really not guilty of anything except poor judgement of who she associated with.'","Jennifer Mee, 22, is charged with murder in the 2010 killing of Shannon Griffin .

A devoted husband who spent a year walking the streets with a sandwich board appealing for a kidney donor for his wife is a very happy man after his wife successfully underwent surgery on Wednesday. Larry Swilling’s extraordinary appeal came to fruition earlier this month when 41-year-old retired Navy lieutenant commander Kelly Weaverling came forward and proved to be a perfect match.

Help: Larry Swilling walked with his signboard across the community to broadcast his need for a donor . ‘Have you ever just had a feeling that was just a strong gut feeling that you just went with your instinct, because you just knew it was right?’ she told CBS. ‘That's exactly what happened. I could do something to give this family hope.’ Earlier this week, Weaverling flew to Anderson, South Carolina, and met the Swillings. 'I told her I was going to give her the biggest hug she’d ever had in her life,' Larry Swilling, 78, told The Virginian Pilot. 'And I did.' On Wednesday, one of Kelly’s kidneys was successfully transplanted into Jimmie Sue at the Medical University of South Carolina.

She looks after me, and I look after her,’ he told CBS. Jimmie Sue, 76, had been born with only one kidney. It was failing her and the need for a replacement had become urgent as she had been having dialysis three times a week for the past year. 'I knew it was going to happen because I know Larry. He would not have stopped until he got me one,' said Mrs Swilling. Wednesday's operation proved a success: Both Jimmie Sue Swilling and donor Kelly Weaverling are doing well . When Weaverling arrived in South Carolina, Swilling gave her 'the biggest hug she'd ever had in her life' Her husband had initially hoped that he might to donate a kidney to his wife himself, but neither he nor any of their three children have the right blood type. Since his appeal had started, the couple had been inundated with offers almost 2,000 in total, from as far away as Germany, Switzerland and Jamaica. Jimmie Sue was one of more than . 96,000 people in the U.S. waiting for a life-saving kidney transplant, . according to the National Kidney Foundation. According to statistics, donations from strangers are uncommon. ‘There's not enough words,’ said Larry Swilling, struggling to find a way to thank Weaverling.

Parents should continuing reading to their children up to the age of nine and beyond to help boost their academic results, according to new research. The study by the Oxford University Press found a sharp decline in the numbers of parents reading bedtime stories after their children had begun to master books themselves, usually around the age of seven. But experts said that even when pupils have learned the basics, adults still had a vital role. Book at bedtime: Parents should continue reading to their children to the age of nine and beyond to help boost their academic results, yet there has been a sharp decline in the numbers who do, according to new research . James Clements, a leading school adviser on reading, said: ‘Between the ages of seven and nine, parents can make a huge impact. This age provides an opportunity for them to support their child with developing a love of reading. The difference that enjoying reading regularly can make in children’s achievement extends across the curriculum.’ Separate research also found that children who read for fun are more likely to do better in maths and English than youngsters who rarely pick up a book. The findings come days after another . study revealed that the traditional bedtime story is dying out, with a . third of parents never reading to their children at night.

The study showed the average modern day child gets three bedtime stories a week. But a quarter of a milllion children aged seven or under, or just under five per cent, do not own a single book. In contrast, 91 per cent of those parents said they were read regular stories as a child, according to the research by online retailer Littlewoods.com. Businessman David Hodges, 48, admitted he struggles to find time to read to his two children. Mr Hodges, of Southampton, Hanmpshire, said: 'I tended to get back too late from work and the children were already in bed. 'If they were lucky their mother had time to read them a story but it could be a real struggle to get them both fed and ready for bed in time.'","Parents play vital role even after children learn to read, new study says .

Nowadays few would give this bearded man a second glance. Paul Michael Glaser – who was one half of detective duo Starsky and Hutch – strolled into rehearsals in Southampton this week virtually unnoticed. Sex symbol: Paul Michael Glaser as David Starsky in 1976, left; and right as he appeared yesterday as he arrived at rehearsals in Southampton for a touring production of the musical Fiddler On The Roof . Now 70, he is in Britain preparing for his latest role in a touring production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof. Forty years ago the American was a global sex symbol playing Starsky opposite David Soul as Hutch. These days his once curly black hair is grey, he has grown a beard and he is somewhat stockier. When pictured he was wearing a poor-fitting blue T-shirt, cargo shorts and ankle-high socks with trainers. In Fiddler on the Roof, he plays the role of Tevye. The production, directed by Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood, is touring 21 regional venues. However despite ‘enjoying’ working with Strictly’s Mr Nasty, the actor said he had no desire to take part in the come dancing competition. In a recent interview he said: ‘I love any challenge, but I’ve never been a fan of reality shows. I don’t think it’s something I’d enjoy. ‘In the beginning, I found celebrity to be fascinating. ‘I suppose some of me was frightened by it, but the larger part of me really wanted to be a celebrity. ‘When I got there, I couldn’t believe that had been something I’d wanted.' Starsky and Hutch: David Soul, left, played the intellectual Kenneth 'Hutch' Hutchinson and Glaser appeared as the streetwise David Starsky in the iconic Seventies cop series set in California . Speaking about his Starsky and Hutch days Mr Glaser described how women threw themselves at him when he played the detective heart throb. He said: ‘I guess they did, but you know what that’s all about — fame. ‘We all crave a real, intimate relationship and then there’s the candy and that was all candy. ‘Me, I prefer fruit — it’s better for you, although candy can occasionally be quite good. ‘But I don’t think I was prepared for that level of fame, and when I got it, I didn’t like it at all. But that’s part of the package and now I’m OK with it.’ The sitcom veteran returned to the big screen in 2003 in romantic comedy Something’s Gotta Give. He also had a brief cameo in the 2004 spoof film version of Starsky & Hutch, starring Ben Stiller. Fiddler on the Roof is a musical with music by Jerry Bock and book by Joseph Stein, set in Tsarist Russia in 1905. It is based on Tevye, the village milkman, who has always stuck by his traditions when suddenly his headstrong daughters decide they don’t want to have arranged marriages.","Glaser played streetwise California cop David Starsky in the iconic series .

With his sportswear, earring and back-turned baseball cap, you wouldn't think he was a fan of classical music - let alone a talented opera singer. But Maxwell Thorpe is proof that you should never judge a book by its cover. Because the shy 23-year-old, known as 'Chavarotti', has won hundreds of fans performing tear-jerking renditions of opera classics such as Nessun Dorma and Halleluja. Unlikely: Maxwell Thorpe, 23, sings on the streets of Chesterfield with his dog, Humphry . Performance: Maxwell likes to sing classics such as Nessun Dorma and Halleluja . And rather than performing in concert halls, Maxwell prefers a more down-to-earth venue - a bustling town centre. Maxwell, who is always accompanied by his loyal dog Humphry, a Shar-Pei Staffordshire terrier cross, sings outside a shopping centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. On busy days, up to a hundred people gather to listen to his amazing voice. He has also become and internet sensation, with one clip of him singing on YouTube receiving almost 100,000 hits. Humble Maxwell, from Sheffield, admits that people are often surprised by his unlikely talent. He said: 'People stop and ask me: ""where does that voice come from?""' Humble: The singer, pictured at his usual performance spot, says he just wants to share his gift with the world . Popular: Sometimes up to a hundred people stop to listen to Maxwell sing . 'I know it’s a gift and . something I have to share with people. 'I was lost for a bit and then I . came out on the streets and it’s been great.' As for his 'Chavarotti' nickname, Maxwell, who calls his style of singing 'Hip-Opera', said: . Out of the limelight: Maxwell has no plans to enter any talent competitions such as Britain's Got Talent . 'A guy took a video of me in Doncaster - he called it Chavarotti. 'It is very funny, it is a pun. The guy was sincere. There wasn't any harm meant by it.' Despite his growing popularity, Maxwell has no plans to audition for X Factor or Britain's Got Talent. He said: 'I would like to show a different way to life. 'I know that there are people who go on the shows who do have real talent - but I don’t feel that’s the way for me.

He added: 'I can only improve and the more I improve the more people will see the beauty of the voice. 'It’s a gift, I can’t take any accolade from it.' The amateur singer also performs reggae and hip-hop. But he seems to have found his hit niche with opera, and following some timeout in early 2013, plans to take his talent to more market towns across the north of Britain.","Maxwell Thorpe, 23, sings classics such as Nessun Dorma and Halleluja .

Tommy Hilfiger has worked in the fashion industry since the tender age of 17, but it seems he is finally ready for a change of scenery. In the latest issue of Haute Living New York, the 62-year-old fashion mogul strikes a pose with his wife and muse, 46-year-old Dee, as he jokes that he's 'sick of fashion'. He says of his decades in the industry: 'I've been doing it for too long,' adding: 'My real passion is flipping houses.' Happy couple: In the latest issue of Haute Living New York, Tommy Hilfiger strikes a pose with his wife and muse, 46-year-old Dee, in their Greenwich, Connecticut home as he jokes that he's 'sick of fashion' The designer was referring to his sprawling property in Greenwich, Connecticut, which he and his wife have been renovating for the past few months. The photo shoot sees the designer getting cosy in his temporary home with his wife of five years, a former model, whom he says is also his muse. 'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on her, what she would wear and how she would wear it,' Mr Hilfiger explains. Dee may inspire him now, but the . designer goes on to confess that there was a time when he let trends get in the way of . his personal aesthetic, much to the chagrin of his customers. 'In the Nineties I was chasing the modern minimalist trend,' he recalls in the interview. 'So I . tried to make the line more modern and sleek.' 'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on Dee, how she'd wear it' But the design change backfired. 'My customers completely . pushed back,' he says. 'They really wanted to stay with preppy, colorful, cool . designs. It was hard to rebound from that. 'Luckily I made the mistake and . came back to who I really am,' added the father-of-five. Judging by the photo shoot, Mr Hilfiger and his wife are more than just an artist and his muse. Inspiration: 'Every time we do a collection I think about what would look good on her, what she would wear and how she would wear it,' Mr Hilfiger said of his wife of five years . The couple look happy and in-love as they pose on a sofa, in a sailboat and next to a vintage car together. But the chemistry wasn't always so evident between the pair; indeed, Mrs Hilfiger reveals that when she was first introduced to the designer in St Tropez in 2005, she assumed he was gay. Sparks flew shortly thereafter, however, when the pair bonded over a cause that is close to both of their hearts: autism. 'Love at second sight': The couple look happy and in-love in the images, but Mrs Hilfiger revealed that when she was first introduced to the designer in St Tropez in 2005, she assumed he was gay . 'We both have children from our prior marriages on the autism spectrum so that was one of the things we bonded over,' explained Dee, whose two teenage sons are from her first marriage to Italian tennis player Gianni Ocleppo. The couple have since collaborated on fundraisers and public service announcements, and share projects and ideas with each other. 'It was love at second sight,' jokes Dee. 'The smartest business decision I ever made was to find a niche in the market and stick to it' Though the designer sold the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to Phillips-Van Heusen in 2010, he still maintains control over the brand's distinctive, all-American designs. 'The smartest business decision I ever made was to find a niche in the market and stick to it over a long period of time,' he told the magazine. 'The second smartest was to bring in great partners,' he said. 'It was like a band - you needed a guitarist, a drummer, a bass player and a singer.' Past mistakes: Dee may inspire him now, but the designer confessed there was a time when he let trends get in the way of his personal aesthetic, much to the chagrin of his customers . Despite his long-running success, however, Mr Hilfiger still sometimes gets mistaken for his fellow designer, Ralph Lauren. In the magazine, he recounts one time when a man came up to him in a restaurant . to tell him he had just bought 'a bunch of shirts' at his store. The man apparently told him: 'That's all I wear. I love your shirts. . . I love the horse,' referring to the animal logo on Ralph Lauren . apparel. Instead of correcting him, Mr Hilfiger - who admits he has gotten used to the comparison ever since he began letting his hair go white - says he 'smiled politely, and said, ""Oh, thank you very much.""'","The designer, 62, told Haute Living New York that his real passion is flipping houses ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:05 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:44 EST, 15 September 2013 . International law: UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon says he believes the Syrian regime is guilty of 'many crimes against humanity' United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon yesterday said the Syrian regime is guilty of 'many crimes against humanity', but stopped short of blaming it for chemical weapons attacks. Western nations are threatening military strikes against the war-torn country's armed forces after accusing it of a poison gas attack last month that killed more than 1,400 people. The Syrian government and rebels blame each other for the attack on August 21 in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Speaking at the UN yesterday, Mr Ban said he believes there will be 'an overwhelming report' from UN inspectors that chemical weapons were used in the attack. The Obama administration, which says 1,429 people were killed, has said it has evidence that clearly indicates the Syrian government was behind the attack. But Russia, a key ally of Syrian dictator Bashar Assad, has said it is not convinced by the U.S. evidence. The UN inspectors have a mandate to determine whether chemical weapons were used - and if so, which agent - not to establish who was responsible. But two UN diplomats said the report could point to the perpetrators, saying that the inspectors collected many samples from the attack and also interviewed doctors and witnesses. Mr Ban spoke shortly before the chief chemical weapons inspector, Ake Sellstrom, told The Associated Press that he would deliver his report to the secretary-general in New York this weekend. A senior U.S. intelligence official, meanwhile, said the U.S. reached its own figure for the dead in Ghouta by analysing videos taken in the hours after the attack and counting the number of people who appeared to have died by chemical attack, including bodies under bloodless shrouds - a sign that they probably did not die by rocket fire or some other conventional means. U.S. lawmakers were also shown transcripts of the communications intercepts of Syrian officials discussing the attack both before and afterward - including a conversation where one Syrian commander told the military's chemical weapons unit to cease firing, because they'd done enough damage, according to a congressional official. The intelligence official said the U.S. is not going to release those transcripts, in part because foreign intelligence agencies provided some of the material. The Obama administration also said it had established that rockets were fired from a regime-held area into rebel-held areas through satellite imagery, but such imagery has not been shown to lawmakers, though the congressional official said they will ask to see it. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss how they obtained the intelligence publicly. Prepared for a strike: Syrian President Bashar . Assad, whose regime blames rebels for the gas attack, faces missile . attacks from Western nations that say his forces used chemical weapons . in Damascus last month . Mr Ban, who spoke at the Women's International Forum, said President Assad's regime 'has committed many crimes against humanity,' though he did not refer specifically to chemical weapons attacks. 'Therefore, I'm sure that there will be surely the process of accountability when everything is over,' he said. UN associate spokesman Farhan Haq said that while the report still hasn't been completed, Ban 'has been in touch with different people including the experts.' The secretary-general thought his speech and his responses to questions that followed were not being broadcast, but they were shown on UN television. Speaking by telephone from the Netherlands, Mr Sellstrom, the UN's chief chemical weapons inspector in Syria, said he didn't know exactly when the report would be released publicly. He said that 'it's done, but when to present it is up to the secretary-general.' But in a later conversation Friday, Mr Sellstrom said he wasn't quite finished with the report, and that what he meant was that it would be done once he delivered it to Ban this weekend. Investigation: Mr Ban said he believes there will be 'an overwhelming report' from UN inspectors (pictured) that chemical weapons were used in the attack, but the team have no mandate to establish who is responsible . The two UN diplomats said the inspectors had soil, blood and urine samples and may also have collected remnants of the rockets or other weapons used in the attack, which could point to those responsible. The diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions on the issue have been confidential. Mr Haq said after receiving the report, Mr Ban will present it UN member states and that the media should receive it shortly afterward. In his speech, Mr Ban said 'the disaster' in Syria has created 'a lost generation of children and young people' and led to 'rising sectarian tensions, regional instability, the largest displacements of people in a generation, grave violations of human rights, including sexual violence.' 'The latest fighting has also raised the specter of chemical warfare - which, if confirmed by the U.N. investigation mission, would be an atrocious violation of international law,' Mr Ban said.","Ban Ki-Moon said Syrian regime guilty of 'many crimes against humanity'

Basketball's MVP LeBron James married his longtime girlfriend Savannah Brinson in a lavish San Diego ceremony on Saturday. The 28-year-old multimillionaire and his new wife held their ceremony at the Grand Del Mar hotel less than three months after he won his second straight NBA title with Miami Heat. A ceremony was said to have been held in the hotel's Capella Chapel at 4.30pm, with celebrations lasting three days. Newly weds: LeBron James and Savaannah Brinson were married in San Diego on Saturday . Screened off: White tents were put up over the hotel entrance left, and chapel area, bottom right, on the wedding day . The high school sweethearts, who have two children, announced their engagement in January last year. Guests, including James's teammate Dwayne Wade, Beyoncé and Jay-Z, were welcomed to the wedding on Friday, with a barbecue and the festivities are expected to last until a farewell brunch on Sunday. Other guests including Wade's girlfriend Gabrielle Union, and NBA players Chris Paul and Carmelo Anthony, according to People. A couple since high school and the parents of two young boys, right, LeBron James and Savannah Brinson are finally getting married this weekend . The happy couple have reportedly decided upon the exclusive Grand Del Mar hotel and resort in San Diego as their venue this weekend . Decadent: The Grand Del Mar has an elegant Mediterranean look and luxury resort features . Hotel staff and pretty much everyone involved with the wedding were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements, but one tell-tale sign about the venue is about to host something out of the ordinary is the large tent that's been erected outside. The extravaganza was organized by celebrity wedding planner Preston Bailey, who also oversaw internet entrepreneur Sean Parker’s $10 million ‘Lord of the Rings’-themed wedding to Alexandra Lenas back in June. King James' big day was expected be a slightly more muted affair. The guest list was expected to only number in the hundreds, rather than the thousands that have attended some NBA All-Star’s nuptials. Basketball superstar LeBron is getting married to Savannah Brinson at the weekend and guests are expected to include Jay Z and Beyonce . The guest list for LeBron's wedding is expected to including his Miami Heat teammate Dwyane Wade and his girlfriend Gabrielle Union, far left . ‘He cut the list down because he didn’t want to have 1,000 people at the wedding,’ a source told the New York Post. This weekend’s wedding also clashes with Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement. Guests started receiving their ‘save the weekend’ cards, which featured an illustration of the happy couple along with their two kids, back in March. The reception is expected to include cocktails, dinner and dancing to DJs and a live band, as well as an after-party in a different part of the resort. LeBron’s mom Gloria will be in attendance and is expected to take along her boyfriend Da Real Lambo, an obscure rapper who has posted a series of photos on Instagram of him enjoying the good life at LeBron’s expense on the family's recent European vacation. Other guests are expected to include LeBron’s longtime manager Maverick Carter, New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony plus wife La La Anthony, Miami Heat president Pat Riley and head coach Erik Spoelstra.

They have two sons: LeBron Jr., 11, and Bryce, 6. King James’ fiance has purposefully sought to shun the limelight for much of his career, but since their engagement was announced has started to engage more with the press and media. In April she provided prom dresses for about 100 underprivileged girls in her current home of Miami and her hometown of Akron, Ohio. 'I can't imagine being in their situation and not have somebody help,' she said. 'I really care. It's really in my soul to help people, and this is the first baby to come from it. There comes a time when you have to give back.' Her husband has encouraged his soon-to-be wife to be as visible as she wants. Savannah Brinso has purposefully sought to shun the limelight for much of his career, but since their engagement was announced has started to engage more with the media . 'I just think she has a knack for being powerful,' said James. 'Women are more powerful than men. Her voice and her being my sidekick, her voice is very powerful, especially to these young women who are underprivileged.' Brinson admitted that there have been plenty of times when she has been bothered by attention, particularly when stories have come out that simply aren't true. 'I've heard things about me that are bad, where they've literally looked up into the sky and said, ""What can they say about Savannah?"" It's going to happen,' Brinson said. 'People will say I'm doing this for attention and now that I'm getting married, I'm coming out from behind his shadow, but I just thought it was time. I'm letting these girls know that I'm confident, showing them my personal growth, and maybe it will help them as well.'

This is the dramatic new footage which shows the world's most wanted terrorist for the first time since he masterminded an attack on an Algerian gas facility which killed six Britons in January. In the Al Qaeda video the one-eyed fugitive Mokhtar Belmokhtar helps a soldier to hold a rocket propelled grenade launcher. Belmokhtar, 41, who has a £3.3million bounty . on his head, also addresses the camera before being pictured kneeling . with fellow terrorists and talking to them. The world's most wanted terrorist dubbed 'the uncatchable' has appeared in a new video . Trained to kill: In the video he shows a trainee terrorist how to use a rocket launcher . At the end of the two minute clip he embraces each smiling militant in turn. Intelligence agents from Britain, the US and Europe are sure to be studying every second of the film for anything that might provide them with information as to his whereabouts. An intelligence source said: 'Photos and footage of fugitives are always of great interest. Evidence of appearances and associations can be vital in tracking down even the most elusive of individuals.' Belmokhtar is thought to be on the run somewhere in Lybia as the country recovers from its uprising. Wednesday Jan 16 - Terrorists attack two buses carrying workers into the plant killing two, including one Briton, before driving to the plant's living area and taking hostages. Thursday Jan 17 - Algerian forces attack as the militants try to move hostages, and as a result several innocent people are killed . Friday Jan 18 - A stalemate develops as Algerian forces surround the compound . Saturday Jan 19 - Algerians attack again after reports that hostages were being killed . Sunday Jan 20 - Siege ends as Algerian military reports bodies of burned hostages found at plant while several remain unaccounted for . Though Belmokhtar has been fighting for Islamic organisations in Algeria, Africa, since 1992, he only came to prominence after he claimed responsibility for a deadly assault on the BP co-owned In Amenas gas plant. In January his troops stormed the facility carrying machine guns and grenades, killing one Briton in the process. They then strapped semtex explosives to the necks of other Western hostages, claiming they had only come for the Christians, while allegedly treating Muslim Algerians with kindness. They then surrounded the plant with mines before demanding France halt its attacks on rebels in neighbouring Mali. After days of tense negotiating Algerian special forces stormed the compound in a widely criticised operation which killed 29 militants and 37 foreign captives. Belmokhtar posted a video at the time of the attack saying: 'We in Al Qaeda announce this blessed operation.' Four months later his soldiers carried out two suicide bombings in Niger, followed by an explosion in a military base in Agadez which killed 20 soldiers and wounded 16. Another bomb at a French mine in Arlit killed one and injured another 14. Nicknamed 'Mr Marlboro' after making a fortune smuggling cigarettes across the Sahara, the senior terrorist is one of the most fearsome warlords in the Sarah, having been involved in a string of kidnappings and ransom demands dating back to 2003. Five Britons were killed by terrorists at this In Amenas gas facility in an attack ordered by Belmokhtar . Bullet belts, hand grenades and a machine gun were among the weapons seized by Algerian forces during the siege . Dubbed 'the uncatchable' by French security forces he was thought to have been killed in a combined French and Chadian army operation when they destroyed a terrorist base in March. DNA tests later showed the body to be that of Abou Zeid, another senior Al Qaeda figure. Belmokhtar was sentenced by an Algerian court to life imprisonment in absentia in connection with the killing of 10 Algerian customs agents in 2007. A UK coroner's investigation into the Algerian massacre is under way.","Mokhtar Belmokhtar can be seen training soldiers in the two minute clip .

As she poses in a bikini showing off her defined abs, bulging biceps and super toned legs, it's hard to believe that Rachel Turner was once a size 16 with body confidence issues. But the mother-of-three from Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea, has transformed both her figure and her self-esteem in two years after taking up bodybuilding. The now 42-year-old said it was turning 40 that gave her the impetus to change her life after an under-active thyroid, poor diet and role as a stay-at-home mother led her to pile on the pounds. Scroll down for video . Happier now: Rachel was a size 16 before she dropped her body fat and became a body builder . She said: 'Although I was on medication to tackle my under-active thyroid problem it was still difficult for me to regulate my weight and if I was honest I was not following an entirely healthy eating plan. 'I gave up my job at a law firm to be a stay-at-home mum. I suppose because I enjoyed work and missed being busy during the day I was comfort eating. 'I would buy chocolate bars to snack on whilst cooking the family meal. I would wade through packets of biscuits whilst watching daytime TV and drink untold cups of cappuccino. I would always serve a dessert sweet after our family meal. My eating was out of control.' Toned up: Rachel follows a weight regime and strict protein diet to build her lean muscle . Rachel's weight rose to 12 stone and her confidence and relationship with her husband, David suffered. She explained: 'As my weight increased, I didn't seem to care and allowed my weight and clothes size to balloon. Before I knew it, I was fitting into size 16 clothes. I convinced myself that I was fat and happy. 'I thought if I could dress well and keep my hair and make up nice I could get away with being fat. I was totally kidding myself. One day I caught a glimpse of myself under severe lighting in a changing room. I noticed that not only did I have cellulite on my thighs and bottom but also on my upper arms. I was gobsmacked. I was so busy covering up I hadn't noticed what I was covering up. 'How my body looked at this time affected everything. My relationship with my husband suffered. I didn't want him to look at me let alone touch me. I would jump into bed fully clothed from head to toe.' 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt . washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I . needed to do something about it and fast' Before having children, Rachel had been a trained aerobics instructor who had studied nutrition and enjoyed exercising so she was deeply unhappy with her weight gain and lack of fitness. 'I was snappy with everyone, angry that I let myself get into this state,' she said. It was the milestone birthday of 40 that made her realise she had to turn her life back around. 'I didn't want to be fat, frumpy and forty', she said. 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I needed to do something about it and fast.' Rachel began eating more healthily, cutting out sugary, fatty foods and swapping her milky cappuccinos for black coffee. She attended Zumba and Body Pump classes, did some weights at the gym and started running. Her weight soon dropped and she loved the way her body shape was transforming. 'My arms became more shapely. My back and . shoulders were stronger. My legs and bottom toned and I almost carved . myself a six pack,' she recalls. Life begins at 40: As a stay-at-home mother, Rachel said she let herself get out of shape but turning 40 gave her the impetus to change her life . Her husband noticed how her fitness levels had gone 'through the roof' and suggested she run a marathon. But Rachel dismissed this idea as 'everyone runs the marathon'. 'I want to do something extraordinary,' she added. She has now achieved this by becoming a professional bodybuilder, winning accolades for her physique and aiming to qualify for Miss Universe. As previously reported in the MailOnline, it was former glamour model Jodie Marsh who gave her the idea to become a bodybuilder. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better' She explains: 'In October 2011 I was watching This Morning and I saw Jodie Marsh giving an interview about her bodybuilding. That was my eureka moment - I would become a competitive bodybuilder.' Rachel contacted Jodie's trainer Tim Sharp who devised a weight training and nutrition plan for her to follow. She said: 'I would see Tim once a week and he would send through to my phone my training plan which I would do at my own gym. Tim also sent through my nutrition plan. This included supplements such as protein drinks, glutamine, branch chain aminos and creatine. These were all supplied by LA Muscle who are now my sponsors.' Confident: Rachel used to hide her body away but now she loves to show it off . Under Tim's fitness regime, Rachel dropped body fat and gained lean muscle. She also learnt a choreographed routine in which she forms various poses to music to showcase her muscular figure. She was then ready to enter her first bodybuilding competitions - and hasn't looked back. So far she has been runner up at the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association (NABBA) South East Qualifiers and sixth place at NABBA Britain. She aims to carry on doing well in these competitions so she can go on to represent England in international competitions such as Miss Universe. The body Rachel would hide away two years ago is now one she's proud of. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better,' she said.

Using software the ring is built in realistic 3D, and to enable shoppers to see and touch an example of the ring as it will look when finished they hold a large number of prototype rings in-store, made from low cost alloys and are finished with imitation stones. The groom-to-be is given a design pack to take away and present to their partner upon proposing, or a low-cost replica version of the ring made with Swarovski crystals instead of precious stones can be ordered. Personalised: Shoppers are invited to design their perfect ring using the 3D technology and they hold a large number of prototype rings which are made from low cost alloys and are finished with imitation stones to take a look at . Manu, 30, from Coventry, was inspired to create the company . when he wanted to design an engagement ring for his now wife, and found . the High Street options didn’t offer enough value for money and lacked . creative vision. Speaking about the technology he uses, Manu said: 'Most of our customers want to choose a ring based on a central stone type. We have a live database of actual gemstones that are available from our suppliers. 'Once you have selected your stone, our ring design experts will start designing your perfect ring. We will use the actual dimensions of the stone that you have selected. 'Throughout the design process you can see how the design decisions you make will affect the total cost so you can budget for what you want, with no nasty surprises at the end. Brains behind the brand: Manu was inspired to create the company when he wanted to design an engagement ring for his now wife, and found the High Street options didn't offer enough value for money and lacked creative vision . 'Once you have selected your gemstones for your ring, you have the freedom to customise every detail of the ring. 'Once you have created your final design, a full HD 3D photorealistic model will be shown to you as it would look on a hand.' Manu promises that if customers aren't satisfied after the consultation, they are under no obligation to buy the ring. He also warns that due to daily prices fluctuations in the value of precious metals and gem stone costs, the cost of a shopper's design may vary over time until they commit to purchase. Speaking about the innovative software, Manu said: 'The . designer is essentially the translator between the customer and the . software. It’s our job to translate the client’s vision of their perfect . ring into reality. 'When I was searching for my wife’s engagement ring, . the lack of control in the design process frustrated me, and I didn’t . want to sacrifice quality or design freedom which can be the case with . traditional design methods.' Manu set up the bespoke jewellery company in 2011, and this month he will be pitching his idea on BBC Two's Dragons’ Den. 'Dragons’ Den has helped to kick start great businesses such as Mydish.co.uk and Thermo Logistics. 'Appearing on the show was a once in a lifetime opportunity to follow in the footsteps of some admirable British Businesses. I was eager to meet The Dragons’, and show them how Hot Pink goes and above and beyond a traditional jewellers with its innovative business model.'","Manu Bhardwaj is former Ministry of Defence Mechanical Engineer .

By air and by land, the rescue of hundreds of Coloradoans stranded by epic mountain flooding was accelerating as food and water supplies ran low. Meanwhile, thousands more were driven from their homes on the plains as debris-filled rivers became muddy seas inundating towns and farms miles from the Rockies. For the first time since the harrowing mountain floods began Wednesday, Colorado got its first broad view of the devastation - and the reality of what is becoming a long-term disaster is setting in.

This news comes on the heels of slumping ratings for ‘Katie’ and buzz Ms Couric isn’t happy about her show’s slant towards celebrity gossip during its second season. Radiant: Ms Couric beams as she's asked about the news season of her show 'Katie' during an appearance on 'Good Morning America,' but rumor has it she wants out . With rating spiralling downward on her daytime talk show and ABC executives searching feverishly for a brand name to replace the iconic Ms Walters, Ms Couric would seem like a natural fit. ‘Katie may ultimately replace Barbara when she retires,’ a source told the paper. The former ‘Today’ host is looking for a way out of her namesake talk show after a format shift overseen by former ‘Tyra Banks Show’ executive producer Rachel Miskowiec, said the Daily News. Ms Walters announced in May that she would take a step back from her on-air duties at ‘The View,’ but plans to remain an executive producer of the morning talkfest. Hamming it up: Barbara Walters laughs during a recent episode of 'The View' The source told the Daily News that the timing would save Ms Couric the humiliation of having her show publicly cancelled as ratings continue to slide, and look more like she was Ms Walters’ heir apparent. ‘Execs are so concerned about publicly humiliating Katie by canceling her show in the middle of her second season that they want to put her on ‘The View’ this year to slide into Barbara’s chair,’ the source added. In a nod to her success at ‘Today,’ but her mediocre ratings while anchor of the ‘CBS Evening News,’ the source added that ‘The feeling across the board is that Katie is rejected by audiences when she is alone, but on a panel show she’s incredible, and even not liking her can work in the show’s favor and her favour.’ Producers have also been looking for a Latina woman to join the show’s panel, the source told the paper.

Flesh-eating bacteria survivor Aimee Copeland has shown off her bionic hands on the Katie Couric show a year since she lost her four limbs to the aggressive infection. The 25-year-old Georgia native revealed her astonishing on-going recovery on the show, eliciting cheers from the crowd as she walked on stage using new limbs and a cane for support. It comes a year since Aimee, who suffered her life-changing injuries when she cut her leg after falling from a zipline into a lake, appeared on the show for the first time with just one prosthetic leg and relying on a walking frame to cross the stage. Scroll down for video . Smiling: Aimee Copeland, who lost her limbs to a flesh-eating bacteria last year, appeared on Katie Couric's show . Fighter: Aimee walked across the stage using her new prosthetic limbs and just a cane for support . Speaking to Katie, she showed how her . new bionic hands - which open and close by her pushing her wrists . backwards and forwards - and said the new limbs and her new service dog . Belle have made every day tasks so much easier. 'It's a difficult process when you wake up in the morning and you realize this is my life,' she said, adding: 'I think I'm at the place now where I wake up and I'm like, ""yeah I'm at the same place I was at yesterday"".' Thanks to the new prosthetics, gadgets in her home and her unwavering upbeat attitude, Aimee is now able to put on makeup, brush her teeth, text, type for her social work degree and even drive. She said that she still has bad days but that she chooses to have a positive attitude. Even when she fell over in the shower in her New York hotel, she knew that she only had one option. Changes: She showed off the bionic hands which have helped her complete everyday tasks . Life-changing: She pushes her wrists forwards and backwards to close and open the fingers on her hands . Help: She showed that the new limbs can help her with tiny details - such as brushing makeup off her face . 'You can curl and and cry all day or you can smile over it or you can just scream real loud and just carry on doing what you're doing,' she said. 'So that's what I did.' Sitting among the audience, her father, Andy Copeland, said: 'She can make lemonade out of lemons better than anyone else I know.' Despite her inspiring appearance, Aimee expressed her doubts about going on the show in a blog on Katie Couric's website. 'When I was invited to come back to Katie this year, I really didn’t think I had come far enough to return,' she wrote. 'I didn’t want to come back until I had my left leg because I didn’t want to be in the same place I was last year. I wanted to show progress to everyone.' Making friends: She also introduced Katie to her new service dog, Belle, who helps her retrieve items . Moving on: Aimee can use the hands to help her type and text. She uses her iPad to switch on light and heat . Brave: Aimee, pictured at a physical therapy session, needed her limbs amputated after the flesh-eating bacteria got through a cut she sustained when falling off a zipline into a lake . The new normal: She is seen leaving her home with her new dog, who handlers say is bubbly like Aimee . But eventually, doctors deemed her skin on her left leg strong enough, she was fitted for the limb - and she realized she was ready to appear again. 'This year, I feel a lot stronger,' she said. 'Last year... I was so dependent on other people to help me with everything. Now I can do so many more things for myself. I feel independent.' She added: 'When I come back to Katie next year, I see myself walking onto the stage again, this time without a cane. I see myself practicing social work and actually taking on my own cases.' Aimee was injured on May 1 last year when she traveled down a homemade zipline that snapped, sending her into a lake on the Little Tallapoosa River near Carrollton. A cut on her left leg from rocks in the water became infected with necrotizing fasciitis, caused by a flesh-eating bacteria which is found in many fresh-water rivers. Support: Aimee is pictured with her parents, Andy and Donna Copeland, outside Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia last June. They described their astonishment at her positive attitude . Before the accident: Aimee poses with her parents and sister before the fall changed her life last year . As her organs shut down, her parents made the agonizing decision to amputate her limbs to save her life. She had to undergo several months of hospitalization and rehabilitation. Her bionic hands, which usually cost around $100,000 each, were given to her for free because she participated in a Georgia Tech research project about the limbs. She completed her master’s degree in psychology from University of West Georgia in August and will now work on a second master’s degree in social work at Valdosta State University to become a licensed counselor. While appearing on Katie Couric's show, a representative from Citi in Atlanta presented her with a check of $25,000 from the company to go towards a holistic center she wants to open. The center will give people with disabilities the opportunities to experience nature and garden while undergoing therapy.","Aimee Copeland, 25, needed multiple amputations after cutting her leg during a fall from a zipline in Georgia in May last year .

But the company hasn't said what new models, . if any, it will be launching, instead inviting journalists to a 'Special . Event', with the cryptic invitation 'Let's Talk iPhone'. The company remained typically tight-lipped about what the 'event' might launch - but it seems set to be epic. For . the first time, the event is being held at the company's Cupertino HQ in California - . at the famous address, 1, Infinite Loop, a geeky programming joke. Few . outsiders ever visit the complex - so even seeing the company on its . home turf is sure to ignite a media frenzy. Let's talk iPhone: The Apple invitation, with the date, the time and the location . Every previous event has been held at conference venues nearby. Apple . staff have been 'banned' from holidays in the first two weeks of . October in America, and tech insiders expect products from the launch to . appear in stores shortly after - probably on October 14. All the signs now point towards an early October launch for the gadgets. Tim Cook, chief operating officer of Apple Inc, is expected to launch the iPhone 5 on October 4. The event will be his first big product introduction . 'Having . seen first-hand how Apple packs its staff inside its stores for iPhone . launches does suggest that whatever new product they announce  is . imminent,' says Luke Peters, editor of T3. Tech insiders believe that any new iPad is far off in the distance, and that the current flurry of components, rumours and leaks refer inevitably to new models of iPhone. The idea that there are two models - one sporting the fast A5 processor inside iPad 2, and a cheaper model with lower-tech components, seems likely. Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month.' This seemed to confirm two rumours: one, that there would be more than one model, and two, that they would both appear late in October. Mr Gore's statements - at a conference in South Africa - also tied in closely with the most credible of the recent iPhone rumours. Al Gore, a board member of Apple Computer, seemed to give the biggest hint yet of what the tech giant had in store for us in October - referring to 'the new iPhones released next month' While the iPhone 5 is much anticipated, there is more at stake than usual.

QUESTION: For most of my  27-year . marriage I’ve enjoyed a tender and romantic sex life, but in the past . year my husband has changed. He barely approaches me, is far less . tactile and verbal and sometimes abandons lovemaking halfway through. I’ve tried to talk about it, but he shrugs me off. I feel distraught. How can we recapture our joy? After 27 loving and romantic years, her man has become distant and seems to have lost his sex drive . ANSWER: There’s nothing more distressing than finding the person you love best has become a stranger to you. There’s a temptation to think, 'Is it something I’ve done?', but in reality that’s rarely the case. The change is baffling precisely because some external agency is involved. Cynics might suggest another woman, but you would surely be aware if your husband was addicted to his phone and spending hours away from home? Typically, it’s the erotically unfulfilled who stray, while you say the pair of you have enjoyed a good sex life. My guess is that the problem is physiological or psychological —or a combination. If your husband has enjoyed an untroubled sex life into middle-age, the sudden onset of impaired libido would prove a huge shock to his sense of self. Numerous health issues from heart disease to diabetes can play havoc with desire and men’s ability to sustain an erection. Around half of men aged 40-70 will suffer from erectile dysfunction at some point and 80 per cent of cases stem from physical causes. The biggest clue is that your spouse abandons sex without achieving orgasm. That suggests a problem with male plumbing, because a man with a steady erection doesn’t tend to pull away. Two of the most common causes of a depleted libido are depression and stress, but a failing appetite for sex can, of itself, make one feel low. Has your spouse had anxieties in the past year? The most robust men can go off sex if their professional or financial security is threatened. Many men’s sexual vitality is index-linked to their sense of success; take that away and they wilt. Put it like this: no man who’s made a bad investment, or seen his company’s stock price plummet, will feel sexy. The more they bottle up the truth, the worse they feel — ashamed that their emotions and self-discipline have failed them, let alone their winning streak. The problem can be intensified by the fact most frequently prescribed antidepressants tend to suppress libido. For that reason I would check your husband’s medicine cabinet in case, unknown to you, he’s taking a drug that has personality-altering side-effects. Above all, you must ensure your husband goes to see his GP. Small changes, such as exercising and reducing alcohol intake, can have a big impact. If your husband is suffering impaired blood flow to the genitals this might be the first symptom something’s wrong with his heart (chest pains arrive later), so it’s crucial he has a full check-up. I would also talk to your husband’s family and friends to see if anyone else has noted changes.Your last line of resort is to make it clear how distressed you feel and how you can cope with anything — even a lack of lovemaking — if communication is restored. The key is not to put more pressure on your husband, while coaxing him into seeking a solution. It’s a delicate dance, but once you’re allies again, it’s a far shorter step to rekindling your lover’s flame.","I've enjoyed a romantic sex life for 27 years but things have changed .

A shocking image of a woman apparently pointing a handgun at a child's head has prompted concerns for the toddler's welfare. The photograph has been shared on social media hundreds of times since it first appeared online last month as worried web users desperately try to identify the pair in order to alert the authorities. However, the search has been hindered by the lack of information about the picture's origins. Shocking: This photograph shared on Facebook appears to show a woman pointing a gun at a child . The photograph shows a young woman smiling as she points what looks like a pistol directly between the eyes of a child aged around two years old. There are few details about when or where it was taken, but it seems to have appeared originally on an Argentinian Facebook page around a month ago, suggesting the people in it are Latin American. The image sparked panic when it was posted on blogs which campaign against domestic abuse. No Longer Victims shared the photo, saying: 'If there is anybody that can help us to find this child, please please do so.' The blog later added: 'A baby can be traumatised like anybody that is a victim of abuse - and this is a form of abuse.' Facebook users have reacted with outrage to the image, with some calling it 'downright evil'. It is not known whether the gun shown in the picture is in fact real, or whether it is a capgun or a prop weapon. However, many people have suggested that even if it is some sort of replica, it is nonetheless irresponsible to expose such a young child to gun violence.","Origins of image unknown but it is believed to come from Latin America .

Mr Wonderful: Hasnat Khan, the surgeon who stole Princess Diana's heart almost two decades ago pictured leaving his East London home yesterday . Walking out of his pebbledash house with his jacket over one arm, this man cuts a perfectly unremarkable figure. In fact, he is Hasnat Khan, the surgeon who stole Princess Diana’s heart almost two decades ago – and could have been her second husband. Nicknamed ‘Mr Wonderful’ by Diana, he was photographed yesterday ahead of the premiere tonight of a film which chronicles their two-year affair. Friends say Diana wanted to marry dashing heart surgeon Mr Khan. But their relationship ended in 1997, only a few weeks before her death. Now 54, Mr Khan lives in East London and is based at Basildon University Hospital in Essex. He was dressed casually as he left the house yesterday, in jeans and trainers, but was carrying a suit jacket. It was a mundane scene far removed from the dashing young heart surgeon of the film - and what might have been. Mr Khan has vowed he will never see the film, which he said was ‘completely wrong’ and based on ‘cruel lies’. After seeing a poster for the movie, called Diana, he said: ‘I could tell immediately those were never our mannerisms at all. 'You could just tell from that picture that it is all just presumed about how we would behave with each other, and they have got it completely wrong. ‘There wasn’t any hierarchy in our relationship. She wasn’t a princess and I wasn’t a doctor. ‘We were friends, and normal people stand like friends with each other.’ The film makers tried repeatedly to win Dr Khan’s cooperation and support for the movie, but he said: ‘I haven’t spoken to anyone involved in that movie. I have never given my approval for it.’ Then and now: Hasnat Khan pictured in 1996 during his affair with Diana, left, and yesterday in East London, right . Painful memories: Friends say that Diana wanted to marry the surgeon, but their relationship ended just weeks before she died in August 1997 . He said he could not imagine what the . film was based on, given that he had never told anyone, not even close . friends, details of his closeness to Diana. Mr Khan, who is single after an arranged marriage ended in divorce, made the comments in the Mail on Sunday. He added: ‘There are a hundred could-have-beens. ‘She [Diana] could be living very happily and married and having more kids, with me or with someone else. ‘It could have led in that direction. I try not to think about these things. I can’t change anything now.’ Screen version: Naomi Watts as Diana and Naveen Andrews as Hasnat Khan in the new film chronicling the pair's romance .

The Princess is shown deploying celebrity photographer Jason Fraser and using Dodi as a pawn to make the heart surgeon jealous.

The perfect recipe for love used to be eyes meeting across a crowded room followed by hours of scintillating conversation but now it seems that stimulating chats have been replaced by 140-character tweets. According to a new study, Twitter is now the most common way of winning over a potential new partner and has even overtaken texting and phone calls. On average, it now takes 224 tweets, 163 text messages, 70 Facebook messages, 37 emails and 30 phone calls to seal the deal. Virtual romance: Witty tweets have replaced love letters as the modern way to impress a potential date . And as a result of all the tweeting, texting and emailing, young couples now fall in love faster than ever before. The study, which was conducted by electronics retailer PIXmania, found that within the space of a single generation, the amount of time taken for love to blossom has more than halved. Couples aged 55 and over said on average their courting process took more than two and a half months (78 days) whereas for those under the age of 25 it takes just under one month (24 days) for them to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend. As a result, researchers believe that this could signals the end of the traditional 'three day rule' where would-be lovers wait for 72 hours before calling a date back. Instead, it's now closer to three hours, with two thirds saying they were happy to contact their new beau within four hours of their first date. You've got mail!

The study also found that less than one in ten of the nation’s couples still write old-fashioned love letters to each other. However, the number of couples willing to send saucy texts and explicit pictures to each other has increased, with more than a third of couples admitting to sexting. Over half of the people questioned by researchers also said they feel less inhibited when using . technology to chat up a date.

The Chancellor, pictured, will hail 'dramatic improvement in financial conditions' in recent months, in his most upbeat assessment of Britain's economic outlook since the election . Britain's economy is ‘turning a corner’ and making a sustained recovery from Labour’s ‘Great Recession’, George Osborne will say today. The Chancellor will hail ‘dramatic improvement in financial conditions’ in recent months, in his most upbeat assessment of Britain’s economic outlook since the election. In a speech to economists, he will say the recovery has ‘decisively ended’ debate over whether the country should heed Labour’s call to abandon spending cuts and switch to a ‘Plan B’. He will also dismiss warnings that the recovery is being driven by an unsustainable consumer boom. Signs of growth vindicate the Coalition’s decision to stick with its austerity programme – which still has years to run – despite intense pressure from Labour and left-wing economists to drop it. He will say: ‘The plan is working, but more years of hard decisions lie ahead. Our economy is turning a corner, but  we must not take anything  for granted.’ Taking aim at Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls and others who have called for a spending spree to boost growth, Mr Osborne will say: ‘Those in favour of Plan B have lost the argument.’ He will point out that Britain’s growth, now forecast to be the best in the developed world in the second half of this year, has happened at the same time as the programme of cuts. ‘Government spending cuts have continued as planned, and yet growth has accelerated and many of the leading economic indicators show activity rising faster than at any time since the 1990s,’ he will say. Mr Osborne will say that it was external factors, such as the eurozone crisis and soaring commodity prices, which had held back growth since the election, rather than the programme of austerity. He is also expected to pledge that all sections of society, and all parts of the country, will benefit from the recovery. His bullish tone reflects growing . confidence the economy is on course for a sustained recovery in the . run-up to the next election. In the three months to June, it grew by 0.6 . per cent – double the figure in the previous three months, and the . respected OECD think-tank last week upgraded its 2013 growth forecast . for the UK from 0.8 per cent to 1.5 per cent. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had wanted a spending spree to boost growth . One . senior Government source said the UK was now out of the ‘European . bucket’, with growth prospects comparable to those of the US. The Chancellor will say there is evidence of a ‘broad-based and sustainable recovery’, with business surveys suggesting all sectors of the economy are enjoying growth, and that only half of the growth this year was driven by consumer spending. But he will warn: ‘More tough choices will be required after the next election to find many billions of further savings, and anyone who thinks those decisions can be ducked is not fit for government.’ But Ed Miliband will use his speech to the Trades Union Congress tomorrow to say: ‘Living standards have been falling for longer than at any time since 1870. Only the privileged few are feeling better off. ‘This is an unfair recovery. This is an unequal recovery. And an unequal recovery won’t be a stable recovery.’","Osborne's most upbeat assessment of Britain’s economic outlook since the election .

The past year has been a whirlwind for Shelley Gilbert. But ask her the best thing about becoming Daily Mail Inspirational Woman Of The Year 2012 and she will tell you about one little girl. Like many of the children Shelley works with, the eight-year-old had lost both her parents and was living with her aunt. And, like too many adults in this difficult position, the girl's aunt had long refused any official help and support. That was until the girl brought her aunt's attention to an article in this newspaper about Shelley and her ground-breaking charity Grief Encounter, which helps counsel families, and especially children, to cope with bereavement. Shelley recalls: 'She was able to . persuade her aunt to contact us and we have been helping them for . several months. I'm pleased to report they have come on in leaps and . bounds. Not only does the little girl leave our workshops with a smile . on her face, her aunt has benefitted from being with others in a similar . position. 'If . it hadn’t been for the attention the Mail brought us, they would be . suffering in silence, perhaps drowning in pent-up grief.' Even better, this was just one of hundreds of families who contacted the charity after last year's award. Visits to Grief Encounter’s website rose from 500 to 2,500 a month. They now have 30 counsellors, 100 volunteers, ten paid part-timers and this week gained their first paid full-time employee. In February, they moved to a new office in Finchley, North London, which has a drop-in centre. Worthy winner: Shelley Gilbert is presented with her award by Darcey Bussell. She said the accolade has helped her charity reach even more people . Fundraising has rocketed, too - they made £100,000 more than usual last year, which Shelley attributes to her Inspirational Woman award. 'The more people who hear our message,' says Shelley, 50, 'the closer we get to my goal: a time when my charity isn't needed. 'What we try to do, in essence, is to encourage people to talk about the death of a loved one, rather than attempt to bury the pain.' Somewhere in Britain, a child loses a parent every 30 minutes. Thousands more lose a sibling each year. Shelley says children can be brushed aside when tragedy strikes: 'We adults mistakenly assume they do not feel or understand their loss as acutely as adults do.' She speaks from personal experience - she lost her mother to breast cancer when she was four. Five years later, her father died of a heart attack. Shelley explains: 'In those days people thought they were protecting me by not talking about it - each time it was days before I was even told of the death. Understanding: At last year's awards, Shelley met Samantha Cameron, who knows all about the support bereaved families need after losing son, Ivan . 'I found myself orphaned, adrift in a world that refused to discuss grief or let me in on the deaths that had changed my whole life.' Shelley was adopted by her uncle and aunt and got 'three ready-made older brothers'. She went on to have a happy childhood, but the tragedy still haunted her. It was this which propelled her into the 'helping professions'. 'Getting the award was such a shock. Suddenly, we had been given a badge of trust, credence' While looking after her own four . children - ranging in age from 16 to their late 20s - with businessman . husband Michael, she trained as a psychotherapist. In . 2003, Shelley published a book, also called Grief Encounter, to help . families discuss death, and was deluged by requests for more guidance . and support. She launched her charity in 2004 from her North London . home. Over the years, she . set up a helpline, an interactive website, arranged counselling, . workshops, family remembrance days and residential camps. 'We present a bereaved family with a . menu of choices,' she explains. 'They can have one-to-one therapy . sessions, join in group sessions or both.' The . charity has attracted support from celebrities such as BBC presenter . Gabby Logan, who lost her brother as a child, and singer Katherine . Jenkins, whose father died when she was 15. Big . Brother star Jade Goody was also in contact before she died: 'We still . care for her boys, and their dad Jeff Brazier champions our cause.' Support: The Wells, whose daughter Holly was murdered by Ian Huntley, are one of the many families Grief Encounter have helped . But it was Kevin and Nicola Wells, whose ten-year-old daughter Holly was murdered in Soham in 2002 by school caretaker Ian Huntley, who nominated Shelley for our award. She says: 'They got to know us because I sent Kevin my book. He has since said he wept tears of relief when we taught him it was OK to grieve for Holly for the rest of his life.' The Wells's son Oliver was 12 when Holly was killed and they feared he would be left traumatised. The Wells's were one of the first families Shelley helped, telling them it is fine to grieve and that they didn't need to pretend it hadn't happened. Kevin went on to become a patron of the charity. Shelley says she didn't think 'for a moment' that she'd win the Inspirational Woman Award. Last November, she met Samantha . Cameron at Downing Street with four other nominees before a star-studded . ceremony hosted by the Mail at the Marriott Hotel in London's Grosvenor . Square. She says: 'We felt like film stars at the Oscars. I was impressed by how much time the Prime Minister's wife spent with us. 'Suffering . is a bridge without words: we didn't need to speak about specifics to . know we understood each other. After all, she lost her own son [Ivan, . who suffered from cerebral palsy and died aged six] not so long ago.' At the ceremony, Strictly Come Dancing's Craig Revel Horwood announced Shelley the winner. 'It was such a shock,' says Shelley. 'Suddenly, we had been given a badge of trust, credence.' Following her award, people contacted the charity in droves, asking for help and volunteering. And . in the past few months, the charity has secured grants from the . National Lottery, Lloyds TSB and Children In Need. This has enabled them . to launch a Skype service, allowing people to be counselled over the . internet. But the most rewarding achievement of . all? 'Being asked to speak at my children's old primary school,' she . says. 'Children have so many questions, such as: ""Why won't Mummy come . back? If God loved her so much, why won't he let her back?"" In need: Jade Goody contacted the charity before her untimely death to ask them to support her two sons . 'We are committed to speaking honestly about death - age appropriately, of course.' As for the children's feedback, Shelley says: 'Sometimes it's the way they look me in the eye, a shy smile when they leave or a little hand suddenly slipped into mine. These unspoken signs of gratitude are the best reward.' But she insists it's not all doom and gloom - the charity helps children to have fun again after the death of a loved one. Shelley says: 'It's our job to show them it's fine to play; it isn't wrong for them to enjoy themselves.' Shelley gives the example of a three-year-old girl called Carly. 'I just want to make sure today's bereaved children don't suffer the pain and confusion I did' 'She was clinging to her mum, sobbing when I met her,' she says. 'She had lost her father. Her mother felt she was a bad parent because she couldn't heal her daughter's pain.' Thanks to Shelley's reassurance - and the chance to meet others in a similar position - Carly's mother is better able to cope and Carly is happier. Shelley stresses that the positive side of death is it teaches us to cherish every moment. 'Life isn't a dress rehearsal,' she says, with infectious enthusiasm. 'Get out there and live every minute!' Shelley has won several awards, but says the Daily Mail's Inspirational Woman Of The Year is her most prized. 'It is a clear milestone in my life,' she says. 'Next stop? The Palace! I'd love Prince Harry on board.' Next March, the charity celebrates its tenth anniversary. 'It seems incredible for someone whose parents' death taught her to fear the future,' says Shelley. 'When the worst happens to you when you’re a child, you learn to dread what's around the corner. Mum or Dad went away and never came back. Now, in the light of our success, I can look forward with pride.' Despite the sadness in her own childhood, this humblingly determined woman declares she's the luckiest person in the world. 'Not only do I have a wonderfully close family, I get to help others every day,' she explains. 'I just want to make sure today's bereaved children don't suffer the pain and confusion I did.'

"By . Ruth Styles . PUBLISHED: . 12:40 EST, 11 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 11 September 2013 . A woman who thought she had met her perfect man online has issued a stark warning to other lonely hearts after losing more than £1,000 to an online con artist. And in a cruel twist, when Lori Martorana, 41, from London, confronted the man, he replied with an email saying how much he was enjoying spending her money. 'I don’t consider myself naïve and I . never thought something like this would happen to me so it’s important . that I let other women know even though it’s embarrassing to admit,' said Lori. Duped: Lori Martorana (above) was conned by a man who used this stolen photo of a real soldier to woo her . 'We’d been . talking for months and exchanged hundreds of emails before cash was . mentioned and by that time my guard was down. If he’d asked immediately I . would have known.' The scam began after office manager Lori joined dating website Love2Meet and spent £79 on a profile on the site. After a month, she was contacted by a man purporting to be Michael Kolb, an officer serving with the US Army in Afghanistan. His picture showed a handsome man in Army fatigues. Initially though, Lori was unimpressed. 'I liked his photograph but there didn’t seem much point because he lived the other side of the world,' she said. 'I replied to his message out of politeness and we soon got chatting.’ But despite her initial reluctance, 'Michael', who described himself as a 45-year-old widower with grown-up children, swiftly started to become an important part of Lori's life. 'The more we talked the more I liked him,' she admits. 'We exchanged private email addresses and soon we were in contact every day.' Devastated: Lori has decided to make her story public in the hopes that no one else will fall for a similar scam . Sometimes Michael had to go offline urgently, but as he was serving in a war zone, it appeared to make sense to the besotted Lori. 'We grew closer the more we got to know each other. The distance seemed less of an issue because he was due to retire anyway.' After eight weeks, Michael told Lori he had strong feelings for her and she admitted she felt the same. Then, when he told her he had some leave coming up and wanted to travel to the UK to meet her in person, she agreed and says she was 'thrilled' that she would at last meet her online match. 'He wasn’t pushy, he just said it would be nice to spend time together and get to know each other properly,' said Lori, adding: 'I was thrilled.' But her joy wasn't to last. Before he could travel to the UK, said Michael, his superior officers would need to know more about her for 'security reasons'. Unsuspecting, Lori agreed, and when a few days later an email asking for personal and contact information arrived, she had no reason to think it wasn't from a fellow officer as claimed. Convincing: Along with stolen photos of serving soldiers, the conman also sent shots like this one . Apology: 'Michael' even apologised for the intrusion before asking Lori to hand over more than £1000 . Michael even wrote to apologise for the intrusion and assured her it would be worth it once his leave was granted. Then, out of the blue, she received an email saying the trip would only be approved if she paid a security deposit of £1150 to guarantee his return. 'I was surprised to say the least but Michael said it was common in the US Army to stop soldiers going AWOL,' said Lori. According to Michael, Lori would have the cash returned when he rejoined his unit in Afghanistan. She agreed to make an online transfer to the account details he provided and began preparing happily for his visit. 'I was so excited to meet him and started getting ready for his visit,' she adds. Then, another email arrived. Only, it didn't, as expected, contain details of his visit. Instead, it was a demand for a further £400. 'This time the alarm bells rang straight away,' says Lori. 'I started thinking about all the information and cash I had already sent.' Panicking, Lori called her bank but found it was too late to stop the transfer. 'They told me to go to the police,' she says. 'As I gave the police officer my statement I felt such a fool. Swiftly, Michael's story began to unravel. He was not, as he had claimed a member of the US Army. In fact, he didn't exist at all. The police revealed that photos, supposedly of himself, that he’d sent to Lori had been stolen and that the man in the pictures had been a victim of identity theft. 'I asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money.' Astonishingly, the conman replied, saying: 'yes thanks'. The loving emails had been crafted by a scammer interested in nothing more than her cash. Distraught, Lori emailed the dating site but as his profile had already been removed and his membership terminated there was nothing they could do. She continued to email 'Michael' in the vague hope of uncovering information that might help police return her money but all she got was requests for more. Eventually, she snapped. 'I emailed him telling him I knew the truth, that he was nothing more than a con artist,' she said. 'I asked him if he was enjoying spending my hard earned money.' Astonishingly, the conman replied, saying: 'yes thanks.' Lori was furious. 'I couldn’t believe the cheek of it,' she says. 'I was devastated and angry beyond words. He was taunting me.' 'I never ever thought something like this could happen to me and I still can’t believe I was so stupid. 'I’m ashamed and embarrassed but I don’t think I am the first or the last to fall for this so I want to warn other women who think they are talking to soldiers. 'They may not have asked for cash yet, it may take several months like it did with me. If you can’t meet them they might not be real. I fell for a man that didn’t even exist. That hurts just as much as the money.' She added: 'If speaking out stops one more women being conned it’s worth it.' Asked to comment, dating agency Love2Meet said: 'Scams are something we take very seriously. Our moderation team works 24/7 to ensure our members are safe from scammers. 'Occasionally, one may slip through the net. We would like to apologise to Lori for any distress or upset this may have caused.'","Lori Martorana, 41, from London, was tricked out of more than £1,000 .

Twitter has been valued at up to £10billion just seven years after it  was launched. The micro-blogging site, which has amassed 200million users, is to be floated on the stock market in what was last night described by a leading broker as ‘the most hotly anticipated stock offering since Facebook’. Appropriately, the US firm broke the news in a 135-character tweet, explaining it had submitted its flotation application this week to the Wall Street watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission. Jack Dorsey founded Twitter in 2006 when he was 29 years old. He now serves as chairman . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey (right) attended the Allen & Company Sun Valley tech conference in July with girlfriend Kate Greer . The website has become a cultural touchstone used by celebrities and politicians to keep in touch with the public. It was launched in 2006 by programmer Jack Dorsey and web entrepreneur Evan Williams in California. The . pair were joined by designer Biz Stone who gave the site its . distinctive look. All three are in line for multi-million-pound payouts . if the float, which is expected late this year or early in 2014, . succeeds. This is the first ever tweet sent by creator and co-founder Jack Dorsey on March 21, 2006 . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey . (right with New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg) has told CBS's '60 Minutes' that . he wants to run for mayor in the future . Christopher Issac 'Biz' Stone, co-founder of Twitter and his wife Livia Stone, left, and Evan Williams and his wife Sarah, right, are to increase their wealth through the floatation . The move is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major social networking sites to go public. Evan Williams . Age: 41 . Net worth: $1 - $2billion . Potential worth: $8billion . CNN Money estimated that he has a 30 to 35 per cent share in the company. His firms have also founded Blogger and Medium.

He is a certified masseur and lives in San Francisco. Role: Executive chairman at Twitter, CEO at Square . Biz Stone . Age: 39 . Net worth: Thought to be around $200million .

Role: Co-inventor and co-founder of Twitter, CEO of Jelly Industries . It comes after Facebook floated on the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion (£66.2 billion) and, despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence. It is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 2,000 investors. Although the IPO was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions, naturally, with a tweet last night. The confidentiality should help Twitter avoid the media scrutiny that surrounded Facebook's decision to float. The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation. But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue. Under the law, Twitter's financial statements and other sensitive information contained in the IPO filing must become publicly available at least 21 days before company's executives begin traveling around the country to meet with potential investors - a process known as a 'road show'. The decision to float the company is likely to see the company's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone stand to gain huge financial windfalls. The site was founded in March 2006 but has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years. Dorsey introduced the world to the site by sending out the first ever tweet which read: 'Just setting up my twttr'. The 36-year-old is also the founder and CEO . of Square, a mobile payments company. He is reportedly living in a $10 . million home in San Francisco and dating his longtime girlfriend, Kate . Greer. Dorsey's interest in programming . began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He . came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz . Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software . startup Odeo. Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company. Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures. Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase threefold. Biz Stone's wealth could jump from $200million to $2billion, while Evan Williams, thought to be the richest of the three, could see his personal fortune jump from $2billion to $8billion. Biz Stone is one of Twitter's three co-founders. He is pictured here in 2012 at at Canon's Imaginat10n Lab. He has also helped create Medium and Blogger . Twitter co-founder Evan Williams was Dorsey's boss when Dorsey came to him with the idea for Twitter . Others . that stand to gain from Twitter going public include early investors . Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Spark Capital, as well . as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, Ron . Conway and Naval Ravikant. The . company delivered the news of its planned IPO Thursday in a tweet sent out at 5 p.m. The tweet read, . 'We've confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.' That tweet was followed up by a second post: 'Now, back to work.' Bloomberg reports that Goldman Sachs is expected to be the lead underwriter of the offering. Twitter had been working to boost ad revenue in . preparation for the move. It  recently acquired MoPub, a mobile advertising company that has a $100 . million annual revenue run rate, and in July, the company hired a number . of people with IPO experience. Rowghani Ali, COO of Twitter, is pictured. Twitter has filed paperwork in its first step toward an initial public offering of stock .

But a new device is set to take on the Kindle by offering similar features. One of the main reasons people also buy a Kindle is . because of its e-ink display - its low-power meaning it lasts much . longer than a phone, and its anti-glare screen means it can be read in . bright light. Now, a new phone case with a flexible e-ink display adds a second screen to . an iPhone 5 or 5S - doing away with the need for both gadgets. Scroll down for video . popSLATE's creators believe their case is an alternative for an eReader thanks to its anti-glare e-ink screen that can be read in bright sunlight. But they also point out that it also has features that a Kindle does not . The . screen can be used to read books in bright sunlight, but it also . connects to and 'mirrors' the phone's main screen - showing . notifications, photos or anything else that the main screen can show. The Popslate screen also uses less battery than the phone's display, too, and because it is . called 'always on', which means it doesn't timeout, it is a simpler and . more energy-efficient way to watch videos, for example. The clever case, which is available to pre-order via the company's website costs $129 (£81), or $149 (£94) when shipped to the UK. The company says its case 'enables bookworms to forgo carrying a Kindle' because text can be displayed on the back of their iPhone. Pages are turned by double-tapping the case, which contains a 'tactile interface' controlled by the handset's accelerometer. Just like Amazon's e-reader, the Popslate case only uses power when the text or images changes and the e-ink screen is anti-glare and can be read in direct sunlight. The company claims the case can be used as an energy-saving measure so users can see urgent notifications, maps, notes or their calender without having to constantly turn their iPhone on and off, which can be useful if a handset is almost out of battery. Always On: The screen can display virtually anything and because it uses e-ink technology, it can be kept for long periods of time without using much energy . When they first started out, Greg Moon and Yasha Behzadi wanted their product to be able to add some creative edge to the ubiquitous iPhone. They originally built it simply as a way to display pictures and give iPhone users a way to personalise their phones. But after testing, they worked out that they could do a lot more with the case and decided to add more practical features. But what makes this product so practical is that it uses e-ink technology, which only requires minimal power to stay on. The phone case, which turns the back of an iPhone into a second screen, is avauilable to pre-order in two colours for $129 and its creators said an iPad version might be released in the future . So while notifications on the main iPhone screen will disappear after minutes, those on the Popslate will not, which makes the second screen more useful for lengthy tasks. The device is designed to be user-friendly and mimic the iPhone's features, as well as getting its power from the iPhone without having to charge it separately. Popslate partnered with Plastic Logic, experts in flexible display technology, to make the 'shatterproof' second screen. It uses Plastic Logic's OTFT (organic thin film transistor) backplane display technology and the screen is called electrophoretic because it moves fluid around an electric field. The designers are now looking into making a larger version of Popslate for the iPad as well as whether a dedicated reading app can be developed for the case to make full use of its e-ink screen. The case itself is 'ruggedised' so as well as being an extra screen, the company claims it is 'nearly indestructable' and still protects the phone. The phone used crowd-funding website IndieGoGo to raise $219,417; exceeding its goal of $150,000.","Popslate's phone case adds a second screen to the back of a phone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:40 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:52 EST, 13 September 2013 . A semiautomatic rifle that mimics the rapid fire of a machine gun is about to hit the shelves. The SFS BFR, made by Texas company, Slide Fire, is fed bullets from a belt, which gives it the potential to have thousands of rounds of ammunition. The weapon will be available this autumn and will sell for $6,000, according to Brandon Renner, the sales and marketing manager for Slide Fire. He said the gun ‘sprays like a fire hose’. ‘We recommend no more than 30 rounds on the belt, but one person could make it as big as they want.’ Scroll down for video... Approved: The new bump stock rifle which fires like a machine gun has been deemed as legal by The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives . Ready, aim... fire! The rifle fires multiple rounds like a machine gun . Spray like a hose: The bullet casings fly out of the weapon as it's fired . The recoil: The part of the gun that makes it all happen - the new rifle is fitted with this smart piece that allows the gun to shoot multiple bullets at a time . Automatic weapons, such as machine guns, are heavily restricted at a federal level for the general public by the National Firearms Act of . 1934 and the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986. Automatic firearms also include short-barreled shotguns and short-barreled rifles. A machine gun can normally fire between 400 and 1,000 bullets per minute, or between 7 and 17 rounds per second. But the manufacturers of the SFS, also called a ‘bump gun’, found a loop hole. Of the pieces that make up a gun, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) only regulates the ‘receiver’. It is the only piece that has a serial number and the only one that requires a background check to purchase. Slide Fire's technology uses the recoil of the rifle shot to ‘bump’ the gun, speeding up the rate of fire without changing the gun's classification as a semiautomatic. To be classified as a semiautomatic, the gun is only allowed to fire one round each time the trigger is pulled. Multiple bullets: Just like this machine gun, the bump gun can fire thousands of rounds from a belt . Semiautomatic: A normal assault rifle (pictured) does not have the bump stock 'recoil' part that moves back and forth to fire the bullets faster . In a video advertisement for the gun, the company states that this type of 'slide stock' technology gives people the ability to 'bump fire more safely' offering 'another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere'. According to the company, the 'muscular application of force to create forward movement of the firearm defines the will of the shooter to discharge each individual round of ammunition. ‘Each discharge requires a separate decision by the operator to move the firearm back to a firing condition,’ says the ad. And so, the gun is technically legal. In a 2010 letter posted on Slide Fire's website, the ATF wrote: ‘We find that the 'bump-stock' is a firearm part and is not regulated as firearm under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms act.’ ATF spokesman, Christopher Amon, told CNNMoney.com: ‘I can confirm that ATF did approve the device referenced in the letter and that the Slide Fire is legal.’ Slide Fire, based in Moran, Texas, already sells bump-stocks for $370 that speed up the rate of fire for semiautomatics. The company also sells semiautomatic rifles that have already been accessorised for bump-fire, costing between $1,150 to $1,950. But these guns use magazines, not belts, and thus have limited ammo capacity. A spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, one of the largest gun sellers in America, said the company does not sell Slide Fire products, and will not be offering the belt-fed rifle. Machine guns: Automatic assault rifles can fire up to 1,000 rounds a minute just by holding the trigger . Reborn: Slide Fire's new gun has been called 'a poor man's machine gun' by weapons shop owners . James Hill, owner of the Abilene Indoor Gun Range, located about 50 miles away from Slide Fire's headquarters, told CNNMoney.com that the company's bump-fire accessories are quite popular with his customers. But Hill, who referred to the Slide Fire products as ‘a poor man's machine gun’, doesn't plan to sell the belt-fed gun, because he doesn't believe there will be much of a demand for it. He said the Slide Fire rifle is a bit more challenging to fire than a fully automatic weapon. ‘It's not as easy [as full auto], but it's fairly idiot proof,’ he said. It has been unlawful since 1934, under The National Firearms Act, for civilians to own machine guns without special permission from the US Treasury Department. Since . the Firearms Owners' Protection Act of May 19, 1986, ownership of newly . manufactured machine guns has been prohibited to civilians.","The SFS BFR 'bump gun' is fed bullets from a belt and can fire thousands of rounds at a time .

The Centre Court crowd erupted with a roar never before heard as the Serbian plunged a groundstroke into the net to give Murray the victory. But he had thoroughly earned it. He . threw off his hat, screamed in joy, and pumped his fists in the . direction of his team up in the stands and he scaled the steps to hug . each of them in turn. There were tears from him and his mother Judy. It may have been straight sets but . there was drama at the finale. Of course there was.

Championship points to get the job done but that will not matter a jot. Serving for the match, he raced a . 40-0 lead and stood on the precipice of history ground-breaking enough . to shake Centre Court to its core. But Djokovic, never one to give up . easily, ensured the wait would go on a little longer, saving all three . Championship points, then doing the unthinkable and holding three break . points. But Murray only increased his athleticism, his determination, his guts, to turn it around and show he was the better player.

It was excruciating. But what are a few extra minutes when you’ve been waiting 77 years? The opening told how the match would take shape with plenty of break points and long rallies from the outset. There was ebb and flow too. Murray won the first three points only for Djokovic to take the next five. At 1-1, the third game provided a vignette of the quality, excitement, and gripping tension that would follow. It took beyond 10 minutes and had epic rallies lasting 24 and 25 shots. At the end of it Murray was celebrating, finally breaking his advisory for the first time at the seventh time of asking.

Djokovic broke straight back in the . next game, but, at 3-3 on the Serb’s serve Murray’s defensive qualities . shone through. He took it, then secured a vital, tense service game to . lead 5-3. Minutes later he had the all-important first set. The second saw more gruelling groundstroke duels before Djokovic, as expected, upped his game to break in the fourth game. But with Murray at the peak of his . abilities – full of running and incredible reaches – it never felt like . that would prove definitive and indeed it proved as he broke back in the . seventh. Djokovic showed an unusual lack of composure in handing the . game to Murray with a double fault. Errant challenges were also becoming a . feature, and at 5-5 on his serve, Djokovic would come to rue the . incorrect calls to Hawk-Eye. At 15-15 he felt a ball from Murray fell . long but he had lost the ability to challenge. After losing the point he . was evidently upset, asking umpire Mohamed Lahyani: ‘You can’t see . this?’ Magical: Murary celebrates another point on the way to winning the coveted title . On target: Murray was in sensational form as he claimed the Wimbledon title against the world No 1 Djokovic . It turned out he was wrong anyway and . the ball clipped the line but Djokovic was rattled. The score . progressed to 30-40 and a shot into the net gave Murray an important . break. He served it out, laying down an ace . to take the second set and a 2-0 lead. It was so important. Not since . Henri Cochet in 1927 had a player come back from two sets down to win a . men’s final. That bit of history was too much to change. Murray was on a roll, breaking . Djokovic in the first game of the third set and then taking another to . make it five games in a row. But, once more, Djokovic surged, breaking Murray twice to claim four in a row in response. Yet again the momentum swung, however, and this time decisively in Murray’s favour. With lung-busting sprint after . lung-busting sprint, he first got level to 4-4, then took the score in . the penultimate game to 40-15 in his favour with a trademark forehand . down the line on the run. The game was sealed and the rest is (new) history. Vocal support: Tennis fans swamped Murray Mound to cheer their hero on at the All England Club .

"By . Francesca Infante . PUBLISHED: . 06:48 EST, 10 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 10 September 2013 . A drunken single mother who killed two football fans in a car crash after taking a cocktail of lager and cocaine has been jailed for four years. Terri-Ann Harrington, 27, was twice the legal limit for driving when she lost control of her silver Renault Clio and crashed into a garden. Her two passengers Stoke City fans Martin Wilson, 26, and 20-year old James Morgan who were friends of Harrington were killed instantly in the impact. Victims: Harrington's former partner Martin Wilson, left, and friend James Morgan were killed instantly when the car veered off the road and overturned . Party girl: Terri-Ann Harrington has a string of previous convictions for drug and theft offences and had already been told by a judge that she risked an early death if she didn't change her ways . But despite being responsible for the accident Harrington, who has a five year old daughter, left the bodies of two men in the wreckage and staggered off down the road. She was found lying unconscious in the road a short time afterwards near a pub. Tests later showed she had both cocaine and opiates in her system. It also emerged that at the time the crash occurred Harrington, from Bentilee, near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, had already been warned by judges she faced an 'early death' to her regular misuse of Class A narcotics including heroin. Stoke Crown Court was told on the evening before the crash last November she went for a family meal before visiting several pubs with ex-partner Mr Wilson and his friend Mr Morgan. She had then driven them to a friend’s home, and then onto James’s mother’s house. The car was travelling through the Lightwood area of Stoke in the early hours when it veered out of control and overturned landing in a residential garden. Harrington told police she had drunk just three halves of lager, and claimed to have hit a patch of black ice on the road. But blood tests revealed she would probably have had a blood alcohol content of 183-microgrammes of alcohol per 100-millilitres of blood at the time of the crash - more than twice the legal limit. Crash investigators found the road would not have been icy, and no mechanical defects were found in Harrington’s Renault. Harrington, who has a string of previous convictions for burglary and theft, later carried out a series of thefts in the weeks after the crash - including a shoplifting expedition on the day of her two victim’s funerals. She pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving whilst under the influence, was banned from driving for two years and ordered to take a retest. Jailing her Judge David Fletcher forced her to confront the horror of her actions that night. He said: 'You walked away. Let’s face it, you walked away leaving your friends dead.' Devastation: Friends and family left tributes to the men at the scene where the Renault crashed into a residential garden in Stoke-on-Trent . Harrington's lawyer Peter McCartney said the his client could not recall why she lost control of her car. He said: 'She has struggled to come to terms with the deaths of her friends, and the guilt of being responsible for it. She continually has nightmares where she goes back to what happened. 'Miss Harrington has a daughter who turned six last Saturday. She knows she is going to prison, while her daughter is not.' The four year jail term will be consecutive to a 15-month sentence imposed on Harrington in January for a series of offences carried out in the weeks after the crash including handling stolen goods, theft, possession of cannabis, criminal damage, having a bladed article and three charges of failing to surrender to bail. 'Polite and likeable': Family paid tribute to James Morgan, right, pictured with Martin Wilson, left, . Guilty: Harrington's lawyer said she had 'struggled' to come to terms with the death of her friends but could not remember how she lost control of the car . In 2008 she was given drug rehabilitation treatment following previous offences including the burglary of a vicarage. At the time another judge warned her: 'It is a very narrow window of opportunity for you. 'If you go back to your old ways, effectively that will be the end of your life. If you get back into drugs you will have an early death.' In statement at the time of the crash Stephen Bell, Mr Morgan's former deputy headteacher at Painsley Catholic College said: 'James was a pleasant and popular member of the school. 'He was always polite and was very likeable. He worked hard and the other students thought a great deal of him, as did the staff.' His older sister, Sara Morgan, added: 'James truly was amazing and influenced so many people’s lives. He was my little brother and I loved him.' Mr Wilson's uncle Andrew Milton paid tribute to his nephew saying: 'Martin was loved by many, we will all miss him. I still can’t believe it.'","Terri-Ann Harrington initially claimed that ice on the road had caused the accident .

Just over a year ago, Lauretta Johnnie, 46, was so overweight at 27st, she couldn't walk without the aid of a stick. Today, she's Britain's unlikeliest personal trainer. Although she's still a size 24-26, she's on a mission to get the fuller figured out of their armchairs and into the gym. Her fledgling business, Full Figured Fitness, is aimed at larger ladies and although she says anyone of any size is welcome, the exercises are tailored to the overweight. Good example: Lauretta (right) shows off her moves in front of a class of eager students . Improvement: Lauretta's classes are tailored to fuller-figured gym goers and have proved hugely popular . She said there was a gap in the fitness market for the Fuller Figured Fitness method because there are currently no other classes 'designed for fat people'. She said overweight people may struggle to do some of the moves in a traditional workout because of their body shape and mobility. She explains: 'If you do something like a grapevine, some of the movements . are really difficult because they have fat between their legs and they . just can't keep up. 'When they first come in, I can see them walking how I used to walk and they lack a full range of movement.' Loretta's own route to fitness started more than a decade ago when she qualified as a fitness instructor. But an unhealthy diet led to her piling on the pounds and eventually, she was so overweight she was told that she would need a gastric band. Even after the band had been fitted, . her weight continued to yo-yo because, as she puts it, 'you can eat . anything, really. Even unhealthy stuff like chocolate.' Lauretta said people are sometimes surprised to see someone of her size leading a class but she points out that you don't always have to be slim to be fit . 'My weight went up and down,' she . explains. 'I needed to do more than diet. Something just had to change. I . needed to get off my butt really.' Her . eureka moment came when she decided to give up her role as a community . development officer and pursue a business idea that had first struck her . a decade before - fitness for the fuller figured. A . chance conversation at the local job centre led to a small amount of . funding being made available and she launched her first fitness class at . the Fit Rooms in Fulham in November last year. 'I get all sizes coming to my class . because not everybody wants to be slim, some people want to be fit and they aren't always associated' The . first class attracted 27 people and triggered a flood of positive . feedback. As her reputation grew, Lauretta was asked to run more classes . and will soon launch a regular class at Bar Rhumba in central London. Much . to her surprise, not all of the interest has been from larger ladies, . although as she explains, some people just want to be fit, not thin. 'I get all sizes coming to my class . because not everybody wants to be slim, some people want to be fit and they aren't always associated,' she explains. All welcome: The class is open to all shapes and sizes . 'People who come range from ""I need a chair to exercise"" to . others who are probably fitter than me! I've had people who are size 30 and 32 but I've have people who are a size 8 too. 'The . classes are a good step up . into exercise and good way of warming up major muscle groups, building . up your core but also a great way to feel more positive [about . yourself]. 'Exercise is . integral for tackling obesity. It burns calories, gives you endorphins . and it acts like a platform that improvements for people's lives spirals . from. 'It changes . people's lives and it's doable. We don't do star jumps and we warm them . up and cool them down properly so they come back saying they feel . better.' It hasn't been entirely plain sailing though, as Loretta explains: 'Some . people are shocked and you can see them thinking ""are you an . instructor?"" and looking me up and down. But most really enjoy it.' Obesity . is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges facing the NHS, with a . staggering 62 per cent of British people now overweight or obese . according to figures released by the Department of Health. Worse still, the department has forecast that the cost of treating obesity will rise to a staggering £6.2bn a year by 2015. Not right: According to Lauretta, traditional fitness classes aren't always suitable for bigger women . But despite the overwhelming scale of the problem, treating the condition still focuses on diet and bariatric surgery such as gastric bands. So why not exercise? 'It's very important to put together good healthy eating and making positive exercise choices,' says Loretta when asked whether the NHS needs to do more to get fuller figured patients moving. 'I . think a lot of big people think ""oh I don't like going to the gym"" but they just haven't tried it. I get . loads of inquiries and then people don't come. I think they sit on it and ponder for a . while. 'I do get people who come and find the class just isn't for them but some who do drop out have other issues. 'I . think a lot of big people think ""oh I don't like going to the gym"" but they just haven't tried it' 'Some . people who are big are going through drama or depressed and don't come . back because of that,' she continues. 'It's about encouraging them to make a positive choice.' At the moment, Loretta is focused on making sure that her Bar Rhumba class is a success but she's got big plans for the future and thinks gyms and other fitness businesses need to to more to become more fuller-figure friendly. 'We need institutional and personal change so classes like Full Figured Fitness can filter onto the high street,' she explains. 'I know this might take a while but in the meantime, I want to try and change as many lives as possible. 'Thousands have been spent on these . [health] conferences and its not about everyone philosophising. Let's just do . something and get people dancing and feeling better!' And of course, she's looking forward to living life to the full now she's no longer hampered by being overweight. 'I used to get tired walking down the road,' she adds. 'Now I can run for the bus without being out of breath.'

Aundra Akins, pictured here in 1997 aged 18, faces a further 40 years behind bars on top of his 27 year sentence . A man who murdered a Briton in a botched robbery 20 years ago in Florida has had 40 years added to his prison sentence. Aundra Akins, who was just 14 when he gunned down holidaymaker Gary Colley in 1993, was imprisoned for 27 years in four years later - the maximum sentence he could receive as a juvenile. But today Akins appeared back in court where Judge Karen Gievers added 40 years onto his existing sentence. The 34-year-old was told there was no hope of parole. A court official at Jefferson County Court said: 'Aundra Akins was sentenced to 40 years to run consecutively to his previous sentence of 27 years for the murder of Gary Colley.' Margaret Jagger, Mr Colley's girlfriend at the time, was also injured in the incident. She travelled back to Montecito in Florida for yesterday's  hearing. Speaking before the case, she told local news outlet WCTV: 'I didn't think I would have to come back again. 'Both he and I have served time in different ways. My sentence will never end.' Ms Jagger said Akins needs to show he can stay out of trouble, it was reported. Akins reportedly told the judge today that at the time he did not comprehend the magnitude of what happened, but said he does now. His mother was reported to have appeared at the hearing, and in asking the judge to release her son, she said: 'I understand what he did was wrong. I know he won't be no trouble to nobody.' Akins' brother, cousin and uncle also testified, according to reports. Gary Colley (pictured) from West Yorkshire was murdered by Akins in 1993 on a motorway near Tallahassee in Flordida . Now the same age as his victim was when he died, the murderer who acted as part of a gang in 1993 pleaded for forgiveness. Akins pointed to his attainment of a GED qualification, trade certificates and his attendance of a Christrian retreat as proof of his changed ways. He said: 'I'm not the kid I was before. I am a grown man and I really want to make a difference and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me,' but was refused the chance by Judge Gievers. Remarkably, yesterday's developments took place on the eve of the tragedy's 20th anniversary. Speaking of the landmark date, Ms Jagger from Bradford said: 'It's a big coincidence that this happened on this day, so it's very strange. It's 20 years tomorrow that Gary died. So it's pretty emotional'. Mr Colley, Wilsden, West . Yorkshire and Mrs Jagger were reportedly threatened on . their way to Tampa in 1993 by a gang of youths, of which Akins was one. The number of incidents that year prompted the Foreign Office to issue a warning to Britons thinking of . travelling to the Florida, guidance which has since been lifted.","Aundra Akins murdered Gary Colley from West Yorkshire in 1993 .

U.S. scientists are working on an 'invisibility cloak' for mosquito-plagued people, pets and livestock. The researchers have discovered substances that occur naturally on human skin and block mosquitoes' ability to smell and target their victims. Scientists believe the research could be another step in the fight to stamp out deadly diseases such as malaria, which kills approximately one million people around the world every year. U.S. scientists are working on an 'invisibility cloak' for mosquito-plagued people, pets and livestock. The researchers have discovered substances that occur naturally on human skin and block mosquitoes' ability to smell and target their victims . Speaking at the National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, research chemist Ulrich Bernier said that far from being a nuisance, mosquitoes are more deadly to humans than any other animal. In the U.S. alone, mosquitoes spread rare types of encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain as well as transmitting heart worms to pet dogs and cats. Dr Bernier said: 'Repellents have been the mainstay for preventing mosquito bites.' The most widely used repellant, DEET, is quite effective and has been in use for a long time but some people don't like the feel or the smell of the repellant, he said. 'We are exploring a different approach, with substances that impair the mosquito's sense of smell. If a mosquito can't sense that dinner is ready, there will be no buzzing, no landing and no bite,' he explained.

Scientists believe their research could be another step in the fight to stamp out malaria, which kills approximately one million people around the world every year . Female mosquitoes, which suck blood to obtain a protein needed to produce fertile eggs, can smell people from over 100 feet away. A person's scent, Dr Bernier explained, comes from hundreds of compounds on the skin, many emitted through sweat and others produced by bacteria. To identify which of these attract mosquitoes, Bernier and colleagues at the Mosquito and Fly Unit at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service Centre for . Medical, Agricultural, and Veterinary Entomology in Florida, used a special mosquito cage divided by a screen. They sprayed various substances into one side of the cage and documented the effects in attracting mosquitoes. Some compounds, like lactic acid - a common component of human sweat - were definite mosquito lures, drawing 90 per cent of the mosquitoes to the screen. With other compounds, however, many of the mosquitoes didn't even take flight or seemed confused. Dr Bernier said: 'If you put your hand in a cage of mosquitoes where we have released some of these inhibitors, almost all just sit on the back wall and don't even recognise that the hand is in there. Female mosquitoes (pictured), which suck blood to obtain a protein needed to produce fertile eggs, can smell people from over 100 feet away. A person's scent, Dr Bernier explained, comes from hundreds of compounds on the skin, many emitted through sweat and others produced by bacteria . We call that anosmia or hyposmia; the inability to sense smells or a reduced ability to sense smells.' He said that a group of chemical compounds, including 1-methylpiperzine, block mosquitoes' sense of smell. This may help explain why mosquitoes fly toward some people but not others. The substances have a molecular architecture found in ingredients in dozens of medicines and other products and they appear suitable for use in cosmetics, lotions, clothing and other products that currently incorporate mosquito repellants, he said. The Mosquito and Fly Unit has been doing research on mosquito . repellents since the 1940s. In . the 1990s, it accumulated information on substances secreted through . the human skin or formed by bacteria on the skin that make some people . more attractive to mosquitoes than others.","U.S. researchers have discovered substances that occur naturally on human skin and block mosquitoes' ability to smell their victims .

Air pollution created by the Industrial revolution could be responsible for the retreat of glaciers in the Alps, scientists claim. Austrian researchers believe the reason for the end of the 'Little Ice Age' in around 1850 could be down to the large amounts of soot being spewed out by Europe's growing factories and steam engines. This activity could explain why glaciers in the Alps began to melt and retreat before the accepted beginning of 'global warming,' they said. Soot from glaciers on the Monte Rosa massif in the Alps (pictured) explain why glaciers began to retreat in the mid-nineteenth century, according to Austrian scientists. They reason that darker surfaces absorb more heat, so if enough soot fell onto snow and ice it would have accelerated melting . There are around 4,000 Alpine glaciers of various sizes that are currently under threat from warming temperatures. During the Little Ice Age, which stretched from the beginning of the 14th Century to around 1850, glaciers thrived in the cool climate and in the mid 19th Century were almost twice as large as they are now, Nature reported. As Europe became increasingly industrialised the Alpine glaciers suddenly began to retreat but interestingly, average global temperatures did not rise noticeably until the end of the century, causing scientists to look for an explanation why. Alpine climate records, which are considered to be some of the most reliable in the world, suggest that the bodies of ice should have continued to thrive until around 1910, according to University of Innsbruck research that was published in journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1. Georg Kaser from the university, said: 'Something gnawed on the glaciers that climate records don’t capture.' Austrian researchers believe the reason for the end of the 'Little Ice Age' in around 1850 could be down to the large amounts of soot being spewed out by Europe's factories and steam engines that settled on glaciers . A sharp drop in the amount of snowfall during winter has previously been blamed for the decline of the glaciers, but the scientist thinks soot is the reason. He decided to investigate whether soot particles from the burning of coal could explain the decline of the glaciers, after discussing the mystery with Thomas Painter, a snow hydrologist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California two years ago. Professor Kaser believes that if soot fell onto the snow and ice of the glaciers, it would have caused them to melt faster as darker surfaces absorb more heat. His theory is strengthened by historical records that say the air in some Alpine valleys was polluted in the mid 19th Century and 'housewives in Innsbruck refrained from drying laundry outdoors' presumably because soot would dirty the clothes. Scientists had ruled out a prevalence of soot in the area as a reason for hastening melting glaciers as they thought it would not have been carried high enough to reach the glaciers in large enough quantities. Dr Kaser's industrial theory is strengthened by historical records that say the air in some Alpine valleys was polluted in the mid 19th Century and 'housewives in Innsbruck (pictured) refrained from drying laundry outdoors' presumably because soot would dirty the clothes . However, Professor Kaiser's team found that in 1860 layers of glacial ice contained large amounts of soot when they looked at ice cores from the Colle Gnifetti glacier at 4,455 metres above sea level the Fiescherhorn Glacier at 3,900 metres in the Bernese Alps. They calculated the effect the soot would have had on the glaciers using a simplified mass-balance model, to discover the effect of soot explained the glacier retreat. Andreas Vieli, a glaciologist at the University of Zurich who was not involved in the study, told Nature the modelling could not be more refined and the 'study offers a very elegant and . plausible explanation for the glacier conundrum. It appears that in . central Europe soot prematurely stopped the Little Ice Age.' Professor Kaser said global warming only became the primary reason for the retreat of glaciers after 1970 when air quality began to improve. He warned that if the glaciers continue to melt at the same rate as the past 30 years, they could disappear by the close of the century.","Austrian Scientists believe industrial activity could explain why Alpine glaciers began to melt before the accepted beginning of global warming .

A giant lizard that ruled the prehistoric seas up to 85 million years ago, killing anything in its path, was a skilled hunter as deadly as a shark, Swedish scientists have said. At a time when T-Rex roamed the land, the Prognathodon was the top predator underwater, using its tail fin to propel itself at speed and grab prey ranging from turtles to sharks. The terrifying creatures could grow up to 17 metres long, weigh as much as 20 tonnes and would have spent most of the day swimming near the seabed stalking their next meal from the cover of seaweed and rocks. A giant lizard that ruled the seas 85 million years ago was as deadly as a shark, Swedish scientists have said. The Prognathodon used its tail fin to propel itself at speed and grab prey ranging from turtles to sharks. A fossil, skeleton diagram and illustration of the creature is pictured . Being caught in the jaws of a Prognathodon meant almost certain death, although the lizards were still vulnerable to attack themselves, with one fossil bearing the marks of a shark bite in its spine. The latest and best specimen was dug up from rocks in central Jordan, with part of its soft tissue preserved, including the perfect outlines of its tail fin and flippers. A member of the mosasaur family, the marine reptile discovered measured just five feet long and was a juvenile when it died. It would have ended up six times its size had it lived. Although early members of the genus possessed body shapes similar to today’s monitor lizards, their bodies have traditionally been portrayed as long, sleek animals with broad tapered tails. This led to the idea that they were slow swimmers but the new fossil described in Nature Communications has a crescent-shaped tail fin similar to whales and extinct marine reptiles called ichthyosaurs that resembled dolphins. The latest and best specimen was dug up from rocks in central Jordan, with part of its soft tissue preserved, including the perfect outlines of its tail fin and flippers, which indicates the lizard was a highly efficient swimmer . Comparing the fossil to modern sharks led scientists to the conclusion mosasaurs were very good swimmers and their highly specialised tail evolved independently in several groups that occupied similar environments. Dr Johan Lindgren, of Lund University in Sweden, said they were similar swimmers to sharks, 'a finding that significantly expands our understanding of the level of aquatic adaptation achieved by these seagoing lizards.' He described the skeleton, which is complete save for the head and part of the tail, as 'extraordinary'. Dr Lindgren said: 'The bones are generally in a pristine condition and retain their original three-dimensional shape, although some skeletal elements were fractured or lost during the excavation of the fossil; the latter are now represented by natural moulds. 'In addition, plant rootlets have penetrated and partially dissolved a string of vertebrae near the end of the tail. 'The exposed elements of the pectoral . girdle and rib cage are somewhat disturbed and the latter structure has . suffered slight crushing; otherwise, the skeleton is in nearly perfect . articulation, preserving, for example, a virtually complete, . hydrofoil-like forelimb surrounded by skin impressions.' The terrifying creatures could grow up to 17 metres long, weigh as much as 20 tonnes and would have spent most of the day swimming near the seabed stalking their next meal from the cover of seaweed and rocks . Mosasaurs breathed air, were powerful swimmers and were so well adapted to living in the warm, shallow seas prevalent during the Late Cretaceous period that they gave birth to live young, rather than return to the shore to lay eggs. Dr Lindgren said: 'The findings in the present study on Prognathodon, along with recent previous work on the streamlined body shape, keeled scales and modified limbs provide compelling evidence derived mosasaurs were hydrodynamically advanced animals capable of high efficiency swimming. 'Moreover, the emerging evidence suggests aquatic adaptations evolved relatively quickly within the group, that is, within less than 10 million years.'","Archaeologists have discovered an 'extraordinary' skeleton of a Prognathodon in central Jordan with part of its soft tissue preserved .

Most people think of a simple round bowl filled with eggs up in a tree when they think of a bird's nest, but not all are the same. Photographer Sharon Beals set out to catalog these works of art for her book Nests. Calling birds 'nature's most fastidious architects,' Ms Beals wanted to share her fascination with structures created 'in all shapes and sizes using a variety of materials. 'There are those that build with mud, burrow tunnels, weave hanging pendulous baskets or cups onto branches, stitch leaves, stack sticks, or glue with saliva. Some just make simple scrapes on the ground, or fill cavities with fur and bones, and others that camouflage their nests with lichen, spiderweb, or moss,' Beals wrote in her book. The nests featured in the book are parts of permanent collections at the California Academy of Sciences, the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at UC Berkeley, and the Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology. Many of the nests pictured were collected prior to 1950, some are over 100-years-old. Nest collecting was made illegal in the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, signed into law in 1918. Several of the photos are also on display now through May 2014 at the National Academy of Sciences, in Washington, D.C. All captions and further descriptions are courtesy of Ms Beals. Verdin (Auriparus flaviceps): Collected from Sierra La Mojina, State of Chihuahua, Mexico, 1961 . The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology . The only North American member of the penduline-tit family (Remizidae), these tiny insectivores survive bitter winters and searing summers in the arid forests, scrub lands, and deserts of the American Southwest and Mexico . They manage this year-round residency by building small thorny domes for both breeding and roosting. Fledglings as young as three months construct their own nests, and in a year a Verdin may build a dozen solo shelters. African Palm Swift (Cypsiurus parvus): Collected from Morondera, Mashonaland East Province, Zimbabwe, 1973 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . African Palm Swifts live in sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Arabia, and Madagascar. Using their sticky saliva, they bond a shallow platform of soft feathers and plant down to the under side of a downward hanging palm leaf. If palms are unavailable, they adopt other trees, or even man-made structures. When the female produces an egg, she carefully lowers it into the nest platform and glues it in place with saliva. Both members of a pair incubate the eggs, pressing them tightly against the nest, trading shifts carefully. Akekee (Loxops caeruleirostris): Collected from Kokee State Park, Kauai, Hawaii, 1970 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . This cup of moss and lichen was built by a pair of Akekee in the crown of an Ohi?a Lehua tree. The last 4,000 of these small finches are found in the high rainforests of Kauai. Living above 1,800 feet, these survivors have escaped the mosquito-borne avian pox and malaria that have decimated so many other Hawaiian birds since the 1800s when European trading ships emptied their bilges on the island. Grazing and feral animals have also destroyed their habitats. Of 113 endemic species, 71 have been lost. Of the 42 left, Akekee are one of the 32 listed as endangered. Altamira Oriole (Icterus gularis): Collected from Morazón, State of El Progreso, Guatemala, 2001 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . Relatives of blackbirds and meadowlarks, Altimira Orioles can be found from the Rio Grande to Nicaragua, living in year-round territories as life-long pairs. It can take the female a month to weave a pendulous nest, which is entered from the top, with a nesting chamber at the bottom. In Texas, Altamira Orioles are considered a threatened species due to the loss of the native trees of the Rio Grande to agriculture and to flood control. Brown Booby )Sula leucogaster brewsteri): Collected from San Jorge Bay, Georges Island, State of Sonora, Mexico, 1925 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . Brown Boobies breed on the islands and atolls of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and the Caribbean Sea. The only species of ground-nesting Booby that regularly builds a nest, its ritualized construction plays a role in the bonding and breeding partnership. Made of almost anything available, from grass, sticks, and seaweed, to refuse and plastic, it often includes bones and the bodies of dead Sooty Tern chicks. The male, head and neck stretched high, presents a piece to the female, who accepts with the same posture. They both work these offerings into the nest with quivering heads, soft grunts and calls. Bullocks Oriole (Icterus bullockii): . Collected from Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York, 2003 . The Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates . These colorful songbirds breed in woodlands in western North America?especially insect-rich land bordering water, filled with cottonwood, sycamore, and willow trees. Most migrate to Mexico for the winter. Usually the female weaves the hanging nest, but her mate may help, the pair working in tandem, one on the inside, the other out. Horse hair, twine, fibers, grasses, and wool form the outer shell, which is lined with cottonwood or willow cotton, wool, or feathers. The blue fibers wrapping this nest are the plastic threads of a construction tarp. Caspian Tern (Hydroprogne caspia): . Collected from Scammons Lagoon, Shell Island, Baja California, Mexico, 1932 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . Found on every continent except Antarctica, Caspian Terns breed near coastal estuaries and lagoons, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers that offer small- to medium-sized fish, the major food source for these diving birds. They often return to their former nesting grounds, which might be species-specific colonies, or ones mixed with other species of terns, as well as gulls, plovers, cormorants, stilts, pelicans, and skimmers. Nest construction is rudimentary, with both sexes scraping a shallow depression in the ground, adding rocks, shells, sticks, seaweed, and other plant material, and relying on the color of their eggs to camouflage them in the open. Cuban Emerald (Chlorostilbon ricordii): Collected from Andros Island, Bahamas, West Indies, 1988 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . These winged jewels are common in Cuba and the Bahamas, with a few found in Florida. Like all hummingbirds, nest building and care of the young is the responsibility of the female. They attach their nests to supporting forks of a branch in a shrub or vine, frequently in a young coffee plant. Their well-hidden two-inch cups are made of silky plant fibers and moss bound with spider web, with long trailing grasses and strips of plant bark that disguise its shape, and bits of lichen and bark attached to its exterior. Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor): . Collected from Tatoosh Island, Callam County, Washington, 1995 . The Cornell University Museum of Vertebrates . These iridescent aerialists nest in cavities of older trees and snags, often those created by woodpeckers. Goose feathers insulate this loose cup of grass and twigs found in one of these natural nesting sites, which have been disappearing over the past 200 years. They will readily occupy nest boxes as substitutes if they are placed near sources of insects, the mainstay of their diet. Two Brown Creeper Nests (Certhia americana zelotes): . Left: Collected from Spanaway, Pierce County, Washington, 1926 . Right: Collected from Echo Summit, Mono County, California, 1942 . The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology . Disguised as a piece of moving bark, Brown Creepers circumnavigate tree trunks, consuming a wide variety of insects and bugs. The female builds the nest under a flap of bark or in a cavity of a dead or dying tree, or in the excavations of woodpeckers, squirrel drays, even crevices in manmade structures. A foundation of twigs, bark, and woodchips bound with spider web and cocoons attached at a couple of anchor points supports a layer of wood fibers, leaf fragments, hair, feathers, grasses, lichens, or moss. Golden-hooded Tanager (Tangara larvata): Collected from Helechales, East of Fiala, Puntarenas Province, Costa Rica, 1972 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . Striking Central and South American members of the Cardinal family, a mated pair shapes a simple, sturdy cup of plant fibers and leaves, often lining it with the black threads of horsehair fungus. It is well hidden, usually in a tree fork or the leaves of a branch. They also adopt other protective sites: the fronds of banana plants, cavities in trees, abandoned hanging oropendola nests, and rarely, the cavity of a scavenged honeycomb. They are insectivores, but they also eat fruit; by dispersing the seeds, they regenerate forests and, in turn, their own food supplies. Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus): Collected from Big Basin State Park, Santa Cruz County, California, 1974 . The California Academy of Sciences . Discovered in 1974, this slice of a limb of a Douglas Fir holds the first nest of a Marbled Murrelet to be found in North America, providing important clues about the nesting habits of these small birds. They fly 25 miles or more inland to nest in trees 200 to 2,000 years old, with limbs wide enough for both a landing pad and a nesting platform. The nest is a mere depression in the moss or leaf litter. The parents share the care of their young, trading shifts before dawn, and fledglings make their first journey to the sea alone. Marbled Murrelets are disappearing along with the old growth forests that are home to these ancient trees. Social Flycatcher (Myiozetetes similis): Collected from East of Durán, Guayas Province, Ecuador, 1991 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . Egret feathers camouflage this grassy dome shaped nest built by a female Social Flycatcher. Recent immigrants to the Rio Grande Valley, their range extends to Paraguay. They attach their nests to bushes, trees, vines, and dead branches, and often over water on tree snags and pilings. They also adopt abandoned houses, bridges, signposts, utility poles, and even railroad trestles. Spotted Nightingale-thrush (Catharus dryas harrisoni): Collected from Cerro Baul, State of Oaxaca, Mexico, 1968 . The Western Foundation of Vertebrate Zoology . With large eyes ringed in orange, yellow-spotted chests, and orange legs and feet, Spotted Nightingale-thrushes are a striking member of the genus of Catharus thrushes. In spite of these markings, they can be extremely hard to find, staying hidden in the understory of the forests of the Central American highlands and the Andes, where they feed terrestrially and nest year-round. The female builds the nest using moss, lichen, and leaves, binding them with rootlets and grasses to form a deep, thick-walled cup, often woven onto a supporting vertical branch, with trailing foliage to disguise its shape.","Pictures were taken by photographer Sharon Beals for her book Nests .

Technology used to understand distant planets has helped reconstruct two ornate Tudor tombs that were destroyed during King Henry VIII's anti-Catholic offensive. The tombs were commissioned by Thomas Howard, the third Duke of Norfolk, in the 16th century for Thetford Priory in Norfolk and when the priory was dissolved in 1540, some parts of the tombs were salvaged while others were abandoned in the ruins until they were excavated in the 1930s.

Americans are known for their love of coffee - whether it's pricey single-origin beans brewed with a siphon or the watered-down version sold in Greek cups from the corner deli, coffee is a morning tradition. But according to a story published yesterday in Ad Age, tea may be catching up to coffee as America's new favorite drink. Consumer market research by the NPD group shows that the tea industry is experiencing a moment of staggering growth. Tea time: Sales figures indicate that tea is becoming more popular in the U.S., leading many retailers to invest in expanding tea options . Over the past six years, tea sales have gone up 58 per cent, from $2.4 billion to $3.8 billion wholesale.Growing five per cent in the past year, tea is now the fourth fastest growing beverage category according to Beverage Marketing Corp. Tea party: Starbucks currently sells Tazo tea through a deal with Pepsi Co., but recently also bought tea chain Teavana . Tea's increasing popularity means it's growing at a faster rate than coffee. While coffee consumption increased 1.9 per cent between 2003 and 2013, tea consumption by the average American increased 22.5 per cent - and it's expected to rise another 3 per cent in the next five years according to IBISWorld. 'The tea industry is going straight up, and at some point, it will reach the level of coffee,' David DeCandia, master tea blender at Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, told the Los Angeles Times. 'It's time. People have maxed out on other types of beverage.' And with domestic tea sales raking in $15.7 billion last year according to Packaged Facts, retailers are quickly catching on. Specialty retailers like Starbucks and Caribou Coffee, as well as fast food chains, are developing new tea drinks to cash in on the trend. Starbucks, which has been selling Tazo teas through a deal with Pepsi Co., recently bought tea store Teavana for $620 million. Starbucks plans to grow the chain from 300 stores to 1,000. 'We now intend to do for tea what we have done for coffee,' Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz said in a recent conference call. The new coffee: Starbucks recently bought retail tea chain Teavana, and aims to expand the business to 1,000 stores, from the current 300 . To push tea sales more, Starbucks will be offering a new Shaken Peach Green Tea Lemonade this summer, while Teavana will roll-out six different iced tea drinks. Super size tea: McDonald's is just one of many fast food chains creating a variety of iced teas in response to tea's increased popularity in the U.S. Following the leader, Caribou Coffee launched a line of sparkling teas and juices last summer, and recently launched a lighter version of it's Green Tea Lemonade this month. Iced tea is one of the fastest growing types of teas, with 7.7 per cent of tea flavors named 'sweet' in 2012 - up from 3.6 per cent in 2010, according to Technomic's 2012 Beverage Trend Report. This opens a huge market for fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's and Sonic, who have all have iced teas they plan on rolling out for the summer. But while tea may be growing fast, it still has a ways to go if it wants to outpace coffee. According to figures from IBISWorld, tea currently accounts for $987 million in revenue at the wholesale level, which is just a tenth of the $9.6 million coffee industry.","Domestic tea sales are up 32% since 2007, and is expected to reach $18 billion in the next two years .

The Humane Society of Missouri is offering $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person who viciously burned a pit bull last month, resulting in the dog's death. The pooch named Zeus was discovered August 27 with horrific third-degree burns to 75 per cent of his head and 30 per cent of his body in St Louis. His left front paw was scorched to the degree that there was no padding left. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Heartbreaking crime: A 3-year-old pit bull named Zeus was brought to a veterinary clinic last month with horrific burns to most of his body . WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT The pooch had nearly his entire face scorched, and also suffered burns to his left side and scrotum; his left front paw (right) was left with nearly no padding . The 3-year-old pet's injuries were so severe and his suffering so great that veterinarians were forced to euthanize him. Initially, the Humane Society put up a $2,500 reward to help catch the culprit behind the animal abuse. The reward now has been doubled to $5,000, according to the station KSDK. ‘We believe there are people who know what happened to Zeus,’ said Mike Perkins, director, Humane Society of Missouri Animal Cruelty Task Force. Tragic outcome: The extent of Zeus' injuries was such that he had to be euthanized to spare him further suffering . Beloved pet: Zeus was adopted as a puppy by a St Louis man who entrusted him with a friend last month while he was moving to another place . Devastated owner: A St Louis man identified as Benjamin (pictured) adopted Zeus as a puppy and took good care of him, but had to temporarily entrust him with a friend while moving to another house . Zeus belonged to a man identified on a Facebook page dedicated to the pet as Benjamin, who adopted him as a puppy from a serviceman stationed in Alaska. Hunt: The Humane Society of Missouri initially put up a $2,500 reward to help catch the culprit behind the animal abuse, but the reward has since been doubled . Last month, the owner was in the process of moving to another home and asked a friend to look after his pet. But on August 26, the 3-year-old pup vanished from the yard of the residence in north St Louis where he had been staying. Zeus' caretaker called the Humane Society to report the pooch missing, The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The next day, he received a call from a neighbor who found Zeus severely burned in his yard near the intersection of Amelia Avenue and Bircher Boulevard. The beloved pit bull suffered gruesome injuries to his head, left hip, left leg and scrotum after someone had doused him with gasoline and set him alight. Zeus was rushed to a veterinarian, but the animal could not be saved. The 3-year-old pet had to be put down to spare him further suffering. The medic who treated Zeus and eventually euthanized him said that prior to the tragedy, the pooch appeared to be in good health.","Three-year-old male pit bull named Zeus was discovered torched in St Louis, Missouri, on August 27 .

The Zumba instructor in Maine who admitted to being prostitute had sex with as many as five different men per day and took only 15 minute breaks in between each one. Text messages revealed that the former fitness instructor-turned-prostitute Alexis Wright would not meet with her clients unless her business partner, a 57-year-old man who lived 100 miles away, was watching the trysts in real time via Skype. The messages between Wright and insurance agent Mark Strong Sr. were obtained Tuesday through a records request by the Portland Press Herald. They were shared with the jury but kept from the public by the judge during the trial, and have only been released today. Busy: Text messages that prostitute Alexis Wright sent allege that she had sex with up to five men per day . On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy . The communications included spreadsheets Wright used to keep track of her clients, with names, dates, times, sex acts and payments. Messages from February 9, 2012, show how busy Wright was having sex with men for money, with as little as 15 minutes between encounters, the newspaper reported. 'I had sex with Larry, Pete and Paul on Thursday,' she writes. 'And Michael, Pete, Pat, Jason and Mike today. ‘Wow. Two days, ten clients.’ Wright pleaded guilty last month to 20 counts including prostitution for using her studio in Kennebunk, a village known more for its sea captains' homes and beaches than for crime, as a front for prostitution. Strong was convicted of 13 counts relating to the promotion of prostitution. Video and testimony during Strong's trial indicated Wright's trysts were captured by a hidden video camera in a sophisticated operation featuring meticulous ledgers and calendars and the use of license plates to identify clients. Explicit: Prosecutors played a video of Alexis Wright, 30, stripping off and teasing construction workers across the street from her exercise studio . For all to see: The video played for jurors shows Wright stripping out of her towel while standing in the window of her Pure Vida Zumba exercise studio in downtown Kennebunk, Maine . Strong, who has acknowledged having an affair with Wright, monitored the sex acts from his office. In one text, Wright wrote: ‘I love you Mark :-)’. Only texts sent by Wright were released, and none that Strong may have sent to her in response. Video recordings that were aired during the trial show Wright approaching the camera and checking that it was hidden under a pile of lingerie before each client came into the studio. On January 25, 2012, she sent a string of texts to Strong when a client was due to arrive but she would not meet with him until she know that Strong was watching via Skype. 'You must have gotten tied up somewhere. I can't reach you and Jared is already in the area. I won't see a client without your permission and viewing so I'll wait to hear from you I guess,' Wright wrote in a text. Admission of guilt: Zumba instructor Alexis Wright appears with her attorney, Sarah Churchill, to plead guilty to 20 counts, including prostitution, theft and tax evasion . Putting on a show: Dressed to the nines and sporting heavy makeup and bright manicure, Wright quietly answered 'guilty' 20 times when the judge read the counts . 'I can see him sitting across the street. 'I'm sure he can see my car but if he knocks, I won't answer unless you're in your office. :-(' 'Jared is sitting across the street waiting to hear from me. I'll wait until 1:30 but I'm assuming that you're not heading into the office,' she wrote at 1.13pm. The Kennebunk prostitution scandal attracted international attention in the fall after it was reported that Wright's ledgers indicated she had more than 150 clients and made $150,000 over 18 months. Authorities then set the town abuzz with word that they would be charging each of the johns, leading residents to wonder who they were. 'He's weird. He doesn't like things that feel good. He likes to be tortured,' Wright wrote of one unidentified client. Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex . 'To each his own I guess, but there is something about him that is very strange.' The scores of people charged with engaging Wright's services include a former mayor, a high school hockey coach, a minister, a lawyer and a firefighter. Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, pleaded guilty under an agreement that calls for 10 months in jail. Her sentencing is set for next month. Strong, 57, served 15 days in jail and was released this month. His defense lawyers had characterized him as being infatuated with a younger woman and making bad moral decisions but never profiting from the prostitution operation.","Alexis Wright, 30, plead guilty to charges of prostitution .

Headteachers have said parents should spend less time on the phone to make their children know their views are important . Parents should stop checking their mobiles and listen to their children when they are talking to them, headteachers said yesterday. They said it is vital that mothers and fathers are not distracted by phones and computers and that they spend time talking and listening to their children so that they know their views are important. Bernadette Hunter, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘It’s easy for everyone, even parents, to be distracted by the immediacy of electronic communications. ‘We understand the pressure and temptation to respond straight away but it’s important that parents spend time speaking and listening with their children.’ The advice comes in a leaflet published by the NAHT and the Family Action charity, aimed at helping parents to develop their child’s speaking and listening. It advises: ‘Give your child your attention: Don’t check your mobile phone at the same time as they are talking to you.’‘Switch off television and laptops well before bedtime. Chat or read a bedtime story together instead.’ Other advice includes being patient and not interrupting children, to ask questions, discuss the day, and to try to have a family meal together. And it suggests that parents praise their child for listening to them and following instructions, while those mothers and fathers who do not have English as their first language should make sure they speak their native tongue ‘confidently and well’. David Holmes, chief executive of Family Action, said: ‘We all know how easy it is to be distracted by our mobiles when with our children. That’s part of modern life. ‘But this leaflet is a reminder to  parents about the importance of  making time to listen actively to our children. We all need to do this so that children in turn learn to speak and listen well.’ The leaflet is the second published by the two organisations. The first called for parents to give their children ‘lots of hugs’, play games and ensure youngsters get enough sleep. They also urged families to eat  dinner together and make time for homework, reading and talking.","National Association of Head Teachers said parents should stop checking their phones when talking to children .

Sentenced: Ed Bagley was finally sentenced Wednesday for holding a mentally disabled woman captive as a sex slave he drugged and abused for six years starting when she was sixteen years old . A Missouri man who imprisoned a young woman in his trailer for six years was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years in a federal prison. Edward Bagley agreed to a plea offer from the prosecution in January that, while sparing his victim the ordeal of reliving her torment publicly, also allowed Bagley to maneuver around outright admitting he’d kept the woman captive for years. He pleaded guilty to just one count of using an interstate facility to entice a minor into illegal sexual conduct, a crime he first committed when the woman was just a girl of 16. ‘Even though Ed pleaded guilty, he still hasn't told the truth,’ the woman said in court, reading from a statement. Bagley, 46, and his wife, Marilyn, recruited the woman to live with them in their rural Lebanon, Missouri trailer in late 2002 and groomed her to become Bagley's sex slave. The Bagleys have insisted he didn't have sex with her until she turned 18 and that the often-extreme sex acts were consensual, but prosecutors believe it started years before that and was forced on the woman. The woman even claimed she was coerced into appearing on the cover of a sex bondage-themed magazine called Taboo. ‘I had no idea he was going to make it an every-single-night thing,’ the victim said in court as she gave her statement. ‘It started bad and got worse and worse.’ She described how the Bagleys initially showed her images and videos of people practicing bondage, dominance, sadism and masochism — or BDSM — and told her it was fun. She signed a contract on her 18th birthday that Bagley said made her his sex slave for life. The girl allegedly suffered water-boarding, electric shock, piercing and mutilation, according to the Kansas City Star. Four other men have been charged for allegedly paying Bagley to have sex with his 'slave' and to watch webcam sessions of her being tortured. Horror house: This trailer was the unnamed mentally disabled woman's prison for six years. It sits alone on an isolated hill six miles outside the town of Lebanon, Missouri . Marylin Bagley pleaded guilty to helping her husband hold the woman captive. She and two other defendants— Michael Stokes and James Noel — will be sentenced Thursday. Two other men were sentenced in the case Wednesday — Bradley Cook and Dennis Henry. Cook, 34, of the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood received a 20-year sentence and must pay $123,000 in restitution. He pleaded guilty in December 2011 to one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion. Manipulation: The young woman was allegedly forced to appear on the cover of S&M magazine Taboo (her face has been blurred to protect her identity) As part of his sentence, Bagley also agreed to pay about $123,000 toward future counseling and medical care for the woman, who's now 27. Attorneys for Bagley declined to comment after his sentencing Wednesday. The case came to light in early 2009 when the woman, then 23, was hospitalized after what prosecutors said was a torture session. Then-U.S. Attorney Beth Phillips called the case one of ‘the most horrific ever prosecuted in this district.’ Henry, 53, former postmaster in Nevada, Missouri, pleaded guilty in March 2011 to participating in a sex-trafficking conspiracy and transporting the victim across state lines for sexual activity. Of the six defendants, he is the only one whose plea deal didn't specify a prison sentence. He was sentenced to 10 years, $123,000 in restitution and lifetime supervision after he's released. Marilyn Bagley along with Stokes, 65, of Lebanon and Noel, 47, of Springfield each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud and coercion. Marilyn Bagley, 48, is to receive probation and Stokes and Noel five years each. The victim called Cook the most deviant of all the men who came to Bagley's trailer for torture sessions. Prosecutors say Cook watched her being whipped, locked in a dog cage, tied up and shocked with multiple electrical devices. The woman said in court that she will never forget ‘how he laughed while I suffered. Laughed while I cried and begged. Brad Cook is evil. I can still hear his laughter.’ As part of Cook's plea deal, charges accusing him of trying to hire someone to kill the woman while he was in federal custody in Leavenworth, Kansas, in the case were dropped. Prosecutors also alleged in court documents that Cook tried to hire a hit man to kill Assistant U.S. Attorney Cynthia Cordes, but no charges were filed. As part of his sentence, Cook is not to have contact — or encourage others to have contact — with the victim or anyone involved with investigating and prosecuting his case.","Edward Bagley, 46, drugged, abused and pimped out the woman from his rural Missouri trailer starting when she was 16 .

One month since Alexis Wright was charged with running a brothel from her Zumba studio in the genteel New Hampshire town, local police continue to work through her client list and the revelations keep on coming. Once known primarily for its . pristine beaches and proximity to the Bush family's summer residence in . Kennebunkport, the scandal has rocked the New Hampshire town to its very . foundations in more ways than one. Scroll down for video . Energetic and fun loving: Alexis Wright, 29, in more sombre mood as she is arraigned on 106 charges last month . Showing a different side: sultry and fun loving Alexis in a photograph shot by promoter, Mark Strong . Because in a bizarre twist it has now emerged that as many as half of the 56 men charged to date work or worked in a business associated with home building, planning or construction. Notable among them is Donald Fortin, . 59, owner and founder of Fortin Construction Inc, a company that boasts . of being 'Number one Maine Home Builder for over 20 years,' and advertises itself online as 'A Christian Family Owned Company.' Indeed Mr Fortin is such a staunch . advocate of conservative family values. According to state records, he . donated $1000 to Protect Maine Marriage and organisation set up to . 'defend' marriage in the state from the perceived onslaught from 'gay . rights activists' and 'radical judges' seeking to 'redefine marriage'. He also made a donation of $350 to Senator Garrett Mason a conservative opponent of the state's same-sex marriage ballot. Maine's 'Number One Home Builder,' and family values advocate, Donald Fortin, 59, has been charged by police . Invested in the community: Attorney Joseph Lewis, former Portland Planning Board member and Little League coach has also been implicated . Similarly vocal in his defence of family values is attorney Joe Lewis, identified by Kennebunk Police as one of the men charged with 'engaging a prostitute,' and a Portland based lawyer. Mr Lewis, 49, served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer 2012. In his professional biography he makes great play of his commitment to the community and to his family who are, he says, 'firmly settled in Portland'. He goes on: 'I can honestly say that of all the wonderful places I've had the chance to live in, Portland, ME is exactly where I want to be. 'I'm heavily invested in the community I served on the Portland Zoning Board of Appeal from 2000-2005. I also served on the Portland Planning Board from 2008 until summer, 2012.' He has coached and umpired for the local little League and volunteered in local schools. When approached by MailOnline Mr Lewis declined to comment. Speaking to Portland's Morning Sentinel, Ronald Weitzer, a sociologist at George Washington University and expert on prostitution said that the fact that a large number of  Wright's alleged clients were in such related or similar businesses, 'does suggest that there was some referring going on.' Though truth be told it hardly takes an expert to draw such a conclusion. Alexis Wright is said to have kept meticulous notes, a 'Domination Fettish Sheet' and stands accused of having filmed clients in her Zumba studio and rented office . Former Mayor, James Soules, 58, a married father of four with 'lots of explaining to do' to his wife . Attorney Jens Bergen, 54, a 'happy guy who loves his wife and children' Financier Joe Cuetara,63, who lives in a $500,000 waterfront New Hampshire home . Gary Bahklow, 57, a realtor with a string of wealthy clients in search for real estate and timberland . Wright kept meticulous records suggesting a business enterprise that brought in more than $150,000 in 18months and including a 'Domination Fettish Sheet,' and client list reportedly running to 150 'johns.' This, along with other materials removed from her Zumba studio has formed the basis for much of the Kennebunk Police investigation. An honours student who raised money for good causes, none suspected Alexis Wright of living a double life . Speaking to Mail Online Lieutenant Antony Bean Burpee admitted that they were a long way from completeing their enquiries. He said: 'We've been investigating since September 2011 and we're nowehere near finished. 'We have to establish probably cause before we can charge these men and we're working through a long list.' The investigation was sparked by a tip off from a 'concerned resident' who had grown suspicious of the frequent male visitors to Wright's dance studio and, later, a rented office across the street. But nobody could possibly have imagined the torrent of allegation and counter-allegation that would follow. To most of those who knew her to that point Wright was simply 'a fun and energetic' girl, a former honours student from neighbouring Wells who took part in charity drives and class trips with her 7-year-old son. She hosted Zumba charity events for earthquake victims in Haiti, the Susan G Komen foundation for breast cancer and Toys for Tots. These are the sort of our-of-hours activities residents of the light-house studded coastline expect of their neighbours. But if the charges against are prove true she did all this while leading a double life that included acts of prostitution and filming clients. So far police have released three . batches of names of men charged with engaging a prostitute. As well as . the peculiar prevalence of contractors, painters, drywall and concrete specialists, . window and flooring professionals, realtors, appraisers and real estate . attorneys the list has included former Mayor James Soule, 58, realtor . Gary Bahklow, 57, attorney Jens . Bergen, 54, financier Joe Cuetara, 63 and local ice hockey coach, Donald . Hill who has since stepped down from his role at Kennebunk High. All . of the accused men sought to prevent their names being made a matter of . public record in an application that was last month denied in . Cumberland County Superior Court by Justice Thomas Warren. Picture Perfect: Kennebunk had long been known simply for its white beaches, light-house studded coastline, lobster and proximity to the Bush family's summer home . They are not the only men seeking to distance themselves from Alex Wright, the Zumba instrutcor who allegedly employed a number of online aliases to advertise her willingness to 'have fun(Sex) with both men and women'. The lawyer acting for Mark Strong, 57, Wright's former business partner and alleged co-conspirator, has applied to have Strong's case heard separately from the dance instructor. According to Strong's lawyer, Daniel Lilley, this is because Wright faces far more serious felony charges than Strong who has been charged with 59 misdemeanours - all of which he denies. She has been charged on 106 counts of prositution, invasion of privacy, conspiracy, tax offences and receving welfare benefits when ineligible for welfare. Mr Lilley said, 'It is guilt by association and we woudl just as soon go this month on our own, by ourselves.' Mr Lilley is also hoping that his client's trial can be heard before Christmas - an impossiblity for Wright as the police continue to issue summonses, and release names, pushing the trial well into next year.","Hypocrisy of a Hallmark community as the men who built Kennebunk dominate list of those accused in the scandal rocking it .

A high school cheerleader in Minneapolis, Minnesota plead guilty Friday to pimping out a girl on her squad. 18-year-old Montia Parker plead guilty on three counts of prostitution Friday including solicitng a minor to practice prostitution, first-degree sex trafficking of a minor and first-degree promotion of prostitution of a minor, according to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. The charges stem from an illegal business Parker started with one of her teammates at Hopkins High School. Female pimp: 18-year-old Montia Parker, left and right, plead guilty to three prostitution charges related to an incident where she advertised one of her cheerleading teammates for sex on Backpage.com . On March 1, that teammate approached Parker asking if she knew a way of making money. According to the criminal complaint, Parker told her she could make money by giving men oral sex. The victim agreed and soon after, Parker sent a message to her on Facebook asking for her contact information and told her to take pictures that were 'not too nasty but kinda cute' for an advertisement on Backpage.com. On March 5, Parker texted the 16-year-old victim and told her to leave school and meet her in her car. The two teens drove to an apartment where the victim performed oral sex on a man for $60 dollars. The victim gave Parker the money and Parker kept it - giving nothing to the victim. The next day, Parker set up another transaction - this time for vaginal sex. However, the victim told Parker she did not want to perform vaginal sex, and offered to do oral sex instead. The client declined and no money was exchanged. The prostitution was discovered when the victim's mother got a message about unexcused absences from school. Skipping classes: The crime was reported when the victim's mother was notified about unexcused absences and read the text message conversations between the two girls . She checked her daughter's phone and found texts between her and Parker discussing the prostitution and called the police. When asked about her crimes in her court appearance Friday, Parker responded: 'Guilty. Regretful. Remorseful.' Parker faces 45 to 60 months in prison and has a sentencing hearing scheduled for October 11.","Montia Parker, 18, plead guilty to three charges related to a prostitution business she had with a cheerleading teammate at Hopkins High School .

An Oklahoma man who died in February under suspicious circumstances had a heart attack and did not spontaneously combust as some at first believed. Danny Vanzandt, 65, of Muldrow died after burning for 10 hours. When his house was found largely untouched by the fire, some began to suspect spontaneous combustion. Now investigators say Vanzandt died of a heart attack and likely fell on top of a cigarette, lighting himself on fire, thereafter. Nothing to see here: Danny Vanzandt died in this Tulsa house early this year. Initially, some believed he spontaneously combusted when he was found burned with his home unharmed . After neighbors saw smoke coming from the house they called the fire service and attempted to put out what they thought was a pile of burning trash. They soon realized it was in fact a body. Sequoyah County Sheriff Ron Lockhart said: 'This is very bizarre. You’re thinking someone poured something on him, but there was no fire source. The body was burned and it was incinerated. I think there is only about 200 cases (of spontaneous combustion) worldwide. I'm not saying this is what it is, but I haven't ruled it out.' Wrong: Sheriff Lockhart said the way his body was burned was inconsistent with an accidental fire - such as from a cigarette dropping . Interior: The floor below the 65-year-old was not damaged and there was no sign that any accelerant was used . Sheriff Lockhart spent about 20 years as an arson investigator for the Fort Smith, Arkansas Police Department, and said he had never seen anything like it. The floor below the 65-year-old was not damaged and there was no sign that any accelerant was used. On Tuesday, Lockhart’s suspicions were discounted, reports KFSM. ‘The lack of soot within the airway and a negative carboxyhemoglobin level within the procured blood sample suggests death prior to the fire,’ reads the medical examiner’s report. ‘These findings are not consistent with someone breathing in smoke in the moments preceding death.’ The report also noted Vanzandt’s advanced coronary artery disease and heavy smoking habit. Authorities said the man had a history of heavy drinking and smoking, according to Tulsa World. Hawaii: Young Sik Kim was found enveloped in blue flames in December 1956. By the time firemen arrived on the scene, Kim and his easy chair were ashes. Strangely enough, nearby curtains and clothing were untouched by fire . The remains of Mrs Mary H Reeser, left, which were largely ashes, were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting, right, and only part of her left footand her backbone remained, below . Limbs: The remains of Mrs Mary H. Reeser remains after she allegedly spontaneously decombusted . A baffled coroner ruled last year that a man who burned to death in his home died as a result of spontaneous human combustion. Dr Ciaran McLoughlin, the coroner for West Galway in Ireland, said that although Michael Faherty, 76, had been found lying on his back close to a fire in an open fireplace, that blaze had NOT caused his death. He said a detailed investigation into all other possibilities had offered no other explanation, so he was delivering such a verdict for the first time in his 25 years as a coroner. In December 1956, Virginia Caget of Honolulu, Hawaii, walked into the room of Young Sik Kim to find him enveloped in blue flames. By the time firemen arrived on the scene, Kim and his easy chair were ashes but nearby curtains and clothing were untouched by fire, in spite of the fierce heat that would have been necessary to consume a human being. On July 2, 1951, Mrs Mary Reeser's remains, which were largely ashes, were found among the remains of a chair in which she had been sitting. Only part of her left foot and her backbone remained. Plastic household objects at a distance from the seat of the fire were softened and had lost their shapes. The FBI eventually declared that Reeser had been incinerated by the 'wick effec't. As she was a known user of sleeping pills, they hypothesized that she had fallen unconscious while smoking and set fire to her nightclothes. The theory of the wicker effect is that the human body can become an 'inside out' candle. The . person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or . flammable substance, that keeps the blaze going. Limbs may be left . intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the . body being cooler than the top. There have been a number of documented cases where police have found corpses burned almost to ashes but no burned furniture around them. Temperatures of 3,000 degrees would be required to burn a human body to this extent, yet in these cases only smoke damage is reported. Puzzled scientists have come up with the ‘wick theory’ to explain such events. The theory is that the human body can become an ‘inside out’ candle. The person’s clothes are the wick, while their body fat is the wax or flammable substance, that keeps the blaze going. Limbs may be left intact because of the temperature gradient, with the bottom half of the body being cooler than the top. A grisly aside is that greasy stains left after such an event could be a residue for the person’s body fat. The combustion would not be ‘spontaneous’ however, because it would need an external source to start it off, such as a cigarette. Some have postulated that static electricity could cause the needed spark. A body would take around five hours to burn in this way to ashes. Victims are often elderly, sick, or under the influence of alcohol, which might explain why they would not have been able to escape. Charles Dickens provides a very graphic depiction of the death of the shopkeeper Mr Krook by spontaneous combustion in his 1852 novel Bleak House, where the author does away with the alcoholic rag-and-bone man Krook by making him mysteriously burst into flames. Dickens had done his research: in the 1850s, the main theory used to explain these occurrences was alcohol — that, if you drank enough, it seeped into your skin  and made it possible to catch alight if you brushed past a flame.",Danny Vanzandt's February death was considered suspicious coroners ruled Tuesday he died a natural death .

But, much as they try, few married couples get to feel it all over again. Unlike gobsmacked Jason Mortensen. Dosed up on morphine for a hernia . operation, the love-struck American couldn't believe his eyes when he . caught sight of the woman by his bed. The video purportedly shows Mr Mortensen meeting his wife all over again for the first time, but there's now speculation over its authenticity. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Was he faking? Mortensen's acting profile lists his ambitions as movies, TV shows and commercials . 'Love of my life': Jason and Candice allegedly married six years ago and he claims to have had five surgeries during that time . Gawping, he had a million questions: . 'Did the doctor send you? Man you are eye candy! Woah. You're the . prettiest woman I've ever seen. 'Are you a model? Who are you? What's your name?' The answer blew his mind. 'I'm your wife,' she giggled. In . a video that has now amassed more than 240,000 views, Mr Mortensen's . jaw drops. And he's got a fair few more questions to ask. 'You're my wife?!' the former missionary gasps, 'Holy sh**! Dang. How long?' Candice Mortensen, the blonde beauty behind the lens, tries to encourage her husband of six years to eat a cracker as he recovers in an unidentified hospital. But he is too distracted. 'It's hard baby, it's hard... Do we call each other baby?' Dumbfounded, he clutches his head: 'Man I hit the jackpot!' Unaware: He wakes up writhing around in pain and calling for medicine. When Candice speaks he turns to look . Baffled: He gawps at the bedside beauty wanting to know if she is a model. He cannot believe they are married . Now said to be recovered, Mr Mortensen, Vice President of sales at Oltuse Pharmaceuticals in Orem, Utah, is sticking to his every word. The former missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints said: 'I had a hernia repair to fix residual tears from a previous surgery. 'I wish I could remember this but I was definitely out of it. 'This was my fifth surgery within our six years of marriage and she's been by my side through all of it. 'In a previous surgery I suffered a severe complication and we didn't know if I'd ever function the same again. 'She is the love of my life.' The couple live in Utah, where Mr Mortensen swapped medical school for business in 2010 after starting his own marketing company, Kangaroo Clips. The start of the viral video purportedly shows a half-conscious Mr Mortensen rolling around in pain asking for medicine. It is only when Candice offers to find a doctor that he turns to look at her. For the next three minutes of video, which will go down in family history, pain is the least of Mr Mortensen's worries as he repeatedly exclaims: 'We're married?!' He ogles at Candice, wanting to . know if they have children ('not yet'), have they kissed ('just eat . your cracker'). 'I hit the jackpot': Jason Mortensen cannot believe his luck when he realises the bedside beauty is his wife, but did he recognise her all along? After a few moments of contemplation he is . inspired to investigate further: 'Let me see your face. Woah! Your teeth . are perfect!' Much to his disappointment, she refuses to 'turn around'. Catching sight of her left hand he says: 'Did I get you that ring? God I must have been... really liking you'. Commenters flooded to praise the 'husband of the year' on YouTube after the video was posted on August 30. One person said: 'That guy studied!' Another commented: 'This man is a friggin genius!' A yearning viewer said: 'Why can't I find a guy like this!' Applauding Mrs Mortensen for her camerawork, one commenter said: 'I can't decide who is the genius of this operation. Jason, for saying this on camera or his wife for making sure it was documented!' Not long after the video went viral, it received a flood of attention, but now some are doubting its validity. It has the looks of a hoax, according to a doctor who spoke to Slate. Explaining that there are two types of amnesia, Dr. Larry Squire, a psychologist at the University of California-San Diego, says that neither of them would likely cause the type of memory loss allegedly suffered by Mr Mortensen. 'The first type, psychogenic amnesia, is a psychiatric condition that can involve retrograde memory loss, but isn't associated with surgery, says Dr Squire. 'The second, which is similar to Alzheimer's, can be caused by a loss of oxygen during surgery, but mainly leads to difficulty learning new information,' he adds. Explaining that while retrograde memory (that of past events) can occur, Dr Squire says it is unheard of for a six-year marriage to be wiped clean from a person's memory. 'It would not affect something so salient in a person's life,' said Dr Squire. Another strike against the sensational video's legitimacy is a head shot found of the suddenly coherent Mr Mortensen on an acting audition website, the Slate post points out. One final item of note, the former actor has only one video uploaded to his YouTube account, which Slate notes 'employs the easy-to-remember username 'UCx-PiDcTqvNUoyNHY5R7RIA.'","Jason Mortensen is filmed in bed half-conscious after a hernia operation .

Rather . optimistically, it seems, she had been relying on the sun shining on her . 170 guests as they mill around in the vast garden during the four-hour . gap between the 3.45pm service and the start of dinner in a . specially-erected marquee. All . this week, she has been glued to her iPad, looking at weather forecasts . which have ominously predicted that the heavens are expected to open. How, . she has asked friends, is everyone going to shelter from the rain in . the giant tent while the caterers are trying to lay tables? And that is not the half of it. Yesterday, the Mail revealed that the bride’s stepmother, TV weathergirl . Sian Lloyd, has been mysteriously barred from the wedding. The . reason, I can reveal, is that she has had a massive, tearful . falling-out with Suzanne over comments Miss Lloyd made about her mother. Nor . has Miss Lloyd given up on the idea of attending without a fight, and . there are suggestions she will still turn up regardless. However, it . seems that even if the bride relents, she will not be given a place on . the top table. Excluding: Euan and Suzanne, pictured in 2009, has allegedly banned the bride's step-mother Sian Lloyd from Saturday's nuptials . Uninvited: Sian Lloyd, who married Suzanne Ashman's father Jonathan in 2007, allegedly made a comment about Suzanne's mother . The problem began, I gather, at a recent pre-wedding . dinner party attended by 29-year-old groom Euan, Suzanne, her father . (motor-racing entrepreneur Jonathan Ashman) and his second wife, Miss . Lloyd. It seems that . Welsh-born Miss Lloyd, 55, inadvertently made a comment about the . bride’s Turkish mother, Sedef — Mr Ashman’s first wife — that Suzanne . took the wrong way. ‘I don’t think Sian meant anything by it, but Suzanne was in floods of tears,’ I was told. ‘It’s . just the sort of typical misunderstanding that happens in the run-up to . a big wedding. Everyone thought the issue would settle down but Suzanne . said she didn’t want Sian at the wedding.’ Miss . Lloyd’s one-time fiancé, the flamboyant ex-Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, says . he is ‘not surprised’ that she has been ‘uninvited’ and suggested there . were several reasons. Admittedly he offered no proof that Miss Lloyd . ever uttered the remark, but said that Tony Blair may have heard her . comment that she thought him a ‘war criminal’ and didn’t like his . policies. He added: ‘There is a comic-tragic irony that she now is to be . related to him in the future.’ Meanwhile, . Mrs Blair, 58, tried to escape the fray by taking her 25-year-old . daughter Kathryn with her to a spa in Sicily last month to prepare for . the big day. Indeed, she has been making plans for the wedding ever since Euan and Suzanne got engaged at Christmas. There . has been so much to arrange. For instance, the Blairs’ youngest child, . the musically-gifted Leo, 13, must be rushed back home from London where . he is due to spend this morning rehearsing a production of The Magic . Flute. The young singer made . his West End debut in the chorus of Bizet’s Carmen last year. No . wonder, given all this angst, that paterfamilias Tony — wisely — has . stayed well out of the way over the last week. He has been abroad (as . usual) on business and was due to fly home only yesterday. Among their guests is, I am told, the Italian Prince Girolamo Strozzi and his wife Irina. A . friend of the family, he became headline news in 2006 when Blair was PM . and accepted a freebie holiday with the prince’s family — one of . several the Blairs have taken with them — at his 16th-century Tuscan . palace Villa Cusona, set in the hills of Chianti near the walled town of . San Gimignano. In May, an . Italian magistrate took possession of the estate over an ongoing fraud . inquiry, though the 75-year-old aristocrat denies any wrongdoing. Wedding: Tony and Cherie Blair's son Euan is marrying Suzanne Ashman and the party afterwards is taking place at the family mansion in Wotton Underwood, Buckinghamshire . The Blair mansion: South Pavilion, in Wotton Underwood, where the wedding party will take place . Also invited is Lord Levy, the controversial former Labour-fundraiser who was embroiled in the so-called cash-for-peerages scandal that engulfed the party in 2006. But it has been suggested that the peer might not be able to attend as the wedding falls on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. There is also talk that the groom has invited senior officials from the West Midlands Labour Party. For the Bristol University graduate is keen to follow in his 60-year-old father’s footsteps and wants to become an MP. He is said to have targeted two safe seats in Coventry, where he hopes to be selected as a candidate to fight the 2015 election. One is due to be vacated by former Labour minister Bob Ainsworth and the other is currently held by Geoffrey Robinson — Tony Blair’s millionaire old pal who controversially lent Peter Mandelson £373,000 to buy a house — who will be nearly 77 come the election. Last year, Euan gave up his well-paid job as a merchant banker with Morgan Stanley in London to take on the role of business development manager at Sarina Russo Job Access — an employment agency in Coventry involved in the Government’s flagship Work Programme. He has helped canvass for Labour, for example in the Corby by-election last year. Certainly, he and his bride, who attended the prestigious St Paul’s Girls’ School in London, have all the hallmarks of a power couple in the making. They met eight years ago when she was doing work experience for the then Labour Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon. In 2009, she also did a stint working for her future father-in-law’s charity, the Tony Blair Faith Foundation. And dark-haired Suzanne, who has a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Trinity College, Oxford, has the sort of exemplary Left-wing credentials to equip her for the high-powered life of a Labour politician’s wife. She works as an analyst for Social Finance, which helps raise funds from private investors for good causes and is currently working on a pilot programme involving Peterborough Prison. In her spare time, she is a governor at a Westminster primary school. Suzanne’s parents are, of course, divorced. Her mother is the daughter of a former Turkish government minister and one-time mayor of Ankara. Family affair: Euan, far right, with his parents and siblings Nicky and Katherine in 2006 during Tony's time as Prime Minister . Her father, Mr Ashman, 64, married Miss Lloyd in 2007 after a whirlwind ten-month romance. The problems over the presence of Miss Lloyd at the ceremony aside, another hitch, it has been reported, is that the young couple — who bought a house together in Islington, North London, last year — have not seen completely eye-to-eye with Tony and Cherie over the arrangements. Euan, who previously lived in a £1.3 million Grade-II-listed Georgian townhouse bought for him by his parents in Marylebone, London, is said to fear that the wedding could be considered too posh for a potential Labour MP for an economically-ravaged Midlands city, which would damage his chances of getting grassroots party backing. Accordingly, the menu is said to be a simple affair. Others invited to today’s nuptials include Euan’s younger brother Nicky and his girlfriend Alex, plus Mrs Blair’s 81-year-old father, former hell-raising actor Tony Booth, and his fourth wife Steph, who unsuccessfully stood as a Labour candidate at the last general election, as well as Cherie’s mother, Gale. Cherie’s only full sister, Lyndsey, with whom she has had a turbulent relationship, is also expected to be present, as are Cherie’s half-sisters Jenia and Bronwen, from Booth’s former relationship with American sketch-writer Julie Allan. Not expected to attend, however, is another of Mrs Blair’s six half-sisters, journalist-turned-peace-campaigner Lauren Booth, who publicly criticised Mr Blair’s decision to go to war in Iraq and branded Cherie as ‘high and mighty’. Lauren, who appeared in ITV’s I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here! in 2006, converted to Islam in 2010. With so much to contend with, it is hardly surprising that earlier this week Mrs Blair checked herself, the bride and bridesmaids to the plush Champneys health spa in Tring, Hertfordshire, for a pre-wedding pampering session. I am told that Euan has also booked into the spa, where he has requested a facial. Cherie, whose love of a freebie is well-known, has also been telling friends that Champneys has offered to supply a team of beauticians, at no charge, to be based in a cottage in the grounds of the Blairs’ estate to touch up the make-up of Cherie and other female guests during the evening. Given all those pre-wedding headaches, a frazzled Mrs Blair (who is expected to wear a gold and cream lace ensemble) needs all the pampering she can get.","Euan Blair, 29, is marrying long-term girlfriend Suzanne Ashman, 25 .

A mother who lost both her arms from an electric shock as a toddler has found a love of bodybuilding. Barbie Thomas, 37, has been competing against able bodied women in bodybuilding for over a decade after a youth crammed full of dance, soccer and swimming competitions. The mother of two says there is little she cannot do. She shrugs off the amount of effort it takes to compete as a body builder and just like any other family, she says raising her two teenage sons is hard work. Scroll down for videos... Barbie Thomas, centre, lost both her arms aged two and has been competing as a body builder for ten years . But anything that could prove challenging makes her work even harder to achieve it, because she says her biggest inspiration is being told she can't do something. Speaking to the Huffington Post, she said: 'Someone once told me that you know you can never win, and to this day those words light a fire under me like you would not believe. Because when someone tells me I can't do something I will bust my buns to prove them wrong.' Mrs Thomas lost both her arms when they were burnt to the bone by an electric shock when she climbed up onto a transformer and grabbed the wires with both hands. She was aged just two and her mother was distraught, but almost immediately young Mrs Thomas learnt to adapt, holding out her legs to hug her mother. Mrs Thomas, pictured in the 2012 Natural Western Regional Championships, says she has only ever won when she was the only person in the competition . Drive: Mrs Thomas says her disability does not stop her from doing most things, in fact when someone says she can't do something, she is more determined to do it . Every day, the stay-at-home mother, who has recently gone through a divorce, goes to the gym to train. She does cardio in the morning followed by a routine of either weights, dance, track training, lunges and leg exercises and of course, practicing her competition routine. In her next competition, she plans to being out a new move to wow the judges, a complete flip. But, according to the news service, she's promised her mother not to do any tumbles, since this is how she has previously hurt her knee. Reliant on her legs and feet, Mrs Thomas says she dresses and prepares herself like any other person without any help. Given her disability, you might expect she would get extra help for her sons, aged 13 and 17, around the house, but she tells the Huffington Post: 'They're teenage boys. I still have a hard time getting them to do chores.' Ambitious: She is now setting her sights on acting parts in Hollywood . In addition to her gym work, Mrs Thomas does some modelling and is now setting her sights on some film parts. She told the newspaper she was offered a part in the Steven Spielberg film A.I. but had to turn it down because she was pregnant. She said limbless actors were often used in Hollywood films where people are dismembered. The inspirational mother is also giving motivational speeches to help others achieve their goals.

Nick Clegg’s fiercest Liberal Democrat critic has suggested he should be ousted because his personal ratings are as bad as Labour’s least successful leader Michael Foot. Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election even if picks up slightly in the polls, adding: ‘It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look at the facts.’ And in a fresh blow for Mr Clegg, his party has slumped to just eight per cent in the polls with voters saying the animal he most resembles is a poodle. Dog days: Under fire: Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is accused of holding back his party with his own unpopularity, with 15 per cent of people saying he resembled a poodle . The YouGov survey for The Sun put Labour on 38 per cent and the Tories 34 per cent. UK Independence Party is on 13 per cent. The survey found 21 per cent think the Lib Dems are untrustworthy, and 44 per cent say the party has not contributed 'anything positive'. Asked which animal he most resembles, 15 per cent said a poodle, 13 per cent a labrador,, sheep 13 per cent and 11 per cent a snake. Lord Oakshott, a close ally of Business Secretary Vince Cable, said next year’s local and Euro elections would be ‘crunch time’ as the biggest test of public opinion since 2010. He said next May would be a ‘last chance’ for the Lib Dems to change direction. Lord Oakeshott’s intervention will exasperate Mr Clegg’s allies, coming just days before the party gathers for its annual conference in Glasgow. The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday that an economic ‘dawn appears to be breaking’ - something that he claimed would not have happened had it not been for the Lib Dems. He told LBC radio he was ‘very proud’ of sticking with the coalition and helping to ‘pilot the economy through its darkest hour’. ‘You shouldn’t be complacent but it is moving in the right direction and I don’t think that would’ve happened if we hadn’t been there,’ Mr Clegg said. Cheers: Lord Oakeshott used the interview on the eve of the Lib Dem conference to again call for Mr Clegg to resign . There are growing tensions in the Lib . Dems between those who want to start distancing themselves from the . Tories in the run up to the 2015 general election, and those who think . they must stick the course and seek to claim equal credit for the . Government’s achievements. Senior Lib Dem minister David Laws this week insisted the coalition would continue ‘up to the wire’ before the election. But . Lord Oakeshott, in a provocative interview with political magazine The . House, said that would lead to disaster and insisted the Lib Dems should . split from their Tory coalition partners as soon as May next year in an . attempt to convince voters they have a clear policy agenda of their . own. He said Mr Clegg’s personal poll . ratings were ‘very poor’ and the party would have to think about whether . it would do better under another leader. ‘We need to face facts, there’s quite a . lot of complacency going on and self-delusion going on. We are likely . to lose seats,’ he said. ‘If we are on 15 per cent we would . hold 30 seats, if we are on 17 per cent we would hold 40 seats - and if . we are on 13 per cent we would hold 20 seats.... It’s very important to . maximise our national share of the vote to give our MPs the best . chance.’ Lord Oakeshott, who revealed in the interview that he and his wife are worth £10 million, said the party’s poll ratings were currently stuck between 8 per cent and 10 per cent with ‘no sign of improvement’. ‘Let’s be objective; we have to accept that Nick’s ratings are very poor and have been for a long time. You’ve got to be frank that his ratings are down at levels which if you go back were only seen by Mrs Thatcher shortly before she left, and Michael Foot. It’s nothing personal, you’ve got to look at the facts,’ he said. State of the parties . Britain’s most expensive homes should . be hit with a ‘super mansion tax’ to help raise billions in tax . revenues, according to a senior Liberal Democrat. The . party already advocates a 1 per cent tax on homes worth more than . £2million, but party president Tim Farron said those worth more should . face an even higher rate. He . said yesterday: ‘You could have various rates within the mansion tax. A . £4million property, for example, paying a higher rate.’ A . tax on expensive properties is also backed by the Labour Party. Mr Farron told the Evening Standard he wanted . to charge people who had properties and wealth at much more than . £2million 'a higher proportion' instead of lowering the threshold to . catch more properties. He . said: 'You . could have various rates within the mansion tax - a property worth . £4million, for example, paying at a higher rate, as well as a higher . global sum, than those with smaller properties. ’There is a way of doing this without damaging people who are potentially in a more marginal position.' ‘You do have to say “where are our . prospects at the next election if we don’t have a major and clear change . and detachment from the Conservatives?” and we’ve got to think about . the best way to get that message over.’ The peer pointed to polls last year which suggested the party could add about three or four points to its ratings under another leader, adding: ‘These are things people have to think about given how sensitive the number of our seats will be. It’s for the party to decide. ‘It’s disastrous if we are seen as a tin can tied to the Tories’ tail in 2015. We have to move on to developing our own very clear and distinctive Liberal Democrat message for next time. ‘It will be very difficult to do that if we are still in Government at the next election. I believe we should disengage well before the next election, sixth months to a year before.’ A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Nobody . who has ever spoken to Matthew will be surprised to learn that he . doesn’t like Nick Clegg and that he enjoys talking about how rich he is. ‘This is a predictable annual . occurrence. He last called for Nick Clegg to resign at conference in . 2012. You can set your calendar by it. Having a dig at Nick gives . Matthew his occasional moment in the sun.’ Mr Cable said: ‘Matthew is an independent minded member of the House of Lords, with his own views. 'He does not speak for me. His comments today were seriously unhelpful.’ Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb acknowledged that the party had ‘a lot of hard work to do’ and ‘you’d rather the polls were better than they are’. But he added: ‘I’ve seen us recover from worse than this and incumbency is important. We’ve got a lot of work to do and we know we’ve got to get our message across and in coalition it’s a unique challenge to be distinctive.’","Lord Oakeshott is one of the Liberal Demorcat leader's fiercest critics .

A couple had to put their wedding on hold after an owl which had been chosen to carry the rings fell asleep in the roof of the church. The bride had secretly arranged for the bird to swoop down to the altar with the wedding bands attached to its feet by tassels. But the spectacular stunt failed when the barn owl, called Darcy, took to the rafters to enjoy an impromptu snooze. Bird brain: This was the moment a church wedding had to be halted because an owl chosen to carry the rings fell asleep . It remained perched high inside the 900 year-old Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire, for an hour after falling asleep. Rev Chris Bryan, who was in charge of the ceremony between Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mettle, 49, tried to coax the animal down but his efforts were in vain, so he decided to continue the service by using a back up set of rings. He said: 'It would have been absolutely superb - if it worked. It was a lovely idea and it was supposed to be really stunning. 'It was a complete surprise to the groom, although the bride was in on it. It was the bride’s mother’s idea. 'The . groom is into falconry as a bit of a hobby and so it was secretly . arranged for two falconers to suddenly appear at the moment when the . best man hands over the rings. 'This . chap popped up at the front of the church next to us with a gauntlet . on, as another chap appeared at the back of the church with a box. 'The owl appeared, and took a bit of coaxing to take to flight it paused for a little bit, eventually saw the gauntlet, and then took off. Halted: The Church of the Holy Cross in Sherston, Wiltshire, where the wedding was briefly stopped as the owl took to the rafters for an ill-timed snooze . 'But instead of landing on the arm of . the man by us and delivering the rings it went up over our heads and . landed up in the roof space. 'The . idea was it would be amazing and would swoop over the heads of the . guests, and they’d all feel the air rushing from its wings, but it . didn’t quite work like that.' Rev. Bryan added: 'We all had a bit of a laugh about it, and then we tried to get it down, but it didn’t come. 'In fact it fell asleep. It presumably thought ‘I’m a barn owl, this is like a barn’. 'We had a plan B. They say never work with animals, so we had a back-up pair of rings. 'After . a few minutes, we gave up trying to get it down and carried on. It was . actually rather nice when we went up for prayers and the owl was right . above us. 'The couple, from Oxfordshire, had left the chuch by the time dozy Darcy was finally brought back down. 'The chaps were there for probably an hour, and in the end had to get a long ladder to go up and get it down. 'I thought it would be a really beautiful and interesting thing to do at a wedding. 'It’s . important that people realise that a church wedding doesn’t just come . as a package of things you have to do, and there’s no room for . creativity. 'I’m all for including something of the personality and individuality of the couple getting married.' Darcy was booked to deliver the rings to Mr Mattle and Miss Cadman as they tied the knot. Sonia, a mother-of-two, said: 'Andrew is a twitcher, so the owl delivering the rings was a surprise gift from my mother. High up: The bird was in the roof of the 900-year-old church for an hour before it flew away . 'The owl is a ring bearer so the idea is that it's meant to fly in with the rings attached to some ribbon and deliver them. 'When the owl flew in though it seemed really distracted, I'm not sure if maybe it was spooked by something, but he just wasn't concentrating. 'It's meant to fly straight into the glove of a falconer who then takes the rings off, but instead the bird disappeared into the rafters. 'It probably felt really at home because the inside of the church is a little like the inside of a barn, so it just ended up sleeping.' She added: 'We waited for about 15 minutes for the bird to come down but it didn't come. 'Instead we went ahead with plan B, we had back up rings ready because they don't always do as they're told - a bit like all animals and children really! 'I'm glad that the bird didn't come actually, it didn't ruin the big day at all, in fact it added to the humour. 'It was such a magical wedding and it was so full of emotion, it was nice to be able to have a bit of a laugh. 'Luckily the service was able to go ahead and my husband was able to hold the bird and have some really nice pictures taken after the ceremony.' Darcy belongs to Phil Voller, who runs Wings Over Wiltshire which promotes the bird as 'a ring-bearer' for weddings. His website says: 'In the recent months we have added to our collection of birds of prey. 'Darcy the Barn Owl came to us as a four week old ball of fluff and has settled in perfectly. 'Darcy was hand reared and is now ready to embark on the many ideas we have for her.' The site adds: 'Why not forget the traditions and have the beautiful Darcy fly the wedding rings over the congregation to the alter? It is a stunning performance to make your day extra special. 'After the ceremony, if you would like, we would be part of the photographs or entertain the guests with our other birds. 'We can colour coordinate Darcy's ribbons and the ring pouch to what ever colour you would like to make your day as perfect as possible.'","Sonia Cadman, 46, and Andrew Mattle, 49 got married at the Holy Cross Church in Sherston, Wiltshire .

Legal action: PC Kelly Jones has dropped the case brought against a man who dialled 999 . A police tsar has warned that Ministers must clamp down on a compensation culture fuelled by  no-win, no-fee lawyers, after a woman officer who tried to sue a crime victim finally dropped her claim. PC Kelly Jones launched a compensation bid against the owner of a garage where she tripped while investigating a suspected burglary, in a case that caused outrage when revealed by The Mail on Sunday. Last week PC Jones withdrew her legal bid although her ‘union’, the Police Federation, maintained she only ever wanted to recover income lost through her injury. In the wake of her climbdown, the elected Police and Crime Commissioner in her force area said the case marked a new low in the compensation culture that has ‘infected’ the police and other public services. Stephen Bett, the independent PCC for Norfolk, said: ‘This mindless no-win, no-fee compensation culture is being driven by greedy lawyers. It’s rife. Everybody seems to believe they can make a fast buck. ‘This case of a PC who suffered an injury answering a 999 call was driven by lawyers. 'It was ridiculous and it should give Westminster the ammunition it needs to legislate against them. ‘They should be told that if they fail, as they did in this case, they’ll be given a hefty bill for costs. It would act as a deterrent.’ Fall: PC Kelly Jones (right) launched her legal action in March this year after injuring her wrist at Steve Jones' garage (left) when answering a 999 call . Mr Bett fears the case has tarnished the reputation of the police. He said: ‘The actions of this PC degrade what huge numbers of police officers do every day – running the risk of being stabbed or hit by a car. ‘The officer involved faced a huge amount of opprobrium for her actions, but she has raised questions over the genuine and vital compensation awards made to officers who have been badly hurt in the line of duty.’ PC Jones, 34, a mother of two from Thetford, Norfolk, was called to a service station in the town in August 2012 and hurt her leg and arm in a minor fall. In March this year she launched her action against garage owner Steve Jones seeking tens of thousands of pounds in compensation. After she dropped her claim, Mr Jones said he was delighted, describing it as a ‘victory for common sense’. Scene: PC Jones tripped over at this petrol station owned by Steve Jones while investigating a break-in . The woman with a conviction for theft who sued the police for refusing to make her a constable has been sacked from her civilian police job after a row involving her own colleagues. Rachida Sobhi, 43, became embroiled in an argument with litter wardens after she was issued with an £80 on-the-spot penalty for dropping a cigarette butt near her home. The uniformed enforcement officers from Kingdom Security, employed by Bromley Council in South London, called the police. Miss Sobhi, a Metropolitan Police Community Support Officer, paid the fine after the dispute in December but her bosses at Scotland Yard hauled her before a disciplinary hearing. The panel concluded she had behaved badly towards the law enforcement officers and sacked her. Miss Sobhi had been part of the safer neighbourhoods team in the Kelsey and Eden Park areas in Bromley. She was employed despite her decades-old criminal record for theft, but took legal action when chiefs would not give her a job as a PC. Despite the latest development, Miss Sobhi is still pursuing her landmark claim against the Met and it will go before a fresh employment tribunal preliminary hearing on October 18. Miss Sobhi could not be contacted.","WPC Kelly Jones was injured in a fall while responding to a 999 call .

Questions are being asked after the fire-damaged wreck of an Antonov-2 biplane lost for almost a year was found just five miles from where it took off. The plane and its 13 passengers disappeared after going on an unauthorised 'joyride' from Serov in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia, on June 11 last year. Despite an extensive search lasting several months over an area the size of Western Europe, the wreckage remained undetected - although it apparently crashed just five miles from where it took off. Lost no longer: The wreckage of the Antonov-2 'ghost plane' which lay undiscovered for almost a year after it disappeared carrying 13 passengers on an unauthorised flight from Serov in Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia . Two hunters came across the debris in a swamp at the end of last week, solving what RIA Novosti news agency dubbed 'one of the biggest modern mysteries in Russia', The Siberian Times reported. Now relatives of those who died in the crash, who included senior police officials and their families, are asking questions as to why it has taken so long to locate the site of the tragedy. Some believe there has been a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Andrey Safronov, father of Anton Safronov, who was travelling aboard the plane with his wife Julia, told the Siberian Times: 'They searched there last summer. All around was searched and nothing was found'. 'Last year's hunt was conducted by elite OMON troops, it was claimed. And now - suddenly - everything was found. 'And, most importantly, it was all on the surface, all the debris on the surface, all the bones on the surface, even though it was burning'. Mr Safronov claimed the crash site was staged to look like the scene of the tragedy and that there could be sinister circumstances behind the plane's downing. 'Now this is what I think: they brought them here, and offloaded them,' he said. 'Who else could have done it in such manner? Only the military. Why do they need this? Just to hide it all. 'I think someone shot them down. Or, you know, around the same time, they launched from Plisetsk the missile Topol-M, which did not reach its goal. So, there are a lot of assumptions.' Mystery: Now relatives of those who died in the crash, who included senior police officials and their families, are asking questions as to why it has taken so long to locate the site of the tragedy . Anastasia Rogulina, whose sister perished in the crash, said she was suspicious about the well-made video of the crash site. She said the weather in the video did not match the actual weather on the day the plane was supposed to have been found; and while there is fire damage on the plane, the surrounding foliage is unharmed, she said. 'I believe the plane was dragged to that place and burned. Judging by the video, there aren't even dead trees around it. The area is completely untouched, although everything should have burned,' she said. Conspiracy: Andrey Safronov, father of passenger Anton Safronov claimed the crash site was staged to look like the scene of the tragedy and that there could be sinister circumstances behind the plane's downing . Rescue teams spent months scouring the area last year but were unable to find a trace of the AN-2 biplane, which set out without permission. Up to 2,000 people and 14 aircraft were involved in the desperate five-month hunt for the AN-2 biplane over 275,000 square kilometres of rough terrain. Policeman Valery Gorelykh told reporters at the time how the group had set off on their unscheduled flight at 11pm, after a drinking session. He said one theory was that they had intended 'to go fishing or to a bathhouse' - steam saunas often found in remote parts of Russia. The group included a pilot, Serov's chief traffic policeman, another officer, a security guard and the airfield's night watchman – who was reportedly wearing slippers – along with some of the men's relatives, including at least two women. The rescue operation was made all the more tricky because part of the region is hilly and covered in dense forest known as 'taiga'. At least 25 rescuers received potentially dangerous tick bites and one almost drowned in a swamp. The failure of the search led to wild speculation over the fate of the plane and its passengers - including, in echoes of the TV series Lost, that they had survived the crash and were fighting for their lives in the wilderness. The search area even included the notorious Dyaltov pass in the northern Urals where a group of students perished in odd circumstances in 1959. When their bodies were found, two victims had cracked skulls, two had broken ribs and one had her tongue missing, although there were no signs of struggle at the scene. A Soviet investigation concluded the team died as the result of 'a compelling unknown force'. Chance encounter: Two hunters came across the debris in a swamp at the end of last week, solving what RIA Novosti news agency dubbed 'one of the biggest modern mysteries in Russia' The official explanation: Officials say the plane was not found earlier because it is in an area of treacherous swampland that the two men who found it were only able to walk through because it was still frozen . However, not all of the relatives of those lost in last year's Antonov crash believe there was foul play at work - supernatural or otherwise. Alexander Beglenko, whose relative was aboard the plane, said in the thick foliage and swamp it would have been easily possible to miss the wreckage. Andrei Zalensky, an official with the Local Emergencies Ministry, explained how heavy winter snow had turned the area where the plane was found had turned the area into an 'inaccessible bog' last summer. And interior ministry official Valery Gorelykh also dismissed claims of a conspiracy to cover up the truth. Part of the plane is indeed submerged in the swamp, he said, and it was a 'miracle' that hunters had spotted the debris. 'Fragments cannot be seen from the distance of 20 meters even now when the trees are not green yet,' he said. 'According to the hunters who found the plane, they had come to the site by chance and only because the ice in the bog has not melted yet and they could walk on it. In a few days the bog will be already impassable.' The bones from the site are now undergoing DNA testing and are expected to be handed to relatives for burial in around two weeks. Other debris will remain at the site for a few days as evidence is collected, and will then be sent for forensic examination to determine the cause of the crash, said an official from Federal Air Transport Agency. Oddly there will be no black box data on the Antonov-2's final flight. 'In this case the black box did not work. Or was not switched on,' said Mr Zalensky of the Local Emergencies Ministry.","The Antonov-2 and its 13 passengers went missing on June 11 last year .

Today, a Treasury minister said Heaton was 'directly at odds' with the Government's position. Scroll down for video . Taxing situation: Heaton resigned after telling an audience how to reduce tax paid on bonuses by over 30 per cent . The treasury said that Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance . Mr Osborne was reportedly told about the comments - to be broadcast by the BBC on Monday - before flying to a meeting of European finance ministers in Lithuania. A source said the Chancellor had been 'very annoyed' upon learning of Mr Heaton's comments and 'instructed tough action be taken'. Mr Heaton denied doing anything wrong, but his resignation was announced yesterday, the BBC said. He had also been filmed describing a maternity scheme he called the Bump Plan, and saying: 'Ninety per cent of what you pay out ends up with the employee. You can't really knock that one.' He explained at the conference, in June, that by deliberately timing bonuses to enable an increased rebate on maternity pay, the tax paid on the bonus would effectively fall from 41.8 per cent to just 8.4 per cent, the BBC said. David Gauke, Exchequer Secretary to the . Treasury, said: 'The General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR) is designed to . protect taxpayers.

'Mr Heaton's statements are directly at odds with the Government's approach to tackling tax avoidance. A member of the panel should not behave in a way that could undermine the GAAR and its effectiveness. Therefore, it is right that Mr Heaton resigned from his position.' An HMRC spokesman said: 'The work of the General Anti Abuse Rule advisory panel plays an important role in HMRC's highly effective drive against tax abuse. 'The panel must command the confidence of both tax practioners and the general public. We will be announcing Mr Heaton's successor shortly.' Mr Heaton told Panorama: 'I do not believe a person who advocates artificial or abusive tax arrangements should be a panel member. I did not advocate any such arrangement at the conference and do not advocate such arrangements.' Chair of the Public Accounts Committee Margaret Hodge told the BBC: 'This is an absolutely classic example of where government passes a law with a particular intent and the tax advisers then abuse that and use it for a purpose that was never intended by government.'","George Osborne said to be 'very annoyed' upon learning of the comments .

Ray Dolby, an American inventor and audio pioneer who founded Dolby Laboratories, has died at the age of 80. The company said on Thursday that Dolby died in his home at San Francisco. He had been living with Alzheimer's disease for several years and was diagnosed with acute leukemia this summer. Dolby founded his namesake company in 1965 and grew it into an industry leader in audio technology. His work in noise reduction and surround sound led to the creation of a number of technologies that are still used in music, movies and entertainment today. The innovations also turned Dolby into a rich man with an estimated fortune of $2.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine. 'Today we lost a friend, mentor and true visionary,' Kevin Yeaman, president and CEO of Dolby Laboratories, said in a statement. Yeaman said that Dolby invented an entire . industry around delivering an experience in sound. His work ranged from . helping to reduce the hiss in cassette recordings to bringing Star . Wars to life on the big screen in Dolby Stereo. Dolby held 50 U.S. patents and won a number of notable awards for his life's work, including several Emmys, two Oscars and a Grammy. Lasting memory: The Dolby Theater in Hollywood, California, named after the audio pioneer . He was awarded the National Medal of Technology from President Bill Clinton and was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in the U.S. and the Royal Academy of Engineers in the U.K., among other honors. In 2012, the theater that serves as home to the Academy Awards was renamed the Dolby Theatre and the Ray Dolby Ballroom was named in his honor. 'Ray really managed to have a dream job,' said Dagmar Dolby, his wife of 47 years. 'Because he could do exactly what he wanted to do, whichever way he wanted to do it, and in the process, did a lot of good for many music and film lovers. And in the end, built a very successful company.' Dolby was born in Portland, Oregon, and his family eventually moved to the San Francisco peninsula. It was there that he started his professional work at Ampex Corp. working on videotape recording systems while he was still a student. Love: Ray Dolby and wife Dagmar who had been married for 47 years. She paid tribute to her husband saying that he 'did a lot of good for many music and film lovers' After graduating from Stanford . University, he left Ampex to study at Cambridge University. Following . his time as a United Nations adviser in India, he returned to England . and founded Dolby in London. In 1976, he moved to San Francisco where . the company established its headquarters. Dolby's co-workers described him as inspiring and thoughtful man, who cared passionately about engineering. 'To . be an inventor, you have to be willing to live with a sense of . uncertainty, to work in the darkness and grope toward an answer, to put . up with the anxiety about whether there is an answer,' Dolby once said. He is survived by his wife, Dagmar, his sons, Tom and David, their spouses, Andrew and Natasha, and four grandchildren. Lauded: Ray Dolby, pictured in 2012, receives an award for his work from the Hollywood Post Alliance . Dolby and his wife were active in philanthropy and supported numerous causes and organizations.

His family described Dolby as generous, patient, curious and fair. 'Though he was an engineer at heart, my father's achievements in technology grew out of a love of music and the arts,' said Tom Dolby, son, filmmaker and novelist.

Equal chances: Mike Fairclough, head of West Rise Junior School in Eastbourne, sent his pupils to learn how to shoot . A state school sparked a furious row today after admitting it took pupils as young as eight on a day's shooting trip. Thirty children from West Rise Junior School in Eastbourne aged eight to 11 were handed shotguns and taught how to shoot at clay pigeons with live ammunition. It was part of an event organised run by instructors from the British Association for Shooting and Conservation to help educate the youngsters about the countryside. But the move has been condemned by anti-guns campaigners, who argue that a young child is not mature enough to handle a weapon. Head teacher, Mike Fairclough, said the day's shooting in July helped educate children about the food chain and instilled skills such as self-discipline and commitment to a task. He told the Times Educational Supplement: 'We need to get beyond the Victorian, behind-desks model of education and get children actively involved. 'We are a successful school, rated good with excellent features by inspectors, because we teach this way.' Mr Fairclough said he also wanted to promote equal opportunities, as his catchment has a large proportion of children entitled to Free School Meals, an indicator of poverty. He wanted these children to have equal access to the opportunities, normally reserved for private school children. He said: 'It's about trust. We trust independent school children everywhere to shoot at this age, so why do we not trust children at state-run schools? 'Just because parents have more money, that does not mean the kids are any more reliable.' Mr Fairclough insisted that all the parents supporting the school's shooting day. 'There will always be those who disagree,' he said. 'But people should be trusted with the full picture on the issue so they can make an informed judgement. You never know, people may come to a conclusion that they previously didn't think possible.' BASC spokesman Simon Clarke stressed the organisation runs events like this for children regularly and its instructors were trained to the highest of standards. He said: 'We're not talking about Bill from the pub teaching them how to shoot. Our guys have very strict assessment procedures. 'Everything was under supervision, everything was safe, everything was responsible, and police approval was given for shooting on the land.' Mr Clarke added the youngsters were given instruction in how to use shotguns ranging in size from between 20 to 28 bore depending on the child using it. The shotguns have the capability to kill a small animal, such as a rabbit or a pigeon, although no live targets were used on the day. But Gill Marshall-Andrews of the UK's Gun Control Network condemned teaching young children to shoot. He said: 'GCN is absolutely committed to keeping guns away from children. Mr Fairclough said parents at the school, which is rated 'good' by Ofsted, supported the day trip . 'Guns are dangerous weapons, which are frequently misused. No child should be taught to shoot until the age of 18 when they assume adult rights and responsibilities.' Margaret Morrissey, founder of the family pressure group, Parents Outloud, added: 'I'm sure parents would agree that there are better places to take children such as sailing and climbing. 'I really think we're going down a dangerous road when we start introducing youngsters to guns or any sort of weapons and expecting them to understand that these are for recreational purposes - some will and a lot won't. 'There is no legal or physical barrier to teaching shooting from a young age, so why delay?' Mary Eveleigh, Preparatory Schools Rifle Association . 'We are putting information that may not be backed up with the right kind of support at home into very young children's hands.' The Preparatory Schools Rifle Association (PSRA) currently works with 43 prep schools and has 39 prep school members in the UK. Mary Eveleigh, secretary of the PSRA, said that shooting teaches children to control their emotions and to think about the consequences of their actions. She said: 'There is no legal or physical barrier to teaching shooting from a young age, so why delay? 'The benefits that shootings bring are as applicable to younger students as older ones; and there is an argument that the younger the benefits and skills that come from shooting are instilled, the better the long-term impact.' David Hanson, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, added: 'With niche sports such as archery and clay pigeon shooting, children can find an area outside the classroom where they can excel, which can be incredibly rewarding and also builds their confidence to be the best they can be across the entire curriculum.'

Amanda Knox's former boyfriend has claimed Italian police tried to bribe him into framing her for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher - and revealed his fears 'out of control' Knox would do the same to him. Raffaele Sollecito says 'sneaky' officers instigated a string of approaches from a prison guard, other inmates and even his family as he and his American lover were awaiting trial for the 21-year-old's murder in Perugia, Italy. But Italian Sollecito, 29, said he refused to point the finger of blame at Knox to save his own skin because he was 'really fond of her'. Hitting back: Raffaele Sollecito, who was accused of murdering Meredith Kercher, says the police's handling of his case was 'incompetent'. He claims he was blackmailed into framing Amanda Knox for the crime . Accused: Sollecito says he refused to comply with what police were suggesting because of his 'fondness' for Knox, pictured, and he wrote a letter from his prison cell to his family insisting he would stand by her . Yet he admits he was terrified Knox, who he had been dating for just a week before the 2007 killing, would do a deal to stitch him up because she was 'out of control'. Tragic: Meredith, 21, was killed in 2007. Sollecito and Knox were both convicted of her murder in 2009 and then cleared . Sollecito and Knox, 26, were convicted of Meredith’s murder in 2009 then cleared on appeal two years later. But Italy’s highest court later threw out the acquittals and the pair face a new trial, beginning later this month. Sollecito claimed detectives told him he would be released immediately if he distanced himself from Knox, saying he should pretend he couldn't remember anything or that he was sleeping in order for the prosecution to catch her. But Sollecito said in the Daily Mirror: 'They did not persuade me. It was the most sneaky situation. I couldn’t invent anything.' But he still 'feared Amanda' and added: 'I knew her for a short time, a week, and in reality I did not really know this woman. I was scared because she was out of control at the police station. She had been making crazy statements and everything was just wrong. 'I thought she could make a deal to blame me. I was scared of that.' Knox was jailed for 26 years and Sollecito for 25 following the trial in 2009. Italian Sollecito said the first 'deal' was when he was in solitary confinement and came about when he his father tried to speak to the proseuction and was told to pass on the message his son should keep his distance from Knox. Other family members urged Sollecito to take the deal and free himself, but he refused to be persuaded and wrote a letter to his nearest and dearest vowing to stand by Knox. Sollecito claimed police then began trying to get him to turn against Knox and that, unless he distanced himself from the American, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. He claims this message was passed to his family in no uncertain terms. His father was allegedly approached by a Perugia lawyer offering a similar deal. Close: Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito can be seen kissing in Italy shortly after they had been named as suspects in the murder of Miss Kercher . Prosecutors claimed that Leeds ­University exchange student Meredith had her throat slashed when a drug-fuelled sex game went wrong. Her grieving family, from Coulsdon, Surrey, were devastated when Knox and Sollecito were freed on appeal but vowed to keep Meredith’s memory alive. November,  2007  - Meredith Kercher is found dead in Perugia, ItalyOctober, 2008 - Rudy Guede convicted of sexually assaulting and murdering KercherDecember 2009 . - Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito found guilty of murdering Miss . Kercher. Miss Knox sentenced to 26 years in prison and Mr Sollecito to . 25. October 2011  -  After an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown outMarch 2013 - Italy’s highest criminal court ruled that an appeals court must re-hear the case against Miss Knox and Mr Sollecito . They have kept out of the public eye and refused to read the books that Knox and Sollecito wrote about their 'ordeal'. But in March the family welcomed news of the retrial and hoped they would finally get answers. No murder weapon was ever found, DNA tests were faulty and prosecutors provided no motive for murder. The pair, along with a third man, were accused of killing Meredith when she refused to participate in the sex game at her hillside home. In a series of confused interviews after their arrest Knox initially claimed to have witnessed the murder and named a local bar owner as the killer. She later withdrew the statement, insisting it had been made under duress, and said she had been at Sollecito’s student apartment throughout the night – which he confirmed. The pair met at a classical music concert and became lovers within hours. Meredith was murdered just a week later. Sollecito said the pair 'were like teenagers in a fantasy romance' but then became friends bonded by the tragedy. The couple were photographed being reunited in New York earlier this year – but he insists there is no romance. Sollecito is often asked if he wished he had never met Knox. He said: 'No, I don’t think like that. I don’t blame her, it is not her fault this nightmare. It is others.' And he claimed his own life is 'in limbo', and that he is without a home. He fears he is a target in Italy for those who still believe he and Knox were involved and worries police will try to seek revenge by planting drugs in his car. Fear: Sollecito, left, said his former girlfriend Amanda Knox, right, was 'out of contol' after their arrest . He has tried to settle in Lugano, Switzerland, and set up a computer software firm – but was kicked out by the Swiss authorities because he failed to disclose details of the murder charges. Sollecito then went to stay with relatives in the US and even got marriage proposals from female murder trial 'groupies'. He has now moved to a secret location in the Caribbean, where he is currently trying to establish a business.' Knox’s lawyers have insisted she will not be at the retrial in Florence and Sollecito said he will wait until after the first of eight scheduled hearings to see 'which way the court is going'. Victim: The pair were found guilty in December 2009 of murdering Meredith Kercher but after an 11-month appeal both convictions were thrown out in October 2011 . Sollecito feels victimised and slammed the police handling of the case, saying everything about the investigation was handled 'wrong' and that officers were 'incompetent' and 'fools'. Despite his own grievances, he insists he hasn't forgotten the pain of Meredith's family, saying he 'can't imagine their suffering'. But he urged them to read the case documents and ask questions about what really happened instead of sticking by the 'theory' of what happened. 'If you accept only the prosecution case you will never find what is right and what really happened,' he added.","Raffaele Sollecito claims officers warned him to 'distance himself' from Knox - or face life in prison .

Cabinet minister Ken Clarke said British voters should not become isolationist . Ken Clarke yesterday said British personnel should be sent to Syria to destroy the regime’s chemical weapons as he branded the public guilty of ‘isolationism’ for failing to back military action. The veteran Cabinet minister signalled that Britain is prepared to help police a deal to destroy Bashar al-Assad’s lethal stockpile after the dictator yesterday admitted he had weapons of mass destruction and was prepared to give them up. Government sources said a United Nations report to be published next week is expected to reveal fresh evidence that Assad’s regime fired sarin nerve gas last month, killing nearly 1,500 civilians. He ruled out sending in troops insisting he was ‘flatly against boots on the ground’ but said the UK must stand ready to implement the extraordinary Russian plan to put the chemical weapons beyond use. With US Congress poised to vote on missile strikes against the Assad regime this week, the Syrian government dramatically accepted a Russian proposal to turn over control of its chemical weapons to the international community. David Cameron has demanded a deadline be set for the plan to be enacted to prove it was a serious one. Speaking to journalists in Westminster today, Mr Clarke said: ‘I think we have got to be cautious, we have got to be careful. ‘We must ensure that this is genuinely going to remove these chemical weapons and then all these things can be decided. ‘But I think the British will be supportive of anything which genuinely looks like bringing an end to the threat of gas attacks and chemical weapons that is lurking there in Syria at the moment.’ Asked if that could mean weapons against from the British military being sent in to Syria, Mr Clarke replied: ‘I can’t think of any reason in principle why if British expertise is required, British expertise should not be involved. ‘As far as I am aware nobody has yet asked that question.' He went on: ‘I would always be flatly against boots on the ground in the Syrian civil war but actually experts in chemical warfare, if we were persuaded that we needed to make a contribution to their destruction, fine. ‘But at the moment we are at a very early stage. We have got to get the outcome we want without being perceived to be naïve about exactly the basis upon which it is going to proceed.’ While the diplomacy continues, the conflict rumbles on. A Syrian government solider is pictured in Maaloula village, northeast of the capital Damascus . Ken Clarke today backed George Osborne as a 'contender' to become the next Tory leader. He said the Chancellor is 'bound to be a contender at any stage'. But he insisted: 'I can think of nothing more harmful to the interest of my party or any of its members than to start speculating about that kind of thing.' He also warned London Mayor Boris Johnson not to get carried away with the media frenzy around his own leadership ambitions. 'I did give the advice to Boris when we had Boris Day at last year’s party conference , when the whole thing erupted far beyond I think what Boris expected . 'He arrived to find the whole place in mass media turmoil. My advice to him, if he has interests in the leadership, I would cool it.' Mr Clarke warned Britons against . 'isolationism' and said one of the big failures of the New Labour . government was the legacy of the Iraq war in making voters scepticial of . the need to intervene overseas in the national interest. Rebel forces dismissed the Russian proposal as ‘a cheap trick to buy time for the regime to kill more and more people’. Any deal with Syria to hand over its chemical weapons in the middle of a chaotic civil war would be difficult for inspectors to enforce and destroying them would likely take years, U.S. officials and experts caution. Syria's strongest backer, Russia, proposed on Monday that Damascus save itself from a U.S. military strike over its alleged use of chemical weapons by putting its stockpiles under international control. The proposal was welcomed by Syria and seized upon by the secretary-general of the United Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama said the offer was a potential breakthrough but had to be handled with scepticism. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said there had to be an end to the military conflict. He told LBC 97.3: ‘You can’t sort of hermetically seal Syria; that’s just not realistic. ‘So at the end of the day, you have to really pressure these two sides to recognise that there is no resolution to this militarily. ‘And here is always a big difficulty with conflict, is if the sides in the conflict don’t want peace as much as the outside world, it’s always going to be a bit of a struggle. ‘They’ve got to at some point recognise that they’re on a hiding to nothing by carrying on this conflict.'","Ken Clarke says UK should support 'anything' to end gas attacks .

UN representative Raquel Rolnik stayed in a £300-a-night hotel despite her earlier concerns for those struggling with the 'bedroom tax' The United Nations official who condemned Britain’s housing policy chose only the best UK accommodation for herself, it has emerged. Raquel Rolnik stayed at a four-star hotel where the cheapest room costs £300 a night while preparing a report claiming the so-called ‘bedroom tax’ meant people were going hungry to pay their rent. The UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing was put up in the Rubens at the Palace Hotel in the shadow of Buckingham Palace, where diners can spend thousands on a single bottle of wine. She shunned hotels far closer to the UN offices she used, which had rooms for less than half the price. Mrs Rolnik’s 12-day mission was paid for by the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which is supported by British taxes. Around £22million of the foreign aid budget has gone to the organisation in the past six years. Tory MPs labelled Mrs Rolnik an ‘international trougher’ and called for a rethink after cash intended for the world’s poorest was used to support attacks on British policy. Clacton MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘People like this come with an agenda and never seem to be able to see that they are hypocrites.’ Mrs Rolnik’s report demanded abolition of the ‘bedroom tax’ – a housing benefit curb for those with extra rooms who claim a spare room subsidy. It criticised the Government for encouraging home ownership and called for rent controls, security for renters, and new social housing. Mrs Rolnik said she met ‘many people who are increasingly having to choose between food and paying the penalty’, grandmothers forced from homes and single parents with no space for their children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called Sao Paulo-born Mrs Rolnik ‘a loopy Brazilian Leftie’ and said ‘her actions undermine the impartiality of the UN’. Luxury: The four-star Rubens Hotel close to Buckingham Palace where Rolnik dined and stayed . The trip was made on Mrs Rolnik’s own initiative and accepted by the Government as a matter of protocol. She spent several nights, two this week, at the Rubens, which is one of Britain’s top 40 hotels. It is popular with senior police officers and often hosts functions that attract royal appearances. While Mrs Rolnik wrote about housing benefit claimants who  go without food, she could enjoy a  restaurant whose signature dish, Dover sole with potatoes and chive lemon butter, costs £35. A white burgundy can set a diner back more than £100, while a fine claret,  Chateau Petrus 2000, costs £2,460. The rules of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights say its budget ‘allows for two country visits for each expert’ per year. A spokesman in London confirmed the UN paid for Mrs Rolnik’s visit. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is run on voluntary donations from UN countries. Its latest financial report says it is ‘stretched to breaking point’. The Department for International Development plans to continue  giving £2.5million a year to the Geneva-based UN agency in the wake of a review that said it had ‘a critical role in meeting international and UK development objectives’ – but ‘a number of reforms needed to take place to further strengthen the organisation’. A second review is set for this year. The spending comes from the  foreign aid budget, which will grow to more than £11billion in 2015. Critics say the Prime Minister has upped spending to try to soften the Tories’ ‘nasty party’ reputation. Mr Carswell said: ‘The aid budget is a way in which poor people in Britain pay for the lifestyles of rich people in developing countries. ‘We are having to pay taxes to put this international trougher up in a four-star hotel. People like Mrs  Rolnik never seem to grasp that we have elections so people can decide these matters for themselves.’","Raquel Rolnik stayed at the four-star Rubens at the Palace Hotel .

Celebratory drink: Michael Le Vell plans to sue the Crown Prosecution Service to reclaim almost £200,000 in legal costs spent clearing his name . Innocent Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell plans to sue the Crown Prosecution Service to reclaim his huge legal costs, after the battle to clear his name left him almost £200,000 out of pocket. The star, real name Michael Turner, fell victim to changes in Ministry of Justice rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the ‘reasonable’ costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty. The 48-year-old was accused of raping and sexually assaulting a teenage girl but was cleared by a jury last week in under five hours. And now the TV star hopes to reclaim the enormous legal costs amid questions over whether the case should ever have been brought to trial in the first place. A friend of the actor said he planned to ‘fight’ for justice after two years of hell, adding: ‘Mike and his entire family have suffered – not just mentally but financially throughout this farcical trial. ‘It is not just the substantial legal fees to worry about – there is also the damaging effect the trial will have on him for the rest of his life and career. ‘There have been early discussions between him and his legal counsel and they have agreed that they have not finished working together.’ And another TV insider stressed that while soap actors are ‘reasonably well paid’, they are not as wealthy as many would believe. The source added: ‘The estimates about what TV actors get paid for appearing in soaps are usually hugely exaggerated. 'Of course they are on comfortable salaries, but not enough to fund something like this.’ The case against the actor was initially dropped by the CPS in January 2012 due to a lack of evidence, after he was arrested in September 2011. But on February 14 this year Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions, announced that she had reviewed the decision and authorised Greater Manchester Police to charge Le Vell. Out of pocket: The star fell victim to changes in Ministry of Justice rules made in 2011 which removed the right of defendants to have the 'reasonable' costs of hiring a lawyer reimbursed if they are found not guilty . An insider at the Ministry of Justice admitted it would be possible for the actor to bring a case against the CPS, explaining: ‘It depends on the individual circumstances of a case, but it is certainly a possibility. ‘The rules were changed in 2011 to prevent the taxpayer footing large bills for those who can afford to pay for their own defence. ‘Legal aid is means tested and the vast majority of cases in crown courts are funded that way.’ The trial has also seen many members of Mr Le Vell’s family incur huge travel costs – some of them flying over from Australia to support him as he faced 12 charges at Manchester Crown Court.","Right of cleared defendants to have legal costs reimbursed went in 2011 .

The minimum wage should be increased by more than 10 per cent as part of a drive to force up pay for all workers, senior Liberal Democrats said today. Business Secretary Vince Cable said the £6.19 hourly rate for adult workers had been outstripped by the rising cost of living and was now worth the same in real terms as in 2004. And Treasury minister Danny Alexander said the Government would put pressure on employers to end years of pay freezes to ensure all staff enjoy the economic recovery. Increase: Vince Cable, left, says workers should be paid in line with the current economy and Danny Alexander, left, said the Government would work to end pay freezes . The Lib Dem annual conference gets under . way in Glasgow today with a heavy focus on jobs and wages, with the . coalition under pressure to improve living standards as the economic . growth builds momentum. In a co-ordinated series of announcements, senior Lib Dem ministers lined up to promise more help to push up wages. Latest figures show that while the CPI rate of inflation shows the cost of living rising by 2.8 per cent, earnings are only 1.1 per cent up on this time last year. But with a run of strong economic indicators and Chancellor George Osborne boasting the economics has ’turned a corner’, ministers are under pressure to show ordinary people will start to see an improvement in their own incomes. Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander insisted workers should share in the success of business. Recovery: Nick Clegg will tonight describe how his party helped secure the current economic boost . He told the Daily Telegraph: ’It's not for me as a Treasury minister to start telling employers what their pay policies should be, that's a matter for firms. ’But of course, as growth returns to our economy and we see businesses being successful, the workforce will want to and should share in that success.’ However, Mr Alexander warned any pay rises would only be seen in the private sector, wi several years more of austerity for public sector staff. ’We are going to have to continue controlling spending to ensure the country stays on the right track,’ he said. The idea is likely to attract scepticism form many employers who are still struggling to stay afloat. The Federation of Small Businesses has warned that many small firms are still unable to obtain loans from banks to take expand or invest in staff. However the Government could boost pay across the board by dramatically increasing the minimum wage. The Lib Dems are also committed to raising the income tax threshold to ensure that people on the minimum wage pay no tax at all, although this would be a pledge for the 2015 election. Mr Cable, the Business Secretary, said is to ask the Low Pay Commission to restore its value, which he calculates has fallen in real terms by 10-12 per cent since the crash of 2008, He told the Guardian: ’We cannot go on for ever in a low pay and low productivity world in which all we can say to workers is “you have got to take a wage cut to keep your job”.’ The measures to combat low pay will also involve steps to tackle the abuses of zero-hours contracts. Mr Cable added: ’We have got to enter into a different kind of workplace. ’For a very long time, five or six years, wages have been suppressed in low wage sectors. I am sending a signal that we are entering a very different environment.’ After a series of dire opinion calls, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg will tonight seek to claim credit for his party’s role in securing the economic recovery. Potential: The Lib Dems are expected to announce plans to combat youth unemployment . While he is expected to use the conference to target his Tory coalition partners’ attempts to tear up employment laws, he will highlight a Lib Dem drive to create a million new jobs in the economy. At a rally in Glasgow tonight he will say: ’We are the ones that can campaign as the party of jobs. ’We are the only party that believes in releasing the potential of everyone, creating a society where everybody gets a fair chance in life. ’And that means making sure they get the opportunity to find work. ’We know that unemployment isn't just about statistics or a rising bill for benefits. ’It's about ambitions thwarted, potential frustrated, and the spirit-crushing sense that you are not being allowed to take control of your own destiny. ’And youth unemployment, where people can find themselves left on the scrapheap without even having been given the chance to prove themselves, is a scourge we must tackle. ’But the Liberal Democrats have a proud story to tell on jobs and the economy. ’We can tell people how we took the right decisions in government to make sure interest rates were kept down and to protect people from the economic crises we have seen elsewhere in Europe.’ Chuka Umunna, Labour’s shadow business secretary, said: ’Vince Cable talks about increasing the minimum wage, but you can't trust a word the Lib Dems say. ’At every turn they have supported making it easier to fire not hire people at work, and under their Government people have been left £1,500 worse off.’","Business Secretary asks watchdog to investigate £6.12 hourly rate increase .

Split: Helen Fielding pictured with her former partner, Kevin Curran, at the British Academy Film Awards at The Odeon Leicester Square, London, in 2002 . Wearing dark glasses and striding across the dreary London streets in her yoga trousers, she could be any other harried mother on the school run. But Helen Fielding, 55, hasn’t much in common with other North London mums. It’s not just the expensive highlights or £13,000 gold Cartier watch which set her apart from her contemporaries, it’s that she is what her alter‑ego Bridget Jones would call a ‘singleton’ in a sea of smug marrieds. Her relationship status isn’t the only thing causing the multi-millionairess the odd sleepless night. Her principal worry is: does anyone want to hear from Bridget Jones again? For after more than a decade of complete obscurity, Fielding has written a new Bridget Jones book, Mad About The Boy, which will be published next month. The first book, which depicted the life of perennially single thirtysomething Bridget — who memorably chronicled her weight and alcohol consumption each day in her diary with notes such as ‘130lb (terrifying slide into obesity — why? why?), alcohol units 6 (excellent)’ — sold more than 16 million copies. The novel spawned a 1999 sequel, Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason, and two films — not to mention a whole genre of copycat, less-than-brilliant novels about thirtysomethings waiting for Mr Right — and made Fielding a £30 million fortune. Following her success, Fielding moved to Los Angeles, where she had two children with Kevin Curran, a television executive on The Simpsons, and virtually retired from writing. Today, she is so fabulously wealthy that she is in the fortunate position of needing to work only if she cares to. So why the return to Bridget and to Britain? Helen said earlier this year that she had ‘surprised’ herself by starting to write a new Bridget Jones’s diary. ‘After the books and the movies I sort of lost my voice; I got all self-conscious. I didn’t want to just churn out another one. I really care about Bridget, about her as a character and about her integrity,’ she said. Renee Zellweger starring in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason - Helen Fielding always denied the character was based on her . ‘But suddenly, about a year ago, I had a story again. I was finding things funny and writing things in my diary, and it started turning into a book.’ The plot of the upcoming novel is a closely guarded secret, but the famous daily headings about alcohol, cigarettes and weight will be a thing of the past. Instead, Helen hints that Bridget is obsessed with Twitter. And gone are the days when all Bridget had to worry about was the circumference of her thighs, for she will be a mother to more than one child in her new incarnation. Fielding said: ‘She is older, so in the same way as I was looking at being a single thirtysomething in Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason, now I’m looking at being older . . . and, yes, looking at motherhood. ‘Where Bridget was trying to be a better girl or sex goddess, to be thinner and eat less, now she’s basically trying not to lose the children by checking her Twitter followers while they are up a tree or something. ‘Motherhood is certainly a rich seam of comedy. But she does keep the children alive throughout the book, otherwise that would rather spoil it.’ While loyal fans will clearly rejoice at the prospect of a new instalment of Bridget’s life, Helen is said to be ‘nervous’ about how it will be received when it is published next month — worried enough to ask the opinion of her teenage goddaughter, Scarlett, who happens to also be the daughter of screenwriter Richard Curtis. Goodbye to Hollywood: Helen Fielding pictured at the arrives at the 59th Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills, California in 2002 . Scarlett, thankfully, was positive and bolstered her godmother’s fragile ego. But, sadly, the wider reaction to news of more Bridget Jones has been mixed, with some dismissing her heroine as irrelevant, irritating and old hat. Indeed, the real reason for Fielding putting pen to paper, and hopping on a plane back to Britain, seems nothing to celebrate. She has abandoned her LA life — which included lunching with her best friend, the actress and author Carrie Fisher, and British actress Tracey Ullman — because her relationship with Curran has ended. She quietly separated from him back in 2009. The pair met in 2000 when she was on an LA-based publicity tour for Bridget Jones and he just happened to be lingering in the lobby of her hotel. They swiftly moved in together, and Fielding upped sticks and left London. Helen Fielding has left Los Angeles where her best friends included A-listers such as Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher (left) and British actress Tracey Ullman (right) She had experienced a series of unhappy romances in her 30s, once remarking that she’d had more than one Daniel Cleaver — the bad boy in Bridget Jones — in her life. But with Curran, who had been married and divorced before, it seemed she had found a late-blooming ‘happy ever after’. She said that he was ‘very sweet’ and ‘very funny’.  Baby Dashiell, named after the crime writer Dashiell Hammett, was born in 2004. Curran proposed marriage when she was 48 and pregnant with their second baby, Romy, who was born in 2006. She said at the time: ‘It was a surprise. [Kevin] said he’d got me a present, but I thought it was a slow cooker because I’d been going on about it.’ In fact, they never married — Helen claimed that she was enjoying being engaged too much to spoil it. The couple lived a lovely life of pampered seclusion in Hollywood, where her home is just around the corner from Keanu Reeves’s, and took holidays in Barbados with friends, or at five-star resorts in Mexico. Helen loved her champagne, her pool and the waving palms. Helen Fielding, pictured, can also be 'quite the diva'. But then, one person's diva is another person's successful woman . She looked giddily happy at various Hollywood events and was regularly seen having dinner at the Chateau Marmont with Curran, whose silver hair makes him look older than he is. One Hollywood friend tells me that she and Curran made a ‘wonderful couple’, but adds: ‘He is one of those people who doesn’t suffer fools gladly at all, and she can also be quite the diva — she has a sense of how important she is.’ But then, one person’s diva is another person’s successful woman. Indeed, Fielding, a Yorkshire girl who attended St Anne’s College, Oxford, can be quite assertive. She took on the estate agent and the surveyor who sold them their home after the leaky roof collapsed. And one friend of hers, who I contacted this week, was extremely anxious about Fielding ‘hitting the roof’ over publicity. Another, who has been involved in the Bridget Jones movies, says that Fielding has a reputation for being uncompromising — or ‘difficult’ — when it comes to anything creative. There were ‘really major bloody rows’ over both films and also the mooted stage play, which nearly reached the West End this year but has been delayed until at least next year. There have also been arguments over the possible third Bridget Jones movie, which the film company Working Title has been beavering away on for years now without coming close to shooting. As far as Curran goes, neither has disclosed what caused the end of their relationship. A source close to the family tells me that they remain ‘good friends’ and that Fielding has kept her £2.2 million cream-painted home in Los Angeles so that the children can go to see Curran in the holidays. ‘They are still very good friends. He comes over, while they see him when they go over,’ she said. For her part, Fielding has moved into a tall £2.5 million Georgian townhouse in North London, with a nanny for company in the daytime. She has been quietly moving among the local mums, most of them a decade her junior, for two years now. Apparently she rather sticks out at the school gate, with her lovely blow-dry and penchant for leather trousers and Prada bags — and lack of a husband. There seems to be no new man on the scene for Fielding. Her lifestyle is back to that of the resolute singleton. She is seen out with various good female friends, but never with a man in tow. In January, she took a holiday with another married couple and her children in Oman. Recently, she took another holiday with her old friend Mariella Frostrup, who is a key member of her London circle. Like her, Mariella came late to motherhood, and she left her husband behind in London to go on a mums-only holiday with Fielding. Helen Fielding signing copies of 'Bridget Jones Diary' - she has been inspired to write Bridget Jones as a single mum of two children who is navigating the dating scene . It’s no surprise, then, that Fielding has been inspired to write Bridget Jones as a single mum of two children who is navigating the dating scene. She said: ‘The book will explore this whole world of internet dating where there’s all these cyber-presences who aren’t actually real. ‘And texting. People can have entire relationships via text which are, in some ways, emotionally fulfilling and serve the purpose of a boyfriend, apart from sex.’ If she has had her own dabble with a cyber-romance, then it certainly hasn’t produced a Mr Right. But then, while she has always denied that the character of Bridget is based on herself, maybe the role of perpetual singleton does suit Helen Fielding, after all.","She is what her alter‑ego Bridget Jones would call a ‘singleton’ in a sea of smug marrieds .

But at the end of an eight-day trial a jury exonerated Le Vell, delivering not guilty verdicts to all 12 charges after just five hours of deliberation. Mrs Glenis, 60, told the Sunday Mirror how . the family were left 'shattered' by the allegations her brother faced. 'I think the girl's mother deliberately set out to destroy Michael,' she . said.

And Michael is no monster.' 'It would take a monster to do what they said. And Michael is no monster' Glenis Gill, Michael Le Vell's sister . Meanwhile, Le Vell's brother Phil Turner told The Sun on Sunday: ‘He is so forgiving, after everything he's been through. He is a guy who can turn the other cheek. He forgives in a moment. He can forgive the person making the allegations for sure, without a doubt. 'His exact words when I was with him yesterday were: “If she walked in here I would say, why has all this come about?” The lies against Michael are a hard thing for anyone to forgive - but he has done that.’ During the week-long trial, Le Vell . was forced to open up about intimate details of his private life, . admitting to being an alcoholic who cheated on his wife, Janette .

February, is expected to make a decision about his return in the coming . days, as he considers the deal over the weekend. Michael’s . return to the soap, which he has starred in since 1983, is said to be . contingent on the actor’s drinking habits after he admitted to being an . alcoholic during his trial. ‘Michael . is an absolute professional,’ a source told The Mirror, ‘but he . needs to resolve issues in his life – and his dependency on alcohol is a . problem that must be addressed.’ But on . February 14 this year Alison Levitt QC, principal legal adviser to the .

A friend of the actor . told The Mail On Sunday he planned to ‘fight’ for justice, adding: . ‘Mike and his entire family have suffered – not just mentally but . financially throughout this farcical trial. ‘It . is not just the substantial legal fees to worry about – there is also . the damaging effect the trial will have on him for the rest of his life . and career. ‘There have been . early discussions between him and his legal counsel and they have . agreed that they have not finished working together.’ Le Vell's sisters also revealed that is also gearing up to the difficult task of rebuilding his relationship with his son and daughter, who he has not seen since the allegations emerged. Mrs Westcott told how Christmas and birthdays had been especially difficult for Le Vell, and that he had missed not being able to go to watch his son play football. But despite the ordeal, Mrs Gill added, their brother was beginning to recover some of his previous love for life, returning to what she described as his 'cheeky-chappy self'.","Coronation Street actor made comments to sisters after dramatic acquittal .

Trouble: Ed Miliband's senior Labour colleagues have challenged his election strategy . Britain's reviving economic fortunes have plunged Ed Miliband’s Election strategy into chaos – as senior Labour colleagues challenge his plans for driving David Cameron from power. The disagreements spilled out at a Shadow Cabinet meeting called to discuss how to reverse the decline in Labour’s fortunes in what has been a torrid summer for their leader. Defence spokesman Jim Murphy threw down the gauntlet by insisting that the party had to revise its message now that the economy was clearly recovering. He clashed with Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls by insisting Labour could no longer argue the economy was ‘flat-lining’ – a taunt made famous by Mr Balls. Sources say the Shadow Chancellor retorted that there was no guarantee the economic upturn would last. Mr Murphy then aimed a thinly veiled criticism at Mr Miliband for avoiding a full-scale clash with unions at the TUC conference the day before. And the rows continued over the leadership’s plans to focus on attacking the Prime Minister for being privileged. The meeting was shown polling evidence that the PM is vulnerable to accusations of being out of touch with hard-pressed families. Criticism: Defence spokesman Jim Murphy, pictured left in Helmand Province with Ed Miliband, insisted the party had to revise its strategy at a Shadow Cabinet meeting . Their line, strategy director Greg Beales told the meeting, would be that he is ‘for the few, not the many’. One observer said that Ivan Lewis, the Shadow International Development Secretary, then asked whether that meant they would no longer attack the PM as being incompetent or arrogant. ‘But Miliband simply deferred to Beales, who repeated that polling shows it works to go on about how Cameron is only interested in a small minority of well-off types.’","Disagreements over party strategy aired at a Shadow Cabinet meeting .

Unlucky: The unfortunate bird caused the plane to overshoot the runway and smash into a barrier, before landing in a safety net . The crash, which has incredibly left both instructor and pupil unscathed, happened at Mona airfield in mid-Anglesey at 10.50am yesterday. The strip, which is used by trainee pilots, is based at Valley RAF station a few miles away - the same base where Prince William worked as a rescue helicopter pilot until this week. The Hawk T1 plane, powered by a Rolls-Royce turbofan engine, is used by trainee pilots to practise takeoffs and touchdowns. It first entered service with the RAF in 1976, both as an advanced flying-training aircraft and a weapons-training aircraft. Today, the all-metal, low-wing aircraft is used at the Valley base for fast-jet pilot advanced flying training. It is also used by RAF Aerobatic Team and the Red Arrows. A Defence Ministry spokesman said: 'The aircraft was carrying out a practice forced landing. When on the runway, it hit a bird and went into the barrier.' It isn't the first time a stray animal has caused an aircraft potentially deadly problems. In 2010, a plane crashed after an escaped crocodile wreaked havoc on board - killing a British co-pilot and 19 others. The small plane was thrown off balance by a stampede of passengers trying to avoid the reptile.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 18:03 EST, 13 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:20 EST, 14 September 2013 . Family doctors are unhappy about their pay despite seeing fewer patients at evenings and weekends, according to a major report. The proportion of surgeries which open on Saturdays and Sundays has fallen by a third in two years, while there has been a seven per cent drop in those offering evening appointments. Yet GPs are unhappier with their jobs than ever before – and particularly with their pay. Unhappy: One in five GPs want more money and one in ten are thinking of quitting medicine altogether . More than one in five, or 22.5 per cent, are ‘dissatisfied’ with salaries, and one in ten are so unhappy with their careers overall that they are considering quitting. Family doctors earn £104,000 a year on average and their pay has increased by 50 per cent from a decade ago thanks to a lucrative deal agreed by Labour that allowed them to opt out of out-of-hours work. The contract, introduced in 2004, also lets them earn bonuses by monitoring patients with certain long-term conditions. As a result of the agreement, most surgeries now subcontract out-of-hours work to private firms, which critics fear are more concerned with profits than patient care. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in the process of negotiating a new contract with GPs, which could see a return to routine out-of-hours work. The study by the University of  Manchester, commissioned by the Department of Health, found just 22.5 per cent of GPs do any out-of-hours shifts. Those who do take on only four hours a week on average. The survey of 1,189 GPs found 10 per cent work at weekends, down from 15 per cent two years ago. Ten years ago, before the Labour contract, nearly all GPs worked out of hours, with those at smaller practices on call several nights a week. Roger Goss of campaign group Patient Concern said: ‘It’s ludicrous, our GPs are amongst the best-paid in the world. 'GP services and the NHS are meant to be all about continuity of care, yet this has been destroyed by family doctors being able to opt out of working out  of hours. ‘Most patients – especially the  elderly – want to see the same doctor but the present situation means they have to explain their problems to an unfamiliar face every single time. ‘In many areas the GP services are appalling.’ Renegotiation: Health secretary Jeremy Hunt is drawing up new contracts with GPs . Only a third of GPs (32 per cent) said their surgery opened on Saturdays and Sundays, compared to 39 per cent two years earlier. And 76 per cent offered evening appointments, down from 81 per cent two years ago. The lack of availability of GPs has been partly blamed for the crisis in A&E departments, with soaring numbers of patients turning up as they don’t know where else to go. This week the Health Secretary told GPs to provide better care for elderly and vulnerable patients to keep them out of casualty. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘There is no doubt patients are finding it extremely hard to get an appointment. 'People also tell us that their once-friendly GP now has little time for conversation. ‘It seems as if GPs are at a very low ebb and they are being expected to provide more care for vulnerable patients outside of hospital without being given the necessary resources.’ The research, which was carried out through questionnaires, found 8.9 per cent of GPs are considering quitting or moving to a managerial role. GPs’ stress levels, measured on a scale of one to seven, are the highest since the survey began in 2000, having steadily increased across 15 categories including workload, dealing with complaints and long hours. Meanwhile 22.5 per cent of GPs said they were unhappy with their pay and 36.7 per cent with their hours of work. Family doctors say that although they do not have to work out-of-hours, their job is becoming harder because patients are older, frailer and often have a number of serious illnesses that need monitoring. In addition, they warn increases in paperwork and targets leave them less time to see patients. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the GPs committee chairman at doctors’ union the British Medical Association, said: ‘General practice is under real pressure from spiralling patient demand, especially from an ageing population, and falling resources. ‘Recent increases in targets and pointless box ticking have added another damaging level of bureaucracy that is diverting valuable time away from treating patients. GPs want to work with the Government to improve patient care and to be freed from the administrative nightmare that is adding unnecessary  workload to an already overstretched service.’ Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie, who sits on the Health Select Committee, said: ‘GPs are under incredible stress and there is a flood of new demand. ‘This is partly due to the aging population but also younger patients are more aware of their rights and are more inclined to argue back.’ Mr Hunt is currently negotiating a new GPs’ contract with  doctors’ organisations including the BMA. The details will be announced later this year. Stunning: Dr Simon Fradd, pictured here as Master of a City livery company, helped negotiate the deal . He has a £1.6million apartment overlooking the Thames and a handsome income from his private healthcare firm. In 2004, Dr Simon Fradd and his British Medical Association colleagues helped forge the deal securing their members a 50 per cent pay rise. The deal also allowed GPs to give up out-of-hours work. For more than half a century that responsibility was at the heart of GPs’ contract of care. But the Labour government let them opt out, docking them just £6,000 each. ‘It was just stunning really,’ Dr Fradd, 63, said in 2007. ‘Stunning in that no one in my position had ever believed we could pull it off.’ He had at first thought GPs’ pay would be docked up to £50,000 if they wanted to opt out of working out-of-hours. Dr Fradd then set up Concordia Health to offer those very same services, only now at a profit to himself.","Number of surgeries open on the weekends has fallen by seven per cent .

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani could be freed without charge after a new investigation has claimed his wife Anni was shot 'by accident'. Police claim that Dewani hired a . team of hit men to kill his new bride while holidaying in Cape Town, . but the businessman has always maintained he was forced from a taxi by thugs who . hijacked and killed his wife. But now ballistics experts claim the bullet which killed Anni may have rebounded off her hand and hit her chest by accident 'during a struggle'. She was found dead in the abandoned vehicle the next day. Review: Shrien Dewani is fighting a High Court battle against extradition to South Africa. New evidence by ballistics experts could clear him with claims his wife Anni was shot by accident . Dewani, 33, is currently fighting extradition to South Africa, where he faces trial for the November 2010 killing. But this review could alter his case dramatically. Firearms experts at the Forensic Firearms Consultancy in London told the MailOnline they were commissioned to review the evidence, which they claim appears to show the bullet hit 28-year-old Anni by accident. A post mortem examination showed the fatal bullet struck the Swedish newlywed's left hand and went through her chest, causing fatal neck injuries. Couple: Shrien and Anni Dewani at their wedding. Two weeks later, she was found shot in a taxi near Cape Town . After a second look at the documents, a source from the ballistics team behind the investigation told the Daily Mirror: 'The evidence would appear to support the theory that Mrs Dewani was shot during a struggle.' Questions have also been raised over Dewani's role in the scandal after a review of the initial police interviews found the he was not mentioned, the paper reported today. The findings will screened by BBC Panorama this Thursday, along with a suggestion that Dewani was embroiled in the case by the 'desperate' taxi driver, Zola Tongo, in a bid to get a lighter sentence. It is a dramatic twist that could mean freedom for Dewani, who is in a psychiatric hospital in Bristol while he fights extradition at the Supreme Court. But the bride's grieving family have berated the BBC for taking the trial into their own hands. Uncle Ashok Hindocha said: 'The trial should not be conducted in a TV studio it should be in the courts.' Tongo and gunmen Xolile Mngeni and Mziwamadoda Qwabe have all been jailed after pleading guilty. Anni and Shrien Dewani had married in . lavish style in India a fortnight before she was killed. They arrived in Cape Town on 14 November 2010 and, after a three-day stay in the north, they had flown . south to continue their honeymoon at the five-star, £500-a-night Cape . Grace Hotel. At 8pm the next day, taxi driver Zola Tongo arrived outside the hotel to collect them and the . Dewanis. Tongo took the . couple on a short drive around Cape Town’s major city sights and then . turned the taxi onto the N2 motorway. They drove for 45 minutes . away from the city, ending up in the seaside town of Strand, where they . ate sushi in a . shopping mall. Back in the car, at 10.45pm, they drove into a shanty town where they were accosted by two gunmen. Within minutes Tongo was told to get . out. After a terrifying 20-minute joyride through the townships, the . hijackers told Dewani to leave, too. But Anni was ordered to stay. Anni with her father, Vimod Hindocha. Her family has berated the BBC for conducting the trial in a TV studio . Dewani . remained unharmed, and stumbled around in the dark until he was helped . by local man Simbonile Matokazi, who contacted the police. It was . exactly 11.12pm. By sunrise . the following day, the body of Anni, 28, was discovered slumped in the . back of the abandoned taxi in a remote corner of the Khayelitsha . township. She’d been shot with a single bullet to the neck from a 7.62mm . calibre pistol. A former acting High Court judge in South Africa, Paul Hoffman, told the Mirror Dewani's fate rests on Tongo's evidence. Mr . Hoffman added that the court was under pressure to conclude the case to . prevent British tourists boycotting the Western Cape. He said: 'The Western Cape relies on UK tourism. Britons being killed by . taxi drivers doesn't look good.' A judge last month ruled at Westminster . Magistrates’ Court that Dewani should be extradited, rejecting his . attempt to stay in the UK for further hospital treatment for mental . health problems. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle had . already given the go-ahead to Dewani’s extradition in 2011 but was . forced to reconsider the position after two senior High Court judges . allowed an appeal in March last year. They were told Dewani was suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen’s . Bench Division, and Mr Justice Ouseley said it would be 'unjust and . oppressive' to remove him until he recovered. Last month, Judge Riddle said Dewani was . still not fit to plead or stand trial at present, but there was evidence . that he would receive the care he needed in South Africa.

Nick Clegg tonight pleaded with his party to unite behind him, as Lembit Opik made fresh calls for the Lib Dem leader to quit. Writing for MailOnline, ex-MP Mr Opik warned that without a new leader the Lib Dems faced ‘destruction’. In a damning assessment of the Deputy Prime Minister’s performance, Mr Opik claims that if the party were a business ‘he’d have been fired a long ago’. Clash: Ex-Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said it was 'nothing personal' but Nick Clegg has to quit as Lib Dem leader . The searing criticism from one of the Lib Dems’ best known figures comes after peer Lord Oakeshott warned the Lib Dems could be reduced to just 20 seats at the next election and called for Mr Clegg to quit. Mr Clegg sought to brush off the attack from a long-standing critics, insisting: ‘He tends to always do so like clockwork at this time of year. ‘When it's conference and the weather turns bad, up pops Matthew Oakeshott with some disobliging remarks about me.’ Tonight in an address to the party faithful in Glasgow, Mr Clegg tried to ignore his critics and instead urged ‘unity’. ‘Since our party was formed, every step of our journey has been taken together,’ he said. ‘We have decided the policies, fought the campaigns and taken on the vested interests. ‘We decided, together, to go into government. People who don’t understand us like to call debate division. ‘I think it is debate that give us our unity. Unity about what we want to see for our country.’ But after three and a half years in government, many Lib Dems remain deeply uneasy about the power-sharing deal. With the party stubbornly stuck at around 10 per cent in the polls, behind UKIP, there are fears many MPs will be lost at the 2015 election. Blue: Mr Clegg, who was greeted by business minister Jo Swinson in Glasgow, has sought to laugh off calls for his resignation . Mr Opik, who has called for a new leader before, warns the party will be lucky to retain half of its 57 seats with Mr Clegg in charge. He writes: ‘I’ve got nothing against Nick Clegg personally.  It’s purely business. ‘And the truth is, if the Liberal Democrats were a business, he’d have been fired a long ago. ‘No ‘Chief Executive Officer’ could survive such terrible performance indicators: a catastrophic decline in membership, a virtual halving of local Councillors, a dreadful deposit-losing London mayoral result and the worst poll ratings in over two decades.’ However, Mr Opik himself was the butt of a series of jokes in the conference hall. Kirsty Williams, Lib Dem leader in Wales, backed the party's campaign for 1million extra jobs, saying: 'Why do we need to keep talking about jobs, jobs and more jobs? We need to find Lembit one.' Pressure: Mr Clegg used a speech at the party conference in Glasgow to issue a plea for unity . The former MP for Montgomeryshire wants Mr Clegg to announce his resignation as leader, while continuing as Deputy Prime Minister. He went on: ‘Clegg has already done irreparable damage to Lib Dem prospects in the next General Election – making his stated goal of doubling the number of MPs a risible joke. ‘Clegg’s legacy will then be nothing less than the destruction of decades of effort by me and other activists, only to have seen our investment evaporate in five short years.’ However allies of the Deputy Prime Minister have made clear they think the party needs to ‘grow up’ and accept the tough responsibilities of being in government. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne urged left-leaning Lib Dems to stop attacking the government they serve in. In a thinly-veiled barb aimed at the likes of Vince Cable and Tim Farron who boast of being unhappy about the coalition, Mr Browne said: ‘We cannot be half-in Government and half-out. We cannot claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us. ‘We cannot be in the Government but campaign against the Government at the same time. ‘The Liberal Democrats are an independent party and we will stand on our own manifesto, but we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in Government. No foot dragging. ‘No craving the easy gesture politics of opposition. No fence sitting. We have risen to the challenge and we have served our country well. We deserve to stay in office and continue our positive work. ‘The Liberal Democrats should be proud of our Government.’","Deputy Prime Minister urges his party to take pride in being in government .

Audacious: Father-of-one Robinson demanded a four-bedroom house with period features with at least 15 acres of land overlooking the Welsh valleys in a bid to make a fresh start . But just weeks after the show was filmed in May, Robinson was jailed for 30 months for eight counts of abusing a child – thought to be just 15 – in his London home and one count of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. He had been charged with the crimes a year before filming began. The episode followed Robinson and his partner’s quest to find a rural home with enough land to live off and in order to become alpaca farmers. Father-of-one Robinson demanded a four-bedroom house with period features with at least 15 acres of land overlooking the Welsh valleys. Aspirations: Robinson asked the show to find him a house in the country that had enough land to keep alpacas . The paedophile was shown luxury homes in South Wales by presenter Jonnie Irwin (right) and one of them was in the same area as a primary school . Robinson wanted to enjoy 'the wilds of the countryside' such as that surrounding Roch in Pembrokeshire (pictured) One of the properties he viewed was in the same area as a primary school in Roch, Pembrokeshire. On the show he said: ‘London seems to have got a little bit more unpleasant. So we think the time is right to enjoy the wilds of the countryside.’ Outraged viewers voiced their disgust after the programme was aired on Wednesday at 3pm. One viewer told The Sun: ‘After the recent revelations over the BBC and child-sex offenders, they should be doing their research and vetting people more thoroughly before giving them airtime. ‘The BBC needs to take some accountability for this in light of everything Jimmy Savile-related.’ It has since been removed from the BBC iplayer online catch up service.

House-hunters applying to be on the programme are asked to provide details to the BBC before they are featured on the popular daytime show, made by Boundless Productions. Hopeful applicants are asked to give details of their occupation, their reasons for moving and are asked whether they need to be near certain amenities such as schools or motorways. The online application form does not ask for details of spent convictions or for any pending criminal charges. Peter Saunders, Chief Executive of the abuse charity National Association for People Abused in Childhood, told the Sun: ‘It’s the height of insensitivity to broadcast something that features somebody who’s committed such a vile crime. ‘This could have huge psychological effects on a victim, It cries out for more vigilance and I’m hoping to meet the new BBC Director General to discuss things like this.’ A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘The BBC asks for checks on all contributors to be undertaken yet Mr Robinson deliberately withheld information, misled the production team and signed a contract stating that he had no unspent criminal convictions or pending proceedings. ‘The episode has now been removed from iPlayer and will not be repeated. The spokesman added: ‘We categorically would not have broadcast that had we known about the investigation into Mr Robinson beforehand. ‘We would never had made the programme had we known about it previously.’ Escape To The Country is in its 14th series and is presented by Alistair Appleton, Nicki Chapman, Jonnie Irwin and Jules Hudson.","Presenter Jonnie Irwin helped child abuser Darren Robinson find a house .

Voters still blame Labour for the need to cut public spending, three and a half years after the party was dumped from power, new research reveals. In a blow for Ed Miliband’s strategy of attacking the coalition’s austerity programme, more than one in three people say the cuts are his party’s fault as it continues to be haunted by the infamous note left in the Treasury admitting 'there is no money'. A state of the nation study released with barely a year and half before the next election also shows 31 per cent of people think the Tories will handle the economy best. The study by pollsters YouGov examines public opinion since the general election in 2010 and looks ahead to the big issues for the 2015 polling day. It shows that the economy remains the major political battleground, with 67 per cent naming it as the most important issue facing the country. However, only a minority of voters persuaded by Mr Miliband’s attacks on the current government, . YouGov says the party battle over the economy is a contest between two narratives: ‘the tough decisions have been taken and now the economy is on the mend’ versus ‘living standards have fallen since 2010 and, for most people, show no signs of reviving’. David Cameron, George Osborne and Nick Clegg have struck a more upbeat tone in recent days about the recovery gaining momentum. Chancellor Mr Osborne said the economy was 'turning a corner' while Mr Clegg 'a dawn appears to be breaking'. Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs today: 'Our job is to make sure that that's not another false dawn, and ensure that this economy reaches, as soon as possible, a speed of escape velocity, so that it can sustain higher interest rates.' Just over half of people (53 per cent) claim immigration is the most important issue, followed by 30 per cent for welfare, 29 per cent who said health and 17 per cent said housing. Since the election in 2010, the proportion of people who blame Labour for spending cuts has fallen from 48 per cent to 36 per cent. But it is still well above the 25 per cent who blame the coalition, which has only risen slightly since the 17 per cent when the government was first formed. When Labour lost power in 2010, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liam Byrne wrote a note to his successor, David Laws, admitting: 'I'm afraid there is no money.' Labour have struggled to live the blunt admission down, even three and a half years later. Since the start of this year, the Tories have gradually built their lead over Labour on the economy. The Conservatives are considered ‘best to handle the economy’ by 31 per cent of people, compared with 25 per cent who said Labour and just four per cent who named the Lib Dems. However, with the economic recovery still in its early stages, one in five (21 per cent) said they ‘don’t know’ who is best placed to be put in charge of the nation’s finances. Despite the poor economic reputation, Labour remains ahead in the polls for who people would vote for at the election on 38 per cent, with Tories on 32 per cent. YouGov said: ‘Labour’s 6 per cent lead is enough to make Ed Miliband Prime Minister – but may not be enough for him to lead a majority Government. ‘When we take all factors into account, including the incumbency “bonus” likely to be enjoyed by Conservative MPs newly elected in 2010, Labour and the Conservatives both need around a 7 per cent lead in order to secure an overall majority in 2015.’","36% of voters say the spending cuts are the fault of the Labour party .

The majority of most people's Twitter followers are merely cyber strangers, known only through the digital text of 140 characters. But one user of the social networking site decided he wanted to get to know his online chums a little more - and set himself the challenge of tracking down and meeting them face-to-face. Glaswegian magician and writer Declan Dineen, 32, was whiling away a boring Saturday afternoon when he came up with his fun idea. Mission: Declan Dineen set out to meet his cyber friends on Twitter - and has taken snaps with 150 of them . Idle thought: Declan, 32, came up with the idea in January but didn't think much of it . Conjurer: The Glaswegian magician had 170 followers at the time and set about filtering out spam followers . True friends: He worked out he had 150 'real' followers and started meeting them in his home city . Snowball: Before long he found himself booking train tickets all over the country to meet far-flung followers . Snap happy: Soon Declan found himself travelling further and further south . Beaming: After passing through the Midlands he made his way to the south coast . Racking up the miles: He was determined to continue the quirky quest and headed to the West Country . Shining light: One of the highlights of his mammoth journey was meeting followers in his native Wales . But what started as an idle thought turned into a full-blown mission - and he has so far met up with and been photographed with nearly 150 of his followers, travelling the length and breadth of the country in the process. The story of his quirky quest has gone viral and he has been featured on TV and in papers around the world. Declan told MailOnline: 'It has been absolutely mental - I knew there would be some interest but not to this level. It literally started out as a bit of fun - there was no intelectual rigour involved in the process at all.' Pleasant surprise: Declan said every single one of the followers was 'incredibly nice' Who are you again? Declan admitted many of the followers had no idea why they were following him . Performer: But some discovered Declan after his gigs at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival . First meeting: Most people looked utterly thrilled to put a face to the name when they met Declan . Heading north again: After finishing in Wales, Declan started the long rail trip back to Scotland . Connection: 'The beauty of Twitter is that you can really shape your account and follow like-minded people,' said Declan . Risk: But he says his mission highlighted just how much information people are willing to share online . High spirits: Declan met a lot of people in their homes but also had a few nights in the pub . That bit of fun started in January when he had 270 followers. After filtering out some of the 'spam' followers, he realised there were 150 people to meet, and set about the task, first starting in Glasgow and Edinburgh before booking a raft of train tickets and trundling around the country. Over two weeks, he visited 17 cities, including Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby, Manchester, Brighton, Exeter and Cardiff, while he contacted his overseas followers over Skype. 'Everyone I met was incredibly nice, there were no nutters,' he said. 'But I think that's the beauty of Twitter, you have a lot of control over who you connect with and most were like-minded, although quite a few had no idea why they were connected with me.' Memorable nights: Declan met a number of characters on the trip, including this Elvis lookalike, right . Taken aback: Little did Declan imagine the stir his mission would cause and his story hit the world stage this week . 'Mental': After the story broke in Scotland, his followers doubled to more than 300 . Off the scale: After the tale was picked up by national television he passed 12,000 followers . Foul play: Declan suspects the majority of his new followers sprung up due to a hacker . Career changer: Such has been the interest, Declan is thinking of writing a stage sketch about his experience . No stopping him: And he says he will continue trying to meet as many of his new followers as possible . Foreign trip: Declan says he may even have to start flying abroad to meet some of his followers . After the media picked up on his odyssey last week, his followers doubled before exploding to more than 12,000, although he suspects he may have been hacked. Despite this, the interest has been such that he has decided to make a show about his experience. 'I really had planned to stop at 150 and that would be that,' he said. 'But I think I will now carry it on, meeting a few more for my blog every month. I think it will make for a pretty good sketch.'","Declan Dineen, 32, from Glasgow, has travelled the country meeting 150 of his followers .

Ken Clarke signalled that he will back Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne as the potential next head of the Tories . Ken Clarke signalled that he will back George Osborne as the next Tory leader yesterday as he warned Boris Johnson to 'cool it' in his quest to replace David Cameron. The Cabinet veteran said he was a 'big fan' of the Chancellor, who he said was 'playing a blinder' on the economy and warned his rivals Mr Osborne 'is bound to be a contender'. Mr Clarke, who was Chancellor in John Major's government, said with the economy finally beginning to improve: 'George has the chance of coming out with a quite remarkable outcome. 'If he is the Chancellor who can steer the country out of the kind of mess he inherited and demonstrate to people that in his term of office we turned ourselves into a competitive modern economy enjoying normality in our economic circumstances, then that would be a complete triumph.' In a shot across the Mayor's bows, Mr Clarke said Mr Johnson should not repeat his attention-grabbing performance at the last Conservative Party conference, where the mayor was greeted as a near rock star, held a victory rally for his mayoral re-election and embarked on a series of high profile media appearances. Mr Clarke said: 'I gave some advice to Boris at last year's conference and my advice to him was that if he has an interest in the leadership, he should cool it,"" Mr Clarke said. 'There isn't going to be a vacancy for some years. David Cameron - with all the usual good luck and health - is plainly good for a very long time. 'The chances of David Cameron being Prime Minister after the next election are looking better than they have looked ever since we got in.' Mr Johnson is widely favoured to take over from Mr Cameron if he loses the next election. By contrast, Tory MPs judge Mr Osborne's chances of succeeding Mr Cameron to be higher if the Prime Minister wins in 2015 since he is so closely associated with the Prime Minister. Asked to assess the prospects of both Mr Osborne and Home Secretary Theresa May as future leaders, Mr Clarke said: 'I think George is for every possible reason concentrating on getting the economy through this lot, and he is doing damn well so far. 'If he does that, it is probably not doing too much damage to him to say he is bound to be a contender.' But Mr Clarke had nothing to say about the possible claim on the top job of Mrs May, with whom he famously clashed over the case of an illegal immigrant who she said was spared removal from the country so he could stay with his cat. Mr Clarke, who first entered . Parliament in 1970, revealed that he would be deciding within two weeks . whether he will stand as a candidate in the general election scheduled . for 2015. Speaking to a . Westminster lunch, Mr Clarke indicated he was inclined to seek . re-election, saying he remained interested in politics. But his wife has . been unwell and he signalled that he will make a decision after . discussions with his family and supporters. Big beast: The Cabinet veteran, who was . Chancellor in the Major government, said he was a 'big fan' of the . Chancellor, who was 'playing a blinder' on the economy and warned his . rivals Mr Osborne 'is a contender' Mr Clarke also said that the government has accomplished far more as a coalition that it would have if the Tories had won with a small majority in 2010. He also said while he initially thought a hung parliament would be a 'catastrophe', but has changed his mind. 'We have delivered more than we could have as a single party government,' he insisted. 'The present government can say we have put national interest before party interest. We have formed a coalition. 'If we hadn't done that, heaven help us. I do think a coalition can achieve more in a time of crisis than a single party government, though I'd like to move back to single party government as soon as possible. 'We've achieved more actually than we could conceivably have done as Conservative government with a tiny majority. Some Tory backbenchers, frustrated at what they see as a Lib Dem block on Conservative policies have argued Mr Cameron should have not entered a coalition. 'What on Earth that was supposed to achieve I can't imagine,' Mr Clarke said. He said such a minority government would have 'faffed around for six months' while 'the world would have fallen around our ears'.","Tory big beast says improving economy makes Chancellor a contender .

"By . James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 11:40 EST, 14 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:27 EST, 15 September 2013 . Home Office minister Jeremy Browne told colleagues today they could not be 'half in, half out' of the coalition Government . Liberal Democrats are courting electoral disaster by disowning Government policies such as cutting the welfare bill and scrapping Labour’s 50p tax rate, a senior party figure warned today. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne tells senior colleagues who are scrambling to distance themselves from the Conservatives ahead of the 2015 general election that they cannot be ‘half in, half out’ of coalition.He claimed that if there were only two choices at the election – the coalition Government and the Opposition – ‘the coalition government would win and would deserve to win’. Mr Browne told the Daily Mail his party would ‘lapse into the opposition comfort zone’ if it started echoing Labour criticisms of a £26,000-a-year cap on family benefits, the reduction of the top rate of tax to 45p and the increase in VAT.Ministers fear Lib Dem activists at the party’s annual conference, which starts this weekend in Glasgow, are set to rebel against key Government policies and may vote to reinstate the 50p rate introduced by Labour weeks before it lost power in 2010.‘The fundamental question for Liberal Democrats gathering for conference is this: are we proud of our Government or ashamed of it?’ Mr Browne said.His remarks will be seen as a rebuke to colleagues on the Left of the party – including Business Secretary Vince Cable and president Tim Farron – who have begun to complain publicly about coalition policies.Conservative ministers suspect both Mr Cable and Mr Farron are flirting with Labour in preparation for a potential Lib-Lab power-sharing pact after the next election. But Lib Dems on the Right of the party are warning privately that to go straight into coalition with Labour, following five years of sharing power with the Conservatives, would be seen as deeply unprincipled by many voters. Mr Browne, a close ally of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, said the coalition had been formed in 2010 when Britain was in ‘deep trouble’ and Labour had been borrowing a ‘ruinous’ £450 million a day.The country also faced serious problems thanks to ‘entrenched intergenerational poverty and welfare dependency’ and school standards that had been allowed to fall behind those of international competitors.‘Britain badly needed stable government and a clear-headed economic recovery plan. And - with the Liberal Democrats entering office as part of the coalition Government - that is what we got,’ the minister added.Now the country was ‘part of the way down the road to recovery’ with the economy ‘off its knees and back on its feet’ and the deficit cut by a third, he said. Interest rates have been kept low for homeowners and businesses and more than a million jobs had been created in the private sector. At the same time, more than 20 million workers on middle incomes had had their income tax cut as the amount that can be earned tax free has been increased in stages towards £10,000.‘These are all Liberal Democrats successes just as much as Conservative successes. We have stuck with determination to the policies that have made this progress possible,’ Mr Browne said. ‘And the Liberal Democrats have taken . the lead in Government on policies to help people with the cost of . living. Tens of millions of workers on middle and low earnings have had . their income tax cut. Millions of retired people have seen the state . pension rise by more than inflation. Mr Browne told the Daily Mail his party would ¿lapse into the opposition comfort zone¿ if it started echoing Labour criticisms of a £26,000-a-year cap on family benefits . ‘But the Liberal Democrats have not just made the popular decisions. Not everyone likes the cap on welfare, or reductions in military spending, or the rise in VAT to help tackle Britain's debt mountain, but we have supported these policies too. ‘We have been willing at all stages to make the necessary but tougher decisions as well. We have voted through the changes that Britain needed to start on the road to recovery.‘So Liberal Democrats have taken the difficult but correct decisions over the last three-and-a-half years, but now, with the general election approaching, we also need to win the credit we deserve for turning round our country.‘That means Liberal Democrats embracing our role in Government and being proud of our overall record. We cannot be half in Government and half out. We cannot claim credit for the popular policies but pretend the unpopular policies are nothing to do with us. ‘We cannot be in the Government but campaign against the Government at the same time. We cannot lapse into the opposition comfort zone of echoing Labour's policies on 50p tax rates and welfare reform.‘The Liberal Democrat conference is an opportunity to trumpet our achievements, not to amplify the attacks of our critics.’Mr Browne, tipped as a potential candidate in a future Lib Dem leadership race, said the party’s objective in coalition should be ‘to be a more effective governing party than the Conservatives, not a more effective opposition party than Labour’. ‘It is our Government and we need to own it and celebrate it. If Liberal Democrats run down the achievements of this Government we will not deserve to share in the credit for the Government's achievements,’ he added.‘The economic recovery, sticking to Plan A, the new jobs, cutting the deficit, our national renewal - none of these would have been possible without the Liberal Democrats. We have been fundamental to putting our country back on track.’Mr Browne said that as an independent party, it was right for the Lib Dems to stand on its own manifesto.‘But we will only get the credit for our achievements if we unambiguously stand by our record in Government - no foot dragging, no craving the easy gesture politics of opposition, no fence sitting,’ he added.","Jeremy Browne warned colleagues could not be 'half in, half out' of coalition .

A sick puppy that was thrown into a dumpster by owners who 'thought he was dead' has fully recovered and found a new home. The chihuahua named Trooper was taken to his new abode Wednesday, about two weeks after he was found whimpering and seriously unwell in a trash bin in Wells, Nevada. Sheriff's deputies responded to the Flying J gas station in Wells on August 30 after an employee found the puppy there. A new beginning: Trooper wags his tail in the arms of his new owner, D.J. Smith, after being found seriously ill with parvovirus in a dumpster . A deputy located the owners - a couple whose RV had broken down. They said they thought the puppy was dead and callously decided to throw Trooper in the dumpster.Inside the . couple's RV, deputies found a pungent mess of dog feces and flies as . well as 35 dogs. The couple allowed eight unhealthy adult dogs to be . taken to the Elko Animal Shelter. Incredibly, the . original owners were not arrested or cited as there was no way to know . whether the puppy actually appeared dead when it was tossed in the . garbage, according to Undersheriff Clair Morris. The puppy was brought for emergency care to the Elko Veterinary Clinic and diagnosed with parvovirus, an infectious disease that is often fatal for dogs. 'I heard about the story and knew I had to do something,' D.J. Smith, who adopted Trooper, told the Elko Daily Free Press. 'You can't just let something go like that.' Trashed: Trooper's original owners told authorities they threw him away because they thought he was dead (stock image) Local dog lovers Park and Del Blair contributed more than $500 to save the animal's life, said Elko Animal Shelter Manager Karen Walther. 'I didn't think he would have made it,' Walther said. 'For an animal to be that sick and to have that much heart, I'm happy as a lark. He's been doted on here [at the shelter] and everyone's been cheering for him after what he's been through.' 'Time to meet the family,' Smith told Trooper as he carried him out of the shelter, along with two other chihuahuas that needed rescuing, to his new home.","A sick puppy was thrown out by his owners, who told authorities they thought he was dead .
