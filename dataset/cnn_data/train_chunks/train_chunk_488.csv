Reg Traviss attended a police station by arrangement and was questioned about an allegation made to police on January 18. Last night, friends said the 35-year-old film director was devastated by the claim, which one insisted had come out of the blue. 'Devastated': Reg Traviss, pictured with his late girlfriend Amy Winehouse, has been arrested on suspicion of rape . ‘He does know the woman who made the report to police and he completely denies the allegation,’ a friend told the Daily Mail. ‘He wants to do everything in his power to fight this.’ Traviss was left heartbroken after Miss Winehouse died last July and told how he had planned to marry the 27-year-old singer. He said he had gone through hell following his girlfriend’s death, adding: ‘Yes, absolutely, we had talked about getting married. ‘It wasn’t planned as in this date or that date, but it was a topic of conversation and had been for some time.’ Lost love: Traviss, pictured second right with members of Miss Winehouse's family visiting tributes left by fans, was left heartbroken following the 27-year-old singer's death last July . He also spoke of the suddenness of the star’s death at a time when she was getting her life back on track and had beaten her drug addiction. Toxicology tests showed there were no drugs in the singer’s system at the time of her death. However, it was revealed at an inquest that she had 416mg of alcohol per decilitre of blood – five times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg. The inquest heard that 350mg could be a fatal amount. Three empty vodka bottles were found near her body in her bedroom at home in Camden, North London. Traviss was told in a phone call from her security guard Andrew Morris that she had been found dead in bed. He had been in a relationship with Miss Winehouse for two years before her death and their romance received the blessing of her parents. Last night, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘A 35-year-old man was arrested by appointment on April 5 by officers from Westminster Sapphire unit in relation to an allegation of rape reported to police on January 18. ‘He is bailed to return to a Central London police station in early July.’","Reg Traviss 'knows woman who made report to police'

Then we saw riot police turn up and things were being thrown from the house. 'It didn't seem like a real threat, but it is not the sort of thing you would expect.

It appears all Simon Cowell has to do to boost ratings of his UK version of The X Factor is appear on it himself for just a few minutes. Sunday night's Boot Camp show was the most watched programme in Britain that day... and even notched up audience viewers to make it the second highest ratings of the series so far. And it seems it could have been the addition of Cowell back on screens as he made a (very small) comeback. He'll be happy! Simon Cowell is all smiles as he momentarily appears back on Sunday's X Factor... causing viewing figures to be given a boost . The music mogul hasn't been seen on Britain's The X Factor since he quit two years ago. But on Sunday he must have pleased fans of the show as he made a return... although not on the judging panel as some would perhaps like. He instead appeared looking relaxed as he phoned the current panellists, consisting of Nicole Scherzinger, Louis Walsh, Gary Barlow and Tulisa Contostavlos, from the comfort of sunny Miami during a break from filming the US version of the talent programme. That's better: Sunday's show averaged at 9.4 million viewers, with it at 10.8 million at its highest - the second highest rating of the season so far . Cowell was seen smiling as he delivered news to the judges about which group of acts they would be mentoring and taking care of on this year's series. And as a result an average of 9.4 million viewers, including those tuned into ITV1 and ITV+1, while it peaked at 10.8 million viewers at one stage. Although it still failed to draw in the numbers it did from last season. Meanwhile, Downton Abbey on ITV1 averaged around 8.4 million viewers, although that did mean it was down from the previous week's ratings and form its popularity a year ago. It managed to notch up an average of 8.6 million viewers in its debut episode for the new series the week before. The girls! Tulisa was seen squealing with delight as Simon informed her she'd be taking care of the females, consisting of Ella Henderson, Amy Mottram, Jade Collins, Lucy Spraggan, Leanne Robinson and Jade Ellis . The ratings statistics come as the final 24 X Factor contestants going through to the live show part of the programme have been revealed. During Sunday's episode Tulisa, who is the reigning judge from last year, was seen jumping around with joy after the mogul informed her she would be looking after the females. She gushed: 'Get in there. Thank you very much Simon, I won’t let you down.' She added: 'Before, I said to myself there is no way I can win two years in a . row, never going to happen. But my category is so strong that it’s . actually possible.' Tulisa's . group includes 16-year-old Ella Henderson, Amy Mottram, Jade Collins, . Lucy Spraggan, Leanne Robinson and Jade Ellis, who all wowed the judges . with their vocal ability, originality and personality. The boys: Nicole Scherzinger will be mentoring James Arthur, Jahmene Douglas, Nathan Fagan-Gayle, Adam Burrdidge, Rylan Clark and Jake Quickenden . Gary Barlow was given the over 28's, Nicole Scherzinger took the boys while Louis Walsh was handed the groups. The Take That singer and writer seemed pleased with the mature group of singers and said: 'Oh wow. Brilliant! That is good news to my ears.' 'I feel like in recent years, the overs has become a bit of a joke . category and I really want to restore what the overs should be this . year. There are people over 28 with talent!’ The over-28s: Gary will be working with Kye Sones, Melanie Masson, Nicola Marie, Brad Shackleton, Carolynne Poole and Christopher Maloney . Gary will be working with Kye Sones, Melanie Masson, Nicola Marie, Brad Shackleton, Carolynne Poole and Christopher Maloney. Nicole had expressed that she wanted the girl category but after being given the boys she said: 'I wasn’t expecting that. I’m stoked. I’m super stoked. I’m excited.'

The former Pussycat singer will be mentoring James Arthur, Jahmene Douglas, Nathan Fagan-Gayle, Adam Burrdidge, Rylan Clark and Jake Quickenden. Louis, who managed Westlife and Boyzone got the groups - a category he wasn't prepared for. He said: 'I got the groups. I wasn’t expecting the groups. But I’m happy. I’m going to work hard, and yeah, it’s going to be great.' When the judges deliberated over the . groups they told five acts they had made it through before asking two . bands to battle it out for the final place. Mitsotu, Duke, MK1, Poisonous Twins, and Rough Copy all landed spots at the next stage of the competition but Gary Barlow told GMD3 and Triple J that they must battle it out in a sing off. But diehard fans will know Rough Copy failed to make it to judges houses after member Kazeem Ajobe, 23,who was born in Nigeria, submitted his application for leave to remain in the UK which is being viewed by the UK Border Agency, but he left it too late and was unable to head to the judges' houses abroad. He was told he would not be able to re-enter the UK. Upset: Boyband Rough Copy were axed from The X Factor after one member failed to secure a visa . And there was more changes as Union J and Times Red were added to Louis' category while George Shelley added to Union J and the group was renamed Triple J. Louis Walsh sad: 'When Rough Copy left, I found it difficult to choose between two groups to fill their place. In the end I invited boyband Triple J to come to Judges Houses, but still felt that as I’d lost such a strong group in Rough Copy that I wanted to make sure the category was the best it could possibly be. 'I asked Gary, Nicole and Tulisa if they minded if I took a seventh act. They were happy as they felt they’d got the right six acts for their Judges Houses trips so I asked Times Red to come along and they said yes.' She's happy! Tulisa Contostavlos was ecstatic when it was revealed to her by Simon Cowell that she'd be in charge of the girls this year to attempt to continue her reign as champion judge . They'll do!

Convicted: Waseem Daker, now 35, spent a decade behind bars for stalking Loretta Blatz; he was found guilty of killing her roommate . Jurors near Atlanta on Friday convicted a man accused in the strangling death of a flight attendant in 1995 and the stabbing of her young son. The jury began deliberating shortly before 10 a.m. Friday and returned a guilty verdict against Waseem Daker in less than five hours. The 35-year-old was indicted on 11 counts, including malice and felony murder, burglary, false imprisonment, aggravated assault, aggravated battery and attempted aggravated stalking. Daker is charged in the October 23, 1995 killing of Karmen Smith in her Cobb County home. Prosecutors say he also repeatedly stabbed Smith's 5-year-old son Nick, who survived the attack. Daker killed Smith and attacked her son because he was obsessed with Lottie Spencer Blatz, who lived upstairs from them, prosecutors said. Daker was convicted of stalking Blatz in 1996. Authorities had long suspected Daker but couldn't connect him to the slaying until new DNA testing linked him to Smith's death in 2009. Daker did not react as the verdict against him was read, The Marietta Daily Journal reported. Emotional: Karmen Smith's son, Nick, pictured testifying in court during the trial, was stabbed multiple times during the 1995 attack, but survived .

Jurors asked the judge during deliberations for permission to replay a portion of taped telephone conversations that allegedly occurred between Daker and Blatz on October 13 and 14, about a week before the slaying, and a portion of a taped interview Daker had with Cobb County Police Detective Brad McIntyre after the slaying. Daker objected to the jury hearing only portions of the tapes, and wanted them to hear the whole thing, but Superior Court Judge Mary Staley overruled the objection.

The row over the controversial merger of defence giant BAE with the Franco-German aerospace group EADS took a fresh twist last night after it emerged that Tony Blair’s former spy chief is helping to broker the deal. Sir John Scarlett, the ex-head of MI6 who played a key role in the infamous ‘dodgy dossier’ on Iraq, has been engaged on the £29 billion deal by investment bank Morgan Stanley – which stands to earn millions if it is approved. His role will fuel critics’ fears that the proposed merger between the British arms company and EADS is being ‘stitched up’ by high-level Whitehall figures using inside knowledge and connections. MPs have already called for Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood’s role in the deal to be scrutinised. Sir Jeremy, a former head of Morgan Stanley’s UK Investment Banking Division, has held a series of private meetings with the bank, BAE and EADS over the past 15 months to discuss the plan – a level of personal involvement described by Tory MP David Davis as ‘highly unusual’. The Commons Defence Select Committee is investigating the merger. Opponents argue that the new conglomerate would cut costs by slashing jobs, while national security could be placed at risk if it fell under the sway of the French and  German governments. The Mail on Sunday understands that Sir John, 64, is ‘liaising’ between the bank and the Government to help ‘soothe concerns’ in No 10 about the risks. Oxford-educated Sir John became chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in 2004, retiring five years later. He then took up a portfolio of lucrative City jobs, including an advisory role at Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley buildings in Canary Wharf. The company stands to earn millions if the deal is approved . Last night, asked whether Sir John had sought Whitehall clearance to work on the sensitive deal, a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘His appointment with Morgan Stanley was approved on the advice of the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments that he should be subject to the condition that, for 12 months from his last day of service, he should not become personally involved in lobbying UK Government Ministers or Crown servants, including special advisers, on behalf of his new employers or their clients. Sir John observed that condition.’ A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.","Merger of defence giant BAE with aerospace group EADS took a fresh twist .

Three people wounded in the shooting that killed 12 people at a Colorado theatre have filed lawsuits alleging the exit door the gunman used to enter the building should have had an alarm. Two lawsuits were filed on Friday in U.S. District Court on behalf of newlyweds Denise Traynom, 24, and Brandon Axelrod, 30, and Joshua Nowlan, 31, an Iraq war veteran, all wounded in the July, 20 shooting. The lawsuits filed against the subsidiary of Cinemark Holdings Inc. are believed to be the first. They were filed the same day the company revealed plans to refurbish and reconfigure the theatre and have it ready to open by the beginning of 2013. Scroll down for video . Theatre victim: Joshua Nowlan, 31, an Iraq war veteran, is one of three victims of the July, 20 shooting that have filed a lawsuit against the Cinemark theatre . James Holmes, 24, is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 others during a special midnight showing of 'The Dark Knight Rises.' Prosecutors allege the former University of Colorado, Denver, graduate student left the theatre through a back exit, propped open the exit door and re-entered the theatre to begin the shooting. The lawsuits claim Holmes was able to move his car into position after went through the back exit. ‘Throughout that time, no employee or security personnel contacted him, deterred him, monitored him or stopped him from that re-entry,’ one of the complaints reads. Responsibility: Brandon Axelrod, 30, pictured, and his wife Denise Traynom, 24, have also filed suit claiming the theatre could have prevented the shooting that killed 12 . Scene: The victims are believed to be the first to present a lawsuit against Cinemark, owners of the Century 16 movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, pictured on the night of the shooting . In addition to failing to have alarmed exit doors, the lawsuits claim Cinemark was negligent in failing to hire extra security for the midnight showing or generally protect patrons who were sitting in a darkened theatre. The company also knew of at least one prior shooting at the theatre, including assaults and robberies, the complaints say. They also say Cinemark failed to help evacuate the theatre even after the shooting ended. The lights were either off or very low even after the gunfire stopped, according to the lawsuit. 'Any person who wished to make a surreptitious and unauthorized entry into the theatre could easily determine that the lack of security personnel and lack of any alarm on the door at the right, front by the screen of Auditorium would allow them to leave the theatre, and re-enter without fear of being discovered, interfered with, monitored or stopped,' it reads. Entry: James Holmes' car is seen outside the theatre where a trail of blood leads to the building's backdoor he used to get in and out of without difficulty . Ms Traynom was wounded in the buttocks, while Mr Axelrod suffered bone injuries to his right knee and ankle. Mr Nowlan's right arm was nearly severed by a bullet, and he was also wounded in his left leg. 'Josh helped me protect my wife, and he got shot. It wasn't expected. But I'm glad he was there with us because the three of us together, we piled on each other and we kept each other safe. And you know, luck or faith, whatever you want to call it, kept us alive,' Mr Axelrod told CNN just after the shootings. Meanwhile, Aurora Mayor Steve Hogan was celebrating the announcement that Cinemark will reopen the theatre. Cinemark President and CEO Tim Warner advised Hogan of the company's intention by letter before the lawsuits were filed. Accessibility: James Holmes, seen in his most recent photo, left, and immediately after the shooting, right, propped open an exit door and re-entered after moving his car into position according to the suit .

While no one will ever forget that day, this is another step in the community's healing,' Mr Hogan said. In a letter to Cinemark, the mayor asked that special provisions be made for a victim and survivor visitation, memorials, and a change to the outside appearance of the building.

Weekly bin collections have been rejected by the majority of councils, with just one council accepting a share of £250million funding to ditch fortnightly collections. Of 216 councils who pick up rubbish and recycling on alternate weeks, just one wants to increase bin collections to weekly, but dozens have applied for support to bring in or extend separate food waste collections according to research by Materials Recycling World (MRW). The Whitehall funding to return to weekly bin rounds was accepted by just Labour-run Stoke-on-Trent City Council, while another five councils bid for funding to return to weekly collections in challenging situations such as flats, but not for the majority of residents. Weekly bins banished: The majority of councils have rejected £250million funding to return to weekly bin collections in favour of fortnightly pick ups . Communities Secretary Eric Pickles first announced the funding before last autumn’s Tory party conference to improve weekly rubbish collections and reverse the trend towards picking up household rubbish only once every two weeks. The weekly bin collection funding is available to councils which return to or maintain weekly waste collections, which Mr Pickles has described as a ‘basic right’, and to cut the number of bins for householders, bring in weekly food waste rounds and boost recycling. The research found 45 councils wanted money to bring in or extend separate food waste collections. The only one: Stoke-On-Trent council, pictured, was the only council to accept the funding to return to weekly bin collections . Local authority waste and recycling consultant Jennie Rogers told MRW: ‘It comes as no surprise to me that all bar one of those councils which already have an alternate weekly collection (AWC) have opted to keep their service. ‘Aside from the reduction in collection . costs, league table evidence speaks for itself - recycling rates . increase dramatically on the introduction of AWC, especially as . alternate weekly collections often enables councils to enhance their . recycling service.’ When the funding was announced last . year, Paul Bettison, chief of Bracknell Forest Council in Berkshire, . said: ‘To move from alternative weeks to weekly collections we would . have to buy another eight collection freighters which would cost . £1.6million and employ another 40 people. 'Basic right': Communities Secretary Eric Pickles announced the funding last autumn to cut the number of bins for householders and boost recycling . ‘We don’t know how much money we are getting. There are a lot of councils for it to be  shared between.’ Doretta Cocks, of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections, said: ‘I do admire Eric Pickles for trying, but there was a gap between what he wanted to achieve and the reality of what the councils were actually going to do. They have just completely ignored what council tax-payers wanted.’ Matt Hindle, policy manager for the Anaerobic Digestion and Biogas Association, said a number of councils were looking at diverting food waste away from landfill, where rubbish incurs an increasing tax. Segregated food waste could be used in anaerobic digestion, a process which converts organic material into gas and fertiliser, providing financial benefits or even energy supplies for councils, he said. He said: ‘Segregated food collection is the way councils should be going on food waste, and we’d like to see that desire recognised by the Department for Communities and Local Government.’ He welcomed the move by many councils to apply for funding for separate food waste collection and urged the Government to support their schemes to help realise the full benefits of anaerobic digestion.

She was wrapping Christmas presents when a torrent of  foul-mouthed phone calls started. Mark Symington launched a bigoted tirade at his wife Sarah over Christmas last year . Symington, from Ross-shire, continued to call for three days. The . 49-year-old made more than 20 drunken calls during the early hours of . Christmas Day itself. At one point, he told her: 'I’ll f***ing gas you. I’m Adolf.' He later . claimed he made the drunken calls out of frustration after being . prevented from  seeing his children for more than three years since the . end of the marriage. Symington, who has since been involved in an acrimonious divorce after splitting up in 2008, said: 'You think you’re clever. 'You’re . just a greedy little  Jewish princess. You’re just a silly little . gold-digger. You’ve got a few fur coats, you’ve also got my kilt and . waistcoat, which I’d rather like, and my antiques, which I’d rather . like.' At Perth Sheriff . Court on Wednesday, Symington admitted making offensive calls, . aggravated by religious prejudice, to Mrs Symington at her home in . Crieff, Perthshire, between December 24 and 27 last year. Sheriff . Lindsay Foulis said: 'It defeats me that someone of 49,  who appears to . have some sort of insight and ability, engages in three nights of what . can only be described as an unpleasant tirade against an estranged . spouse. 'This course of conduct was unpleasant in the extreme. He has had a background in investment and is not an immature teenager.' Fiscal . depute Carol Whyte said: 'The accused and the complainer were married . but have been separated since 2008. Since an acrimonious separation, the . accused has not seen his children, although he still provides financial . support for them and Mrs Symington.' Perth Sheriff Court heard that 49 year old Symington made more than 20 drunken phone calls during the early hours of Christmas Day . Mrs Whyte said the victim started receiving messages shortly before 9pm on Christmas Eve, with more than 20 during an hour-long period from 2.05am on Christmas Day. During these, Symington  said: 'It would be very nice to actually have something. I would like to have some contact with two little people I love. 'Happy f***ing Christmas. I don’t know what you feel you have achieved. You can give this to your scumbag lawyer, because I am taking it all the way. 'I am going to leave messages till you ring back. You think you are clever. Stupid little inter-national housewife.' Mrs Whyte told the court Mrs Symington was still up wrapping presents as the stream of messages continued. Solicitor John McLaughlin, defending, said Symington was £20,000 in debt and obtained his main source of income from the B&B business he operates. Two years ago, Symington – who suffered financial losses on the stock market – walked into a pub after wrecking his £70,000 Maserati at the harbour at Shieldaig. Witnesses saw the sports car swerve off the road and hit rocks supporting the sea wall, before Symington – who had his dog with him – got out and went into the pub.

"PUBLISHED: . 16:02 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 19 September 2012 . A high-end steakhouse in the Meatpacking . District is offering New York restaurant goers their first real taste . of a Kobe steak, for a whopping $350. While restaurants across America have claimed to sell . Kobe beef on their upscale menus for years, charging customers hundreds of . dollars for the delicacy, these steaks have previously been fakes. Until August 17, 2012, it has been illegal to buy, sell, and import any Japanese beef in the U.S, including the rare Kobe; and while some ranchers in the Midwest have claimed to recreate it, they only produce what Forbes Magazine has called 'Faux-be' beef - a cut of meat that is all beef, but no Kobe. The real deal: The Old Homestead Steakhouse in the Meatpacking District is offering New York restaurant goers their first real taste of a Kobe steak, for a whopping $350 . Last month the USDA lifted the ban on the import, which was originally set in place because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Japan, and now the brand new steak dish at Old Homestead Steakhouse is so popular that the restaurant doesn't even have it on the menu. Owner Greg Sherry told MailOnline: 'We got our first shipment on Friday, and already it has sold out. 'The availability is so limited, so we're keeping it to a first come, first serve basis of reservations only,' he said. During the import ban, restaurants have been charging approximately $40 for a . 'Kobe' burger or $100 for a 'Kobe' steak, conning customers into paying top dollar by using a word synonymous with . excellence and good quality meat. 'We got our first shipment on Friday, and already it has sold out' However The Old Homestead Steakhouse's Kobe steak is the real deal. 'We had two people fly in from Japan's National Federation of Agricultural Co-operative Associations to see the meat, to ensure it have arrived properly, and was being served correctly,' Mr Sherry explained. Kobe beef in Japan is a . registered trademark of the Kobe Beef Marketing & Distribution . Promotion Association, and must fulfill seven strict conditions in order . for a restaurant or supplier to label it as such. Patented and pricey: Real Kobe beef on sale at a . price of $180 per kilo in Japan, it is known for its renowned flavour, . tenderness, and fatty, well-marbled texture . The virtues of Kobe, which refers to . cuts of beef from the Tajima-ushi breed of Wagyu cattle, considered a . delicacy and renowned for its flavour and tenderness, has been regularly . touted by famous chefs and on menus all over the country. While Wagyu is a broad term which literally means Japanese cattle, Kobe is the term which is used for beef actually raised in the province of Kobe. Under . Japanese law, for a beef to be labelled Kobe, it can only came from the Hyogo prefecture, where . no slaughterhouses were approved for export from 2010 until August 2012 by the United States . Department of Agriculture. And despite the fact that Kobe Beef, . Meat, and Cattle are patented trademarks in Japan, these Japanese trademarks are . neither recognised nor protected by U.S. law. Similar to the label 'natural' on many U.S. products, a term also unregulated in America, Kobe is an adjective which has been used by restaurants mainly to confuse consumers and profit from their confusion. However real Kobe beef is produced under . some of the world’s strictest legal food standards, contributing to the . $350 cost of the The Old Homestead Steakhouse's authentic Kobe steak. Copyright guidelines: These authentic Kobe cows . were born in the Hyogo prefecture, raised on local grasses since its . birth, and have a 10 digit ID . 'I can only equate it with having a great bottle of wine. You would pay $300 to taste the best possible red, much like you would for the best steak in the world,' said Mr Sherry. He added: 'Buying Japanese beef is about ten to 15 times the cost of buying American beef, and that's where most of our overheads come in. But it's not about the money, it's just about enabling the public to try this exquisite piece for meat.' According to the Kobe patent, in order . to label a cut of meat Kobe, it must have come from a pure lineage of . Tajima-gyu breed cattle. However in the U.S., Japanese cattle which were . imported before the 2010 ban are crossbred with American cattle, which . has translated into a Kobe-style product. Must be pure-bred Tajima calf born in Hyōgo Prefecture . Farm fed only from grains and water from Hyōgo Prefecture . Castrated bull or virgin cow, to purify the beef . Processed at slaughterhouses in Kobe, Nishinomiya, Sanda, Kakogawa and Himeji in Hyōgo Prefecture only . Marbling ratio, called BMS, of level 6 and above . Meat Quality Score of 4 or 5 . Gross weight of beef from one animal is 470kg or less . The cow must also have been born in the Hyogo prefecture, raised on local grasses, water and soil since its birth. It must be a bull or virgin cow, and it must be processed in a Hyogo slaughterhouse, which for two years have not been able to be exported to the U.S., until now. There are only 3000 head of certified Kobe Beef cattle in the world, and each of them live in Japan. The process is so strict that when the beef is sold, either in stores or restaurants, it must carry the 10-digit identification number so customers know what particular Tajima-gyu cow it came from. But as an unregulated term, the American government has enabled vendors to misuse the Kobe name, charging customers high prices under false pretenses. However with the ban now lifted, hopefully this will change. And while the American Kobe-style beef is usually raised all-natural, antibiotic-free, hormone-free, and fed a vegetarian diet, it has nothing in common with actual Kobe beef except that it comes from cows. Restaurants currently have no legal obligation to label it as such, easily justifying a price tag to match the wool pulled over consumers eyes. Mr Sherry, who is excited about being one of the first American restaurants to serve the real deal, said: 'We'll continue to serve it as long as the demand is there. 'It’s a food experience of orgasmic proportions – really,' he added. Diners who order the pricey dish will also be able to take home an inscribed plate as a token of their experience.","Old Homestead Steakhouse is one of the first restaurants in America to sell real Kobe beef .

A high school teacher considered hiring one of his former students to kill a former colleague it's been revealed in shocking recorded conversations played in court. In the 11 minute phone call a Florida courtroom listened as James Pepe, 55, of Bloomingdale High School discussed knowing someone who would hook him up with 'every --- murderer we need.' Pepe is accused of offering to pay $2,000 to kill Robert Meredith, 49, a former co-worker at Strawberry Crest High whom police say he believed had spread rumours about him being a child molester. Meredith told WFTS it 'came as a complete shock,' having known of Pepe but the pair having never once spoken. 'We gotta kill this ----' Pepe is heard in the tape telling a friend who later went to police. 'Originally I remember you and I talked about it and you wanted to pay me to kill him and then I was uncomfortable with that because I've got kids and then you wanted me to find some ---- that didn't work. I found a white supremacist, that didn't work,' the man is heard regurgitating Pepe's plans on the phone. Eventually the man told Pepe he had found someone else to do the job.

'He would do it. Yeah, I mean, here's the deal, you should just talk to the guy. Why don't you just talk to him? How do you want Meredith killed?' 'Anyway he wants. I don't get a f---,' Pepe said. According to ABC Pepe was also open to the idea of having the teacher killed at a school event. Police say the two teachers fell out while working at Strawberry Crest, in Dover. The rift saw Pepe transfer to another school, according to reports, while Meredith, an economics teacher, remained at Strawberry Crest. 'I don’t feel that I’m in any way culpable for this,' Meredith told ABC. 'If there is a . problem, it is 100 per cent on the other side.' Job seekers: The recorded phone calls revealed Pepe allegedly considered hiring one of his former students as well as a white supremacist to do the dirty work for him with a payment of $2,000 . Officer Tray Towles, a Plant City Police Department spokesman, told the Tampa Bay Times that police understood Pepe felt Meredith was behind anything negative which happened to him at work. He said the breaking point came when Pepe suspected his colleague was spreading rumours about him. Officer Towles said: 'Meredith was allegedly telling everybody (Pepe) was a child molester.' Police have said officers worked with the FBI to set up a sting operation following a tip-off, where a Plant City undercover officer played the role of a hitman. They allege during a call on . September 13 Pepe told the undercover officer he 'had an issue he might . need take care of' and was willing to pay $2,000. Rift: Pepe and Meredith worked together at Strawberry Crest High School before a rift between them caused Pepe to transfer according to police . They have said during a second call the officer attempted to arrange a meeting, which Pepe refused, but still allegedly said he wanted Meredith killed. Officers arrested the history teacher - known by students as Dr Pepe - at the end of school on outside the school. He faces a charge of solicitation of first-degree murder and was being held without bail at the Hillsborough County jail. Pepe started working for the Hillsborough County School District 28 years ago. Former student Dee Dee Cardenas, 22, of Dover, who was in Pepe's government class at Durant High in 2007, said she was stunned to hear her former teacher was behind bars.

Asma Hussain was tied to a bed, covered with holy water and beaten continually for almost eight hours after her husband, son and son-in-law became convinced she had the devil in her. A Muslim preacher was brought in to perform an exorcism ritual during which Mrs Hussain was held down and beaten with a cane. Assault: The victim's son-in-law Muhammed Aziz (left) was also found guilty of taking part in the attack while a judge advised a jury not to convict her daughter Salma, 22, (right) who had also faced charges . The husband Ahmed Hussain, 60, of . Poplar, son Mohammed Kayes Hussain, 28, of Wapping, and son-in-law . Muhammed Aziz, 21, of Bethnal Green, all east London, will be sentenced . next month. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard that on January 7 last year Mrs Hussain’s niece visited her home after being told she was ill. Mohammed Kayes Hussain told her she had been possessed by a demon, a Yard spokesman said. A short time later a neighbour arrived and saw Mohammed Kayes Hussain and Aziz holding Mrs Hussain down. Mohammed Kayes Hussain was pouring . water from a bottle over her face. The neighbour was told Mrs Hussain . had the devil inside her and they were trying to get rid of it.

Mrs Hussain’s brother later visited the address having been told Mrs Hussain was unwell. She said she had been hit - she was . bruised and had blood running from her nose - and her son said she was . possessed. The imam was again pouring holy water on her and striking her . with the walking stick. The alarm was raised after another daughter of Mrs Hussain visited and called paramedics. Mrs Hussain had been suffering from . stress as a result of caring for her husband, and this was interpreted . by the family as her being possessed, the spokesman said. Detective Inspector Cliff Jones, from . Tower Hamlets police, said: 'The victim’s family apparently believed . she had been possessed by demons which needed to be removed.

The number of people in England will rise by more than four and a half million over the next decade, official estimates said yesterday. The estimates mean population growth over the next ten years will outpace the historic record increase of the past decade. Figures on future growth, from the Office for National Statistics, were made public following Home Secretary Theresa May’s suggestion earlier this month that no specific effort would be made to keep Britain’s overall population below the symbolic 70million level that one Labour minister promised would never be reached. Historic population: The number of people in England will rise by more than 4.5m over the next decade which will outpace the record increase of the past decade . Britain’s population is around the 63million mark and estimates suggest the 70million figure – which critics say would overstretch housing, transport, education, health services and utilities – will be hit before the currently expected date of 2027. The projections for England’s population in 2021 have been calculated following last year’s census, which found around half a million more people in the country than were thought to be living here. This means numbers are expected to be 667,000 higher in 2021 than previously thought. According to the ONS projections, England will now have 57,688,000 people in 2021 compared with 53,107,000 last year. The anticipated population increase over a decade is 4,581,000. Home Secretary Theresa May suggested that Britain's population would not be kept below 70m as Labour promised it would never reach . The figure follows the acknowledgement from the ONS earlier this week that numbers in England and Wales went up by four million between 2001 and 2011, the fastest rate of increase in more than a century. The population boom is thought to be driven by both immigration and higher birthrates. Immigration and births to migrants were responsible for around 70 per cent of growth, with the rest accounted for by higher birthrates among mothers born in Britain. The ONS said yesterday that population predictions over the next ten years have been increased because ‘estimates for women of childbearing age have been too low in the decade to 2010’. It added that, because of census findings, there are now thought to be 245,000 more women aged between 16 and 44 in England than previously estimated. According to the new projections the population of London will go up by more than a million by 2021, rising from 8,204,000 now to 9,371,000. The South East will have to find room for 800,000 more people – the equivalent of five towns the size of Reading. The other biggest growth region will be the East, which will have 600,000 more people. Simon Ross of Population Matters, which campaigns for more sustainable living, said: ‘This growth rate is one of the highest in Europe, for a country that is already one of its most densely populated. ‘It is hardly surprising that we face issues in housing, transport and employment. In the medium term, these numbers are unsustainable. ‘The Government must be supported in its efforts to limit net migration and should take steps to reduce the birth rate through improving sexual health and encouraging people to have smaller families.’ Critics say the 70million figure would overstretch transport, housing, education, health services and utilities .","The population estimates will outpace the historic record increase of the past decade .

A second cracked engine in a Boeing Dreamliner has been found just two months after a similar plane's engine cracked and failed during a test run that sparked a fire off its runway in South Carolina. Adding further federal scrutiny to the jetliner, an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board uncovered the latest cracks after a recommended review of all Boeing 787 and 747 engines by the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this month. After the forward end of a fan midshaft (FMS) fractured and separated in a General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine on July 28 in Charleston, examination of other models revealed the second engine's crack. Advisory: A U.S. worker inspects a Boeing 747-8's engine earlier this year, one part of a federally advised review this month for cracks in the Dreamliners' engines . That GEnx jet engine, while installed on a 787-8 airplane, had not been flown yet, according to a release by the NTSB on Thursday. In an urgent letter to the FAA earlier this month by the NTSB requesting the engines' inspection, the safety board worried of similar engine explosions that spewed hot metal onto the runway of Charleston International Airport creating a small brush fire. The Boeing 787-8 was undergoing a low-speed taxi test during that incident, according to the NTSB with no passengers aboard or injuries reported. The news comes just days after a similar Boeing 747-8F with a GEnx-1B turbofan lost power during takeoff in Shanghai, China. The safety board said on Thursday that their investigation with the Civil Aviation Administration of China into the design and manufacture of the engine and aircraft is ongoing. Cautionary: After a General Electric GEnx-1B turbofan engine cracked and failed during a test run in South Carolina in July the inspection of all other engines used by the jet went underway . Warm welcome: A Dreamliner Boeing 787 taxis between celebrating arcs of water in Ethiopia last August marking the county's airline as the third to accept delivery of a new Dreamliner . Currently there have been no indications of cracking in that jet engine with its FMS found intact. All of the GEnx engines are manufactured at a GE facility in Cincinnati, Ohio, CNN reports, with GE being the largest maker of jet engines. While the Dreamliner is currently only operating by carriers outside the U.S., United Airlines plans to be the first U.S. domestic carrier of the Boeing jets come November. Earlier this month on September 8 India received their first Dreamliner at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in fanfare celebration making their first of 27 ordered by Air India. The national carrier's 787s will be powered by the General Electric GEnx-1B engines. Expanding: On September 8 Air India received their first of 27 ordered Dreamliners that will be powered by the General Electric GEnx-1B engines, pictured . 'We have done the checks on all our GE engines,' Jack Jones, Boeing vice president and general manager, said earlier this month at an international trade conference near Charleston, South Carolina. 'GE has done a great job of figuring out quickly what we have to do to ensure the integrity of the engine. We know that and we've implemented it.' Jones said the engine issue had not affected Boeing's schedule of delivering planes. 'It obviously didn't stop deliveries. That is absolutely critical,' he said. Playing catch up after a long and rocky start, the American-manufactured airliner has experienced massive cost overruns and hundreds of backlogged orders due to assembly problems. Previous problems and inspections have included concerns over the fuselage's structural stiffeners or shims along with software glitches that cancelled flights.","Discovery follows a review of all Boeing 787 and 747 engines by the National Transportation Safety Board .

Today, she clutched the two-year-old as she celebrated a gold medal-winning ride in the London Olympics. Ms Armstrong - no relation to Lance - knew she was the favorite to win time trial gold in cycling at the Beijing Olympics.

Comeback kid: Ms Armstrong rides to victory blistered an 18-mile course south of London to win her second-straight gold medal . But when she looked at the start list in London, she counted nine riders with a shot. In the end, there was only one. The defending champion blistered an 18-mile course south of London today to win her second-straight gold medal. Victory: Kristin Armstrong carries her son while celebrating with her gold medal . Her time of 37 minutes, 34.82 seconds was more than 15 seconds better than world champion Judith Arndt of Germany, who took silver. Olga Zabelinskaya of Russia won the bronze. 'My mantra was, ""You have to live with this ride,"" said Ms Armstrong, who briefly retired after the 2008 Beijing Olympics to start a family. 'You're only as good as your last result.' It couldn't have been any better. The former two-time world champion had already gained a second on the field by the first time check, and the advantage had swelled to five by the time she reached the 12 1/2-mile mark. Armstrong knew she was headed for . another gold when she started to pick off riders in the run-up to the . finish, including Dutch champion Marianne Vos, who won gold in the road . race. Ms Armstrong, . famously stoic, let a smile slip as she crossed the finish line, slowing . to a stop and then slumping over her bike. She rested just enough to catch her breath before heading to the victory stand and her second consecutive Olympic gold. 'When she stopped, she was on top.

The road from Beijing hasn't been entirely smooth. Armstrong thought she was finished after . winning the world championship in 2009, but got the itch to ride again . after delivering a son, Lucas, in 2010. She got back on the bike and started to win races, only to break her collarbone during a crash in May. Armstrong admits that she rushed her recovery, getting back on the bike only a couple weeks later. But she also thinks the time off allowed her to refocus on the London Olympics. 'This is an amazing moment,' she said. 'A lot of people ask me what the differences were between this and Beijing. I would say this was a much more difficult journey.' The mostly flat course that Armstrong turned into her personal playground began at Hampton Court Palace, the 16th century court once favored by Henry VIII. Quality time: Ms Armstrong and her son Lucas celebrate together after the race, when the mom was awarded Olympic gold . Pride: Ms Armstrong beams as she poses for a picture with her two-year-old son Lucas and her gold medal . The race meandered through the Surrey countryside, twice crossing the River Thames, before finishing back at the palace. Riders in position to medal were ushered onto so-called hot seats - three gilded thrones - to wait out the rest of the riders. Champion: Armstrong won gold in Beijing in 2008, and looked to retire from cycling to start a family - but she came back strong in London . That's where Zabelinskaya spent much of the afternoon. The bronze medalist in the road race, she was the 10th of 24 riders to leave the start tent, and posted a time more than two minutes better than the next-fastest had crossed the line. She looked almost sheepish sitting on her throne as riders finished. 'I'm really happy to win this medal in such company,' she said later, 'but I'm also a bit disappointed, because I know I could have gone a bit faster at the beginning.' Arndt was considered the biggest challenge to Armstrong after her time trial victory at the world championships. The silver medalist at the 2004 Athens Games, she was fifth at the first time check but managed to pick up her pace over the final 12 miles to earn another silver. 'You have to have a good day, and I had a good,' Arndt said. 'I think I had a good race.' Just not as good as Armstrong. 'I'm really happy about this silver medal,' Arndt said, before dropping her voice to almost a whisper. 'Of course, my goal was to win gold, but if you asked me yesterday, I would have named Kristin the favorite to win.'","Kristin Armstrong had put off cycling to have her son, but returned after she had the itch the ride again ."

Burger King is jumping on the bacon bandwagon, and is now offering the meaty treat in the most unlikely of places – an ice-cream sundae. The sundae – vanilla soft serve drizzled with fudge, caramel, bacon crumbles and a piece of ‘thick-cut bacon’ - started in Nashville, Tennessee earlier this year and today launched nationwide. However, the news isn’t all good; the dessert packs a caloric punch, with 510 calories, 18 grams of fat, and 61 grams of sugar. Piggy pudding: Burger King has introduced a bacon sundae as part of its new menu items for the summer; it packs a caloric punch and has 61g sugar . And then there’s the rest of Burger King’s summer menu. The world's second biggest hamburger chain is also launching several pork, beef and chicken sandwiches as limited time offers to go with the bacon sundae. The items are Burger King's latest push to win back customers with a revived menu and reverse sliding market share, an effort that started soon after the company was taken private by the private equity firm 3G Capital in late 2010. Earlier this year, Burger King launched its biggest-ever menu expansion including fruit smoothies, snack wraps and new salads. The items were intended to go after a broader audience of moms and families, a shift from the chain's previous strategy of courting young men with calorie bombs. Summer special: Burger King is also offering other summer specials, including BBQ sandwiches and Whoppers . Core menu items, such as French fries and the Whopper, have also been tweaked as part of the company's efforts to improve food quality. Burger King is trying to underscore its own focus on ingredients with a new tag line, ‘Taste Is King,’ which replaces ‘Have It Your Way.’ A new ad has been celebrating summer barbecues to highlight the chain's emphasis on fire-grilling burgers. The new summer items will be featured in ads starting Thursday. This month, 3G plans to take Burger King public on the New York Stock Exchange. Wendy's is also revamping its menu to improve ingredients and recast itself as a higher-end burger chain. The makeovers by the hamburger giants come at a time when the traditional fast-food chains are seeing more competition from smaller players such as Five Guys Burgers and Smashburger that offer higher-quality food, and more health-conscious alternatives such as Subway. Burger King isn't the only fast-food chain that's trying to draw attention with unusual offerings. Taco Bell earlier this year introduced its tacos with Doritos shells and a ‘nacho burrito’ that includes corn chips. And bacon desserts are hardly anything new. Many non-chain restaurants across the country offer some combination of ice cream and the salty, fatty meat, from milkshakes to sundaes and everything in between.","Burger King to offer bacon sundae as part of new summer menu .

Whether you feel fat, thin, average or you simply don't care may have nothing to do with the chocolate cake you ate (or didn't eat) yesterday. It may instead be down to the genes you inherited from your parents. A woman's body image and desire to be thin stems chiefly from her genetic make-up, according to new research carried out at Michigan State University (MSU). Mothers pass on their 'thin idealisation' to their daughters, so Harper Beckham is likely to inherit Victoria's fondness for the skinny leg, left, and Lourdes may enjoy working out like her mother Madonna, right. Scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their 'genetic programming'. Scientists found that nearly half of the reason why some women feel more pressure to be slim is down to their 'genetic programming', which causes some women to be more susceptible to body image issues and eating disorders. Georgia May Jagger, left, will probably have the same attitudes towards body shape as her mother, Jerry Hall. So Harper Beckham is likely to inherit Victoria's prediction for a tiny waist; Georgia May Jagger could take after her mother Jerry Hall when it comes to staying toned and slim; and Lourdes Ciccone will probably follow her mother Madonna into the gym. The research challenges the popular notion that young women are pressured into idolising thinness due to their environments, which are replete with airbrushed photos of celebrities and 'size zero' models. Scientists carried out the study by examining differing attitudes between identical and fraternal twins. Lead researcher at MSU Jessica Suisman said: 'We're all bombarded daily with messages extolling the virtues of being thin, yet intriguingly only some women develop what we term 'thin ideal internalisation. 'This suggests that genetic factors may make some women more susceptible to this pressure than others.' The . study - which is being published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders - . assessed more than 300 female twins from the MSU Twin Registry between . the ages of 12 and 22. Researchers measured how much the twins wanted to look like people from films, television and magazines. Once . the levels of their 'thin idealisation' were assessed, identical twins . (who share 100 per cent of their genes) were compared with fraternal . twins (who share 50 per cent, just like standard brothers and sisters). Identical twins Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen, left, would be likely to have the same 'thin idealisation' because they share exactly the same genes, but it would probably differ to that of their younger sister Elizabeth, right. The . results showed that identical twins have closer levels of thin . idealisation than fraternal twins - suggesting a 'significant' role for . genetics. This means that identical twins such as Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen are more likely to have the same attitudes towards body image and eating as each other, but will not necessarily share these attitudes with their younger sister, actress Elizabeth. Further research put this figure at . 43 per cent, meaning half of the reasons women differ in their . idealisation of thinness can be explained by their genetic make-up. Results did showed that environmental influences are also important, especially experiences not shared between twins. Non-shared . factors include one twin . being involved in a weight-focused sport like dance, one twin observing . more media that promotes thinness, or one twin having friends . who place importance on weight. A woman's unique DNA dictates how she feels about her body - more so than environmental factors such as diet and the media. Ms Suisman added: 'We were surprised to find that shared environmental factors - such as exposure to the same media - did not have as big an impact as expected. 'Instead, non-shared factors that make co-twins different from each other had the greatest impact. 'The broad cultural risk factors that we thought were most influential in the development of thin-ideal internalisation are not as important as genetic risk and environmental risk factors that are specific and unique to each twin.' Kelly Klump, professor of psychology at MSU and co-author of the study, said a broad range of factors can contribute to the development of eating disorders. She said: 'This study reveals the need to take a similar approach to the ways in which women buy in to pressure to be thin, by considering how both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of thin-ideal internalisation.'","Research carried out at Michigan State University .

Multiple personalities: Diana Williamson claims she is not responsible for defrauding Medicaid for $300,000 . A once-respected doctor has blamed a 'mischievous' alternate personality for defrauding Medicaid of $300,000 by writing prescriptions for painkiller pills which were later sold on the street. Diana Williamson, 56, who founded an Aids institute and ran educational programmes in prisons, pleaded guilty to the crimes but said they were carried out by one of her many personalities. Urging the court  to show  leniency, her defense lawyer Jonathan Marks said Williamson's crimes were really committed by a personality called Nala, who is 'mischievous, irresponsible, reckless and, as we have just discovered, criminal.' Williamson decline to speak in court but in a letter to the judge, she too blamed . Nala, saying she 'committed these crimes without telling Diana or the . other parts of me about them. 'Perhaps . it sounds incredible that a part of me could be doing something that . the rest of me would not know about. 'But everything . about dissociative disorder is difficult to fathom for those who do not . have it.' Williamson was due to be sentenced on Monday, but U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska delayed a final determination until prison authorities say whether they can treat a variety of illnesses her lawyer says would certainly lead to her death behind bars. Scam: Williamson wrote prescriptions for tablets such as Oxycontin, . known in America as 'hillbilly heroin', which were later sold on the . street for up to $20 each . The government has recommended she go to prison for 11 years or more, but Mr Marks says any prison time would be a death sentence because Williamson has several severe medical issues that can't be treated in prison and require occasional emergency trips to a hospital. The judge seemed skeptical of the multiple personality argument. 'I guess I'm having trouble understanding that with the defendant's remarkable medical career, having founded an AIDS hospital ... it doesn't seem to have impaired her ability to function as a medical professional,' the judge said. She delayed sentencing after a prosecutor acknowledged Williamson's severe medical issues and said a Bureau of Prisons official would have to say whether the prisons could handle her issues. Twist of fate: The once-respected Williamson ran an Aids awareness educational . programme at Rikers Island jail but could soon be headed there herself . The government says Williamson defrauded Medicaid out of about $300,000, part of roughly $1 million that a wider conspiracy managed to scam from the program. Prosecutors say Williamson wrote phony prescriptions for about 11,000 painkiller pills that were bought with Medicaid benefits and then peddled on the street. Authorities said the ring mostly dealt in oxycodone, a highly addictive pain medication often sold on the black market for $20 to $40 per pill as a substitute for heroin and other illegal drugs. Two decades ago, Williamson, of Harlem, made a business magazine's list of young professionals on the rise.","Diana Williamson, 56, wrote prescriptions for painkillers which were later sold on the street .

Glamour model and former CBB star Rhian Sugden's 'secret ex boyfriend' has been revealed as a convicted killer. Friends of the 26-year-old say she was dating former model Kevin O'Dea, who was jailed for seven years for his part in a revenge attack which left a student dead in Liverpool, for months. Rhian, who became famous after 'sexting' married TV star Vernon Kaye, is said to have been desperate to keep her boyfriend's identity a secret - even 'banning him' from her eviction from the CBB house. 'Secret love': Rhian is said to be desperate to keep her ex boyfriend's identity a secret as it emerged he is a convicted killer . Irish O'Dea was jailed for seven years in 2008 after being found guilty of attacking 24-year-old Sion Hardy in 2007. Former model O'Dea met Rhian in a Manchester club after being released last year - before her stint in Celebrity Big Brother. And sources claimed in The Daily Star that there could be no way she didn't know about O'Dea's time in jail. The friend said: 'Kevin has been flaunting the fact he is seeing Rhian and he has posted pictures of them together on Facebook. The model and the lag: While Rhian Sugden is more used to posing for paparazzi her ex boyfriend, convicted killer Kevin O'Dea, is more comfortable in custody shots . 'He is very open about his conviction for ­manslaughter and everyone who knows him knows about it. So I’m sure Rhian does too.' Critics of Rhian had said her former boyfriend failed to turn up to her CBB after her incessant flirting with Olympian Ashley McKenzie. But friends of the couple said it was because Rhian was determined to keep their relationship a secret from the public. O'Dea, now a personal trainer, is known for being a 'ladies man' pals said. Fake smile? The blonde was grinning as she left the house but looked uneasy as a member of staff led her to the interview . One university classmate added: 'He’s good-looking and very charming and girls also fell for his Irish accent. O’Dea, who was 22 and a sports science student, was found guilty of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court in May 2008. His victim, Hardy, from Bangor, Gwynedd was described as a 'special, unique and happy person' by his family. During the court case a jury heard Hardy had been out at Nation nightclub in Liverpool with friends and was later attacked, he died after receiving a blow to the neck. Famous pals: Rhian Sugden doesn't mind posing up with celebrity friends but kept her relationship with convicted killer quiet . During the case it emerged Hardy's friend Stephen Lunne was the target of the attack after an earlier incident in the club. Hardy ran into Lunne outside and as the pair walked through a nearby underpass, O'Dea and his gang pounced. The Liverpool University student suffered a brain hemorrhage and was pronounced dead at the Royal Liverpool Hospital. After the attack, O’Dea and his pals were seen 'celebrating'. O’Dea always claimed he was acting in self-defence but a jury dismissed his account. Rhian declined to comment after being contacted by the MailOnline but tweeted yesterday that: 'The guy I WAS seeing is not a killer... And I'm actually single now.' It is not clear when the pair separated.","Kevin O'Dea was jailed for seven years for his part in a revenge attack which left a student dead .

More than 700,000 people could have fled Syria by the end of the year, the United Nations said yesterday. The estimate came as the UN refugee agency, in conjunction with 51 aid agencies, asked for more aid to help deal with the refugees. So far donors have given around £100million toward humanitarian assistance for the estimated 294,000 Syrians who have fled abroad but the UN says £302million is needed. Humanitarian crisis: Syrian refugee Ghassan . Baradan, 50, who fled violence in Daraa, in the Zaatari Refugee Camp, in . Mafraq, Jordan. The UN is asking for more money to help those fleeing the civil war in Syria . With no end in sight to the 18-month conflict and 2,000 to 3,000 Syrians crossing daily into neighbouring countries, humanitarian groups are preparing to help up to 710,000 by the end of the year, the UN said. This includes Syrians who have already fled abroad but have yet to come forward to register as refugees. Panos Moumtzis, Syria coordinator for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said: ‘We only have one third of the funding we need to respond and we are running out of time.’ Almost 95,000 Syrians have found . refuge in Jordan, followed by almost 88,000 in Turkey and 78,000 in . Lebanon. Some 33,000 Syrians have fled to Iraq, which recently reopened . its border crossing at al-Qaim. Mr Baradan's 46-year-old wife wipes her eyes as she speaks during an interview at the camp: Humanitarian groups are preparing to help up to 710,000 refugees from Syria by the end of the year, the UN said . The urgent call for help came as Syrian authorities sent text messages nationwide with a message for rebels fighting President Bashar Assad's regime saying: 'Game over'. The messages signed by the Syrian Arab Army urged the rebels to surrender their weapons and warned the countdown to evict foreign fighters has begun. The texts appear to be part of the regime's psychological battle against the rebels, but are thought to be highly unlikely to have any effect on fighters intent on toppling Mr Assad. Syrian rebel righters in Aleppo: The Syrian government has sent text messages nationwide saying that it is 'game over' for the insurgency and urging rebels to lay down their arms . Civil war: Syrian army soldiers pore over a map . while on patrol to root out rebel fighters from the Suleiman al-Halabi . neighbourhood of Aleppo. After 18 months of fighting the two sides are locked in a stalemate . Syrians say they began receiving the messages a day after rebels bombed a military command centre in Damascus - a major security breach of the heavily guarded capital. People with mobile subscriptions received the messages while those with prepaid phones did not, residents of Damascus said. Despite the high-profile attack, the two sides have been locked in a stalemate after 18 months of conflict. Activists claim the death toll since the conflict began in March last year has recently topped 30,000, with nearly two-thirds of the casualties reported in the past six months. In August, Syrian army helicopters dropped leaflets warning rebels in Damascus to hand over their arms and seek amnesty. Black smoke rises from Syria's army headquarters in Damascus on Wednesday: Twin blasts targeting the army HQ set off hours of sporadic gunbattles . and a raging fire inside the heavily guarded compound . A Lebanese TV station yesterday broadcast footage showing Syrian government troops driving rebels from a building they had briefly occupied a day earlier after a double car bomb attack on the military HQ. The images from Lebanon's Al Manar TV station further demonstrated the scale of the security breach of the heavily guarded capital by rebels determined to topple the Assad regime. The fighters detonated car bombs that engulfed the army headquarters in flames, followed by three hours of gunbattles in and around the compound yesterday. The government said four army guards were killed and 14 people were wounded, including civilians and military personnel. The carefully orchestrated attacks were the most dramatic security breach in the centre of the capital since July, when rebels detonated explosives inside a high-level crisis meeting that killed four top regime officials, including Assad's brother-in-law and the defence minister. Syrian activists said more than 305 people were killed across Syria yesterday, making it one of the deadliest days since the conflict began. They included at least 40 people whose bodies were discovered in a suburb of Damascus, some of whom appeared to have been killed execution-style.","UNHCR warns it has only one third of the funding it needs .

George Michael, who has cancelled his nine-date Australian tour, is pictured in concert earlier this month in the UK . He said: ‘I have tried in vain to work my way through the trauma that the doctors who saved my life warned me I would experience. ‘They recommended complete rest and the type of post-traumatic counseling which is available in cases like mine but I’m afraid I believed (wrongly) that making music and getting out there to perform for the audiences that bring me such joy would be therapy enough in itself.’ The singer said he had ‘seriously underestimated’ how difficult the past year would be. ‘Although I was right to believe that the shows would bring me great happiness and that my voice would recover completely (I truly think that some of my recent performances have been my best ever) I was wrong to think I could work my way through the major anxiety that has plagued me since I left Austria last December,’ he said.

David Cameron last night called on the international community to ‘ramp up’ the pressure on Syria as Kofi Annan quit as  special envoy to the country. The former UN secretary general launched a blistering attack on world powers over their failure to unite over escalating violence in the country. Mr Annan said he was unable to carry on his role while the current stand-off remains between the five veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council. China and Russia, whose president Vladimir Putin met Mr Cameron in  London yesterday, oppose intervention. Mr Annan was behind a six-point peace plan for Syria that has failed to bring an end to the fighting. Speaking in Geneva, he said: ‘When the Syrian people desperately need action, there continues to be finger pointing and name calling in the Security Council. ‘It is impossible for me or anyone to compel the Syrian government, and also the opposition, to take the steps to bring about the political process. 'As an envoy, I can’t want peace more than the protagonists, more than Security Council or the international community, for that matter.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘We need to actually ramp things up, we need to pass resolutions at the UN, to put further pressure on Syria.’ The Prime Minister discussed the crisis with Mr Putin at Downing Street yesterday before going to watch the Olympic judo with the Russian, who is a black belt holder in the sport. Following the talks, Mr Cameron insisted it was necessary to work with the Russians to persuade them to back a political transition in Syria. But no progress appeared to have been made.

Anyone trying to solve the decades-old mystery of Jimmy Hoffa's whereabouts can be sure about one thing - he's not under a driveway in suburban Detroit. Authorities drilled through concrete and removed soil samples in Roseville, Michigan, on Friday in the latest effort to find the remains of the Teamsters boss, who disappeared in 1975. They found nothing, and now, tests on the soil have returned with no signs of human remains. Scroll down for video . Digging: After the dig on Friday, tests of the soil underneath the Roseville, Michigan, driveway showed no signs of human decomposition . Where in the world? Jimmy Hoffa, pictured in 1966, was last seen at a suburban Detroit restaurant in 1975 . Not a burial spot: This driveway in Roseville, Michigan, was the focus of the investigation after a cancer-stricken tipster said Hoffa may have been buried there . The wait: Results of the soil testing at the driveway were revealed on Tuesday afternoon . In a statement released on Tuesday, the Roseville Police Department said: 'After a battery of tests; the samples submitted for examination showed no signs of human decomposition. 'As a result of these tests the Roseville Police Department will be concluding their investigation into the possible interment of a human body upon the property.' Authorities admitted that they had . their doubts from the start after receiving a tip from a  cancer-plagued . man who swore he saw a body being buried 35 years ago that 'may have . been Jimmy.' Roseville Police Chief James Berlin said on Friday: 'We're not sure if anything is down there. That's what this is all about.' They drilled the concrete floor of a shed attached to a driveway where a recent radar test revealed a shift in the soil. Hoffa's body has not been found despite a . number of searches over the years and the case remains one of the . biggest mysteries in modern American history. Investigation: Police officials drilled through the concrete driveway to obtain a soil sample that was tested for signs of human decomposition . Mystery: Rumors have swirled since Hoffa's disappearance that he was entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a fat-rendering plant . The anonymous tipster reportedly kept . the dark secret for 37 years because he was terrified that the mob, or whoever killed Hoffa, would come after him. The homeowner, Patricia Szpunar, 72, has lived there since 1988. She said her son uses the 12-by-12 shed to store two workbenches and his motorcycle. Police detectives appeared more than two weeks ago and said they may need to search her yard for a dead body. Szpunar said on Friday: 'I laughed at them. I looked at them and said, `What? Do you think Jimmy Hoffa is buried in my backyard?' ... They just looked at me, and asked why I said Jimmy Hoffa.' Supervision: The owner of the property, second from left, watches police drill through his concrete driveway on Friday . Authorities had already said that they did not believe the timeline added up and that it's unlikely Hoffa's body is there. He was last seen July 30, 1975, outside a restaurant in Oakland County, more than 30 miles to the west. Recently retired Detroit FBI chief Andrew Arena was among the doubters. 'You've got to check it out, but this doesn't sound right,' he told The Associated Press. 'The working theories that have developed over the years, this really doesn't fit any of those. Evidence: Roseville Police Department detectives carry soil samples removed from the site of the dig . Unearthed: On July 16, 2003, authorities searched under a backyard pool in Hampton Township, Michigan . Other attempts: In May of 2004, investigators ripped up floorboards of a home in the Detroit suburbs where one-time Jimmy Hoffa ally Frank Sheeran claims to have killed him . Hunt continues: In 2006, searchers in formation inspected a field at Hidden Dreams Farm in Milford Township, Michigan . 'If this was the mob and they killed somebody, I just don't see them burying the body basically at the intersection of a residential neighborhood with this guy standing there.' Berlin said he's not claiming it's Hoffa under the slab, but they are 'investigating a body that may be at the location.' Neighbors say that the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975. They . recalled seeing cars coming and going from the home at strange hours, . however, the family of four that lived there moved away before police . closed in. A scan by . ground-penetrating radar confirmed that the earth below the concrete pad . had been disturbed and that there is likely 'something' down there. Media circus: Reporters and other onlookers flooded the Roseville, Michigan, home as authorities drilled for soil samples . Tourist attraction: Onlookers stop to take pictures at the alleged burial site in Roseville, Michigan . Waiting: Police officers stand around as the floor of a Roseville, Michigan shed is drilled for soil samples in the latest attempt to uncover the remains of Jimmy Hoffa . Feisty and iron-willed in contract talks, Hoffa was an acquaintance of mobsters and adversary to federal officials. He spent time in prison for jury tampering. The day he disappeared, Hoffa was supposed to meet with a New Jersey Teamsters boss and a Detroit mafia captain. He was declared legally dead in 1982. Previous tips led police to excavate soil in 2006 at a horse farm more than 100 miles north of Detroit, rip up floorboards at a Detroit home in 2004 and search beneath a backyard pool north of the city in 2003. There were even rumors that Hoffa's remains were ground up and tossed into a Florida . swamp, entombed beneath Giants Stadium in New Jersey or obliterated in a . mob-owned fat-rendering plant. Shady past? Neighbors say that the house where authorities are searching for Hoffa's body was a possible gambling den in 1975 . Stadium burial? Self-described hit man Donald Frankos claimed Hoffa was buried under Giants Stadium - which was demolished in 2010 . Jimmy Hoffa waves to delegates at the opening of the Teamsters Union convention at Miami Beach, Florida in 1957 . Roseville is one of several inner-ring communities that grew quickly as unionized auto factory workers left the city in search of nicer homes and bigger yards. News of the latest search has brought attention to the mostly working- and middle-class suburb from the curious and naysayers. Slowly moving vehicles have clogged the residential street as camera-wielding neighbors snapped photos for keepsakes. 'I believe it's him. My sister said it is, and she's a psychic,' said Mike Smith after ambling up to the home Thursday and shying a bit from the yellow police tape stretched across the driveway. One local theory that has endured was that the body was beneath the foundation of a downtown Detroit hockey stadium, said 57-year-old Cindi Frank, who snapped photos Thursday of the driveway. Believed dead: Hoffa was declared legally deceased on July 30, 1982, when he would have been 69 . The daughter of a unionized driver and salesman for a Detroit bakery, Frank remembers conversations about Hoffa while he was alive and rumors about his fate. 'It was a family thing. Every time we'd go somewhere we'd say, ""Hey, I wonder if Jimmy Hoffa is buried there?""' Frank said. 'It's just been one of those unsolved mysteries that's gone on for 30-something years.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 18:23 EST, 27 January 2012 . A tubby tom cat has become the country's first ever feline to undergo knee-replacement surgery after vets ruled out amputating his cancer-stricken leg because of his size. Cyrano, a 10-year-old kitty who weighs more than 20 pounds, has been helped by doctors and engineers at North Carolina State University after cancer left his left hind leg almost useless. Surgeon Denis Marcellin-Little and  university engineer Ola Harryssonare are at the forefront of osseointegration, a process in which a prosthetic limb is fused to a living bone. Sitting kitty: Cyrano awaits the operation to replace his knee that was weakened by cancer. He is joined by (left to right) engineer Ola Harrysson, surgeon Denis Marcellin-Little and handler Crystal Ritenour . Gadget: Marcellin-Little with the type of artificial cat knee joint - that can bend and rotate - used in Cyrano's leg . Although a British doctor carried out a full knee replacement on a cat crushed by a car in 2009, the surgery carried out by Marcellin-Little used materials more like those used for human operations. 'This is the most complex implant that NC State has made and really, in . all honesty, that anyone has built for any situation that I know of,' Marcellin-Little, a French-born vet, told the Associated Press. The scientists used plastic and cobalt chromium alloy implant for the operation on Cyrano, whose full name is Mr. Cyrano L. Catte II. 'It has a form of articulation that is unique - that allows the implant to bend and rotate,' Marcellin-Little said. 'The devil is in the details.' Whiskered away: Ten-year-old Cyrano was in surgery for more than six hours in North Carolina . Mice work: Vets operate on Cyrano, believed to be the nation's first recipient of a feline total-knee replacement . While these implants are commonplace in dogs, a cat's small frame is harder to work with. Cyrano's damaged bones posed an extra challenge, Marcellin-Little told the AP. The new knee was made using a laser process that hardens metal powder to replicate his tiny bones. The two interconnecting parts each measure around two inches long. Marcellin-Little practiced the . procedure four times on plastic models ahead of the surgery, which took . around six-and-a-half hours to complete. The kitty is expected to be back on his paws in about a week - but won't be catching mice just yet. 'We would like him to take it easy for . about three months after surgery,' Marcellin-Little said. 'And then we . will let him be himself.' Treating the process more as a research . project, much of the time and materials used were donated so a cost . estimate was impossible to make. But it cost owners Sandra Lerner and . Len Bosack around $20,000. Speaking from the waiting room, Lerner told the AP that 'Rat Boy' is worth every penny. Cat scan: Cyrano, who is now recovering, has a knee joint made from plastic and metal, as seen on the X-ray . On the mend: Cyrano will be back on his feet within a week but will have to take it easy for three months . 'He's my child. And if it were your child, would you begrudge the money?' she said. 'I have a personal philosophy that people are, at best, equal with the other inhabitants of the planet. And I'm very, very grateful that I have the money and (am) able to do it.' In 2009, British vets used a stainless-steel joint for Missy the cat's knee after she was knocked down by a car. Amputation was not an option as her . other hind leg had been broken in eight places. Doctors faced putting . her down or finding another solution. Family: Owners Sandra Lerner and Len Bosack sit in a waiting room. The operation cost them $20,000 . The hinged implant was custom-designed based on a CT scan of Missy's knee and exactly fitted her measurements in terms of the size of her bones and the range of motion of her knee joint. It was bonded to the thigh and shin bones using cement. At the time, Dr Fitzpatrick said: 'The most difficult thing about the operation was miniaturising the implants and matching the hinge motion to allow walking, running and jumping, which cats do a lot of. 'A human patient with a knee replacement would probably walk and maybe even run but would rarely expect to jump.'","Cyrano underwent surgery after cancer left his leg weak and useless - but his body was too heavy to have it amputated .

There is a £550,000 shortfall for the cost of staging the event, attended by the Queen, which David Cameron has refused to meet from official funds. In a letter sent to the Bomber Command Association yesterday, the Prime Minister said the Government ‘does not usually support opening ceremonies for public memorials’. Worrying: War heroes face losing their homes to pay for the unveiling of the Bomber Command Memorial in London's Green Park because the Government is refusing to make up a £550,000 shortfall . The decision means trustees of the . charity will be legally  liable to foot the bill. Hard-pressed veterans . are now scrambling to raise money as invoices arrive. Association chairman Air Commodore Malcolm White said ministers ‘could and should have done more’. Survivors had to raise the money to . build their own monument to recognise the sacrifice and courage of their . lost comrades. Bomber Command suffered the highest casualty rate of any . British unit in the Second World War, losing 55,573 of its 125,000 men. In 1940, Winston Churchill praised it . as Britain’s ‘salvation’. But amid public disquiet at the controversial . tactic of carpet-bombing German  cities, he snubbed the airmen in his . 1945 victory broadcast.

Tribute: A Royal Air Force Lancaster Bomber drops poppies during the opening of the Bomber Command Memorial to commemorate the loss of 55,573 airmen during the Second World War . In June, the sculpture depicting a . crew returning from a mission was unveiled by the Queen in Green Park, . central London, in front of more than 6,500 veterans and widows. The final cost of the ceremony, . including seating, security, insurance and catering, was £827,000. The . association has received £270,000 in donations, including £200,000 from . the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. But the Ministry of Defence reneged on a pledge to match DCMS funding. The pensioners fear they will be forced to sell their homes to meet the six-figure shortfall. Former rear gunner Harry Irons, 88, of . Romford, Essex, who survived 60 missions, said: ‘I do not know where we . are going to get the money from. There’s talk that we could lose our . houses. ‘We are very bitter. The MoD was happy enough to send us to war. The Government has a moral responsibility to step in.' Remembering: In June, more than 6,500 war veterans and widows gathered to watch the Queen unveil the sculpture in Green Park of a bomber crew returning from a mission . Honouring: A general view of the Bomber command memorial in Green Park . He added: ‘They gave us nothing after the war. They were embarrassed about what we did to Germany.

The new devices are a Nook HD tablet with a 7-inch screen, starting at $199, and a Nook HD+ with a new 9-inch screen, starting at $269. In addition to new HD screens and a . lighter body, Barnes & Noble is also increasing the services the .

Scroll down for video . William Lynch, chief executive of Barnes & Noble, unveils the new NOOK HD+, left, and NOOK HD in New York. New York-based Barnes & Noble, the largest traditional U.S. bookseller, has invested heavily in its Nook e-reader and e-books. The company will continue to sell its smaller black-and-white e-reader, called the Nook Simple Touch, for $99, and a backlit Nook Simple Touch for $139. The Nook HD runs on Google's Android 4.0 system and includes Barnes & Noble's own app store and browser. It is an upgrade to the . hardware and services offered by its previous tablets, the Nook Tablet . and Nook Color, which Barnes & Noble is phasing out. However, the firm faces a tough battle. Seven out of every 10 tablets sold in the second quarter were iPads, according to IHS iSuppli. Amazon.com has a 4.2 percent share of the tablet market, while Barnes & Noble has a 1.9 percent share, according to iSuppli. However, experts say the bookseller is in with a chance. 'If the decision the consumer is making is whether to buy based on hardware, these new Nooks will beat out Amazon,' said Forrester analyst James McQuivey. 'But that's not the decision every consumer is going to make - hardware is only as good as the services the hardware enables.' So far, Amazon offers more services, McQuivey said, with a bigger app store, and more extensive video library, not to mention Amazon's vast product offerings and its Amazon Prime free-shipping service. In an attempt to measure up, Barnes & Noble is launching a video service that lets users buy and watch movies and TV shows on their mobile devices and televisions.

Mitt Romney has launched another attack on Barack Obama, arguing that the President is anti-business and has run out of ideas to boost the struggling economy. The Republican candidate, who has just returned from a trip to Europe, said Mr Obama was 'like a dog trying to chase its tail' in his economic policies during a speech on Thursday in Golden, Colorado. While the President was campaigning hundreds of miles away in Florida, Mr Romney's message followed him there as his campaign put up billboards criticising his controversial statement that small business owners are not responsible for their own success. Mr Obama was greeted with ads from Mr Romney featuring entrepreneurs with the message: 'Mr President, I built my business.' Attack: Mitt Romney once again criticised the President's approach to economic growth in a Colorado speech . Counter-attack: Mr Obama is accusing Mr Romney of trying to reduce his own tax rate . Billboard: This campaign ad takes aim at Mr Obama's claims that small business owners rely on others . The President fired back with a claim that the GOP candidate supports 'trickle-down fairy dust' that has been shown not to improve the economy, and summarised Mr Romney's tax plans in a scathing television ad: 'He pays less. You pay more.' For Mr Romney, Thursday saw a return to domestic campaigning after a weeklong overseas trip. He is expected to announce his running mate soon, but the former Massachusetts governor gave no indication during the day that he has made a decision. Instead, he unveiled a plan for more jobs and more take-home pay, coupled with a self-generated report card that said Massachusetts enjoyed better economic times when he was governor than the nation has under Mr Obama. Mr Romney said his economic policies would lead to the creation of 12million jobs over the first four years, and help make North America energy-independent. He pledged to expand international trade, particularly with Latin America, and vowed to confront China over its own policies. Star-studded: Mr Romney appeared with ten Republican governors at an event in Basalt, Colorado . Say cheese: The President posed with a group of children at a restaurant in Orlando, Florida on Thursday . 'I'm finally going to sit down with the Chinese and they're going to understand that if they cheat there are going to be consequences, because we're not going to let them walk all over us,' Mr Romney said. He said he would help small business owners, improve the education system and cut spending to reduce the deficit, but he offered relatively few specifics. Mr Romney has previously he wants to extend the tax cuts due to expire on December 31 and grant a new 20 per cent cut in tax rates in addition to stimulate growth. He has also said he will reverse some of Mr Obama's proposed defence cuts, and simultaneously reduce spending on other programmes in a way that deficits would gradually subside. But he has so far refused to identify which existing tax breaks he would curtail to accomplish his goals, and generally avoided naming individual programmes he wants to cut or eliminate. In his remarks during the . day, Mr Romney said he wants federal education funds that aid the . disadvantaged and disabled to be tied to the student rather than flow to . school districts, as is now the case. But he did not specify how much . he would cut from them to achieve his goal of reducing federal deficits. He . criticised Mr Obama for signing legislation that cut $500billion from . Medicare over a decade. But he did not say whether he would restore the . funds, and he has spoken favourably in the past of a House-passed budget . that left the reductions in place. Crowd: The GOP candidate climbed on a table to address a throng of supporters at a fairground . Hungry for victory: Mr Romney boarded his campaign aeroplane with a bag of McDonald's in hand . In his comments, Mr Romney said Democrats have a different view. 'They think we should just raise taxes,' he said. 'The problem is when you raise taxes you lower growth.' Mr Obama's approach is 'like a dog trying to chase its tail, you just don't ever get there,' he added. 'So the right answer is not to raise taxes. The right answer is to cut taxes and cut spending.' For the second day in a row, Mr Obama cited a study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center that says Mr Romney and other millionaires would receive a tax cut of approximately $250,000 a year if the former Massachusetts governor gets his way. 'This analysis also found that if Governor Romney wants to keep his word' about reducing deficits, 'the average middle-class family with children would be stuck with a tax increase of more than $2,000,' he added. The President's new campaign ad was delivering the same highly personalised message. It says that Mr Romney has paid a lower proportion of his income in taxes than many people of lesser means and adds: 'He pays less, you pay more.' Mr Romney's personal wealth has been estimated as high as $250million, but he has not so far made public any detailed disclosure of his holdings. The Republican rolled out his own new ad, giving a less-than-warm welcome to Mr Obama on a day Air Force One touched down in Florida. It notes that the state still suffers from high unemployment, record home foreclosures and an increase in poverty. 'Barack Obama: What a disappointment,' it says.","Both candidates take to swing states to push economic message .

It is rushing out The Paradise, a series set in a 19th-century department store, to beat ITV’s Mr Selfridge to our screens. Battle of the period dramas: The BBC brings forward The Paradise in a bid to beat ITV's Mr Selfridge to our screens . The show, which had been expected to start next year, will now begin on Tuesday, September 25. The corporation hopes to avoid a repeat of its Upstairs Downstairs relaunch, which suffered in the shadows of ITV’s hit. The BBC drama was cancelled after two series, while Downton returns for a third run tomorrow. The Paradise’s launch comes amid a war of words, with the BBC accusing ITV of copying its idea. An insider said: ‘It’s peculiar that months after we announce a drama about a department store, they [ITV] saw fit to do exactly the same thing. BBC bosses weren’t best thrilled . . . so we are pleased to get it out first.’ The corporation has not even finished filming its latest eight-part drama, which is based on a novel by French author Emile Zola. The book’s Paris store has been relocated to North-East England for the TV adaptation, which features Sarah Lancashire.

Neglected: Mr Hands was made to sit for hours in hospital after he feared he was having a stroke . An 80-year-old widower who raised thousands of pounds for a hospital has spoken of his anger at being left in a waiting room for most of the night after suffering from a suspected stroke. Charity worker Ron Hands, who has raised over £100,000 for his local hospital, phoned the emergency services after he woke in the middle of the night with a swollen face and his mouth drooping. Fearing he had suffered a stroke he called an ambulance and was taken to Bournemouth General Hospital, Dorset. It was here that Mr Hands was made to sit in a wheelchair in the waiting room for the majority of the night, as staff attended to a number of drunk patients before assisting him. Mr Hands, who worked tirelessly for 33 years to raise money for the hospital which had treated his wife before she died of pancreatic cancer, was left stunned with the way he was treated after arriving at the hospital. The retired hotel doorman, who resides in Southbourne, Bournemouth, said he was so distressed by the way he was treated he has written to the CEO of the hospital demanding pensioners be dealt with in a more considerate way. Mr Hands said he does not want any other pensioners to be treated the way he was and spent a sleepless night watching drunk people being seen to by staff at Bournemouth General Hospital, Dorset. He said: 'I was really scared. I’d recently had tests for deep vein thrombosis and my first thought was that I might have had a stroke.' Mr Hands was given a brief examination at the A&E department of the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, but was then left sitting in a wheelchair in the waiting room for four hours from 2.30am to 6.30am, when he was finally seen by a doctor. Giving: Mr Hands worked tirelessly for 33 years to raise money for the hospital which had treated his wife before she died of pancreatic cancer . 'It was horrible just sitting there on my own frightened about what was wrong with me,' said Mr Hands. 'The receptionist did come and offer me a cup of tea at about 5.00am, but other than that the only other people there were some girls who’d been on a hen night. 'One of their mates had something wrong with her eye and they were all a bit drunk. It wasn’t very nice.' Hours later, Mr Hands was eventually told that he probably had a dental abscess and was discharged with antibiotics and the promise of a letter to his GP. Former doorman at the town’s four star Royal Bath Hotel, Mr Hands started the Mary Hands Trust in 1989 after Mary, his wife of 33 years, died of pancreatic cancer. For the next 20 years he raised more than £100,000 for hospital equipment in the name of the trust. It is believed that at least £75,000 of that money helped pay for equipment, including a scanner at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. Ron Hands (left) started the Mary Hands Trust in 1989 after the death of his wife Mary (right). For the next 20 years he raised more than £100,000 for hospital equipment in the name of the Trust . Mr Hands finally called a halt to his charity work in 2009 saying he was leaving it to the younger generation to continue the fundraising work. Sitting in his modest flat a week after his ordeal and looking through letters of thanks that he had received from the hospital over the years, Mr Hands said: 'I certainly don’t think I should have received any special treatment but it’s awful that anyone is put through this kind of thing. 'I’m not someone who makes a fuss and I’m certainly not a hypochondriac. I really was worried about what was wrong with me. 'Being left sitting there for hours in the middle of the night I was thinking ""If my wife could see me now."" It was hurtful.' Now Ron has written to Tony Spotswood, the Chief Executive of the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, outlining his ordeal and asking him to investigate. In a direct plea he has asked 'Please Mr Spotswood to save this happening again to other elderly patients I think that just a little more consideration for the not so able should be looked into.' There has currently been no reply from Mr Spotswood, whose organisation’s motto is 'Putting patients first'.","Ron Hands made to wait most of the night to be treated after he feared he was suffering from a stroke .

Unfair advantage: Simon Cho of USA, centre, won gold and Olivier Jean of Canada, left, won silver in the Mens 500m in March of last year, two days before the championship . 'He sounded . personally understanding,' Cho said of his conversation. Cho said the . tampering occurred after the U.S. team had already been eliminated from . competition. Head coach: Olympic speedskating head coach Jae Su Chun, pictured in 2010, has now been suspended . 'When he spoke in Korean, I knew he was serious,' Cho, said of his coach Jae Su Chun, at a press conference at his attorney's Salt Lake City office today. 'The . repetitiveness and aggressiveness of how he came at me was very . intimidating. ... I knew he wasn't going to take no for an answer.' He maintained Chun was angry at the Canadians and convinced they had aided another team to ensure the U.S. had been eliminated. Cho said the tampering took just a few . seconds, and was done with a blade bender normally used to ensure a . skater's blade follows the proper radius in short track. 'I always knew it was wrong that day,' Cho said. 'I was very scared. I was frightened. And I was intimidated.' He . said Chun at the time said he would take full responsibility if the . tampering were ever discovered. But when Cho spoke with him about it a . month ago, he said Chun denied any involvement. The . allegations are part a scandal involving Chun, also accused by a dozen . national team members of 'unchecked' verbal, psychological and physical . abuse. Cho has not signed . onto the complaint and continues to skate with the National Racing . Program under interim coach Jun Hyung Yeo. But said he would not skate . for Chun. Stiff competition: Olivier Jean of Canada, number 212, competed last year in the finals, but had a bent skate . Cho said fellow skater Jeff Simon witnessed the first request in English. Cho also said he would not skate again . for Chun, whom he said he personally witnessed douse a skater with . water and hit him with a notebook. Cho's comments confirmed several allegations made in the arbitration demand that seeks to permanently remove U.S. coach Chun. Canadian speed skater Olivier Jean said last month that he suspected his skates had been tampered with in the 2011 team championship in Poland. He said that at the time, ‘we had our suspicions there was sabotage but we had no proof,’ the Chicago Tribune reported. He said that before the race, the teams from the U.S. and Canada shared a dressing room. Jean told Montreal newspaper La Presse at the time: ‘If there had been a plot orchestrated by the coaches, they should have been…shrewd enough to keep it among themselves and not involve athletes, which increases the chance for leaks.’ Chun has denied any wrongdoing but is suspended. U.S. Speedskating has scheduled a press conference later Friday to discuss the findings of an independent investigation of Chun. 'The . conduct at issue is repugnant and antithetical to the values of the . Olympic Movement and inconsistent with Team USA's commitment to fair . play,' Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the U.S. Olympic Committee, . said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Friday morning. 'We . regret that an American athlete was involved, and intend to actively . engage with US Speedskating to ensure that appropriate action is taken.' Cho, who turns 21 in a few days, couldn't say what would happen with Chun or the other coaches but said he has been 'honest and forthright' with all investigations. 'I hope that I can make up for my mistake and continue to skate in the future,' said Cho, a 2010 Olympic relay bronze medalist and 2011 individual world champion. On Sunday, after failing to qualify for the U.S. fall World Cup team, Cho said he expected to be banned or suspended because of the charges. Chun's attorney, Russell Fericks, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Friday. But on Thursday he said it was his personal opinion that Cho is 'young and impressionable.'

A man who admitted having sex with a 12-year-old girl he met online has been sentenced to 270 days in jail following his arrest in May. But prosecutors in Escondido, California say with 24-year-old Christopher Bradley Nutt's time already served and a policy allowing many inmates to serve half of their sentences, he could be out within a week. Nutt, who was found with the child in his . bedroom hours after she was reported missing by her mother, will also . have to serve five years' probation and register as a sex offender for . the rest of his life, a Vista Superior Court Judge ruled. Sentenced: Christopher Nutt, 24, seen from his Facebook profile, has been sentenced to 270 days in jail after having sex with a 12-year-old girl he met online this year . Sex offender: Prosecutors say with Nutt's guilty plea and time already served behind bars he should be out within a week but as a registered sex offender . Nutt's attorney argued his client having not known the girl's true age at the time, believing she was 16 or 18. Speaking to reporters after the sentencing on Thursday, Attorney Dan Greene said: 'This wasn’t a typical case of an adult preying on a 12-year-old girl.' A family member of the girl overhearing Mr Greene's statements shouted at the . man, reports UT San Diego, accusing him of lying. During his sentencing hearing, Nutt apologized to the girl's family himself. 'I would like to accept full responsibility and I wish to extend a sincere and unconditional apology,' he said, according to the paper. A prosecutor speaking with UT San Diego after the sentencing described it as a 'fair and just result.' Prosecutors at the time of his trial accused Nutt of having sexual relations with the girl for an entire month before caught in May of this year. He was charged with five incidents of intercourse with a minor, one incident of sodomy with a child younger than 14, four incidents of lewd acts with a child younger than 13, four incidents of oral copulation of a child younger than 14, five incidents of possession of child pornography and sexual exploitation of a child . Nutt had recently moved to the area from San Dimas. An investigation into the matter showed he met the girl on social networking site Skout. Scene: Police began searching for the girl, calling her friends and checking her cell phone to locate her before she was found in the 1000 block of Nightingale Place . It is unclear how he got her to come to his home. Police say they found the girl after contacting some of her friends and checking her cell phone before the located her at Nutt's home. Joel Mason, who owns the home where Nutt was renting a room, told San Diego6.com: 'I would have never expected it out of this guy, he seemed so clean cut and seemed like a decent person.' The 24-year-old had just moved in about a month-and-a-half ago, and was rarely around, said Mr Mason. During the interview process, Nutt asked Mason if he could occasionally bring girlfriends back to the room.","Christopher Bradley Nutt, 24, has been sentenced to 270 days in jail after police found the missing girl in his bedroom in May .

Britons take fewer basic hygiene precautions against catching the flu than people in America, Mexico, Japan and Argentina, say doctors. In fact, they are so cavalier about spreading or getting the illness that the country could be left wide open to an epidemic, claim the experts. The warning comes after an international survey showed how individuals in the UK fail to follow simple rules such as washing their hands and sneezing into a tissue. 'Complacent': Britons fail to follow simple rules - like sneezing into a tissue - to avoid spreading the flu, according to new research . Just one in five tried to keep away . from people with flu-like symptoms and fewer avoided shopping centres or . sporting events during the flu season. Researchers carried out surveys in the UK, the US, Argentina, Japan and Mexico soon after the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. In . each country, around 900 people were asked how they had modified their . behaviour when there was a risk of catching the virus. Britons . consistently had the most careless attitude. Flu . expert Professor John Oxford, a virologist at the University of London, . said the results of the survey by the Harvard School of Public Health . in the US, were ‘terribly disappointing’. He . predicted that outbreaks of flu would be worse this winter than in . recent years, which made it vital for people to practise prevention. He . said: ‘We have a lot to learn about avoiding infection. 'One explanation . is that we’ve become complacent because we think drugs will always be . available but it’s very likely we will get a novel infection at some . stage when it will be critical to do these basic things to stop us . getting it.’ People in the UK are so cavalier about spreading the flu that the country could be left wide open to an epidemic, experts claim . The study was published in The Lancet medical journal. In one typical response, one in four Britons questioned said that when swine flu was sweeping the country they covered their mouth or nose with a tissue more frequently when sneezing or coughing, or used their elbow or shoulder to catch a sneeze or cough. This compared with 61 per cent of Americans, 77 per cent of Mexicans, 64 per cent of Argentinians and 48 per cent of Japanese. Fifty-three per cent of Britons said they washed their hands more often, compared with 72 per cent of US citizens, 86 per cent of Mexicans, 72 per cent of Japanese and 89 per cent of Argentinians. People from the UK were found to have been the least willing to avoid hugging and kissing during the swine flu pandemic . People from the UK were also the least willing to avoid hugging or kissing members of their family or friends during the pandemic. Only 2 per cent of Britons said they followed this strategy, which was adopted by 46 per cent of Mexicans, 21 per cent of Americans and 19 per cent of Argentinians. The question was not asked in Japan, where kissing is not the cultural norm. Only one in five in the UK tried to avoid being near someone with flu symptoms. Fifty-six per cent of Americans, 53 per cent of Mexicans, 43 per cent of Argentinians, and 35 per cent of Japanese kept away from sick people.","Britons are so cavalier about spreading infection the country could be wide open to an epidemic, say experts .

But it is unlikely Ernesto will turn towards Florida, as a strong ridge of high pressure should keep the system on a more westerly track. Scroll down for video... Warning: Tropical Storm Ernesto swept north of Barbados this morning and is now heading quickly into the Caribbean Sea - where it is expected to become a hurricane . Windy: Forecasters said the eye of the storm was 35 miles northwest of Barbados (pictured) at 2am . Ernesto was racing at a speed of 23mph and was expected to enter the Caribbean this afternoon, staying on the same northwesterly track for the next 48 hours. This would put it just south of Jamaica by Monday, by which time it was expected to have gained hurricane strength. It had top winds of 50mph today and will become a hurricane if those swirling winds reach 74mph. Forecasters warned island residents to expect large waves and 5 to 8cm of rain, with nearly 13cm in isolated areas. Flooded: Tropical Storm Debby left Florida under water in June . Damage: Gordon McClain, left, surveys his water-filled living room in Live Oak, Florida, after Tropical Storm Debby hit in June . Several computer forecasting models showed it moving through or near the Yucatan Channel into the southern Gulf of Mexico in the middle of next week. It was too early to know whether Ernesto could disrupt oil and gas operations clustered in the Gulf. August and September are usually the most active months of the Atlantic-Caribbean hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. David Zelinsky, a meteorologist at the Miami-based National Hurricane Centre, said the storm was a reminder for people to be prepared for the onslaught of bad weather. He said: 'It's our first system coming out of the deep tropics this year. 'So maybe it's a good time for people to review their preparedness plans as we're getting into the part of the season where things normally begin to get a little more active.'","Storm swept north of Barbados this morning and heading to Caribbean .

At least four people were killed and dozens were wounded when a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb near a Syrian security compound. The explosion happened in a predominantly Kurdish town, raising fears that the country's largest ethnic minority might be drawn into a widening civil war. Opposition activists, who are fighting to remove the Syrian president Bashar Assad, claimed the death toll was at least eight. Explosion: Smoke rises following an attack by a suicide bomber near a Syrian security compound in the Kurdish town of Qamishli . Devastation: Men inspect the scene of the car bomb attack in Qamishli, which has raised fears that Syria's Kurdish minority may be drawn into the civil war . Attack: A man stands in the rubble at the scene of the suicide bombing, which killed at least four people and wounded dozens more . The attack, which apparently targeted Syrian intelligence agents, occurred on Sunday in the remote north-eastern town of Qamishli, more than 435 miles from the capital Damascus. Syria's more than 2million Kurds, long marginalised, have largely stayed out of the fighting, although some have participated in protests against Assad's regime. But what began as an uprising 18 months ago has now spiralled into a full-blown bloody civil war. The conflict has killed more than 30,000 people, activists say, and has devastated entire neighbourhoods in Syria's main cities, including Aleppo, the scene of intense fighting on Sunday. The leaders of Turkey and Egypt, among Assad's main enemies, sent stern warnings to the regime and its allies, in speeches to Turkey's ruling party. Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi said that 'we will be on the side of the Syrian people until the bloodshed ends, the cruel regime is gone and Syrian people reach their just rights'. Violence: Syrian rebels take position during clashes with regime forces in the old city of Aleppo . Gun battle: A Syrian rebel fires towards regime forces as his comrade ducks for cover during clashes in Aleppo . War: The conflict has devastated entire neighbourhoods in cities such as Aleppo . Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan urged Syria's allies Russia, China and Iran to end their support for Assad, warning that 'history will not forgive those who stand together with cruel regimes'. Turkey has given shelter to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees and rebel fighters have used the country as a crucial logistical centre since they captured key border territories during the summer. Syrian troops left several towns and villages in the Kurdish north-east during the summer, possibly to divert forces to overstretched troops fighting in hotspots elsewhere. However, the regime has maintained a security presence in Qamishli, which abuts the Turkish border, said Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's blast. Several previous suicide attacks in Syria were claimed by a Syrian militant group, the Al-Nusra Front. Syrian state media said the explosion . went off in an area housing security officers. It said four people were . killed, dozens wounded and nearby buildings damaged. An amateur video posted online by activists showed a column of white smoke rising between buildings in Qamishli. The Observatory said eight Syrian intelligence agents were killed and at least 40 people wounded in the explosion. Most Kurds live in the north-east, but Aleppo and Damascus also have Kurdish-dominated neighborhoods. Crisis zone: Smoke billows from a burning textile factory in the neighbourhood of Arqub in Aleppo (left) and a building in the city's al-Zebdieh district (right) after shelling by regime forces . Last week, a Kurdish district in Syria's largest city, Aleppo, was for the first time drawn into fighting between rebels and regime forces, amid conflicting reports about whether Kurdish gunmen fought alongside the regime or remained on the sidelines. Fighting continued on Sunday in several areas of Aleppo, as part of what rebels say is new push to drive out regime forces. Opposition fighters seized several areas in an initial offensive two months ago, but were unable to keep up the momentum. On Thursday, they announced what they said would be a decisive battle. Either side could potentially shift the direction of an otherwise stalemated war if it seizes Aleppo, a city of 3million people. Abdel Kader, a commander of the Tawhid Brigade, the largest rebel unit in Aleppo, said that his men were fighting in seven areas on Sunday. Pro-Assad troops have been shelling rebel-held districts. Amateur video posted by activists on Sunday showed Syrian warplanes flying over the city and heavy smoke rising from the city's skyline. Before the civil war, Aleppo was Syria's business centre. Its walled old city with a medieval covered market, or souk, was recognised as a World Heritage site, one of six in Syria. Late on Friday, the fighting sparked a huge fire in the market that continued to burn on Saturday, destroying hundreds of shops.

A nephew who was branded an 'ostentatious spendthrift' by his uncle will inherit his £800,000 Cornwall home - despite the elderly relative leaving a will to the contrary. Before he died, aged 90, retired art historian, William 'Bill' Taylor, said his nephew Roger Taylor was 'the last person' he wanted to have Lower Manaton Farm, his grade-II listed long house in Callington. The widower was adamant that his nephew would 'blow all the money' if he got his hands on it and that he wanted to leave £650,000 to charity - but now his wishes have finally been thwarted by an Appeal Court ruling. Dispute: Roger Taylor won his legal battle to get the £800,000 home, despite his uncle's wishes . To the fury of other members of the family and charities that would otherwise have benefited, the court held Mr Taylor to a 'bargain' he made before he died and declared his nephew and his partner, Denise Burkinshaw, the rightful owners of Lower Manaton Farm. It was the disappearance of Mr Taylor’s beloved Etesia lawn mower from an outhouse after his wife’s death that made him realise he should not be alone and he invited his nephew, Miss Burkinshaw and their two children to move down from their Sheffield home to live with him. The couple set up home in the farmhouse’s east wing, while Mr Taylor stayed in the west wing, but by the time Mr Taylor died in 2010 they were dragging each other through the courts. Lower Manaton Farm in Cornwall. The picturesque property has been the focus of a legal battle and family feud . The nephew and his family were . adamant that Mr Taylor had promised to leave them his home in return for . uprooting themselves from their home in Sheffield and moving south to care for him. However, the pensioner insisted the . only deal he ever struck with the couple was that they could live in the . house rent-free if they contributed towards the bills. To the day he died, he insisted he would be entirely within his rights to throw them out. In . August last year, a year after Mr Taylor died, Judge Jeremy Griggs . accepted the couple’s plea that an agreement had been struck by the . uncle and awarded them the whole of Lower Manaton Farm, subject to inheritance tax. Dejected: Gabrielle and Peter Bradbury (left), his niece and her husband, lost out after the Appeals Court ruled in favour of Roger Taylor over ownership of the grade II-listed house. Denise Burkinshaw (right), Taylor's partner, claims they never would have left Sheffield if they had not been promised the house . Tempestuous: A self portrait by the late William Taylor. He claims his nephew was 'the last person' he wanted to have his home . That was despite a witness statement signed by Mr Taylor the month before he died in which he insisted:'Roger would be the last person that I would leave the house to. There was never any intention of leaving my house to him, or anyone else.' The house made up the vast bulk of Mr Taylor’s estate - valued at over £1m - and the judge’s ruling meant that charities, his great-granddaughter, Isobel Constantine, and his niece and her husband all lost out. Judge Griggs’ ruling came under fire at the Court of Appeal where the executors of Mr Taylor’s estate, including his niece Gabrielle Bradbury and her husband Peter, argued that he got it wrong and was far too generous to Roger Taylor and Miss Burkinshaw. Leslie Blohm QC, for the executors, said the relationship between Bill Taylor and his nephew was 'not easy' even before the widower decided to share his home. Mr Taylor had 'bankrupted' his nephew over an unpaid loan in the 1960s and the evidence was that he regarded the younger man as 'a spendthrift, ostentatious and a risky proposition'. The court heard trouble brewed in 2009 when the couple discovered Mr Taylor had no intention of leaving them the house. They went to court, claiming the old man had promised it to them, although he 'vehemently denied' ever having done anything of the sort. The elder Mr Taylor even sought an injunction against the couple, seeking access for himself and his carers to guest rooms and the house’s laundry room. In his ruling, Judge Griggs accepted Denise Burkinshaw’s account that she had only reluctantly agreed to abandon Sheffield for Cornwall and would never have done so had Mr Taylor not assured her that she and her husband would inherit the house. The couple had helped the old man empty his bins, get his car in and out of his garage and put his laundry into the washing machine and, although that 'did not amount to a great deal', the judge said it sealed the 'bargain' they had reached with Mr Taylor. In his final will, signed in 2009, Mr Taylor tried to leave £650,000 - more than half his estate - to charity. He directed that the rest of his his estate be split into 100 equal parts, with 55 of them going to his great granddaughter, Ms Constantine, 15 of them to Mr and Mrs Bradbury and the remaining 30 to Roger Taylor and Miss Burkinshaw - but only on condition that they moved out of the house within six months of his death. However, the pensioner’s plans were defeated by Judge Griggs’ ruling, with the asset that made up almost 80% of his estate going to the couple with whom he was engaged in a bitter legal dispute until he died. Had Mr Taylor’s will been observed, there would have been no inheritance tax liability on his estate but the court heard Judge Griggs’ ruling saddled the estate with a tax bill for almost £160,000.","Roger Taylor wins fight to get grade II-listed property, despite uncle's 'vehement' objection .

A police officer from Dearborn, Michigan, was caught on video issuing a ticket to a woman in retaliation for failing to let him know that she is HIV positive during a routine traffic stop. A 29-minute dash-cam video posted on YouTube shows Officer David Lacey telling Shalandra Jones and her boyfriend, Mark Scott, that he is ticketing them because he is 'aggravated' that the woman did not disclose her HIV status before the traffic cop proceeded to search her vehicle during the August 3 incident. In the footage, Lacey says, 'I don't want to catch something' and 'I got a family.' He then wrote up a ticket for a broken taillight. Scroll down to watch video . Incident: Officer David Lacey (pictured) stopped a 1999 GMC Jimmy in Dearborn, Michigan, on August 3 after noticing that the vehicle has a burnt out brake light . Violations: Lacey, left, determined that the driver, Mark Scott, right, was driving without a license and had a warrant out in his name for an unpaid ticket . In response to the incident, the Dearborn Police Department will have its employees undergo training on HIV and AIDS, CBS Detroit reported. Police Chief Ronald Haddad told The Detroit News that he takes the matter 'very seriously' and is investigating the traffic stop. 'We want our officers to be peak performers, and a complete review will occur,' he said. The Detroit Legal Services, which is representing Jones, said in a statement that the firm 'is working to ensure that Jones is protected to the full extent of the law.' Attorney Joshua L. Moore, president of the firm, called Lacey's actions 'shocking, outdated and illegal,' and said that he is going to pursue all legal avenues for his client. Police Chief Haddad said he is reviewing the incident and 'corrective action will be taken' if the officer is found to have violated department policy. Lacey asked passenger Shalandra Jones to leave the vehicle so he could search it after he smelled marijuana . Aggravated: The officer rifled though the woman's purse and became upset when told that the pills he found inside are her HIV medication . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the risk of contracting HIV from casual contact with an infected individual or her possessions is minimal, while legal experts say that people are not required by law to disclose their HIV status during a casual traffic stop. It all started when Officer Lacey stopped a 1999 GMC Jimmy with a burnt out taillight in Dearborn on August 3, according to The American Independent, which obtained the dash-can footage. The officer asked for Scott's license, but was told that he did not have it on him. After being questioned by Lacey about a strong odor of pot in the vehicle, Jones admitted that that she was in possession of marijuana, and handed him a small bag containing the substance. Lacey then handcuffed Scott and placed him in the back of his patrol car. As he did this, he explained that he had pulled the couple over because of the broken brake light. 'I couldn’t even see who was in the car,' he said. 'I just rolled up and saw the brake light out, and I thought, ""Well, you know, what? I’m kind of bored."" So — might as well – it’s worth a stop.' During a search for warrants for Scott, Lacey discovered that the man was wanted for an outstanding $168 ticket for failure to provide proof of insurance. Retaliation: Lacey told Jones and Scott that he is issuing them tickets because he is 'pissed' the woman failed to tell him she is HIV positive . The dash-cam video shows that the traffic cop became upset after he searched Jones' purse, which contained a pair of earnings, and found the woman's HIV medication. Lacey later said he is 'pissed' that Jones did not notify him of her medical problem prior to his search and said, 'Honestly, if it wasn’t for that, I don’t think I would have wrote anybody for anything. But that kind of really aggravated me, you know what I mean? You got to tell me right away, ""I’ve got this. I’ve got that"" ‘cause at that time, I wasn’t wearing any gloves.' According to the video, Lacey didn't find any sharp objects that could have potentially put him at risk of HIV infection. 'I deal with plenty of crackheads and heroin addicts. Usually they all tell me when they got a needle on them,' said Lacey. 'They'll tell you right away what they got so that way we don't get pissed.' Lacey issued Jones, who claimed to be a medical marijuana patient — though her card had expired — a ticket for illegal marijuana possession. Scott was cited for driving without a license in his possession. In an interview with MyFox Detroit last month, Jones and her attorneys said the officer violated her right to privacy and stripped her off her self-esteem. 'It took me a long time to be able to come outside,' the emotional Jones said. 'It took a long for me to stand up for myself.'

The cyclist, 32, who won a gold and silver medal at London 2012, revealed she has lost 10lb since signing up to Strictly Come Dancing. Thighs the limit: Cycling star Victoria Pendleton says she has lost muscle from her thighs since switching to ballroom dancing as a Strictly contestant (left) from weight training ahead of the 2012 Olympics (right) However, instead of feeling more feminine with her slimmer physique, . Miss Pendleton said she is ‘sad’ her powerful thighs are vanishing . before her eyes. Miss Pendleton weighed nine-and-a-half stone before training for the BBC1 show, which begins tomorrow. The gold-medal winner also finally admitted she is determined to win the . BBC1 show, after weeks of denying she is treating it as a serious . competition. Speaking after the Classical Brit Awards on Tuesday, the 32-year-old . said her body shape has changed dramatically since the London Games . this summer. She said: ‘I’ve lost weight. Since the Olympics, I haven’t done any . serious weight training. I’ve done a bit of work in the gym, but not any . weight training to the level that I’m used to. ‘And as a consequence I’ve already lost four and a half kilos of muscle. Mainly from my thighs. Wasting away: Victoria revealed she was finding her muscle mass shrinking at the Class Brit Awards earlier this week . Working hard: Despite attending lots of rehearsal sessions they are not as demanding as her cycling training . ‘When I sit down and look at my legs they don’t look like mine any more. I feel a bit sad because I’ve worked for so many years to get that. ‘And putting on a millimetre on my thigh girth, I used to be like: “Yes!, yes! Thank you. It’s working”. It is hard.’ At the peak of her cycling powers, Miss Pendleton weighed 62 kilograms (9.8stone). She signed up to Strictly a month before winning a cycling gold in the . women’s keirin and silver in the sprint, but was sworn to secrecy at the . time. But asked if she feels more feminine now she has toned down the athletic . physique that powered her to victory in the velodrome, she said: ‘No. That’s not me. ‘I have spent my whole life trying to get bigger, musclier thighs, and . now they are just disappearing in front of my very eyes, daily. It is . going to take some time to get used to it.’ Miss Pendleton added her athletic frame was badly suited to the demands of ballroom dancing. She said: ‘I have a lifetime of bad habits in dance terms. For example, . zero flexibility in the feet. Because as a cyclist, having stiff ankles . is an advantage. ‘And obviously on the dance floor it couldn’t be any worse, because you . are standing on your very tip-toes the whole time. I am getting a lot of . cramp in my feet.’ 'Competitive instinct': The Olympic gold medalist (pictured far right, front row, alongside her fellow contestants) has admitted that taking part in Strictly Come Dancing has brought out her competitive side . The star – who is engaged to her former cycling coach Scott Gardner - . insisted she felt under no pressure to perform on Saturday’s live show . with her professional partner Brendan Cole. She said: ‘Dancing is not my thing. I’ve never done it before. So if I . fall flat on my face, well, that’s life isn’t it.

Asked if Strictly would bring out her competitive side, she told the . magazine: ‘Oh God, yeah!

A dog owner has been banned from keeping animals after he chained his Jack Russell to a shed for up to three weeks, forcing it to drinks its own urine to survive. David Nicholls, 55, tied the 16-year-old dog, named Nato, in freezing conditions in February this year and when he was discovered by RSPCA officers, the dog was so weak he could barely stand and was covered in weeping sores. Vets were forced to remove Nato’s eye after an easily treatable infection had gone septic after being ignored. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Banned: David Nicholls has admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal after his Jack Russell, named Nato, was forced to live in a shed and drink its own urine . RSPCA officer Laura Bryant said: ‘Nato would have needed only basic treatment if Nicholls had taken him to the vet but leaving him for so long made his injuries horrific.’ Nicholls of Blurton, Staffordshire admitted causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and was given the 10-year ban on keeping pets as well as an 18-month community order at Stafford Magistrates Court. The court heard that Nicholls left Nato . in such a poor condition that the dog was forced to drink its own urine . and eat its faeces to survive. Appallingly, Nicholls was convicted last . May of mistreating another dog, a Staffordshire Terrier, after he . bought it in a pub and left it tied to a park bench. In sentencing him over Nato’s unnecessary suffering, Chairman Doug Hood said: ‘This matter of causing unnecessary cruelty to the dog is a serious case. Could barely stand: This dog's owner David Nicholls was banned from keeping animals for 10 years after the Jack Russell was chained to a shed for three weeks in freezing conditions and forced to drink his own urine to survive . ‘Anyone would have realised that the dog needed treatment. ‘This is also compounded by your previous discharge for a similar matter.’ He was also ordered to pay vet costs of £465. Nato has since been rehomed, Glen Cook, defending, said. He added: ‘It’s good to hear that the dog has been responding well to treatment. ‘I understand Nato is soon to be celebrating his 17th birthday.’ In 2011 there was a 23.5 per cent rise in the number of people convicted for animal cruelty and neglect according to RSPCA figures. There was also a 27 per cent rise in prison sentences imposed for animal cruelty by the courts.

A young woman told her parents that she would kill herself if they did not help her kidnap an 11-month-old baby girl, a court was told. Jodie Little, 23, was jailed for 16 months today after a court heard she abducted the child from a social services centre. Following a two-day manhunt which cost around £76,000 pounds, police tracked Little to a flat she had rented under a false name. She was wearing a wig and holding the kidnapped baby in her arms. Kidnapper: Jodie Little, 23, from Huddersfield was today jailed for taking a baby girl, aided by her parents . After failing to fool the police with her disguise on the morning of March 14 she picked up a knife and threatened to kill herself and the officers - forcing them out of the house in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, and into a two-hour negotiation. A court heard Little’s parents Keith, 54, and Jayne, 47, drove the getaway rental car from the social services centre before spinning a web of lies to the police in an attempt to throw them off their daughter's trail. Jodie Little, who has previous convictions for theft, had changed her name by deed poll to ‘Destiny Johnson’ two weeks before the kidnapping and enquired about passports and warm clothing, telling one vendor that she was 'going on a summer holiday with a child'. Prosecuting at Bradford Crown Court, Simon Waley said Jodie Little arrived at the social services centre in Huddersfield on the morning of March 12. After kidnapping the baby, she jumped into a Vauxhall Meriva driven by her parents before going on the run with the baby for two days. Mr Waley said: 'The police managed to track her down to the address. It was later revealed that she had paid three months rent in advance and signed the tenancy agreement as Sarah Johnson. 'Jodie answered the door holding the child. She was wearing a blonde wig. She gave her name as Sarah Johnson. Accomplices: Jayne Little (left) and Keith Little (right) at Bradford Crown Court. The pair's daughter told them she would kill herself if they did not help her kidnap the baby, sparking a police search . 'The officer - knowing that it was Jodie - attempted to calmly talk to her and take hold of the child. 'At that point Jodie grabbed a knife and accepts that she was waving it around in her own vicinity and towards the officers. 'She made threats and screamed ‘get out or I will kill you'. 'The . officers left the property and Jodie could clearly be seen through the . window holding the knife in one hand while cradling the baby in her . arms.' Prior to this, despite the fact that they had dropped her off at the house, her parents phoned the police to say that Jodie Little had left them a letter saying that she was going to kill herself and the child. Mr Waley added: 'Jayne said she had no idea where her daughter was and said that if she did she would tell the police. 'After being arrested Jayne told the police that Jodie had friends in London who she could possibly be staying with. Keith made no comment at interview.' Mitigating for Jodie Little, Jayne Beckett said the young woman had suffered a troubled life and had various personality disorder type traits as a result of it. She added: 'Jodie is adamant that her parents were brought into this matter by her. She told them that she would kill herself if they did not help her and they obviously took that threat very seriously given that Jodie’s older sister committed suicide in 2008.' The Law Courts in Bradford, where Little and her parents were today sentenced. Sentencing Jodie Little to 16 months imprisonment for kidnap and affray, Judge John Potter said: 'You put this child in real and immediate danger. 'Children have a right to be protected from harm and those that act in a way that could cause harm to children must expect an immediate custodial sentence.' Both Keith and Jayne Little were sentenced to nine months imprisonment suspended for two years for kidnap. Keith, who now lives in London and had travelled back to West Yorkshire for the kidnapping, was ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work and Jayne was given supervision from the probation service. After the case, Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley of West Yorkshire Police’s Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'This was a very sensitive enquiry in which the overriding focus of our investigation was to ensure the welfare and safe recovery of the victim.' 'Safeguarding vulnerable members of our communities is a priority and we are pleased that that this investigation has now been brought to a successful conclusion.'","Jodie Little kidnapped a baby from a social services centre and may have been planning to flee abroad .

Marissa Mabanag, 10, has offered the contents of her piggy bank because she 'just wants her doggie back,’ according to her father, Michael Mabanag. Her home in San Jose was burglarised on Monday; though the thieves made off with the family’s electronics and other valuables, Marissa is most concerned with getting her beloved puppy back. Scroll down for video . Safe return: Marissa Mabanag, 10, centre, has offered the contents of her piggy bank to get back her puppy, Meeko . Stolen: Meeko, a six-month-old shih-tzu-Yorkie mix, was stolen when their house was burglarised on Monday . But Marissa has help from high places. San Jose's police and firefighters' unions, as well as the office of San Jose City Council’s Ash Kalra, have pooled their funds for a $6,000 combined reward. The Mabanag’s home has been burglarised twice this year already. Mr Mabanag told the San Jose Mercury News that while the family had taken preventative measures following the first burglary, it clearly wasn’t enough. The father came home Monday to find their garage open and windows of the house smashed in. Several electronic items were missing, as well as the family’s bicycles. He said the first thing he did was to look for Meeko. But the little pup was nowhere to be found. ‘It was one of the worst days of my life,’ he told the paper, after he realised Meeko was gone. ‘How do you break that to your daughter?’ Big reward: Marissa is offering her piggy bank - plus an additional $6,000 donated by the police and firefighter unions, and a donation from San Jose City Council's Ash Kalra . Namesake: Marissa said she named the puppy after Meeko, the mischievous raccoon from the Disney film Pocahontas . Talking to a group of reporters, Marissa said that she named the dog after the mischievous raccoon from the Disney movie, Pocahontas. She added that he was a ‘dead ringer’ for Chewbacca from the Star Wars films. According to ABC affiliate ABC7 News, Mr Mabanag brought home the puppy over the summer after his two daughters made their school’s honour role. Marissa said that she wants to know that the dog is safe. ‘I just want to know if he is okay or not, if he’s hurt or not, that’s it,’ the 10-year-old student said. The San Jose police department’s burglary division has seen cuts in recent years. Members of city council blame the recent downshift in law enforcement officials in the influx of burglaries. Marissa offered a final, desperate plea to the burglars: ‘Can you try to turn him into me?’ she asked. ‘It would mean the world to me if you turn him in.’ View more videos at: http://nbcbayarea.com.","Family dog Meeko stolen on Monday from family's San Jose home .

Millions of voters will be focusing the presidential candidates and their 'zingers' tonight in Denver, but plenty of attention has already been paid by organizers behind the scenes who have spent much time- and money- setting an even stage for this election's first presidential debate. At 9pm ET, President Barack Obama and Republican rival Mitt Romney will begin their orchestrated dance of appearing relaxed and candid even though they have been practicing their answers for weeks and timing every response down to the second. The debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Setting the stage: Staff prepare the Magnuss Arena in the Ritchie Center at the University of Colorado which will host the first presidential debate on Wednesday night . The focus of the first three segments are dedicated to the Economy (creatively titled Economy I, II, and III) before they move on to health care in the fourth segment, 'the role of government' in the fifth, and concluding on the issue of 'governing'. Political analysts have speculated that the topic of the attacks on the American embassy in Libya, the Obama administration's handling of the situation, and Romney's criticism of their work could potentially be a hot-button topic at the debate, but the first debate is dedicated solely to domestic issues. The candidates may insert the issue into one of the more general segments (most likely the final portion on 'governing') it is not expected to be directly addressed. While Obama is used to dictating the flow of discussion in the Oval Office and Romney touts his executive savvy from his years in the board room, neither will be the one in charge tonight as the reins have been handed over to Jim Lehrer. Mr Lehrer is the former news anchor of PBS NewsHour and known more broadly for his frequent appearances at presidential debates. Nicknamed the 'Dean of Moderators', this will be his 12th time moderating a debate. That tally is particularly impressive considering tonight's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate, meaning that Mr Lehrer has been at the helm of one third of all such debates. Bulking up: Obama delivered pizzas to volunteers Tuesday night in Nevada (left) while Romney ordered a burrito bowl at Chipotle in Denver (right) Even though the title may be impressive, that doesn't mean that he ever wanted to earn it: after moderating one of the debates between Obama and his then-rival Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, Mr Lehrer wrote a book about his two-decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more. For a man known for his sterling reputation and reliability, he made the unusual move of reversing his decision after the Commission on Presidential Debates asked him to return to the chair to kick off the first of this year's three debates. 'I did say that and I meant that, with every bit of firmness I could muster,' Mr Lehrer told Politico referring to his vow not to moderate again. 'But I also have said that people who are invited to moderate these events-- you have to d it. It's almost like getting a draft notice.' Master moderator: Jim Lehrer (right) will be serving as the debate orchestrator, and this will be his 13th time hosting a presidential debate. His most recent moderating came in the 2008 debate between Obama (center) and John McCain (left) Mr Lehrer will begin each of the six segments by asking a question and both of the candidates will be given two minutes to answer. From there, the time will be spent having a conversation on the issue, with Mr Lehrer interjecting to steer the discussion or cut-off excessively-long answers. The 78-year-old is known for being fair but firm, to both the candidates and to the audience. Politico quotes his 2008 memoir on his moderating career, titled Tension City, as saying that while things may get heated on stage, the audience should stay cool and 'they are expected to remain absolutely silent during a debate.' 'They are invited guests, not participants. The moderator should remind the would-be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary,' he wrote. In addition to the thousands of people who will be on the University of Denver campus and be filling the Magness Arena, 60million people are expected to tune in at home. Posing the questions: Seen here with then-candidate Al Gore (left), Lehrer (right) will open each segment with a question, let the candidates answer, and then proceed to steer a conversation for the remaining 11 minutes . The preliminary headcount puts tonight's debate at a fairly standard level, as George Washington University reports that the size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million. One possible explanation for why analysts aren't predicting a higher headcount is because many voters are already rife with campaign fatigue: during the Republican primary, there were 20 televised debates between the ever-changing cast of candidates. Regardless, tonight is pegged as the most important night-to-date in the seemingly endless campaign, since this is the first time that the two candidates will go at it face to face, as opposed to in the 30-second safety net of their scripted attack ads. Adding to the competition of the night, Colorado is a battleground state for the two men, as Real Clear Politics reports that the President only holds a 3.1 per cent lead over Romney in the Centinnel State. That marks a sharp difference from 2008, when Obama carried the state with 9 per cent more of the vote than McCain. The University of Denver is predictably pleased about their selection because the windfall of campaign staffers, political reporters and analysts means big business for the school. The Denver Post suggests that while it cost the University more than $1.6million to host the event, school administrators feel they can expect $20-30million in profits. They will meet again two more times, with the second debate coming in Hempstead, New York on the 16th and their final showdown on the 22nd in Boca Raton, Florida. Traditionally considered a toothless fight, this year’s vice presidential debate is hotly-anticipated because of Romney’s selection of Congressman Paul Ryan. The 42-year-old will face Vice President Joe Biden on October 11 in Danville, Kentucky. Nicknamed the 'Dean of Moderators', this will be Jim Lehrer's 12th time moderating a debate and considering tonight's show will be the 36th televised presidential debate in U.S. history, meaning that Mr Lehrer has been at the helm of one third of all such debates. After moderating one of the debates between Obama and his then-rival Senator John McCain in the 2008 election, Mr Lehrer wrote a book about his two-decades in the moderating business and swore that he would not commit to any more. The 78-year-old is known for being fair but firm, to both the candidates and to the audience. In his book, Lehrer wrote that he feels the audience 'are invited guests, not participants. The moderator should remind the would-be cheerleaders and boobirds of the rules and enforce them when necessary.' The television audience is expected to rank in at around 60million people, which is on the high end of a typical debate headcount. The size of the television audience for the three 2008 debates ranged from 52.4million to 63.2million. All three of those debates were bested by the showdown between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin, whose performance at the vice presidential debate garnered 69.9million viewers. In spite of heated campaign rhetoric over the Obama administration's handling of the attacks on the American embassy in Libya, the topic may not be specifically addressed on Wednesday because the debate is focused on domestic issues. That said, political analysts expect for the issue to be raised at some point by either Romney or Obama. The debate will last 90 minutes and is being broken up into six 15 minute segments. The focus of the first three segments are dedicated to the Economy (creatively titled Economy I, II, and III) before they move on to health care in the fourth segment, 'the role of government' in the fifth, and concluding on the issue of 'governing'.

Syria's Prime Minister Riyad Hijab has been sacked amid rumours he had defected with his family to neighbouring nation Jordan.

Hijab's 'dismissal' also came as . government forces appeared to prepare a ground assault to clear battered . rebels from Aleppo, the country's biggest city. And it saw troops backed by fighter jets kept up an offensive against the last rebel bastion in the capital. Scroll down for video . Attack: A bomb ripped through the third floor of the Syrian state television and radio building in Damascus this morning - injuring at least three people . Blast: Maen Saleh, the general manager of the state-run TV and Radio Public Incorporation is seen inside his office, that was littered with glass . Inspection: Syrians look at the damage caused by the blast that ripped through the third floor of the state TV building . Rebels in districts of Aleppo seemed battered, overwhelmed and running low on ammunition after days of intense tank shelling and helicopter gunships strafing their positions with heavy machinegun fire. Emboldened by an audacious bomb attack in Damascus that killed four of Assad's top security officials last month, the rebels had tried to overrun the Damascus and Aleppo, the country's commercial hub. Reuters News said one of its Twitter accounts was hacked on Sunday and false tweets were posted, mainly related to the current armed struggle in Syria. A spokesman said: 'Earlier today @ReutersTech was hacked and changed to @ReutersME. 'The account has been suspended and is currently under investigation.' The incident follows the company's disclosure that the blogging platform of the Reuters News website was compromised on Friday. It came when a fake post purporting to carry an interview with a Syrian rebel leader was illegally uploaded on a Reuters' journalist's blog. In the latest incident a series of 22 false tweets were sent purporting to be from Reuters News. Some of the tweets also carried false reports about Syrian rebel losses suffered in battles with Syrian government forces. Thomson Reuters had no immediate information on who was behind the hacking. Twitter could not be immediately reached for comment. But the lightly armed rebels have been outgunned by the Syrian army's superior weaponry. They were largely driven out of Damascus and are struggling to hold on to territorial gains made in Aleppo, a city of 2.5million. Damascus has criticised Gulf Arab states and Turkey for calling for the rebels to be armed, and state TV has described the rebels as a 'Turkish-Gulf militia', saying dead Turkish and Afghan fighters had been found in Aleppo. Paralysis in the UN Security Council over how to stop the bloodshed forced peace envoy Kofi Annan to resign last week, his ceasefire plan a distant memory. The violence has already shown elements of a proxy war between Sunni and Shi'ite Islam which could spill beyond Syria's border. The rebels claimed responsibility for capturing 48 Iranians in Syria, forcing Tehran to call on Turkey and Qatar - major supporters of the rebels - to help secure their release. Today, Syrian army tanks shelled alleyways in Aleppo where rebels sought cover a helicopter gunship fired heavy machinegun fire. Snipers ran on rooftops targeting rebels, and one of them shot at a rebel car filled with bombs, setting the vehicle on fire. Women and children fled the city, some crammed in the back of pickup trucks, while others walked on foot, heading to relatively safer rural areas. The main focus of fighting in Aleppo has been the Salaheddine district, a gateway into the city. One shell hit a building next to the Reuters reporting team, pouring rubble on to the street and sending billows of smoke and dust into the sky. State television said Assad's forces were 'cleansing the terrorist filth' from the country, which has been sucked into an increasingly sectarian conflict that has killed about 18,000 people and could spill into neighbouring states. Chaos: Footage showed the latest blast to hit the Syrian capital destroyed walls, overturned desks, blew out cabinet doors and shattered glass on the third floor . Footage: Workers were shown tending to a wounded colleague as the station managed to remain on air . Boost: The attack on the heavily fortified building has been described as a 'symbolic blow' in the 17-month uprising against Assad's regime . The army appeared to be using a similar strategy in Aleppo to the one used in other cities where they subjected opposition districts to heavy bombardment for days, weakening the rebels before moving in on the ground, clearing district by district. Syria's two main cities had been relatively free of violence until last month when fighters poured into them, transforming the war. The government largely repelled the assault on Damascus but has had more difficulty recapturing Aleppo. Rebel commanders say they anticipate a major Syrian army offensive in Aleppo and one fighter said they had already had to pull back from some streets after army snipers advanced on Saturday under cover of the fierce aerial and tank bombardment. Smoke rises over the Salah al-Din neighbourhood in central Aleppo during clashes between Free Syrian Army fighters and Syrian Army soldiers yesterday . Taking aim: A Free Syrian Army fighter holds his rifle as he walks through an apartment destroyed by a tank shell during clashes with Syrian Army soldiers in the Salah al-Din neighbourhood in central Aleppo . 'The Syrian army is penetrating our lines,' said Mohammad Salifi, a 35-year-old former government employee. 'So we were forced to strategically retreat until the shelling ends,' he said, adding the rebels were trying to push the army back again. Late last night rebels clashed with the army in Aleppo's south-eastern Nayrab district, a fighter who called himself Abu Jumaa said. The army responded by shelling eastern districts. There were also clashes on the southern ring road, which could be a sign the army was preparing to surround the city. Once a busy shopping and restaurant district where residents would spend evenings with their families, Salaheddine is now white with dust, broken concrete and rubble. Tank shell holes gape wide on the top of buildings near the front line, and homes of families and couples have been turned into look-outs and sniper locations for rebel fighters. Large mounds of concrete are being used as barriers to close off streets, as lamp posts lie horizontally across the road after being downed by shelling.

David Walliams has  revealed he was driven into such a dark depression he attempted to kill himself several times, once on New Year's Day after Little Britain became a TV hit. His frank admissions, made in his new autobiography, come after he spoke openly about his battle with depression and admitted this week he entered rehab. The Little Britain star, 41, has printed his diaries in the new book, and they reveal the comedian first tried to kill himself aged 12, after being bullied at Sea Scout camp. Dark thoughts: Comedian David Walliams reveals he tried to hang himself twice in his new autobiography Camp David . Walliams is searingly honest in his . book, admitting he has tried to hang himself twice, slit his wrists and . even thought about throwing himself infront of a train. Writing in his forthcoming book Camp David, he told how he ran off into the woods with a makeshift noose, but found he was 'too tall' to go through with it. The second time he tried to hang himself was as recently as nine years ago, soon after a split from an ex-girlfriend. Reading from a 2003 diary entry, David wrote: 'Just tried to hang myself. But I knew . I didn’t really want to die, I just didn’t want to live. I took my . weight with my feet and sat down.

A Chihuahua was left fighting for its life after being brutally savaged by a fox for the second time in four years. The seven-year-old dog was left for dead after being attacked in its garden when it was found by his owner Vicky Neophytou. The Chihuahua, who was close to death when found, is now nursing his injuries and recovering from severe blood loss after being set upon for the second time on Sunday. Petrified: Mrs Neophytou found Pepe covered in blood in her garden after brutal attack . Typically weighing less than three kilograms, the Chihuahua was left with only one eye when he was first attacked by a fox in 2008. Mrs Neophytou, of Sutton, Surrey, was first to the scene after the attack. She said: 'It was 11.30am and I was cutting my son’s hair in the kitchen. I could hear squeaking, I thought the cat had a bird in the garden. 'I went out and Pepe was just lying there on the patio with the fox over him and there was blood everywhere.' Mrs Neophytou was quick to react and tried to scare off the fox before attending to the helpless dog. 'I shooed the fox away, but he didn’t go far.

I was so glad the vet was open. 'I didn’t think Pepe was going to survive in the car.' Protected: Terry Woods from Foxagon 'Foxes are a natural fauna, we can't clinically destroy something just because we don't like it.' During the ordeal, Pepe suffered three broken ribs and several puncture wounds. He remains at the vet in North Cheam and is not expected home for another three days. Still aware of the potential danger of the fox, Mrs Neophytou has been advised to keep her dog flap closed, but has another dog and a cat at home. She said: “I don’t know what to do. If I keep the dog flap closed the dogs will only be able to go out when I open the door but that means the cat can’t come and go. Savaged: Pepe the Chihuahua is recovering from his second fox attack in four years . 'I’ve contacted Foxagon (fox deterrence service) to see if they can take the fox away but they said it is illegal as it is the foxes’ territory.' Terry Woods from Foxagon said he had advised Mrs Neophytou on how to fox proof her garden. He said: 'Foxes are a natural fauna, we can’t clinically destroy something just because we don’t like it.' This is just the latest in a series of fox attacks on both animals and humans over the past couple of years. In 2010, Princess, a two-year-old Chihuahua, was savaged to death when she was snapped up by the jaws of a large fox which crept into its owner Toby Khanna's property in broad daylight. The attack was witnessed by his devastated young children as the 38-year-old chased after the intruder. In one of the most horrific fox attacks, nine-month-old sisters Isabella and Lola Koupparis were savaged by a fox as they lay innocently in their cots. The attack left the young girls with 'life-changing' injuries. In this case, a fox had gained entry to the girls' parents' £800,000 house in East London, on the night of Saturday, June 5. The girls' parents Nick and Pauline, both 41, heard their daughters' cries over a baby monitor and dashed upstairs to find the girls with wounds that looked like they had been caused by a 'cheese grater'.

There is speculation over whether border patrol agent Nicolas Ivie, 30, who was shot dead during the shootout was a victim of friendly fire . Questions have been raised over whether a border control agent shot dead was a victim of friendly fire. Nicholas Ivie, 30, was killed and another agent wounded on Tuesday in Arizona near the U.S.-Mexico line when they responded to a movement sensor which had alerted them to movement along a section of the border known as ‘cocaine alley’. Now there is speculation that authorities are investigating the possibility that a friendly fire accidental shooting could be what killed Mr Ivie and wounded the other agent. A third female agent was unharmed in the shooting. FBI Phoenix would not confirm the possible details according to ABC News, saying in a statement: ‘Due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation, the FBI is unable to provide any further details at this time.’ Forensic reports are being prepared on ballistics and interviews being conducted to shed light on the possibility. Mexican officials said that they had detained two men who may be connected with the shooting but FBI officials are yet to confirm those arrests but said on Thursday that they were ‘aware of the reporting’. The Tuscon Sentinel cites a reporter from Fronteras Desk who claimed that two suspects have been detained in Mexico though their identities have not been released. Agents at the checkpoint declined to comment and barred reporters from going further. Two helicopters from federal immigration agencies could be seen from a distance circling the area. And a fugitive-chase team could be seen staging on a roadside. Shot at: The agents were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border as they responded to an alarm that was triggered on one of the sensors installed to alert possible breaches . Cochise County Deputy Chief Rod Rothrock told ABC News affiliate KNXV on Tuesday: ‘Due to the time of day and the location, we suspect some kind of narcotics trafficking, but at this point that is speculative. ‘Cochise County has been a smuggling corridor for many, many years and that seems to be unabated in modern times. ‘The danger zone can extend pretty far north of the border.’ The trio were responding to a tripped movement sensor along the border when there were fired upon in a rugged hilly area about five miles north of the border at 1.50am on Tuesday. Tight lipped: As agents search for clues, the FBI would not confirm any details 'due to the sensitive and on-going nature of this investigation' 'Smuggling country': Agents from multiple government agencies worked together on the search in the rugged countryside known as a 'smuggling corridor for many, many years' The U.S. government has put thousands of sensors along the border that, when triggered, alert dispatchers that they should send agents to a particular location. Mr Ivie is survived by his wife and two children. His family spoke at a press conference on Thursday, describing him as a ‘friend to everybody’ and a ‘favourite uncle’ according to The Tuscon Sentinel. His brother Rick Ivie said: ‘There was not a bad bone in his body.’ 'Friend to everybody': Mr Ivie's family held a press conference, describing the man survived by his wife and two children. His brother Rick Ivie said: 'There was not a bad bone in his body' Reeling: This is the first fatal shooting of a border patrol agent since 2010, as the only other deaths have due to car accidents . The other agent, who was shot in the ankle and the buttocks, was airlifted to hospital but has since been released. President Barack Obama contacted Mr Ivie’s family to express his condolences according to a White House statement. The statement read: ‘The President told the family they are in his thoughts and prayers and made clear that his administration was doing everything it could to locate those responsible for this tragic event.’ The last Border Patrol agent fatally shot on duty was Brian Terry, who died in a shootout with bandits near the border in December 2010. The Border Patrol station in Naco, where the two agents shot Tuesday were stationed, was recently named after Terry. At work: Mr Ivie was shot near the Brian A. Terry Border Patrol Station where he worked in Arizona near the U.S.-Mexican border . Fatal shooting: The station was only recently named after Brian Terry who died during a shootout with bandits in 2010 . Terry's shooting was later linked to the government's Fast and Furious gun-smuggling operation, which allowed people suspected of illegally buying guns for others to walk away from gun shops with weapons, rather than be arrested. Authorities intended to track the guns into Mexico. Two rifles found at the scene of Terry's shooting were bought by a member of the gun-smuggling ring being investigated. Critics of the operation say any shooting along the border now will raise the question that those illegal weapons are still being used in border violence.","There is speculation that authorities are investigating the possibility of the fatal shooting of a border patrol agent was accidental .

The head of West Yorkshire Police will stand down after being accused of smearing fans in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy. Sir Norman Bettison said the move will allow independent officials to fully investigate the devastating allegations about his integrity. The chief constable said the recent uproar made him 'reflect' on 'what is best for the future of policing' in his force area. Two weeks ago he was accused of being involved in a South Yorkshire Police 'black propaganda' campaign set up to smear fans in the days after Hillsborough. The top officer was also forced to issue a humiliating apology after saying Liverpool fans were partly to blame for what happened. He faced calls to resign from the families of victims for criticising fans' behaviour despite an independent panel clearing them of wrongdoing. Sir Norman, 56, said he will retire from his £225,000 post on March 31 next year, despite being recently granted an extension to his contract. It remains to be seen whether he will receive any extra pay off over his gold-plated public sector pension of up to £150,000 a year. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating Sir Norman's conduct in the aftermath of Hillsborough. The damning report on the Hillsborough disaster laid bare a shocking cover-up which attempted to shift the blame on to its 96 victims. The inquiry found that 164 police statements were altered, 116 of them to remove or alter 'unfavourable' comments about the policing of the match and the unfolding disaster. The . watchdog said it is conducting a 'detailed assessment' of a referral . from West Yorkshire Police Authority. It is also examining his comments . last month. Supporters of Sir Norman said he has been the victim of a 'witch-hunt' in the wake of the release of the explosive Hillsborough report. In a statement released last night, he said: 'Recent weeks have caused me to reflect on what is best for the future of policing in West Yorkshire and I have now decided to set a firm date for my retirement of March 31, 2013. Tragic: Liverpool fans tried to get away from the crush in the stadium . Trevor Hicks, who lost his daughters Vicki, 15, and Sarah, 19, in the tragedy wants the chief constable stripped of his knighthood . 'Furthermore, I hope it will enable . the Independent Police Complaints Commission to fully investigate . allegations that have been raised about my integrity. 'They need to be fairly and fully investigated and I welcome this independent and formal scrutiny.' Margaret Aspinall, chairwoman of the . Hillsborough Families Support Group, said: 'Obviously I’m very, very . pleased. I’m absolutely delighted that he’s going. 'But then he’ll be going on his full . pension, and I’d like to know the full reasons why he’s choosing to . retire as soon as this.' Mrs Aspinall, whose 18-year-old son . James died in the tragedy, said: 'Why didn’t he stay, then, until the . IPCC came out with their investigation? 'But he’s decided to leave. I’m not arguing against it, because I’m thrilled that he is going.' Sir Norman, who began his policing career in South Yorkshire, has denied any wrongdoing in relation to the disaster. Anne Williams, whose 15-year-old son . Kevin died on the Leppings Lane terrace, said the findings of the recent . report left Sir Norman with no choice but to retire. She said: 'I think the whole lot of . them who have been involved for these 23 years should all go for the . hurt that they have caused us for 23 years. 'I don’t think he would have retired if it wasn’t for the Hillsborough report.' Trevor Hicks, who lost his two . daughters, 19-year-old Sarah and 15-year-old Victoria, told ITV News: . 'I’m glad he’s realised his position . is untenable, however I’m determined that he does not escape his just . desserts and I will make sure he’s stripped of his knighthood. 'He should leave with nothing, like he tried to leave the families.' Questions about Sir Norman’s role in . the investigation of the tragedy have dogged him as he has risen through . the higher ranks of the police - most notably when there were protests . from the families of those who died when he became Chief Constable of . Merseyside in 1998. Undeterred . by this opposition, Sir Norman stayed on in Liverpool for six years and . was even named an honorary fellow of the city’s John Moores University. Liverpool fans held up a Hillsborough banner before the match between Liverpool and Manchester United after the explosive report . Support: Liverpool fans hold up a mosiac spelling out 'justice' and 'the truth' after report findings . After retiring from the police in 2004 to become the chief executive of Centrex, a firm which offered training to police forces, he was knighted for services to policing in 2006. Returning to an active role in the police and Yorkshire, Sir Norman became West Yorkshire Police’s chief constable in January 2007 and was designated the officer responsible for overseeing policing of domestic extremism. Last month he was singled out as the . most senior serving policeman allegedly involved in a 'black propaganda' campaign that followed the 1989 stadium disaster. He was part of a South Yorkshire . Police unit which tried to ensure the force was exonerated over the . tragedy and fans were put in the spotlight. The report revealed that as a chief . inspector he produced a video for MPs which highlighted how a pitch . invasion was 'thought' to have happened. It added that policing a match was 'reliant on some co-operation' from fans. Liverpool MP Maria Eagle said the unit he was part of was nothing more than a 'black propaganda' campaign. But Sir Norman insisted he had 'nothing to hide' as a clamour for him to resign intensified but sparked fresh fury by placing some blame on fans. He stressed he had played no role in changing officers' accounts of what happened, saying: 'I never altered a statement nor asked for one to be altered.' He pointed out that he had been off-duty and attended the fateful FA Cup semi-final match as a fan, immediately joining the police effort. In 1998, several police authority members quit when Sir Norman was made chief of Merseyside over his role in preparing the police response to Hillsborough. In April 2010, Sir Norman raised eyebrows by saying that he was not worth his bumper pay and pension package. He said huge pay awards were 'untenable' and many employed by the state were following a vocation and would happily do the job for less pay.","Sir Norman Bettison will retire from £225,000 post on March 21, 2013 .

Twelve thousand striking miners in South Africa have been sacked by the world's largest producer of platinum in an ongoing dispute over wages. More than 28,000 workers took part in three weeks of wildcat strikes in Rustenburg, during which police shot dead 34 protesters. Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) said the illegal industrial action had cost them 700million rand - or £51million - in revenue with a reduced output of 39,000 ounces. A worker addresses his colleagues before taking part in a march outside the Anglo American mine in South Africa's north west province last month . Both miners and officials have been killed during the wave of wildcat strikes to hit the mining industry in South Africa, with 34 platinum miners being shot dead by police during one incident in August. Amplats said their miners were dismissed because they failed to attend disciplinary hearings, the BBC reported. The company also said four of its mining operations in Rustenburg were unable to operate fully because of attendance levels of less than 20 per cent. The company said workers would have three days to appeal the outcome of their disciplinary hearings, which were due to take place today, Friday. Farewell: . Mourners sing and raise their fists in salute as they surround the . coffin of Mpuzeni Ngxande, one of the 34 striking miners killed by . police . Aftermath: South African protesters lie motionless on the ground as heavily armed police officers check them at the Lonmin Platinum Mine near Rustenburg, South Africa . According to the BBC, a spokesman for Amplats said: 'Approximately 12,000 striking . employees chose not to make representations, nor attend the hearings, . and have therefore been dismissed in their absence.' A commission of inquiry into the deaths at the Marikana platinum mine - where 34 were shot dead - began this week. The Marikana strikers have since been given pay rises far higher than the rate of inflation and the workers have returned to the mine. South African prosecutors sparked outrage last month after charging 270 miners with the murders of 34 of their striking colleagues who were shot dead by police. Footage shot at the scene clearly shows officers firing live ammunition from automatic weapons and handguns . Taking cover: Protesting miners can be seen cowering within the gun sights of an police officer . The mass killing of the strikers at the Marikana mine in August was one of the most shocking incidents since the end of white rule in 1994. The arrested miners were charged under a law dating from the apartheid era that alleges they had a 'common purpose' in the murder of their co-workers. The African National Congress, whose members used to be gunned down by apartheid police at protest rallies and targeted with draconian laws, has been severely criticised for using similar tactics now that it is in power. President Jacob Zuma has seen his support erode, with his enemies saying he is more interested in getting close to industry and powerful labour groups than miners working deep underground. Surrounded: Police form an armed cordon around strikers. It is unclear whether these miners are injured or lying down for officers to conduct searches . At the centre of violence: The Lonmin PLC mine, near Rustenburg, 100km north-west of Johannesburg, where around 3,000 miners walked out on August 10 over wages. Since then there have been several fatal incidents . Prosecutors charged the 270 miners, already under arrest on suspicion . of murder in a earlier shooting at the mine, with the August 16 murder . of 34 co-workers at Marikana, the world's third biggest . platinum producer, Lonmin. The . 34 were shot in a hail of police bullets in what has been dubbed the . 'Marikana Massacre' with videos of the killings broadcast worldwide. Police will not be subject to punishment until the conclusion of a . government probe early next year. Common . purpose was often used by the apartheid government against black citizens to . sentence numerous people for crimes committed by only a few. Mosiuoa . Lekota, a former ANC cabinet minister and now leader of the COPE . opposition party, was imprisoned during apartheid in a case where the . common purpose doctrine was invoked. He said the decision to charge the miners was a setback for democracy.

Free birth control dramatically lowers rates of abortions and teen births, a large study has revealed. Only 6.3 teenagers in every 1,000 given their choice of contraception get pregnant, compared with 34 per 1,000 nationwide, U.S. researchers found. If birth control options were free, one abortion in 79 to 137 could be prevented, said scientists in St Louis, Missouri. New outlook: The rate of teen pregnancies was found to drop dramatically if women were given access to free contraception (picture posed by model) More than 9,000 women in the city were given their choice of contraceptive at no charge. When cost was not an issue, women flocked to the most effective . contraceptives - the implanted options, which typically cost hundreds of . dollars. The women, many of them poor or uninsured, experienced far fewer unintended pregnancies, reported Dr Jeffrey Peipert of Washington University in St Louis. There were much lower rates of abortion, too, with 4.4 to 7.5 abortions per 1,000 women in the study, compared with 13.4 to 17 abortions per 1,000 women in the St Louis region and 20 per 1,000 women nationally. The findings of the study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology come as millions of U.S. women are . beginning to get access to contraception without copayment under President . Barack Obama's health care law. Sound investment: Women given their choice on contraception gravitate towards the most effective methods, researchers found . Women's health specialists said the study, which ran from 2008 to 2010,  foreshadows that policy's potential impact. Alina Salganicoff, director of women's health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said: 'As a society, we want to reduce unintended pregnancies and abortion rates. 'This study has demonstrated that having access to no-cost contraception helps us get to that goal.' Dr. James T. Breeden, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, described the results as an 'amazing improvement'. 'I would think if you were against abortions, you would be 100 per cent for contraception access,' he added. The law requires that contraceptives be available for free for women enrolled in most workplace insurance plans from January 1. Controversial issue: Millions of women are beginning to get access to free contraception under President Barack Obama's new healthcare plans . The policy is among the law's most contentious provisions because it exempts churches that oppose contraception but requires religious-affiliated organisations, such as colleges or hospitals, to provide the coverage for their workers. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and many conservative groups say that violates religious freedom, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney has voiced similar criticism. This week, a federal judge in St Louis dismissed a lawsuit challenging the contraception mandate. Nearly three dozen similar suits have been filed around the country. Jeanne Monahan of the conservative Family Research Council suggested contraceptive use can encourage riskier sexual behaviour. 'Obama administration's contraception mandate may ultimately cause more unplanned pregnancies since it mandates that all health plans cover contraceptives, including those that the study's authors claim are less effective,' she said. Nearly half of the nation's six million-plus pregnancies each year are unintended. An estimated 43 per cent of them end in abortion, with low-income women far more likely to have an unplanned pregnancy than their wealthier counterparts. 'We shouldn't have, in my view, a tiered system where the women with money can get family planning and the women without cannot,' said Dr Peipert, noting that 39 per cent of the women in his study had trouble paying basic expenses. About half of unplanned pregnancies occur in women who use no contraception. As for the other half, condoms can fail and so can birth control pills or other shorter-acting methods if the woman forgets to use them or can't afford a refill. Implanon is an implant inserted under the skin of the arm that prevents pregnancy for three years. An IUD, a tiny T-shaped device inserted into the uterus, can last for five to 10 years, depending on the brand, although it can be removed. Only about five per cent of U.S. women use long-acting contraceptives, far fewer than in other developed countries. Dr Peipert believes this is because insurance has not always covered the higher upfront cost to insert them and because doctors do not always mention these methods. Three-quarters of his study participants chose an IUD or Implanon, and a year later 85 per cent were sticking that choice - compared to about half who had initially chosen the pill, patch or other shorter-acting method.","Millions of women are .

Mrs Obama has long been a vocal supporter of Jason Wu, and now, three years after putting his name on the mainstream fashion map, famously appearing his design at the Inaugural Ball in 2009, the First Lady is the first person to wear a piece from his new collection. First Lady first: Michelle Obama's dusty green shift is from Jason Wu's yet-to-be released contemporary label, Miss Wu, which doesn't hit stores until January 2013 . Instrumental in catapulting the then up-and-coming designer into the hungry eyes of American mass retail, Mrs Obama has worn his designs on many occasions, including on the cover of Vogue. While the First Lady usually wears pieces on the back-end of a collection's shelf life, she has firmly established herself as someone who supports young talent, and according to The Daily Beast, the Miss Wu dress was sent to her by the designer. The new contemporary collection, which is 'a little bit more playful and a little younger,' will retail for less than the Jason Wu line, and launches in partnership with Nordstrom in January. The 29-year-old designer told WWD: 'Instead of just doing ""Jason Wu-for-less,"" the idea is to explore the other side of myself. 'I always see Jason Wu [the . collection] as my aesthetic, my design sensibility. Miss Wu is my . personality. It was really fun to explore that facet of who I am - . slightly more downtown, and with a more relaxed attitude.' The collection retails from 'an approachable' $195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to . $795 for a black leather jacket. Whereas a . garment from the Jason Wu collection averages about $1,700.

Jeffrey Kalinsky, Nordstrom’s executive vice president of designer merchandising, explained: 'There’s a large audience who wants to wear his clothes. 'This collaboration has an appeal not just to a younger set of women, but to a broader set of women and at prices that are approachable. 'What’s great is that while feeling different from the Jason Wu signature collection, it still clearly has Jason’s design DNA.' Mr Wu added: 'One thing that is rare in the contemporary market is more feminine, girlier clothes. It tends to be more hard-edged, or too young. I felt this is something that brings a little bit of softness.' The first collection of Miss Wu, inspired by the Sixties, will be available at Nordstrom, as well as at nordstrom.com for one year, starting January 7th.","Miss Wu launches on January 7th at Nordstrom, with prices starting at $195 ."
"By . Michael Seamark . UPDATED: . 17:04 EST, 6 January 2012 . Eddie Gilfoyle speaking at press conference in 1992, the year his wife died . Police retained a secret diary that could have cleared a man jailed for life for killing his wife, it was revealed yesterday. Eddie Gilfoyle protested his innocence for nearly two decades after being convicted in 1993 of murdering his pregnant wife, Paula, and making it look like suicide. But it has emerged that a padlocked box existed containing two volumes of a diary covering ten years. The journal reveals her troubled past and how she had previously tried to take her life. These facts were not disclosed to Mr Gilfoyle's lawyers or told to the jury. In fact, the diary contradicts the image presented to the murder trial of Mrs Gilfoyle as a happy woman with everything to live for. Police refused to say where the box had been over the years – because the case is being reviewed by the commission that investigates miscarriages of justice. Mr Gilfoyle, 59, who was released in December 2010 after two unsuccessful appeals, said yesterday: 'I am completely devastated that the police had these diaries and failed to hand them over to my defence. 'I am disgusted, appalled, words just fail me. They should have been disclosed prior to my two appeals but they were kept hidden. 'I have told the truth all the way through. The police have lied all the way through.' His solicitor Matt Foot, said: 'Mr Gilfoyle has protested his innocence for 19 years. Meanwhile the police have held on to a locked box containing material that directly contradicts their case. How has this happened?' Eddie Gilfoyle at his wedding reception with wife Paula. He has always maintained that she killed herself . Mrs Gilfoyle, 32, who was . eight-and-a-half months pregnant, was found hanged in the garage of the . couple's home in Upton, Wirral, in 1992. A suicide note was discovered in her . handwriting but prosecutors said Gilfoyle dictated it to her, telling . her he needed it for a course in his job as an auxiliary nurse. Relatives and friends told the jury . she was a happy, bubbly woman but the diaries and other personal papers . which she kept in the marital home reveal she took an overdose of pills . when she was 15. They also show that as a teenager she . was engaged to a boy who was convicted of killing a girl. She bought . him a wedding ring while he was in prison. It was when that boyfriend, Mark . Roberts, threatened to leave her that she took an overdose, writing in . her diary: 'Mark went mad but I done it to him.' The new evidence also revealed that . two of Mrs Gilfoyle's former boyfriends threatened suicide and among her . possessions was a note from one – using similar words to the note found . where she died. Mr Gilfoyle's lawyers have asked the . Criminal Cases Review Commission to refer his case back to the Court of . Appeal to be overturned. Merseyside police confirmed they handed papers to Mr Foot last year but refused to comment further. The Gilfoyles' house, in Upton, Wirral where his Paula's body was found hanging in the garage . At trial, Gilfoyle suggested his wife’s teenage relationship with Mark Roberts could have affected her mentally. Her friends maintain that after Roberts was jailed for killing a girl she didn’t want anything to do with him. Her diary tells a different story: . May 26, 1974: ‘Went to golden goose. Went for a drink. Had our photos taken there.’ One time he threatened to leave her and she took an overdose: ‘Took some tablets 10 Mark went mad but I done it to him.’ September 30, 1976: ‘Mark rang me up. He has broken it off. Very upset just can’t believe he went with another girl.’ October 2, 1976: ‘Had to give a statement on Mark he has been charged with murder. Mum came to pick me up at his house nervous wreck. November 19: ‘Went to court went in the cell with Mark. He gave me a love bite. He is sick but I love him.’ December 3: ‘Went to see Mark in court, Had hour and half with me lovely time. We kissed talked we are both in love. I want him and I need him.’ February 7, 1977: ‘Went to Crown court. Mark got sentenced for life, but I still love him. I shall try and keep my promise . On March 12 she bought him a silver wedding ring. Two months later she collected his clothes he wore when he handed himself in: ‘Went to pick Mark clothes up at police station and got his wallet too, his belt and jeans had blood on.’ The box containing the fresh evidence – Paula Gilfoyle’s diary and other personal possession – was handed to Gilfoyle’s defence team in August 2010 by Merseyside Police. On the box was an exhibit label from Lancashire constabulary, although it was the Merseyside force that investigated the murder. Lancashire had been invited by the Police Complaints Authority in 1994 to review the investigation and took some exhibits. Though it is unclear whether the box was discovered by Lancashire detectives during a search of Mrs Gilfoyle’s home during their 1994 inquiry or had ion fact been taken in the original investigation, but for whatever reason, subsequently forgotten about. It was undisclosed throughout both Gilfoyle’s appeals in 1995 and 2000. New developments after June 2010, when the new Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC had to apologise to MPs after Parliament was given wrong information about the case . The CPS had drafted a deficient answer for the solicitor general Vera Baird about the disclosure of evidence in Gilfoyle’s trial. In a statement, the CPS added: ‘Should there be any further queries or requests for clarification, the CPS will try to deal with them as quickly and comprehensively as possible.’ Two months later Gilfoyle’s solicitor Matt Foot was taken to Merseyside, when the box was produced by . No explanation was given by Lancashire Police or the Independent Police Complaints Commission – which succeeded the PCA - as to why the box was only now being produced. Released: Eddie Gilfoyle (centre) is flanked by his sister Susan Caddick and Lord Hunt in the House of Lords in 2010 . Gilfoyle was released from prison in . 2010 after spending 18 years behind bars. At the time his solicitor, . Matt Foot, said there had been no forensic evidence for murder. 'The reason for that is that it was a . suicide,' he said. 'What the prosecution did was distort the evidence . to give the appearance that there was forensic evidence in this case.' Mr Foot claimed there were two . 'fallacies' in the murder case - that Mrs Gilfoyle would not have been . able to keep her balance as she walked up the ladder to where she was . hanged, and that she would not have been able to get the rope over the . beam. 'These were complete and utter myths that were created by the prosecution and went into the trial,' he said. It was an 'extraordinary coincidence' that today's press conference came as the Law Commission had . recommended changing the rules on expert evidence in jury trials. 'What they are saying is that there shouldn't be unjustifiable assumptions going into trials from experts,' Mr Foot said. 'And that's exactly what happened in . this case, and if the new rules that are being suggested were in force . in 1992 this case would never have gone to trial.' The only marks found on Mrs Gilfoyle's body were two small scratched on her neck, above where the rope had been. Experts say that these are occur in . around 5 per cent of hanging suicides and are believed to be a result of . attempts to release the rope.","Friends said in court that Paula Gilfoyle was carefree and would never have killed herself .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 18:06 EST, 8 February 2012 . Federal election officials say John Edwards owes taxpayers more than $2.1million in public matching funds improperly received after he dropped his 2008 run for the White House, yet disclosure reports show his failed campaign is still spending freely. Edwards' hopes for the Democratic presidential nomination imploded in a sex scandal four years ago that left him facing criminal charges. But reports filed last week show his 2008 primary campaign spent $836,712 in 2011 on airfare, hotel rooms, cell phones and other expenses. Money trouble: Reports filed last week show John Edwards' 2008 primary campaign spent $836,712 in 2011 on various expenses - years after his presidential bid imploded . The campaign reported $2.1million in cash remaining as of December 31, a figure close to what the Federal Election Commission says the former North Carolina senator still owes the U.S. Treasury. Patricia A. Fiori, one of four lawyers working for Edwards in the FEC case, said this week she could not comment, referring questions to the campaign. Attempts by The Associated Press to find anyone who could comment for the campaign were unsuccessful. A phone number Ms Fiori provided to contact the campaign rang busy for days, even at midnight. Judith Ingram, the FEC's spokeswoman, said Wednesday she could not comment on whether the agency has a pending enforcement action against Edwards. Indicted: The former senator was charged on June 3 for using nearly $1million in illegal campaign funds to help cover up an extramarital affair during his White House run . In a separate criminal case filed by the U.S. Justice Department last year, Edwards, who made millions as a trial lawyer, is accused of concealing nearly $1 million provided by two wealthy donors to hide his pregnant mistress as he ran for president. Politicians are barred by law from using campaign funds for personal expenses. The required year-end report filed by Edwards on January 31 provides little insight into what political purpose some of the campaign's recent expenses might serve. Melanie Sloan, executive director of the campaign-finance watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said it's not unusual for presidential campaigns to remain open years after the election is over, especially if there is an unresolved audit or unpaid debts. 'All they are allowed to do are activities to wind down the campaign,' Sloan said. 'If these are legitimate expenses, then the Edwards campaign should be willing to explain them.' Edwards' campaign reports show more than $15,000 spent in 2011 on airfare, though the destinations or purpose of the travel were not listed. In January, August and December, the campaign spent $2,268 for tickets on Alaska Airlines, a transcontinental carrier that does not offer flights between East Coast cities such as Raleigh or Washington. Most of the $12,811 in credit card charges for lodging were made to websites such as Hotels.com and Kayak.com, providing no information about where the rooms were booked, when or for what purpose. More than $266,000 was paid for salary, payroll and health insurance premiums, along with $1,116 for cell phones. Though the campaign appears to have no office, it paid $428 to a bottled water delivery company. The largest expense, $315,000, was paid to Utrecht & Phillips, the Washington law firm fighting last year's unanimous FEC ruling that Edwards must return its remaining funds to taxpayers. 'Not guilty': Edwards, pictured here with his daughter Cate (right) after his indictment last year, denies any wrongdoing . The Chapel Hill street address listed for the number Fiori provided belongs to the former office of Edwards' defunct anti-poverty foundation, The Center for Promise and Opportunity. A receptionist for the management company that owns the building said Edwards had not been a tenant for more than three years. Julius L. Chambers, listed as campaign treasurer on last week's 2011 finance report, is a Charlotte lawyer who retired as chancellor of N.C. Central University. He did not return calls to his office. Chambers' assistant said he was no longer associated with the Edwards campaign. The other woman: Edwards is accused of using campaign funds to cover up his affair with Rielle Hunter, pictured here with their lovechild . Lora M. Haggard, who co-founded the Georgia-based firm H+P Political Compliance, is listed as receiving an after-tax salary of nearly $70,000 from the campaign in 2011, with paychecks issued every two weeks. Her business partner, Jay Petterson, was paid more than $51,000. Ms Haggard declined to speak. 'Yes, I'm handling the reports, but as long as the audit process is ongoing I can't comment,' Haggard said. She had no contact information for Edwards or his campaign, she said. Calls to the home of Susan W. Jackson, a Chapel Hill woman listed as getting more than $34,000 in biweekly payments, were not returned. Edward L. Niles, a former Edwards campaign staffer who got nearly $31,000 in consulting fees, said the payments had nothing to do with his current job as targeting director at The Atlas Project, a political consulting firm in Washington. He declined to say what work, if any, he performed for Edwards in 2011. 'You'll have to talk to the campaign about that,' Niles said. When asked to provide the name of anyone at the campaign a reporter could try to reach, Niles said he didn't know of anyone. A male voice who answered the intercom at the locked gate at Edwards' sprawling Chapel Hill estate hung up when a reporter asked to speak to Edwards or anyone affiliated with his presidential campaign. Edwards received more than $12.9million in federal matching funds, the money generated from the $3 box that taxpayers can check on their tax returns. Most of the public money came after he dropped out of the race January 30, 2008. For weeks the married candidate had been dogged by tabloid reports of an affair with campaign staffer Rielle Hunter. After withdrawing from the race and months of public denials, Edwards eventually admitted he had fathered Hunter's baby. In July 2011, Edwards was indicted on six criminal counts related to campaign finance violations over the money used to hide Hunter during the campaign. He has pleaded not guilty. A trial set to begin January 30 was delayed when Edwards' lawyer revealed in court filings that Edwards has a serious heart condition that requires treatment. In the separate civil action, FEC auditors concluded earlier this year that Edwards' campaign understated the amount of money it had on hand in its accounts on two separate occasions, failed to itemize more than $4.3million in loan repayments and owed the government nearly $142,000 in checks the campaign issued that were never cashed. The federal audit also determined Edwards got more than $2.1million in public matching funds after his campaign was no longer eligible to receive such payments. The bipartisan Federal Election Commission voted 6-0 on July 21 to order the Edwards campaign to return the money. Records show the campaign repaid the $142,000 in uncashed checks on Sept. 1, but has thus far failed to return the remaining taxpayer money. Health scare: A trial set to begin January 30 was delayed until March when Edwards' lawyer revealed in court filings that Edwards has a serious heart condition that requires treatment . Edwards, who served a single term as a U.S. senator from North Carolina, was the Democratic vice-presidential nominee in 2004. The current year-end report for his 2004 primary campaign, Edwards for President, shows that earlier committee still lists nearly $334,000 in unpaid bills. About $65,000 of that remaining 2004 debt is owed to the Chicago firm of Democratic political strategist David Axelrod, who in 2008 helped then-Sen Barack Obama trounce Edwards in the Iowa caucuses. John Kupper, a senior partner at AKPD Message & Media, said the firm has little hope Edwards will ever pay up. 'There have been no negotiations in years,' Kupper said. 'We've written it off as uncollectible.'","Reports filed last week show campaign spent $836,712 on various expenses in 2011 .

Stephen Farrow, 48, staked the letter to a table with two knives after burgling a house just weeks before he killed Reverend John Suddards, 59. Written in shaky red pen, it read: 'Be thankful you did not come back or we would have killed you Christian scum. I f****** hate God.'

Two half eaten containers of ice cream - which had been opened with a knife - were also left on the kitchen surface. She added: 'I felt very threatened by the note that was left. I am very worried about walking outside alone at night. 'We have increased the security and had an alarm fitted.' Yesterday the court heard how Farrow told the victim of an earlier knife burglary: 'I've killed people before'. The jury heard how Farrow previously attacked an elderly woman with a knife as she was alone at her home in Stourbridge, Worcestershire, in 1994. Edward Burgess, prosecuting, read a statement given by the victim Stella Crow - who died aged 85 in 2003 - after Farrow broke into her home on August 22. Farrow later admitted a charge of aggravated burglary for the attack, which took place in Ms Crow's house where she let rooms to lodgers.

'He then struck me to my face. As I hit the floor I hit my left eye. 'I tried to kick him but he was too tall. He then let me stand up. 'He said if anyone came in he would kill me and the dogs. 'He said ""I have killed people before"". This time he was holding the knife above my head in a stabbing stance.' She said she recognised Farrow as he had previously stolen one of her tenant's possessions from his room after asking for a place to stay. Ms Crow, who lost two teeth in the attack, described Farrow as white, 6 ft 4 and with 'grey or green staring eyes'. The court also heard statements from police forensic experts who found footprints and DNA evidence linking Farrow to the burglary. Rev Suddards was stabbed to death inside the vicarage between February 12 and 15 this year. Farrow, of no fixed abode, was arrested at an address in Folkestone, Kent, at 4.20am on February 19 after a nationwide appeal for his whereabouts.

New DNA evidence has allowed a jury to find a 56-year-old convicted sex-offender guilty of the murder of an aspiring model - 27-years after he was first arrested for her killing. On Monday the Pamona Superior Court jury agreed with the prosecution that Stafford Spicer stabbed 23-year-old Jo Anne Marie Jones to death after trying to rob, kidnap and rape her. Originally the prime suspect of the murder of the pretty blonde in 1985, Spicer was conivcted this week after new evidence from Los Angeles County Sheriff's department showed that blood found on the floor and cup holder of Jones' Camaro contained his DNA. Anne Marie Jones, 23, went missing in October 1985 after leaving her boyfriends house in Long Beach, California - Joel Spicer was convicted of her murder at the Pomona Superior Court on October 1st . Spicer now faces life in prison without parole and will be sentenced on October 12th at the Pamona Superior Court in California. 'I'm really thankful the jury took all the time to consider all the evidence and I'm really thankful to cold case detective Steve Davis, who spent several years on the case,' said Deputy District Attorney John Monaghan to the SGV-Tribune. Covina native Jones disappeared after leaving her boyfriend's Long Beach residence on the morning of April 29th and drove off in her 1978 Chevrolet Camaro after spending the night at his house. Upon calling the West Covina Travel Agency where she worked later in the day, her boyfriend was told she had never arrived there and soon after reported her missing to the police. Stafford Joel Spicer was convicted of murdering Jo Anne Marie Jones 27-years after first being arrested for the crime . 'She never went to work. Her family . never heard from her again. She simply disappeared off the face of the . earth,' said Monaghan to the jury at the start of the trial. Three . days after her disappearance, Jones' boyfriend spotted her Camaro in . Long Beach and called the police who discovered it and Spicer in the . parking lot of a supermarket. Spicer was arrested and held, but denied any knowledge of her disappearance and was released when no trace of Jones was found. One month after later, four hikers discovered the missing model's body near East Forks Road, east of Highway 39. A . coroner's office examination determined that she had been stabbed to . death but still police at the time had insufficient evidence to charge . Spicer with and he was released. In 2008, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Detective Steve Davis decided to review Jones’ cold case. Upon . the review, Detective Davis discovered blood found on the floor mat and . cup holder of the Camaro contained Jones’ DNA and Spicer's and a warrant was put out . for his arrest. Police took three years to trace Spicer to Las Vegas, where he was unemployed and living as a drifter. On March 8th, 2011, LASD detectives and Las Vegas police arrested Spicer without incident at the 3000 block of Cabana Avenue and brought him back to California. Jo Anne Marie Jones was murdered by Spicer in a botched robbery attempt by Spicer for her Camaro (right) which eventually yielded the evidence needed to convict him . Azusa-Canyon - where Jo Anne Marie Jones was found over one month after she went missing . During the trial, Detective Davis convinced Monaghan to have the Jury visit the site where Jones' body was discovered and Spicer's old residence which was near to the model's boyfriend's home.

The price of goods has also risen, as many have to be imported. The U.S. and its allies have imposed the punishing measures in attempts to force Iranian concessions over its nuclear programme, which the West says is aimed at developing atomic weapons. Tehran insists it is for peaceful purposes. An Iranian parliament member, Mohammad Bayatian, was quoted on the chamber’s website as saying that enough signatures have been collected to force Ahmadinejad to face questioning before lawmakers over the currency’s tumble. The Parliament speaker Ali Larijani said that '80 per cent' of economic problems were linked to government mismanagement and the rest to sanctions. President Ahmadinejad faced demonstrations from anti-nuclear groups during his stay in New York last week and has admitted the pressure from the United States and its allies has affected Iran's economy . 'The speaker should help the government overcome the problem instead of accusing the administration,' Ahmadinejad said. Larijani is among the possible candidates for next June’s presidential elections that will pick Ahmadinejad’s successor. Iran’s currency fell again yesterday, hitting a record low of 35,500 rials against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial street trading rate, which is widely followed in Iran. On Sunday it was 29,500 rials to the dollar. Two years ago, it was close to 10,000 rials for $1. 'Are these (currency) fluctuations because of economic problems? The answer is no,' Ahmadinejad said. 'Is this because of government policies? Never ... It’s due to psychological pressures. It’s a psychological battle. 'The enemy is making pressure by playing with (exchange rate) numbers in the street.' Ahmadinejad described the sanctions as part of a 'heavy battle' that has succeeded in driving down oil exports 'a bit,' but he gave no precise figures.","President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blames the dip in the economy on sanctions from the U.S. and its allies .

Lindsay Sandiford, 56, from Redcar, Teesside, was arrested with three other Britons by Bali police in May after she . arrived at the airport with a suitcase allegedly packed with 4.8kg of . cocaine worth £1.6m. During her brief appearance, in which she was charged with selling or facilitating the sale of illegal narcotics - she insisted that many aspects of the prosecution’s case was wrong. Accused: Lindsay Sandiford, 56, (pictured) faces execution if found guilty of cocaine smuggling in Bali. She told a court today that the case against her was 'riddled with inaccuracies' Stress: Mrs Sandiford, seen here at an earlier court hearing in Bali last week (above left and right) is one of four Britons who have been charged in connection with the case . Drama: She also tried to cover her face during the earlier hearing (above) after cameramen were allowed into court . Mrs Sandiford appeared in court with a scarf . over her head in an attempt to keep her face hidden from cameramen who . were allowed to be present. She spoke in English to the three judges, telling them that she would respond to the charges in full at her next hearing, set for October 10. But the fact that she has already disputed much of the prosecution case suggested to observers that she was determined to put up a fight in her defence. Because she did not have a lawyer with her, she was told that the court would appoint one for her if she did not find one herself by then. Custody: Mrs Sandiford is being held at Bali's notorious Kerobokan prison along with three other Britons charged in connection with the case . This was her second appearance without a . lawyer. The court has told her that it will not hear her side of . the case until she has appointed one. When she appeared last week the hearing was immediately postponed because she was not legally represented. She told the court at the time that she had been asked by police to sign a number of documents. But because they were all in Indonesian she had refused to put her name to them. Mrs Sandiford is being held at Bali’s notorious Kerobokan prison. The prison, which opened more than 30 years ago, contains hundreds of male and female prisoners of various nationalities. Three other Britons charged as part of the case are also being held at the jail – Rachel Dougall, Julian Ponder and Paul Beales. While Miss Dougall has yet to appear, she and Mr Ponder are facing a death sentence if convicted. Mr Beales has been told he is not likely to face execution if convicted but could receive up to 20 years in jail. Bali is a province of Indonesia - which has some of the toughest anti-drugs laws in the world.","Lindsay Sandiford faces death penalty if found guilty .

Critically ill babies could be diagnosed with genetic diseases in just days rather than weeks, thanks to a new rapid gene unravelling machine. Doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas sequenced the entire genetic code of four gravely ill newborns and identified genetic diseases in three of them in just 50 hours. This was quick enough to help them . make vital treatment decisions. Genetic sequencing involves analysing 3.2 billion chemical 'bases' or 'letters' that make up the human genetic code. Four gravely ill newborns had their entire genetic code sequenced in 50 hours at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas . 50 hours to diagnosis: How the process works . It can reveal DNA variations that point to around 3,500 rare diseases. Many of these conditions are fatal but around 500 have treatments available. Up til now the process was viewed by . medics as too slow and expensive to pursue. Study author, Dr Stephen Kingsmore: 'It is now feasible to decode an entire genome and provide interim results back to the physician in two days.' The study tested two software programs developed at Children's Mercy that were used in conjunction with a high-speed gene sequencer from Illumina called HiSeq 2500, which can sequence an entire genome in about 25 hours. The company helped pay for the study and company researchers took part in it. Next-generation gene sequencing machines have driven down the cost of whole genome sequencing, but making practical use of the data has been more challenging, largely because of the time it takes to analyse all of the data. Dr Stephen Kingsmore led the study into the new ultra-fast genetic testing . As many as a third of babies admitted . to a neonatal intensive care unit in the United States have some form . of genetic disease. Treatments are currently available for more than 500 . diseases, but identifying them quickly has been a problem. Typically, . genetic testing on newborns using conventional methods takes four to . six weeks, long enough that the infant has either died or been sent . home. 'Up until now, they have really had to practice medicine blindfolded,' Dr Kingsmore said. Dr . Neil Miller, director of informatics at Children's Mercy, said the . software programs help doctors identify which genes to test, and analyze . the data quickly. One . of these programs, called SSAGA, allows doctors to order this test based . on the child's symptoms, without having to know in advance which genes . to test for. The . software only maps genes associated with the child's symptoms. SSAGA . does this for nearly 600 diseases, but the team is expanding this to . include all 3,500 known disease genes, Miller told the briefing. The team developed a second software program called Runes that helps determine which of the suspected genes was most likely to be the cause of the child's illness. In the study, the team tested the system on four seriously ill babies whose conditions were suspected of having a genetic cause. One of the boys was found to have a heart defect that the team discovered is also shared by his six-year-old brother. The infant underwent heart surgery and has survived. While two of the other three babies were diagnosed with rare conditions they sadly all passed away. How the cost of decoding genomes has dramatically fallen since 2008 . Dr Carol Saunders,who helped interpret the study results said the study could give parents more information . about the cause of their child's illness and allow them to make . decisions about what kinds of treatments they wanted to pursue. The test is projected to cost £8,300 ($13,500), but the team believes that may be worth it given the high cost of care in a neonatal intensive care unit, which runs roughly £5,000 ($8,000) per night. The next move is to broaden the test to include 100 or more babies to determine the benefits, costs and potential problems linked with the testing. Because the Illumina machine was not available in the United States, the team had to discount the time it took to ship the blood samples to Britain, where the actual sequencing was done. But Kingsmore said the hospital expects to receive its own HiSeq 2500 machine next month. Eventually, the hospital hopes to have its . testing validated, so the researchers can do genetic testing on newborns . in hospitals across the United States.","Doctors at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas sequenced genetic code of four newborns .

The Long family's two puppies China and Asia were stolen from their backyard in Grand Prairie, Texas, in September 2008. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Asia the husky dog has finally returned home four years after she went missing from her home in Grand Prairie, Texas . China was returned in 2010 after being found in the town of Saginaw, Texas, about an hour and 45 minutes drive from their home. And this week Asia was driven back from Chicago leaving her owners wondering what sort of adventures she had been up to over the last four years. Twyla Long told ABC News. 'It was a huge sense of relief. 'We wish we could be a little speck on her brain so we could know what she has seen in the last four years and what she has been through. 'She came in our house last night and she went right to the back door like she knew the back door was there,' Long told ABC News Monday. 'She's not so friendly with her sister right now. They're irritated with each other but we're working them slowly back together.' The Long family's two puppies China and Asia were stolen from their backyard in Grand Prairie, Texas, in September 2008 . Asia was discovered wandering along a highway on the outskirts of Chicago 825 miles away from her owners in Grand Prairie, Texas . Mrs Long, 33, had rescued China and Asia from Fort Worth Animal shelter as pups days before they were due to be put down. The family already had a husky dog and Mrs Long had a tough job persuaded her husband to adopt another two. 'The day they were scheduled to be euthanized I begged my husband and he said OK,' Mrs Long recalls. 'I said, ""Great, I'm sitting in their lobby now.""' Luckily both dogs were microchipped as part of the adoption fee from the shelter. Mr and Mrs Long and their four children quickly fell in love with the two puppies and were left devastated when they were taken. The Long family had rescued Asia and her sister China from Fort Worth Animal shelter as pups days before they were due to be put down . Mrs Long said: 'Every time they [her children] would see a Siberian husky they wanted to scan it for a microchip. 'They wanted to make sure it wasn't China or Asia.' Long's 15-year-old son also volunteered at the animal shelter in Grand Prairie so that he could check any Siberian huskies that came through to see if they were China or Asia. 'We knew that one day we would find them and they would come back home,' Long said. The family used the company Dog Runner Transport, who drove from West Virginia to Chicago to pick up Asia and bring her home.","Husky dog was stolen as a puppy from owners home in Grand Prarie, Texas .

A judge branded a crooked church . accountant 'despicable' as he jailed him for five years for stealing . over £500,000, including thousands for starving orphans. Stephen Methuen, 57, abused . his position of trust while working as a treasurer for his local . evangelical church and an international relief charity. He fiddled the accounts of Amblecote . Christian Centre in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where he had been a member . for 16 years, as well as the Christian International Relief Mission to . steal a total of £517,000 over a six-year period. His dishonesty was only discovered . when Adrian Lowe, the church’s senior pastor and his personal friend, noticed irregularities while carrying out a financial . assessment and called the police. Officers discovered Methuen’s Gift Aid . claims were substantially in excess of the actual donations made and he . often added an extra zero to the figure. He was jailed for five years . at Wolverhampton Crown Court after pleading guilty to 12 charges of . false accounting at a hearing earlier this year and four offences of . cheating HMRC. Sentencing him, Judge John Maxwell . branded Methuen 'despicable' for stealing cash intended for charities, . including to help hungry orphans. He told him: 'We are all familiar with . employees who steal from employers but when the victim is a charitable . trust the consequences are far greater. 'A total of £118,000 had been raised . by the Christian International Relief Mission to help struggling . children in the Philippines in a desperate state of poverty. 'You used the cash to prop up your ailing accountancy business. People in this country were generous when they made donations to charity. 'When they find out that instead of . going to a good cause the money has gone into the pocket of a dishonest . accountant it severely tests their attitude.' Methuen, 57, fiddled the accounts while treasurer at Amblecote Christian Centre in Stourbridge, West Midlands, where he had been a member for 16 years . The court heard Methuen pocketed . £195,000 after making false Gift Aid repayments and siphoned off a . further £205,000 from the church. He also trousered £117,000 from a . charity called the Christian International Relief Mission which helped . children’s orphanages in the Philippines. Rona Campbell, prosecuting, told the . court: 'He was simply paying out the money from the church bank account . into his own coffers through a variety of different routes. 'He was a clever, professional, . qualified man who used guile to systematically defraud the most . deserving and vulnerable institutions - the church and a charity. 'He abused the trust placed in him to . line his own pockets. He manoeuvred himself into the position where he . had sole control of large sums of money.' HMRC investigator . The court heard trustees of the . charities feared they would lose their homes if the inland revenue . pursued the stolen money but had taken a 'compassionate view' and opted . not to try and claw the cash back. After the case, a spokesperson for HM . Revenue and Customs said: 'When interviewed Methuen told HMRC . investigators he was innocent and the discrepancies were due to errors . with computer software. 'However digital forensic analysis of computers by HMRC and West Midlands Police proved this to be a blatant lie. 'He had transferred around £517,000 to his own account and paid off his personal credit cards.' Graham Ranson, Assistant Director . Criminal Taxes Unit, for HM Revenue & Customs, said: 'Methuen was . ruthless in his campaign to steal these substantial funds. 'He gained the organisations trust over a number of years and held a respected position. 'This did not satisfy him or provide . any sense of loyalty. The Gift Aid scheme is designed to benefit . charities, but Methuen continued to falsify business records for his own . financial benefit. 'The prison sentence handed out by the . courts today sends out a clear message that crime does not pay and the . community will be horrified to learn he exploited and stole from these . charities and the taxpayer, in a sustained and methodical way, over a . number of years.' Pastor Adrian Lowe, leader of the congregation at Amblecote Christian Centre, said afterwards: 'It is indeed a very sad day.

Victim: Vitalija Baliutaviciene, pictured, was strangled to death then driven across Europe to be buried in a remote wood, jurors heard . A jilted husband kidnapped and strangled his ex-wife then took her body on a road trip across Europe where he dumped it in a shallow grave, jurors heard yesterday. Lithuanian-born Rimas Venclovas, 47, is on trial for murdering Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29, in a jealous rage after he discovered she had a new lover in the UK. Ms Baliutaviciene's body was found by a mushroom-picker in a remote wood in western Poland two months after she went missing from her home in Peterborough in August last year. Prosecutors told the Old Bailey that Venclovas meticulously plotted his ex-wife's abduction after learning of her new life, applying for a fake passport and using another lover's credit card so he wouldn't get caught. Maureen Baker QC described how the man, who denies the charges, grew his hair long, started sporting a moustache and purchased a new car to avoid detection, according to Court News UK. After UK police arrested him twice for attacking Ms Baliutaviciene, Venclovas skipped bail and flew back to Lithuania to avoid prosecution. But he returned to the UK for the fatal attack, which saw him pounce on his former partner as she left her Burmer Road, Peterborough, home in the early hours of August 12 to go to work. 'CCTV footage taken a short distance along her route shows her being overpowered and taken away by someone,' Ms Baker told jurors. Caught on tape: CCTV stills, pictured, showed the victim being led away . Abduction: Ms Baliutaviciene was kidnapped on her way to work on the morning of August 12 . 'Then she simply vanished. That is . until October 30, when a man gathering mushrooms in a wood in western . Poland came across a shallow grave containing her remains. It was established she had died suddenly and violently as a result of manual choking. 'The prosecution say that this defendant, her former husband, is responsible for both her kidnap and murder. And, in doing so, did exactly what he always promised her he would.' The couple got together when Ms Baliutaviciene was just 17 and after having a son, they were married in 2007. In July 2010, they divorced but Venclovas 'blackmailed' his ex-wife into allowing him to come to the UK, using their son as a bargaining tool, Court News reported. Trial: Venclovas has denied murdering his ex-wife during his trial at the Old Bailey, pictured, in London . Prosecutors claimed yesterday that the woman suffered consistent abuse at the hands of Venclovas who was convinced she was having an affair. 'He was telling her it was the destiny of her son to grow up without a mother, while hers was to be killed by him,' Ms Baker said, describing a previous argument. Venclovas fled Britain in February 2011 after being quizzed by police about attacking his ex-wife. Ms Baker said an investigation into an earlier assault the previous year was dropped on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service. 'Subsequent events have of course called that decision into question,' she added. The trial will continue next week.","Rimas Venclovas, 47, on trial for kidnapping and murdering Vitalija Baliutaviciene, 29, after learning she had new lover in UK .

As a result, seven new High Court . posts, with salaries of more than £170,000, will be advertised. Last week Mr Justice Tugendhat, a senior media law judge, gave a rare insight into the working life on the Bench. ‘One difficulty is that many of the people to whom judges have sworn to do right are very unattractive, and some of them are utterly abhorrent. The Government is beginning an appointments drive . ‘Another difficulty is that the oath . is to do right “after the law and usages of this realm”. It is not to do . right according to the judge’s personal principles or preferences. There is no conscience clause in the oath.’ He also warned politicians about attacking judges. ‘Those who criticise the decisions of judges may not always have in mind what the judicial oath requires. This applies both to the media and to politicians. ‘If judges are publicly criticised for making unpopular decisions which the judicial oath requires them to make, no good can come of that.’ Mr Justice Tugendhat revealed that High Court Judges in the Queen’s Bench Division ‘commonly work for  50 to 60 hours per week, and they devote a significant part of their holidays to catching up with reserved judgments and other administrative work. ‘This statistic is very worrying.

It began with three ribbons that the missing girl’s mother tied in bows to the front gate of their home. Then came a few more in the main street, on windscreen wipers, around tree-trunks and lamp-posts, in shop doorways and on lapels and handbags. Scroll down for video . Solidarity: Pink ribbons have been tied to the fence outside April's home as her family prays for her safe return . The sea of pink ribbons began with three ribbons that April's mother tied in bows to the front gate of their home . Five-year-old April Jones who was abducted after she was seen getting into a stranger's vehicle on Monday evening . By the time the hunt completed its fourth fruitless day yesterday it was impossible to walk more than a few paces in Machynlleth without encountering pink. Even the landmark clock tower in the heart of town was draped in it. Thus, in an extraordinary act of solidarity, the five-year-old’s favourite colour became a symbol of hope that she can be safely returned to her family. The countless ribbons and swatches of pink also underlined a powerful community spirit – rarely encountered in many parts of Britain, but which hallmarked this remarkable little place from the moment hundreds of people came together to offer help in any way they could. One question is always asked first when friends meet in the street: ‘Any news yet?’ Machynlleth is too big to be called a village but it feels like one. More than 2,200 people live here and everyone seems to know each other. The butcher is a former mayor; several shopkeepers know April and her family personally; people call the bobbies by their first names. The little market town has deep and historic roots in Wales, and is claimed in some circles to be the principality’s ancient capital. Yet its eclectic mix of inhabitants gives it a character unlike many other Welsh communities, coloured by the scores of people who visited as tourists and came back to live. It has an almost bohemian atmosphere and has long been a magnet for hippies, environmentalists, ecologists – anyone with a love of the unspoilt countryside and spectacular mountain backdrops. The Centre for Alternative Technology, which aims ‘to empower people to live a more sustainable life’, was founded in 1973 on the site of a disused quarry and draws visitors from around the globe. Yesterday outside the vegan and vegetarian Quarry Café in the main street, Craig Evans sat in the welcome sunshine and pinned a pink ribbon to his pullover. He moved here 20 years ago from Surrey and now considers himself a local. He had just volunteered to help search for April but was told by police that such help was no longer needed. Symbol: The family launched a pink ribbon campaign to help sustain awareness of the search . Pink ribbons are tied around several shop doorways in Machynlleth High Street . Ignoring the advice, he and a friend spent three hours searching anyway with the friend’s spaniel, examining outbuildings and lock-up garages they believed might not have been checked thoroughly on day one. ‘I actually felt guilty sitting at home doing nothing,’ he told me. ‘Every time before I turn the TV or radio on I get a sick feeling that there’s going to be bad news. Then I think it could be good news. But when there’s no news, I feel I have to do something, anything, to help.’ The ‘pink for April’ initiative took off in response to a Facebook appeal by April’s mother Coral Jones, who asked people to wear pink as a tangible sign that no one was giving up hope. ‘Please keep looking for April,’ she wrote. ‘She needs to come home.’ By the time the hunt completed its fourth day it was impossible to walk more than a few paces in Machynlleth without encountering pink .

Some users of the social network site changed their online photographs to pink ribbons to show support. Poignantly, the campaign mirrored the sea of yellow ribbons that grew around Kate and Gerry McCann’s home at the height of the search for missing Madeleine. Cathy Jenkins, shopping in Machynlleth, said the wait for news had been so agonising that being asked to participate even in something symbolic ‘comes as something of a relief’. Most of the pink material spreading over Machynlleth yesterday came from Wheeler’s fabric and haberdashery in the centre of town. Sam Wheeler couldn’t make the little pink ribbons fast enough.

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 05:27 EST, 6 August 2011 . He’s had a tricky few months since confirming he fathered an out-of-wedlock son, but Arnie is making a comeback. The former California governor made his first speech in the state following the disastrous revelations as he edges back into the public eye. Arnold Schwarzenegger, 64, has appeared in public only sporadically in recent months, despite once being among the most public of men. I'm back: Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger speaks at the the American Chamber of Commerce Executives event in Los Angeles . In the days after he split with wife Maria Shriver, he told agents to postpone his movie projects and his once-lively Twitter account went dead. He hired a divorce lawyer, and the former Hollywood star known to crave the spotlight went into a self-imposed exile to sort out his family problems. But he started tweeting again in late June when travelling to his native Austria for an environmental conference, far from his troubles in the U.S. Then last month, he announced he will return to acting with a starring role in the Lionsgate film ‘Last Stand’. Pensive: Mr Schwarzenegger made his first speech in California following a few tricky months after revelations he fathered an out-of-wedlock son . Mr Schwarzenegger will play a border-town sheriff who unwittingly finds himself battling a notorious drug kingpin on the run. He is known for his appearances in films such as The Terminator, Predator and True Lies - and his famous catchphrase: 'I'll be back'. ‘We have too many of the legislators . that are too far to the right or too far to the left, and therefore . nothing gets done' Arnold Schwarzenegger . Mr Schwarzenegger never mentioned his marital problems in the appearance, or his admission of fathering his now-teenage son with maid Mildred Baena. A crowd applauded him after he recounted teaming with business leaders to reform the state's workers' compensation laws. He gave a glossy recounting of his uneven years in Sacramento, cherry-picking accomplishments such as re-districting reform. Maid: Mr Schwarzenegger never mentioned his marital problems in the talk, or his admission of fathering his now-teenage son with Mildred Baena . But, sporting a deep tan, Mr Schwarzenegger never mentioned the state economy has struggled for years, during his talk to a business group. The moderate Republican joked that he was running for president in 2012 - of a body-building association. But he warned about the dangers of political gridlock, saying that partisan division was choking progress in California and Washington. ‘We have too many of the legislators that are too far to the right or too far to the left, and therefore nothing gets done,’ he said. Ex-wife: In the days after Mr Schwarzenegger split with wife Maria Shriver, he told agents to postpone his movie projects and his Twitter account went dead . The speech comes in the midst of his divorce, which is unfolding largely behind closed doors. Last month he withdrew a request for a judge to terminate Ms Shriver's right to spousal support, and he clarified he is willing to pay her lawyer. Once a popular governor, Mr Schwarzenegger returned to the public stage with his image badly bruised. One poll taken after disclosures about the son and his split found nine of 10 voters in his home county of Los Angeles didn't like him.","Former California governor comes back into public eye .

Ms Brightman, 52, plans to join a Russian Soyuz spacecraft going to the International Space Station (ISS). The trip is said to be costing the star, who was once married to Andrew Lloyd Webber, about £5 million – although one estimate has put it as high as £20 million. Boldly going: Classical singer Sarah Brightman will undergo six months training to go into space . Russian space agency sources said that the world’s biggest-selling soprano, who is worth £30 million, secretly visited Moscow last month and ‘successfully completed all the necessary medical  tests and checks’. Ms Brightman’s flight is likely to be in 2014 or 2015 and she will undergo at least six months of intensive training at Russia’s restricted Star City, where all cosmonauts are prepared for flights. She is likely to spend between ten days and two weeks in space. Starship trouper: The Soyuz TMA-12 spacecraft, similar to the one Ms Brightman will board, approaches the International Space Station .

She has revealed how she relied on a cocktail of pills and injections to come to terms with the split . Cheryl Cole has told how she relied on a cocktail of pills and injections to cope with the news of ex-husband Ashley’s infidelity. She said finding out that he had been unfaithful made her so miserable that she turned to tranquilisers to keep functioning. She also had vitamin injections in her bottom. The 29-year-old singer recalls her ordeal in her autobiography, Cheryl: My Story, which lays bare her despair on discovering that the Chelsea and England footballer had cheated on her during their four-year marriage. In one extract, she tells how she flew at Cole in a fury after hearing the first girl’s claims that she slept with him in Las Vegas. She admitted ‘shaking him, kicking him, scratching his face, pushing and shoving him like I was a lunatic’ before sobbing uncontrollably. Miss Cole went to stay with her Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh during the break-up but needed medication from her GP to calm her nerves and did not sleep for days. ‘Kimberley cried when she saw me,’ she recalls in the book. ‘I was still in shock. I wasn’t in control of myself at all. I needed medical help. ‘I got pills off the doctor to calm me down and lay on Kimberley’s sofa. But I still couldn’t sleep. ‘We had a videoshoot for our new single coming up and my doctor gave me a vitamin injection in my bum to perk me up, but it didn’t work.’ It is claimed that vitamin injections can give the body a boost when it is run down or exhausted. After the initial revelations, Miss Cole then heard further allegations from women claiming to have slept with her husband, some dating back from before they were married. She decided to escape on holiday to Thailand. Support: Cheryl Cole, pictured in concert (left), went to stay with her Girls Aloud bandmate Kimberley Walsh (right) during the break-up of her marriage . ‘It was now about two weeks after the initial allegations and, looking back, I was out of my head on tranquillisers. ‘As soon as we got there I crashed out for two full days. ‘When I finally came out I sat on my own overlooking the beach. I didn’t know who I was any more, I thought. 'I was a heartbroken girl, but who was I now without Ashley by my side? I knew I loved him and I didn’t want to end my marriage.’ The couple were briefly reunited but separated again as more allegations of his infidelity surfaced. In 2010, she divorced Cole on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’. She has been dating her backing dancer Tre Holloway since the summer. In the autobiography, Miss Cole also recalls her anger at Simon Cowell after they fell out last year.

Michael Warrener, who was jailed for 19 years in May for the rape and indecent assault of his daughter Claire Warrener. An inquest heard how she killed herself after reporting her father to the police . A woman killed herself after reporting her father to police for raping her when she was a child. Claire Warrener, 22, finally gained the courage to report the abuse in 2010, six years after it ended. But she found it hard to cope after telling police she had been abused from the age of 11, an inquest was told. Michael Warrener, 59, of Newcastle, went on to stand trial for raping and indecently assaulting her and was convicted in May this year. Claire took her own life months after reporting the sick attacks, and the sentencing judge at Newcastle Crown Court blamed her father for her death as he handed Warrener a 19-year jail term. An inquest in Sunderland yesterday heard how Claire’s cousin Ashleigh found her body in the kitchen of her home in Hendon. Paramedics tried to save her, but she was pronounced dead at Sunderland Royal Hospital on December 9 last year. Her sister Stacey broke down and was unable to continue giving evidence to the hearing held at Sunderland Civic Centre. Stacey said: 'He had been following her about town. She was scared about the trial.' Investigating officer Detective Constable David Garrity, who led the investigation into the allegations about Michael Warrener, gave evidence at the hearing. He said: 'Prior to her death, she had made a report to the police with regards to sexual abuse by her father. 'I think on speaking with Claire and throughout the investigation, it had a clearly significant effect and massive impact on her life.' Dr Hugh Cochrane, a pathologist at Sunderland Royal Hospital, said Claire would have died suddenly from heart failure. He added that there were marks of self-harm on her body and small amounts of alcohol and amphetamine was found in her blood.

Lily Willis, 8, from Great Lumley, County Durham, was diagnosed with a bone cancer tumour called osteosarcoma in February after she came home from school limping just weeks earlier. The tumour, on her right leg, meant that her entire knee, tibia and part of her femur had to be removed and rebuilt with stainless steel adjustable bones. As Lily grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh as required. Lily Willis holds an x-ray of her leg, which shows her new metal bones that will grow with her over the next six years . Her mother Tori, 30, said: 'Lily came home after school one day with a sore ankle. She had been doing cross-country and was limping. We thought nothing of it and imagined she had just sprained it while she had been out running. 'But after a couple of weeks, the pain had travelled up her leg and didn’t seem to be going anywhere so I took her to the doctors. 'I thought they were just going to strap her up and send her home again - we never thought it would ever be anything serious.' But Tori and Lily’s father Bryan were in for the shock of their lives after doctors sent Lily for an X-ray, which revealed she had a tumour on the bone above her right knee. Bryan, 40, said: 'They did an X-ray of her ankle and then called us back so they could do another on her hips. 'We were told to wait five days and assumed this meant there was nothing serious going on or they would have done something straight away. 'But the hospital called us a few days later and told us we had to take Lily out of school and get her there. 'That’s when we started to worry. I could sense the urgency over the phone and I couldn’t possibly have expected what they were going to tell us.' Lily will undergo another six months of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed . Surgeons at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary performed a biopsy on Lily’s tumour and found it to be cancerous. Tori, a former florist said: 'It sounds stupid to say now but until we were told Lily had cancer, I didn’t think children got cancer. 'I’d heard of children with leukaemia but for some reason I didn’t think of them as the same thing.' Once Tori and Bryan had been told of Lily’s cancer, doctors sat the youngster down and explained to her what was wrong with her. Lily said: 'They told me I had cancer but I didn’t know what it meant. I’d heard people talking about it but I didn’t know what it was.' Tori said: 'When we were told Lily had the disease, I think my heart stopped for a second. My little girl had cancer. No parent should have to hear that. 'I thought she was going to die. We asked doctors if she was going to be OK but it was a question they couldn’t answer - they just looked at us sympathetically.' Just a week after her diagnosis in February, medics began Lily on a course of chemotherapy and performed a 14-hour operation on the youngster to remove her knee and tibia bones. They then replaced them using adjustable stainless steel to act like real bones. Xray of Lily's leg: As Lily grows, a magnet will be placed around her leg which will allow doctors to lengthen the bones in her shin and thigh . Bryan, a former mechanic, said: 'Lily was so poorly. The chemotherapy hit her hard, she was sick a lot and had very little energy. 'Her hair began to fall out which I think was hard for her - but now we can’t imagine her ever having any! 'She also contracted pneumonia - a strain which doctors said was the worst they had seen, after her lung collapsed. 'The operation was the hardest part. We didn’t think it would take that long so it was a waiting game for her to come out of theatre. The longer she was down there, the more we thought was going wrong.' But the operation was a success and after installing Lily’s new limbs, surgeons managed to reconstruct all of the muscles, tendons and even blood vessels around the new bones. As the new metal bones were too big for her leg when they were fitted, skin and tissue from her left thigh was used to stretch around her newly built limb. Now that the cancerous tissue has been removed, Lily is well on the road to recovery. She will still need up to six months worth of chemotherapy to ensure all cancerous cells have been destroyed before she can be given the all-clear. Lily’s new bones will last until she is 14, when they will be replaced with adult sized metal pieces, which will be left inside her leg for the rest of her life. In the meantime, her sisters Jessy, 5, and Ruby, 2, are pleased to have her home where they can help look after her with their parents, who both gave up their jobs to be Lily’s full-time carers. The brave youngster has recently been nominated for a Champion Child of Courage award, after she made hundreds of friendship bracelets while she was in hospital to raise money for charity. Her mother said: 'She’s doing really well, she is better than she used to be. She is absolutely amazing. 'It will be a while before Lily can walk independently as she has to build up the muscles again in her legs but she is doing brilliantly - we are all so proud of her.'","Lily had a sore ankle, which her parents put down to a school cross-country run .

Abrupt ending: Lee Eddins, 12, battling leukemia since February, passed away on Thursday one day shy of fulfilling a long-time dream of meeting his favourite basketball star . For 12-year-old Leukaemia patient Lee Eddins, meeting NBA star Roy Hibbert was to be a dream come true. Just one day before the Indiana Pacers player planned to visit him at a hospice centre in Sacramento, California, the boy's memorable farewell was lost, however, with Lee tragically succumbing to his illness. 'Lee likes players from all over the NBC, but there's something about Roy that he liked. I didn't even know he had heard of Roy Hibbert before,' Lee's legal guardian Victor Baker told the Indianapolis Star on Wednesday. A devoted fan of Hibbert 'since he was back at Georgetown [University],' according to Mr Baker, Lee followed the athlete from 2008 until his final day on Thursday. Diagnosed with stage four leukaemia in February the boy underwent a bone marrow transplant in June but it didn't take. When his left lung developed an infection, consequently spreading to his right, doctors thought it would be best not to try again. 'The doctors did a CT scan to see how his lung was doing, but it was getting worse because the infection was spreading more,' Mr Baker said. 'The doctors finally decided they didn't want to put him through another round of chemo because it would pretty much suppress his immune system and they didn't feel like he would be able to handle it.' Flying in: Roy Hibbert #55 of the Indiana Pacers was scheduled to fly to California to meet with Lee on Friday after hearing what a huge fan the boy was . Comforting: Lee was transferred to the UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, pictured, last week for their hospice centre with Hibbert planning to visit on Friday . Keeping promises: Despite hearing the news of Lee's death, Hibbert jumped on a plane on late Thursday afternoon hoping to still meet with the boy's family and friends . Last week Lee was moved to hospice care at the UC Davis Medical Center with family flying in from all around the country to see him. Hibbert planned to too. 'Once I heard he had a dying wish, I knew I had to do something more than send him presents and Skype with him on the computer,' Hibbert told the Star after announcing his plans. 'I'm usually uncomfortable going to hospitals when the Pacers do events because it's pretty tough to see kids in that situation. Once I heard about (Lee), I realized I had to get over it and do it for him,' he said. With African-Americans having only a 6 per cent chance of finding a match for a bone marrow transplant - compared to 85-88 per cent for Caucasians, according to the African American Community Health Advisory Committee - Hibbert said while he was visiting Lee he'd provide a swab of his cheek as well. That swab would tell doctors if he had the potentially life-saving match the boy needed. 'I've had two family members die of cancer,' Hibbert told the Star. 'It's tough. I seriously don't know what I'm going to say to Lee. I'm just going to be myself. If I can get a smile out of him that will be great.' When the news broke of his death, one day short of their eventful meeting, Hibbert still kept his plans to fly out and see his family. 'On my way to Sacramento,' Hibbert informed his Twitter followers on late Thursday afternoon. 'I'm heartbroken today. I won't be able to meet my lil guy Lee but I will be there for his parents and family.'","Lee Eddins succumbed to cancer the day before scheduled to meet Indiana Pacers centre Roy Hibbert .

They have fought on battlefields and in courtrooms for the return of the land that once belonged to them. And now - 150 years after the sacred, mountainous land in South Dakota's Black Hills was taken from them by the U.S. government - the Sioux are desperately trying to raise $9million to get it returned. However, the bid has sparked controversy among the native American tribesman, many of whom are angry that they are being forced to buy back land that once belonged to them. Scroll down for video . Sioux tribesman on the plains of South Dakota: The Sioux have an ancient association with the Black Hills . Disputed land: The Reynolds Prairie in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The ranch - nearly 2,000 acres - encompasses the sacred site of Pe' Sla . Tom Poor Bear, the vice president of . the Oglala Lakota Tribe in South Dakota, told the New York Times: 'It’s like someone stealing my car and I . have to pay to get it back.' A portion of the rolling range of mountains, given the name of called Pe' Sla by the Lakota Sioux tribes, was offered for sale earlier this year. The family that have controlled the land since 1876 - the year that General George Armstrong Custer died - have accepted a bid for the land made by more than half a dozen Sioux tribes. The group, which includes some of the country's poorest people, is now scrambling to raise the $9million needed to buy back the land before next month's deadline, the New York Times reported. Not for sale: Lakota Indians at Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, protesting in 2004 against the Government taking away treatied land . Sacred land: The Black Hills was given to the Sioux in 1868 but mountains (pictured) were snatched back by the government after the discovery of gold . The move is the latest in a long and . controversial battle over ownership of the land after the United States . broke several treaties when it took it from the natives. The . government's seizure of the Black Hills was described as one of the . most dishonourable acts in American history in a landmark federal court . decision in 1979. The SIoux . tribes have been blighted by poverty and unemployment for generations. If they cannot raise the money they stand to lose their sacred land as . well as a $900,000 initial payment they put down. Sioux tribal leaders from all over the Great Plains will meet this week to devise a strategy to come up with the remaining $8.1million by November 30. 'Our ceremonial patterns would collapse': The current owners have always allowed the Sioux to access the land for prayer rituals . Way of life: If the Sioux fail in their bid to buy Pe' Sla they say their culture could 'come to an end' The current owners - the Reynolds family - have always allowed the Sioux to access the land for prayer ceremonies. However, if the Sioux fail in their bid to buy Pe' Sla they say their culture could 'come to an end' if the land was bought by an owner who prevented them from visiting, effectively finishing 3,000 years of annual pilgrimages. Victor Douville, who teaches Lakota history and culture . at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, told the New York Times: 'Our ceremonial patterns would . collapse.' Heading the purchase bid is the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. It's treasurer Louis Wayne Boyd said: 'This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get some land back that is very, very dear to us. 'Most of the tribes want to do something, but it’s very difficult for them to raise any money, especially of this magnitude.' Gold rush: A prospector in the Black Hills. The site was snatched back from the Sioux when gold was discovered . The Sioux have an ancient association with Pe' Sla, 1,942 acres of prairie in the heart of the Black Hills mountain range. They consider Pe' Sla to be sacred and believe the site was once the setting of an epic battle between good and evil. The Sioux honour this with an annual religious ceremony which welcomes the spring after a long winter. In 1868, the Treaty of Fort Laramie granted them ownership but the mountains were taken back by the federal government when gold was discovered. The area then became a hot spot for prospectors hoping to cash in on the gold rush. The land was homesteaded by the Reynolds, a ranching family, since the Battle of Little Big Horn in 1876. Despite owning the land where the Lakota perform healing ceremonies, the Reynolds have allowed the Sioux to access the site. However, they divided their 1,940 acres into five tracts which were sold at auction last month. Pictures of the lot show the land to be a remote prairie where wild deer roam. The U.S. Government was accused of using deplorable tactics from drive the Sioux from Pe' Sla before it appropriated the land, including starving them. In 1979, more than 100 years later, the United States Courts of Claims said of the federal government's actions: 'A more ripe . and rank case of dishonourable dealing will never, in all probability, be . found in our history.' A year later, the Supreme Court ordered the government to compensate the Sioux for seizing the Black Hills site, but the tribes refused to accept the money. They believe accepting compensation effectively condones the sale of the mountain and they instead have insisted Black Hills is returned to tribal authority. Despite the fact the government compensation fund has grown to more than $800million as it sits in a bank account accumulating interest, the Sioux have refused to use the money to buy Pe' Sla.","Time is running out for tribes to buy back sacred land taken from them by the U.S. Government .

From its long legs to smaller body the unusual shaped critter is a surreal echo of its much larger namesake.

But unlike the giraffe the bug's neck is not to help it reach for food but is for aggressive combat with other giraffe weevils to win over a female. The necks of the males are typically two to three times the length of those of females, and are also used for nest building. Most of the creatures' bodies are covered with a distinctive red shell covering the wings. Despite their fierce look, they are not dangerous to humans. Though it is not listed as threatened or endangered not much is known about the giraffe weevil, which was only discovered in Madagascar in 2008. This specimen was photographed by Russian wildlife photographer Nikolay Sotskov, 29, who couldn't believe his eyes when he spotted it on a leaf while in the Indian Ocean island nation.

Mostly harmless: Most of the creatures' bodies are covered with a distinctive red shell covering the wings. Despite their fierce look, they are not dangerous to humans . Madagascar split from India around 88million years ago, allowing plants and animals on the island to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90 per cent of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. However, the island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population. 'I like photographing animals as despite being one of the hardest to capture they are still the most fascinating,' he said. 'And this is the strangest insect I have ever seen.

The eldest son of missing Utah mother Susan Powell told his teacher 'my mom is dead' after her disappearance and also told police she went on the camping trip with them but 'did not come back'. This is just some of the shocking evidence released in sealed court documents about the initial investigation into the mother's disappearance, who went missing in December 6, 2009. Her body has never been found. The documents also revealed that authorities immediately classified the case as a murder and kidnapping probe, according to the heavily redacted court documents released on Tuesday. Despite what seems like overwhelming evidence against her husband Josh Powell, he was never arrested or even labeled a suspect, leaving him free to kill himself and his young sons at their home in Washington state earlier this year. Loss: A report has found that social workers failed to consult law enforcement before allowing Josh Powell to see his sons, who he killed in a house explosion. Their mother Susan was missing . Missing: Susan Powell vanished from the couple's Utah home in 2009. She had said she feared her husband . The documents reveal that a search of the Powell home turned up blood evidence not only on the sofa, but on nearby carpet and a tile floor.  Forensic tests showed it belonged to Susan. They also found Susan's purse with all her cards, money and identification. When they told Josh about this, he did not seem concerned and did not ask if they had found her throughout the whole investigation, according to documents. What police did not tell Josh, the documents reveal, is there was also a safe deposit key in her purse. When they traced it to a local Wells Fargo, they found that only Susan had access to it and she had used it only twice. Inside the box was a folded letter addressed to her friends and family with specific instructions that it should not be shown to her husband, writing that she didn't trust him. The letter - signed by Susan and dated June 28, 2008 - stated that Josh Powell threatened to destroy her if she ever divorced him and 'leave the children without a mother and father'. She also wrote that if she died, 'it may not be an accident even if it looks like one'. Grisly: Powell attacked his sons with a hatchet before torching the home in Graham, Washington, pictured . Killed: Braden, left, and Charlie Powell are pictured. A committee concluded that social workers should 'make a concerted effort' to check with detectives before amending visitations . Home: The house in West Valley City, Utah where the Powells lived and where Susan's blood was found . The affidavit, which is just a part of a large number of sealed documents in the missing mother's case, also reveal that when police searched Josh Powell's van after he returned from the late-night camping trip with his sons, they found a generator, blankets, a gas can, tarps, circular saw, humidifier, utility knife, latex gloves, rake, sleds, and a shovel. They also found Susan's cellphone with no SIM card in it. When questioned about his impromptu . late-night camping trip, Powell told authorities he was testing out a . new generator, according to the documents. As well as eldest son Charlie telling investigators his mother had gone camping with them but 'decided to stay and not come home', Susan's other son Braden, who was just two at the time, said his mother was 'in the trunk'. On January 3, 2010, Charlie Powell was attending church in Puyallup, Washington, when the teacher said she was going to have to get his mom or dad because he was misbehaving. He answered with 'no emotion and without hesitation' that 'my mom is dead', according to documents which were released by the Salt Lake Tribune. After interviewing many of Susan's friends as part of the investigation, authorities were told about bizarre comments . Josh Powell made at his wife’s Christmas work party regarding 'how to kill . someone, dispose of the body and not get caught'. Information was also received during . this investigation that Josh Powell was the beneficiary of several life . insurance policies totaling $1.5million on Susan Powell. Murder suicide: Powell, pictured with Braden last year, also killed himself in the explosion . Probe: Powell had always mainatined his innocence and said she had gone missing when he was camping . He also said he liked . to go camping in Utah's west desert because it was filled with mine . shafts and tunnels and was the perfect place to 'dispose of someone and . no one would ever search for the body', one of the recently released documents . states. After detectives seized the family . van, Josh went that evening to the Salt Lake City International Airport . to rent a car. He kept the car for two days and drove it 800 miles. He subsequently refused to speak with . police or to take a lie detector test. Within ten days of his wife’s . disappearance, Josh Powell had cancelled Susan Powell’s upcoming . chiropractic appointments, told their day care provider the children . would not be returning and withdrawn all the money in his wife’s IRA . accounts. On December 6, the day Susan . disappeared, her friend Jovanna Owings told police she was at the Powell . home and Susan 'became very tired after eating a meal Josh had prepared . for her'. That was the last time she would see her.

The records help 'make the public aware, to some extent, of what's been . going on', West Valley City police Sgt Mike Powell said on Tuesday. 'We've . been working diligently and very hard on this investigation.' Publicly, they would only say the case . remained active while sharing little else, and they never specifically . labeled Josh Powell a suspect. Anne Bremner, an attorney for Susan . Powell's parents, said that's not good enough. She has been fighting for . the release of the entire case file under a Utah law that provides . victims the same rights and access to investigative records as criminal . defendants. 'We'll keep making attempts to get the . full measure of the records,' Bremner said on Tuesday. 'Until I'm . satisfied that I have everything, my clients have instructed me to keep . going forward.' Other documents released this week chronicle Steven Powell's uncontrollable love and spiraling obsession with Susan. In passages from 17 spiral notebooks written over more than ten years, he wrote of his sexual fantasies about and urges towards Susan, how he believed she loved him too and hopes they would be together. He wrote: 'She is an amazing woman. I hope I am right, that she is in love with me, but of course there is the problem of her being married to my son. 'The fact is, I can hardly control myself when it comes to her.' He also wrote: 'My biggest problem as well as my greatest pleasure lies in the fact that for over a year I have been madly in love with my daughter-in-law, Susan. 'I have never lusted for a woman as I do for Susan.' He admitted in the passages that he secretly recorded his daughter-in-law from as early as January 2003 and would watch videos of her while masturbating. He admitted 'looking at her naked body under the bathroom door (using a mirror)' though recognized this was a 'sick' thing to do. His obsession with her, he said, 'represents the first time I’ve mentioned fetishes and what might be considered sociopathic. I mean, who looks under the bathroom door with a mirror?' The journal included countless photos of Susan and different parts of her body. He also revealed he stole some of her belongings including her underwear, her hair and even discarded wax strips. He was jailed in June for 30 months on charges of voyeurism against his neighbor's children.","Charlie Powell told police his mom went on camping trip and didn't come back .

Mr Vaz seemed to enjoy being the centre of attention . Mr Vaz is a renowned networker and the Diversity Night has become a staple on the party conference calendar. The threat of a fresh inquiry into his financial affairs did not seem to dampen his enthusiasm for a night on the tiles. It came after it emerged a Scotland Yard document suggested Mr Vaz received 'significant amounts of cash' of a 'suspicious nature' between 1997 and 2001. Labour MPs and activists clapped along as Mr Vaz swayed with the dancers . The Usdaw union had a stall at the Diversity Night, but the guests seemed more interested in the entertainment . Tory MP Andrew Bridgen yesterday wrote to John Lyons, the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner to demand an inquiry and called for Mr Vaz to stand down as chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee. The inquiry was linked to Mr Vaz’s alleged involvement in trying to obtain British passports for the Billionaire tycoon Hinduja brothers in 2001.

Ann Romney says she's glad people watching the first presidential debate have been able to see her husband, Republican presidential pick Mitt Romney, as she does: 'A good and decent person.' Speaking today before introducing her husband, Mrs Romney says people got to see the former Massachusetts governor as someone who cares for others - and that Americans will be able to see him display that quality again when he gets people back to work. The campaign wants to soften her husband's image in the final weeks of the campaign and maintain his focus on the middle class. On the campaign trail: Mitt Romney and wife Ann arrive at a campaign event in Palm Beach, Florida, on Sunday . Liplock: Ann and Mitt Romney share a kiss as she introduces him in Port St Lucie, Florida . Standing by her man: Ann Romney says the debate presented her husband as a 'good and decent person' At the same event, Romney promised he would 'not raise taxes on middle class families!' Romney's campaign said that 12,000 people attended the event, including 3,000 in an overflow area. Romney has enjoyed a two point boosted in in the respected Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll, as well as a $12million boost in online donations since the debate. He has used the new momentum to go on the offensive against Obama.

However, he launched another ad defending his tax plan against the president's claims that Romney plans to cut taxes by $5trillion balanced mostly on the backs of the middle class. Mitt Romney, campaigning in up-for-grabs Florida, sought to build on the momentum from a debate performance last week that even Democrats conceded was 'masterful.' The Republican told a crowd of about 12,000 in Port St Lucie that he had enjoyed himself, ticking off a list of Obama shortcomings he said he had exposed during the first debate. Romney said: 'Now of course, days later, we're hearing his excuses. And next January we'll be watching him leave the White House for the last time.' Couple: Mitt and Ann Romney step off the campaign plane as they arrived for a campaign event in Port St Lucie, Florida . Romney on Monday plans a major foreign policy address at the Virginia Military Institute, intended to throw Obama back on his heels over his handling of unrest in Libya and elsewhere. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki, dismissing what she called Romney's fourth or fifth attempt to explain his global intentions, said the bar is high for Romney to convince voters he's prepared to be commander in chief. 'We are not going to be lectured by someone who's been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he sticks his toe in the foreign policy waters,' Psaki said aboard Air Force One as Obama made his way to California. Even as Romney sought to reap further rewards from his debate performance, a string of good news for the president threatened to steal the former Massachusetts governor's spotlight. A jobs report Friday showing unemployment at the lowest levels of Obama's presidency was quickly followed Saturday by a fundraising report showing Obama and Democrats had raised $181million in September. It was their best fundraising month of the campaign, but fell short of their record $190million raised in September 2008 as the president campaigned for his first term. Romney's campaign has not released its report for the month, and Republicans sought to downplay Obama's financial advantage. The party's national chairman, Reince Priebus, said on CNN’s State of the Union that he had been counting all along on being outraised by Obama and Democrats. 'This isn't going to come down to . money. This is going to come down to heart,' Priebus said. 'We'll beat . them on the ground, and we'll have all the money we need to be . competitive.' In what will . be his final fundraising trip out West this election, Obama is enlisting . his celebrity pals - from actors to singers to chefs - to donate to his . campaign and encourage their fans to do the same.

Both campaigns were prepping their running mates for Thursday's vice presidential debate - and working to keep expectations low lest their candidate underperform.

Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, who challenged Romney in the GOP primary, suggested on NBC's Meet the Press that Paul Ryan would hold back on any hostility out of respect for Biden's status as a senior statesman.","Ann Romney says people watching the debate on Wednesday night saw her husband as she sees him .

Ronald Smith, 59, from South Bents, near Whitburn, South Tyneside, died after breathing in fumes from an airbag during a car crash in January 2011, an inquest heard . A husband involved in a minor car crash died months later after breathing in the ‘noxious’ contents of an airbag. Ronald Smith’s wife June was relieved when he arrived home apparently uninjured following the six-car shunt, an inquest heard. However he told her the airbag had been torn open by a shard of glass as it inflated and he had inhaled the gases it contained along with a large amount of white powder. Grandfather Mr Smith, a 59-year-old marine engineer who had been extremely fit and active, began to suffer chest and breathing problems. After several weeks he went to hospital where he was placed on a ventilator. However, three weeks later Mr Smith died of bronchial pneumonia. South Tyneside coroner Terence Carney recorded a verdict of misadventure on  Mr Smith, from Marsden, South Shields. He said: ‘This man died as a result of this incident (the car crash) and more pointedly because of the explosion of his airbag ... and exposure to noxious substances.’ Outside court Mr Smith’s son, Lee, 36, said: ‘It’s the verdict I was looking for. Ever since it happened we wanted an investigation to  see if anybody was to blame and I’m happy with what the coroner has said.’ It is believed to be the first time a driver has died after inhaling the contents of an airbag, and Mr Smith’s widow spoke her shock and devastation that something designed to save life had actually taken it. ‘I knew from the very beginning that it was the airbag,’ she said. The accident that led to Mr  Smith’s death happened in November 2010 as he was returning home through Hartlepool. The AA says when airbags ignite they produce nitrogen, which inflates the airbag and should not be hazardous (file picture) He drove into the car in front at the same time that another went into the back of his Vauxhall Insignia. His head was flung forward by the impact and he inhaled the contents of the torn airbag, the inquest at South Shields was told. The AA said the motoring organisation had no record of similar deaths. A spokesman said: 'In the event of a crash, sensors in a car, behind the bumper for example, measure the rate of deceleration. 'If the impact is severe enough, an explosive device triggers the inflation of the airbag. In some systems a sodium azide tablet is fitted inside, and this is ignited electronically. 'When it ignites it produces nitrogen, which inflates the airbag. Nitrogen already makes up 78 per cent of the air we breathe so it’s not hazardous. 'As soon as the bag has fully inflated it starts to deflate - once it’s taken the force. 'A lot of powder is also released. This is mainly talcum powder, which manufacturers use as a lubricant to help the airbag slide into the correct position during assembly. 'Some systems use canisters of a cellulose-based gas to inflate the airbag, but this isn’t regarded as toxic either. We have checked our records and cannot find any similar cases, but this death is very sad.' ‘He told me about the white powder straight away,’ said Mrs Smith. ‘He said there was so much of it he couldn’t see. ‘I just thought that the white powder had got into his lungs. I thought his body would get rid of it by itself – I didn’t think it would be permanent. ‘Not long after that I noticed that he wasn’t right, he would become breathless walking up the drive. ‘Ronnie has never smoked so that was very worrying. He started to cough a lot as well. It wasn’t normal because he wasn’t like that, he never got colds. ‘He had always been so healthy and was extremely fit. I knew  from the beginning that it was the air bag but other people would  look at me as if to say, “Don’t  be silly”.’ On January 5 the couple went to South Tyneside District Hospital and Mr Smith was immediately given oxygen and admitted. ‘He could barely move,’ added his widow. ‘It was a very cold winter, and he was really struggling. We used to walk everywhere and he was always out every night with the dog, but he got so bad that he couldn’t even walk a few steps without my help.’ Forensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton told the inquest that Mr Smith’s lungs were both extremely ‘heavy and firm’. The AA said it had no record of similar deaths. A spokesman for Vauxhall said the company planned to investigate the matter but did not wish to comment at this stage.","Ronald Smith died two months after car accident .

A procession of Border Patrol agents on horseback paraded through Arizona on Monday for the funeral of a fellow agent, tragically shot dead by apparent friendly fire. Nicholas Ivie was killed before daybreak on October 2 as he responded to a tripped ground sensor in a well-known smuggling corridor near Naco, Arizona. A second agent was shot and wounded, while a third was unharmed. Respectful: Mounted officers line the route during the funeral procession for their slain colleague . Tragically short life: A portrait of U.S. Border Patrol agent Nicholas Ivie, 30, stands next to his flag-drapped coffin before his funeral in Sierra Vista, Arizona . Among the sombre convoy was Ivie's own horse, poignantly saddled-up with no rider astride it. The FBI has said there were 'strong preliminary indications' that Ivie's death was the result of friendly fire in an accidental shooting in which only Border Patrol agents were involved. It has released scant details on the circumstances. Ivie was the fourth Border Patrol agent to die in violent circumstances in less than two years in Arizona, and his death heightened concern about border security in a state at the forefront of the national immigration debate in a presidential election year. As they mourned the loss of the 30-year-old, Ivie's family issued a statement in which they said: 'Our best wishes and prayers continue for the other agents involved in the incident, that they may experience healing and peace. Poignant: Ivie's own horse formed part of the procession, no ride astride him . Formal: Law enforcement colleagues march in a procession before his funeral . 'We honor all who serve in the Border Patrol, carrying out an extremely difficult task under harsh conditions. 'We are grateful for all the efforts by so many to thoroughly investigate what took place during that early morning tragedy. National Border Patrol Council president George McCubbin said the incident occurred when Ivie, believing he had run into an armed smuggler, opened fire. The wounded agent returned fire, as did a third agent, McCubbin said. 'It's at night and you have more than one unit responding to the report,' the paper quoted McCubbin as saying.

Call of duty: Arriving at the church, Ivie's colleague's prepare to lift the casket into the service . 'We are running into canyons and saddles and down mountains, and you don't know what you are going to find down there.' Acting Cochise County Sheriff Rod Rothrock  added that: 'It was dark, very, very rugged terrain, and what they could see of each other was further obscured by the fact that there was brush and cacti and stuff like that between them. 'I have no doubt that these agents were in as heightened a state of alert as you can get due to the proximity to the border and the history of trafficking in that area.' A Cochise County Sheriff's spokeswoman said Ivie and the two other agents, who had communicated with one another, had come from different directions and that the two agents had taken defensive postures that were 'interpreted as aggressive. 'They knew they were all in the same area,' spokeswoman Carol Capas told Reuters. 'It's obviously a tragic accident due to the circumstances with what appears to be friendly fire.' On Monday, as details of the incident continued to trickle out, a horse-drawn carriage carried Ivie's coffin through the streets of the small town of Sierra Vista to a Mormon church for funeral services. Ivie's horse, Mouse, also took part in the procession, mounted with an empty saddle.

Later, Border Patrol officers in uniforms and wearing white gloves carried Ivie's body to a white hearse marked with two small U.S. flags and put the coffin, draped in a U.S. flag, inside. Family members of Ivie sat in the front row at the services alongside the agent wounded in the shooting, who was embraced by Ivie's father. Ivie had learned Spanish on a two-year Mormon mission in Mexico City and lived in Sierra Vista with his wife and two young daughters. During an emotional eulogy after the funeral procession, Ivie's brother, Joel, said the slain agent may have placed the sensor that he was responding to when he was killed. Ivie was expected to be buried on Thursday in Utah. 'He died in a beautiful place,' Joel Ivie said. 'He knew that network of trails on the mountain.' Ivie's death marked the first fatal shooting of an agent since a deadly 2010 firefight with Mexican gunmen that killed US Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010 and spawned congressional probes of a botched government gun-smuggling investigation.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured with his family, has caused tension in the Tory party after saying he believes the abortion limit should be halved to 12 weeks . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt was embroiled in a major row last night after controversially backing a reduction in the abortion time limit from 24 weeks to just 12 weeks. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) described Hunt’s comments as ‘insulting to women’ and said such a policy would cause serious harm. The Prime Minister and the Department of Health were forced to distance themselves from Mr Hunt’s views – aired just weeks after his appointment in the Cabinet reshuffle – and insisted that there were no plans to change the current policy on abortion. However, David Cameron indicated that he supported a ‘modest reduction’ in the current limit and Home Secretary Theresa May also revealed her support for the limit to be reduced to 20 weeks. But last night Mr Cameron said he did not agree with Mr Hunt. ‘He is a Member of Parliament, he is absolutely entitled to hold an individual view, a view of conscience and on this issue all Members of Parliament – Prime Ministers, Health Secretaries, everybody – has to vote according to their consciences,’ he said. ‘But people need to know the Government has got no plans to bring forward any legislation in this area and any vote that does happen will be a free vote.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘I personally have voted for a modest reduction from the current limit of 24 weeks because I think there are some medical arguments for that.’ Mr Hunt was forced to clarify his views yesterday after failing to acknowledge medical abortions, when women choose to end a pregnancy after discovering severe foetal abnormalities. Various medical conditions are often picked up only at the 12-week or 20-week scans and Mr Hunt’s failure to recognise this led to accusations that he was ‘out of touch’ with women’s health issues. But a spokeswoman for the Health Secretary said: ‘He is in favour of abortions for medical reasons. So the accusation that a 12-week limit would curtail testing for conditions like Down’s Syndrome is simply not true. ‘He is talking about abortions for social reasons after 12 weeks.’ Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured two years ago with his wife Samantha and their newborn baby daughter Florence, says there are no plans to change the law on abortion . Mr Hunt made his comments in his first major interview since accepting the health brief in July. He originally voted in favour of halving the termination limit during a Commons vote in 2008 as a member of the Shadow Cabinet. ‘Everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is, and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it,’ he said. ‘It’s just my view about that incredibly difficult question about the moment that we should deem life to start. I don’t think the reason I have that view is for religious reasons.’ Home Secretary Theresa May has also revealed her support to modestly reduce the abortion limit from 24 to 20 weeks . Mr Hunt’s comments were widely condemned. Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary and Minister for Women & Equalities, said: ‘Everyone has personal views but as Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt has a responsibility to lead Government policy on women’s health. ‘Perhaps the most chilling part of his interview is the claim that 12 weeks is based on evidence when it undoubtedly is not. David Cameron needs to make sure his Health Secretary doesn’t distort medical evidence and does not impose his own view on women about their health.’ Diane Abbott, Labour’s Shadow Public Health Minister, accused Ministers of ‘playing politics with people’s lives’ and insisted there was no justification for a reduction in the present limit. Meanwhile, Tory MP Dr Sarah Woollaston tweeted: ‘Profoundly disagree with Hunt on lowering abortion limit; would restrict access to safe abortion for most vulnerable who present late.’ RCOG spokeswoman Dr Kate Guthrie said: ‘The comments made by Jeremy Hunt politicise the debate around the abortion time limit and do not put women at the centre of their care. Reducing the time limit to  12 weeks would severely limit women’s choice at an extremely difficult time in their life.’ According to official figures, there were 189,931 abortions in 2011, only a slight increase since 2010. More than 90 per cent took place before 13 weeks and just eight per cent were carried out between  12 weeks and 24 weeks. Of those, 2,307 were carried out because of a risk the child would be born disabled. Those who argue for a reduction in the limit say there is evidence that a child born at 20 weeks could survive in hospital.","Health Secretary's view described as 'insulting' by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists .

An Ohio man charged in the killing of a woman found covered in burns and wailing in pain by the side of a rural road has pleaded not guilty, one week after similar pleas by two other women charged. LaFonse D. Dixon Jr., 33, of Canton, pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated arson and conspiracy charges on Wednesday in Muskingum County court. On Aug. 26, a driver found 29-year-old Celeste Fronsman laying by a road near Zanesville in eastern Ohio appearing so badly burned the motorist didn't even know if she was human. Plea: LaFonse Dixon pleaded not guilty to murder and rape of a woman found naked and burned on the side of a road with his attorney claiming he was never at the scene of the crime . Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and covered in burns . Fronsman had been raped and burned over 80 per cent of her body while found wearing a strap around her neck. She died two days later at a Columbus hospital having suffered second, third and fourth degree burns. Dixon's attorney said her client says he didn't do it and wasn't there. Two women, Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, also have pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated arson charges. If convicted, Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, and Monica Jean Washington, 24, would be eligible for the death penalty. Police have yet to explain why they believe these three people were involved or what, if any, relation they have to the victim. 'It's just too sensitive a case right now to divulge any information,' Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz told The Columbus Dispatch. The only facts known about the three suspects is that they- as well as the victim- have a long list of prior offenses. Culberson, . who was the first to be arrested, has at least six prior charges to her . name in the last two years. Those charges include soliciting for . prostitution, theft and burglary. Others involved: From left, Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, also have pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated arson charges . Appearance: Culberson is seen in court during her plea hearing wiping her eyes while potentially facing the death penalty . Facing death: Monica J. Washington, also charged with aggravated murder with two death penalty specifications appeared as well in court last week while pleading not guilty . In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail. As for the newly-arrested suspects, Washington was arrested twice for disorderly conduct, and Dixon has drug possession, felony endangerment of children. Police records received by MailOnline show that Ms Fronsman had an extensive criminal history, including a rap sheet with 25 arrests over the past nine years. Since 2003, she was arrested for a plethora of crimes including prostitution, drug possession and five counts of domestic violence. Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia. Desolate: She was found by a truck driver on this stretch of Keyes Road in Muskingum County . Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them. 'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold. Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009. 'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.' Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators . Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly. The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning. 'This is a vicious animal. They ought to be taken off the street and put away,' he said. The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite. 'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said. 'I can't imagine the pain that this lady went through.'","Celeste Fronsman, 29, died shortly after being taken to hospital .

On a push to expose his softer side, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Tuesday revealed his intimate connection to the attack last month in eastern Libya that left four Americans dead. Almost a month after the deadly attack on the U.S. embassy, Romney announced that he personally knew Glen A. Doherty, one of the two Navy SEALs who was killed by attackers. Republicans, including Romney, have cited the attack to criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy. The attack also was the centerpiece of Romney's high-profile, foreign policy speech Monday at the Virginia Military Institute. Personal connection: Glen Doherty (left) was one of the Navy SEALs killed in the September 11 Libyan embassy attack, and Mitt Romney revealed today that he met the former SEAL in either 2009 or 2010 . Close ties? Romney waited a day to share his ties to the events in Libya, telling his story at a rally in Iowa on Tuesday, one of a handful of battleground states . Romney, pictured at a campaign event in Cuyahoga Falls, Iowa, on Tuesday, talked about a chance encounter with the fallen Marine at a Christmas party . But Romney waited a day to share his ties to the events in Libya, telling his story at a rally in Iowa, one of a handful of battleground states where he has been getting personal to help persuade undecided voters to support him. The story begins with a chance encounter at a Christmas party in southern California in 2009 or 2010. He couldn't be sure which. On a blustery day on an Iowa cornfield, Romney explained that he had gotten a flier at his home in southern California for a neighborhood Christmas party. He hadn't planned on going but, after noticing a party getting started at a house almost across the street, he and his wife changed their minds and decided to pop over. Killed in action: Doherty was 42 years old when he died after the coordinated attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya . It wasn't until after dinner that they realized they were at the wrong house. 'Turns out, this wasn't the neighborhood party. This was a family having a party with their friends,' Romney said as his audience laughed. 'We were a little embarrassed but they treated us well nonetheless and I got to meet some really interesting people.' Then the story turns serious, as has become the custom in Romney's campaign speeches in recent days. At rallies in Florida, Virginia and now Iowa, he has swapped the tales of hard-working entrepreneurs that had filled his speeches for months in favor of anecdotes about people in his life who have died. He talks about a 14-year-old leukemia patient, a quadriplegic classmate and an American soldier killed last year in Afghanistan. Then there is Doherty, the former Navy SEAL Romney met at a party he wasn't supposed to attend. Both were from Massachusetts. Both enjoyed skiing. And Doherty, who was 42 at the time of his death, talked about his work in the Middle East for a private security company after he finished his tour of duty as a Navy SEAL. 'You can imagine how I felt when I found out that he was one of the two former Navy SEALs killed in Benghazi on September 11,' Romney said in Iowa, pausing to stay composed. 'It touched me obviously as I recognized this young man that I thought was so impressive had lost his life in his service of his fellow men and women.' Misstep: The attack in Benghazi initially created a political headache for Romney, whose campaign issued a statement condemning the U.S. response before the severity of the violence was known . Also killed were U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, diplomat Sean Smith, Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods, another former Navy SEAL. The attack in Benghazi initially created a political headache for Romney, whose campaign issued a statement condemning the U.S. response before the severity of the violence was known. Romney was widely criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for trying to gain politically from the loss of four American lives. Softening image: Romney told an audience in Iowa about the story of his run-in at a Christmas party in California . Now, considering his personal connection to one of the victims, it is even more surprising that though he was quick to rebuke Obama but so slow to show that he had a vested interest in the actions at the embassy. In recent weeks, Obama's critics have questioned the administration's handling of the situation. Officials initially blamed what happened on a spontaneous protest they said was sparked by reaction to an anti-Islamic video that ridiculed the Prophet Muhammad and ignited mob protests at U.S. diplomatic posts across the Middle East and in North Africa. The administration later said what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack carried out by al Qaeda-linked militants. In the foreign policy speech Monday, Romney returned again and again to Benghazi. 'I want to be very clear: The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out - no one else,' he said. Critical timing: Initially after the attacks, Romney criticized Obama's reaction to the deaths but refrained from telling the personal story until Tuesday . 'But it is the responsibility of our president to use America's great power to shape history - not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events,' he said. ‘Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.' His tone Tuesday in Iowa was very different. Romney said he learned that Doherty was in another building across town when he and his colleagues found out the consulate was under attack. 'They went there. They didn't hunker down where they were in safety. They rushed there to go help,' Romney said. 'This is the American way. We go where there's trouble. We go where we're needed. And right now we are needed. Right now the American people need us.'","Mitt Romney met former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty years before he was killed in the attack on the U.S. embassy in Libya .

A family is fighting a bitter war over the £4million fortune of a ‘selfish’ property and restaurant tycoon who was said to have used prostitutes and once threw a dog off a cliff in front of his weeping relatives . Piero Curati, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died aged 81 in 2007 - a year after his wife Emilia - and his sister Carmen Curati, 90, has been at war with his niece and nephew ever since over the money. He was ‘a selfish, demanding, controlling man, who could explode with demonstrations of extreme cruelty’ as well as a ‘philanderer’ who used prostitutes, his niece Sylvana Perdoni told a court. Previous win: If Piero Curati's 1980 will was valid on his death, then his nephew Roberto Perdoni (left) and niece Sylvano Perdoni (right) will inherit his wealth in England, valued at £1.8million after payment of inheritance tax . Central to the dispute are two wills he signed in 1980 and 1994 – the first in England and the other in Italy, his birth country. If the latter will replaced the earlier, Mrs Curati will inherit all his global assets. However, if the 1980 will was valid on his death, then his niece and nephew, Sylvano and Roberto Perdoni, will inherit all his wealth in England, valued at £1.8million after payment of inheritance tax. Sylvana, of Chiswick, west London, and Roberto, of Mill Hill, north-west London, last year won a High Court debate, but Mrs Curati - their aunt - now wants the Court of Appeal to reverse that decision. This would effectively disinherit the Perdoni duo. Mrs Curati insisted that her brother never thought of himself as British, despite moving to this country to make his fortune in the 1950s. She added that he continued to speak the native dialect of Carpaneto fluently and had intended his Italian will to revoke his English one. Her barrister Robert Grierson argued he may have forgotten about his older English will and, had he remembered it, would have wanted it ‘obliterated’ with his niece and nephew’s inheritance rights. Battle: Sylvana, of Chiswick, west London, and Roberto, of Mill Hill, north-west London, last year won a High Court debate, but Carmen Curati - their aunt - now wants the Court of Appeal (pictured) to reverse that decision . During the trial of the case, Ms Perdoni told the court of his character: ‘It was well known by the family including (his wife) Emilia that Piero went with prostitutes and that he was a philanderer. ‘Throughout my life Piero always behaved like a big spoilt kid. If he didn’t get his way he would sulk terribly and his mood would darken so much it was almost unbearable. 'It was well known by the family including (his wife) Emilia that Piero went with prostitutes and that he was a philanderer. Throughout my life Piero always behaved like a big spoilt kid' Sylvana Perdoni, Piero Curati's niece . ‘I recall one evening he was sulking about something. He grabbed the small dog that used to come to the kitchen step of the family holiday villa in Italy for scraps. ‘I remember seeing him pick up the dog, throwing it into a black bin liner then throwing it into the boot of his car. ‘Then with full knowledge that my mother, aunt, Roberto and I were watching horrified from the balcony, he drove down the drive to the end of the twisting road and he threw the bag over the cliff edge. I remember my mother and my aunt crying because of what he had done.' She continued: ‘Despite his deplorable and totally abhorrent behaviour, and his hateful character, Emilia and Piero loved each other and I believe one could not live without the other. Piero often spoke of his home being wherever my aunt was. My aunt always viewed England as her home. 'I remember seeing him pick up the dog, throwing it into a black bin liner then throwing it into the boot of his car. Then he drove down the drive to the end of the twisting road and he threw the bag over the cliff edge' Ms Perdoni . ‘Piero always referred to England as his home and never spoke of wanting to live in Italy...I know from what he said that Piero considered himself British.’ Mr Justice Sales ruled last year that English, not Italian, law applied to the case because Mr Curati, despite his Italian roots, ‘regarded England as his home and considered himself to be British’. ‘I have reached the conclusion that the 1994 will did not wholly revoke the 1980 will,’ he concluded. 'The material part of the 1980 will, which leaves the English estate of the deceased to his niece and nephew, continues to be valid and must now be carried into effect.’ Lords Justice Pill, Munby and Tomlinson have now reserved their judgment at the Court of Appeal on Mrs Curati’s case against that ruling and will give their decision at a later date.","Italian Piero Curati, of Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, died aged 81 in 2007 .

Hundreds of miners are set to lose their jobs by Christmas as one of Britain's few remaining coal mines looks set to close. The 540 workers at Maltby pit, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been given 90 day 'potential redundancy' notices by its owners. Hargreaves Services blames serious geological problems for the closure of the 100-year-old pit, which he says makes mining there dangerous. Closure: Maltby colliery in South Yorkshire, where 540 redundancies have been announced . There are only around five mines like this one left in the UK - around 30 years ago there were more than 150. Maltby had been producing more than a million tonnes of coal a year, much of it going to Drax, Europe's largest coal fired power plants. Last month unusually high levels of water, oil and gas were found at the site and the owners warned about the possible closure. Painful: Maltby is one of Britain's few remaining mines and the local community has expressed its sorrow at the decision . Difficult: More than 500 miners at the colliery could lose their jobs by Christmas . Mike O'Sullivan, from Hargreaves Services, said: 'We have got reports that will be coming to us in a number of weeks which will advise us on all the various risk profiles associated with the geological problems and it's only when our board is in full possession of all the data that any decision will be properly made.' Daw Mill, West Midlands . Harworth, Nottinghamshire . Kellingley, Yorkshire . Maltby, Yorkshire . Thoresby, Nottinghamshire . A statement from the company added: 'Initiating this process is considered to be . prudent business practice and does not indicate that a decision on the . future of Maltby has been taken. The relevant Government department is . being notified. 'The Board of Hargreaves still expects to receive reports later in . October that will advise on the geological, financial and health and . safety risks. The decision by the Board on the future of the colliery . will be based on the conclusions of these reports.' Local people are distressed at the news. Chairman of Maltby Town Council John Carrat said : 'I'm absolutely gutted. I've heard this news and I can't believe they're going to close the colliery. 'When Hargreaves had a similar problem three years ago they had faith in the workforce to get through, and since Hargreaves took over at Maltby Colliery they've made a profit every year. 'Last year they made £34m worth of profit, so I think it's time Hargreaves gave the workforce down at Maltby Colliery some support.' As owners of the historic Maltby pit issued redundancy notices to its . 540 miners today, the South Yorkshire colliery is one in a very long line to . close in recent years. The last three decades have seen an incredible decline in numbers, with hundreds of mines running before the infamous miners' strike of the 1980s. Despite union leaders claiming victory and saving some mines, the industrial action was followed by pit closure after pit closure. Ten deaths were linked to the strike: six picketers, three . teenagers searching for coal, and a taxi driver taking a non-striking . miner to work. After the year-long action ended some 156 alone have been shut, and in 1985 at least 25 were closed including Cortonwood - the Yorkshire pit where the strike actually began (pictured above right) Within seven years nearly a hundred had gone forever and now there are only around 5 deep pits with a small number of shallow mines. Many closed were filled with concrete, turned into museums or left because owners believed that they could be re-opened - but most never did. Engineer Bob Matthews who was the last person out of Cotgrave colliery in Nottinghamshire when it closed in 1993 said simply: 'When a pit is shut it's shut for good. 'It was a bit sad being the last men out of there but the worst part was when the time came to switch off the fans,' he told the BBC. 'Everything just fell silent and that's when I knew it was absolutely dead.'","Maltby pit in South Yorkshire produces a million tonnes a year but could shut by Christmas .

A lack of oxygen from underdeveloped lungs is to blame for the death of an eight-day old giant panda at the Smithsonian's National Zoo last month. The new details into the 4-ounce cub's unexpected death were revealed from a necropsy on Thursday finding the infant having also suffered liver necrosis, or the death of liver cells, according to the National Zoo's Chief veterinarian Suzan Murray at a news conference. The cub, believed to have been a girl and described as no bigger than a stick of butter, was also found with fluid in her abdomen and her liver hard in places. Scroll down for video . Improving: National Park Zookeepers said today that Mei Xiang, pictured sunbathing, is showing much improvement after hiding away while mourning the loss of her baby . Can you see her? After her baby's birth Mei Xiang clutched her tiny cub so tight to her that even zookeepers had a hard time spotting her on this camera . After the panda mother's previous five failed pregnancies the cub's death came as an enormous heartbreak to her zookeepers in Washington, D.C. Seen cradling a familiar toy in her arms for days following, however, mother Mei Xiang was especially devastated. Today the zoo reports Mei Xiang being 'almost completely back to her old self' and no longer with her then-treasured toy. She is also venturing out of her den and eating well. 'Mei is choosing to go outside in the mornings. In the afternoons she can usually be found napping on her indoor rockwork. Mei’s appetite has also returned, and she is eating almost all of her bamboo and all of her leaf eater biscuits and produce,' the zoo reported. The zoo also offered a glimpse of Mei Xiang in her yard on Thursday. Heartache: The 14-year-old mother, seen sleeping, had experienced five failed pregnancies before abruptly losing her last cub . Previous mom: Mei Xiang is seen in December of 2005 with her first cub Tai Shan who as per agreement with China was sent to them after his birth . Father: The father of Mei Xiang's cub, Tian Tian is also seen about their enclosure on Thursday while enjoying a frozen fruit treat . The cub, which was not named, was born on Sept. 16 and came as an enormous surprise because it hadn't been clear whether 14-year-old Mei Xiang, considered middle-aged for a panda, was still fertile. Her curious behaviour seen nesting and eventually cuddling her rubber ‘kong’ toy gradually tipped off her keepers. When the cub was born at 10.45pm on . September 16, she cast the toy aside and held her tiny baby tight in her . paws so that it would be warm and have easy access to her milk. She . kept the cub so tight to her chest that zookeepers were scarcely able . to catch a glimpse of the newborn from the camera inside the panda den. Zookeepers recorded the purrs and 'honks' of the contented newborn and took the noises as confirmation that she was healthy. Zoo keepers left the pair alone, hoping Mei Xiang could raise the cub without interference. No trauma: Staff of the National Zoo held a press conference on Thursday to report the results of the cub's necropsy that included no signs of internal or external trauma to the baby . Park's handling: Parts of the park were seen closed after the birth of the baby panda though they announced all except Mei Xiang's den open to the public's view . However, at 8.53am on Sunday, something went horribly wrong. It was the last time the veterinarians heard a peep from the cub. By 9.17am Mei Xiang began uttering distress howls. Her disturbed cries alerted zookeepers that something terrible had happened. They . stood behind iron bars in the panda paddock and distracted Mei Xiang with honey, . while other staffers used to stick to slid the cub away from her. After an hour, they had the lifeless cub in their hands and tried to perform emergency resuscitation, but it was no use. The top exotic animal veterinarians in the country were unable to revive the cub. With her cub gone, Mei Xiang returned to her familiar toy for comfort. Soon after she lost the cub, she began clutching it again, just as she had before the baby was born. 'Most of her behavior has gone back to where she was before the panda cub was born, but she is still cradling this toy,' National Zoo spokeswoman Emily Grebenstein told MailOnline after the cub's death. Watch: Dennis Kelly, the zoo's director, monitor's Mei via the panda cam . Yummy: Mei is rewarded with honey water when she participates in an ultrasound earlier in September . She said she found milk in the cub's digestive tract, meaning she had been successfully nursing from her mother before her death. 'We’d all felt that Mei Xiang had been a very good mother and had been very gentle with the cub, and indeed, that turns out to be the case,' Dr Murray said after finding milk in the cub's digestive track, meaning she had been successfully nursing before her death. The cub was also found without any signs of internal or external trauma. The seasoned animal surgeon, and mother of three, nearly broke down as she described the dead newborn. 'The cub was just beautiful. Beautiful little body. Beautiful face, with the markings just beginning to show around the eye. Couldn’t have been more beautiful,' she said. The tragedy is a familiar one for the National Zoo. Out of eight giant panda cubs born since the zoo began its breeding program in the 1970s, only one has survived to maturity. The rest died within a few days of being born. Mei Xiang and Tian Tian are the National Zoo's second pair of pandas. They are in the United States on loan from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province until December of 2015. The 14-year-old mother has given birth twice at the National Zoo. In 2005, offspring Tai Shan became the first giant panda cub to survive more than a few days at the zoo. He was sent to China, as per the zoo's agreement with the Chinese government.","Six-day old giant panda cub had underdeveloped lungs, liver necrosis and fluid in her abdomen .

One member of the Russian punk band Pussy Riot has had her conviction overturned in an appeal court in Moscow today. Yekaterina Samutsevich, 30, will be released immediately whilst Nadezdha Tolonnikova, 22, and Maria Alyokhina, 24, remain in custody. Judges at Moscow City Court ruled that as Ms Samutsevich had been thrown out of the cathedral before she was able to get her guitar out of its case, she was innocent. Scroll down for video . One free: Pussy Rioter Yekaterina Samutsevich is pictured leaving Moscow City Court after her sentence was suspended earlier today . The . three women were convicted of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred . in August this year after they performed a ‘punk prayer’ in the Russian . capital’s main Orthodox cathedral imploring the Virgin Mary to rid . Russia of Putin. Earlier Ms Tolonnikova had pleaded with the judges to have all their two-year sentences overturned. Speaking from inside their glass . cage the mother-of-one said: ‘We cannot admit to charges of religious hatred. Please . overturn the conviction.’ Pussy . Riot supporters said earlier that the women were . unlikely to win their appeal against their jail terms Vladimir Putin spoke out against them, saying they got what they deserved. Smiling again: The judges ruled that as Ms Samutsevich did not get a chance to get her guitar out of its case, she was not guilty of hooliganism motivated by religious hatred . Released: As Samutsevich get in a car with her relatives, she can look forward to freedom whilst the other two members will serve their sentence at a penal colony . Relatives and lawyers for the trio . complained of political interference, saying that . Putin's comments on the case in an interview marking his 60th . birthday this weekend, had compromised the appeal. In the interview, which aired on Sunday, . President Putin defended the sentence. He said: ‘It is right that they were arrested . and it was right that the court took this decision because you cannot . undermine the fundamental morals and values to destroy the country’. Despite . support from Western governments including the U.S. president Barack . Obama, and superstars like Madonna and Sting condemning the sentences, a poll showed that a majority of Russians agree with President Putin. Two left: Whilst Yekaterina Samutsevich's prison sentence was suspended, Maria Alyokhina, centre, and Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, right, are to remain in prison and serve their two-year sentences . An . opinion poll conducted by the independent Levada . centre found 35 per cent of Russians believe the two-year sentences were . appropriate, while 34 per cent said they were too lenient and only 14 . per cent said they were excessive. The . three women were brought to Moscow City Court and led into a metal and . plexiglass cage where they sat facing a three-judge panel and stood to . answer introductory questions from the senior judge. The other two members cheered and . hugged their band-mate as the three-judge panel announced that Ms . Samutsevich's sentence was suspended. Kremlin opponents have said the jail terms . were part of a clampdown on dissent that has produced restrictive laws . and criminal cases against critics of Putin since he began his six-year . term in May. Appeal: The three members of punk-rock band Pussy Riot sit in a glass-walled cage in the court room before the beginning of the hearing at the Moscow City Court this morning . But sympathy . for Pussy Riot is limited in Russia, where Patriarch Kirill has cast the . protest as part of an attack meant to curb the church's post-Soviet . revival in a nation where most people are Russian Orthodox. Parliament . is considering legislation stiffening punishment for offending . religious feelings and Putin has warned that such offences - against . Christians, Muslims or other believers in diverse Russia - could incite . violence. Prime Minister . Dmitry Medvedev said last month that they have already served enough . time, while the Russian Orthodox Church has said they should repent if . they want forgiveness. The . appeal hearing in the Moscow City Court began on October 1 but was . quickly adjourned after Samutsevich dismissed her lawyers, citing . unspecified differences of opinion on the case.

At 3,700 yards (3,400m) up, Mr Liesheng admitted defeat and the group were rescued by park rangers, who gave them warm clothes and medical treatment.

Super-strict: He Lieshing insists that his extreme challenges will help his son Duoduo, who was born premature, to toughen up .

Eagle Dad has previously said that because his son was born several months premature he had to make him undergo tough tests of physical and mental endurance to build up his strength. When the video of the unhappy child shivering in a snowy New York appeared on YouTube at the start of this year, outraged viewers demanded that Duoduo be taken into care. His mother could also be heard in the footage, encouraging the boy to carry on as he begged for a hug.

The man suspected of fatally slashing a 25-year-old youth soccer coach in one of New York City's busiest neighborhoods has fled to Mexico, after bogus reports that police had a suspect in custody. The suspect has been identified by investigators as Orlando Orea or Orlando Gutierrez, who fled on an Aero Mexico flight bound for Mexico City on Tuesday, two days after the murder. He is accused of stabbing Michael Jones six times and savagely hacking off one of his ears early Sunday morning before leaving him to bleed to death. Scroll down for video . Devoted: Mike Jones, 25, called his girlfriend Bryeanna Murphy, 23, several times the night he was killed . It had previously been mistakenly reported that a 'person of interest' in the case was in police custody. On the night he was killed, Mr Jones had been out with his girlfriend, Bryeanna Murphy, 23, from Mamaroneck, NY, whose father described to MailOnline her devastation at her boyfriend's death. The beloved youth soccer coach from Liverpool, England, spoke with his girlfriend Murphy, 23, on the phone just minutes before he was attacked. Tim Murphy told MailOnline: 'She's devastated. She can't believe it has happened.' Long term: Miss Murphy had been dating Mr Jones for about six months . He described Mr Jones, who had been dating his daughter for six months, as 'a real gentleman.' He added: ' He was a lovely guy. Good mannered, good fun, just the kind of guy you'd want your daughter to go out with.' Mr Murphy said that his daughter last heard from Mr Jones at midnight. She was home by 2am and went to sleep. 'She didn't know anything was wrong,' he said. On Sunday morning, police contacted a mutual friend of the couple, who had been one of the last dialled numbers on Mr Jones' phone. The friend was told to come to a police station and she was informed about the tragedy. She then contacted Miss Murphy. Mr Murphy said that the family has been in email contact with Mr Jones' relatives back in England. He said: 'We expressed to them our sincere condolences. We wanted to let them know we are thinking of them,' he said. The family is planning to go to a memorial service to be held on Wednesday in White Plains. Some members of Mr Jones's family, who are being flown over by the Red Bulls, are expected to attend. Mr Murphy added: 'I hope they catch this guy and get him off the streets.' After getting the suspect's name, the . NYPD tried to put the suspect on a no-fly list on Tuesday afternoon, but it . was too late to stop him. The New York Post reported that the suspect was identified by a bartender near the scene of the murder, who described Orea as a regular. Killer: Jones' murderer is seen calmly walking away after hacking the beloved soccer coach to death . The revelation came as it emerged . that Mr Jones may have been brutally stabbed to death in Greenwich Village in a . tragic case of mistaken identity. Detectives . are looking into a fight earlier in the evening that Mr Jones' suspected killer had over a woman he met in a bar earlier that night, . the Post reported. Beloved: Mr Jones was well-liked by the young players he mentored as a coach in the Red Bulls' Westchester youth league . Police believe Mr Jones had nothing . to do with the woman or the fight, but was instead mistaken for the . murder suspect's nightclub adversary. Officers have ruled out robbery, since Mr Jones' wallet and iPhone were still with him. Surveillance video shows Mr Jones next to his pony-tailed killer about 4.15am on Sunday on West 14th Street, according to the Post. The two men appear to exchange words . and begin to argue. The suspect suddenly pushes Mr Jones against a . building and pulls out a knife. A medical examiner ruled that Mr Jones died of stab wound to his chest and stomach, including a puncture in his heart. Mr Jones and his girlfriend spent out together on Saturday night in the East Village visiting a friend's apartment. He left Miss Murphy about 11.30pm to hit the town at several upscale nightclubs with other friends.

The 66-year-old says all the best work goes to Dame Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Maggie Smith, leaving little for anyone else of her age. Miss Hodge, who plays Miranda Hart’s mother Penny in the hit comedy series Miranda, told an audience at Cheltenham Literature Festival that the lack of roles for older women was a ‘hot topic’ in showbusiness. ‘It is very difficult for us who are in this age group to talk about it because it makes you sound like an embittered old woman,’ she said. ‘Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave and Maggie Smith are on a level where they will always get work because whatever is on offer will go to them first. ‘They are a band of angels up there who are ascending to heaven and are untouchable. ‘But for everyone else there is not nearly enough representation – but you can’t create it overnight. ‘Even if you asked every playwright in the country to write a play for older women it still wouldn’t be enough. I think it needs to grow, that realisation that there is a whole section of our community which is under represented.’ 'Always get work': Dame Judi Dench (right in James Bond film Casino Royale) and Maggie Smith (left in TV series Downton Abbey) get all the best work 'because whatever is on offer will go to them first', Miss Hodge says . She said she was fortunate she had landed such a good role in Miranda, which was an example of what can be achieved by women in the world of drama. ‘It has broken the mould,’ she said. ‘We have got four very strong roles for women.

Eleven years after their adoptive father was bludgeoned to death by their mother's lover in the Hamptons, the Ammon twins have spoken out for their first time about the torment they endured. In a new documentary, Greg and Alexa Ammon have revealed the moment they learned of the death of their multimillionaire financier father, Ted, and how they were wooed by the man who killed him. 'We loved the guy who killed our father,' Greg, now 22, says of Danny Pelosi, who is serving life in prison for the murder. 'But Danny was and still is a pure psychopath.' Three years after the murder, the twins, who had been adopted by the couple from a Ukrainian orphanage, were left without parents for a second time when their mother died from breast cancer. Scroll down for video . Moving on: Adopted twins Greg and Alexa Ammon, now 22, have made a documentary revealing the torment they suffered following the murder of their father by their mother's lover in 2001 . In the film, which premiered at the East . Hampton Cinema on Friday, they revisit these painful years and also return to their hometown in . the Ukraine to meet their long-lost biological . family. There, they learn that their biological mother's life was also plagued with problems. She prostituted herself to be able to fund her alcoholism and suffered with a mental illness. The revelations come more than a decade after Ted Ammon's murder and the sordid affair between his wife and Pelosi played out in the pages of newspapers and a made-for-television movie. Ammon, 52, was found naked and . bludgeoned to death in the bedroom of his home on October 22, 2001, as he fought a bitter divorce and custody . battle with his estranged wife, Generosa. The twins, who were 11 at the time, recalled the moment they learned of his death in their documentary, 59 Middle Lane. Unhappy families: The twins are pictured with their adoptive father Ted and mother Generosa . Saved: The children had been adopted by the wealthy couple from an orphanage in the Ukraine . 'You wake up in the morning, get dressed . like a normal day and Aunt Sandi comes in, and Aunt Sandi, of course, . lives in Alabama, and we are like why are you here,' Greg recalled. Murdered: But in October 2001, Ted Ammon was found bludgeoned to death at their Hamptons home . At the time of his death, the Ammons had not finalised their divorce and Ted had yet to re-write his will, leaving his estranged wife with half of his fortune, estimated to be around $80 million. In the film, which was directed by Greg, they reveal they are making the documentary for closure. 'I feel like I want to put an end to all the horrible things that happened,' he says. 'Bringing the film back to the Hamptons . and premiering it in the same theater I went to as a kid will be very . emotional and, hopefully, therapeutic,' he added to The East Hampton Press . before it opened. 'I wanted to humanize [my parents], give them a face through my eyes. Although I knew I couldn’t shy away from what happened, I wanted the focus to be on what truly mattered; the incredible gift my parents gave Alexa and I when they adopted us.' They revisit the family home, which they still own, in the film, and recall the months of emotional abuse from their mother as their parents went through their divorce. She would make them steal documents . from their father and then allow them to watch television as a reward. But if they said they had had fun with him, they would be sent directly . to their room. 'I remember Mom, but all I remember are the bad things,' Greg says in the film. Three . months after Ted Ammon was murdered, Pelosi divorced his wife and . married Generosa. They lived in Ammon's mansion before moving to . Pelosi's home in Long Island. Scene: In the film, the twins return to the bedroom where he was found after being tortured and killed . Lavish: They still own the mansion in East Hampton where their father was found dead . Emotion: Greg reveals they made the documentary for closure 'to end all the horrible things that happened' Generosa had little time to enjoy her former husband's wealth, however, as she was diagnosed with breast cancer and died in August 2003. The children went to live with their aunt in Alabama. Pelosi, who had been battling for a . part of the fortune left by his late wife, was eventually arrested in . March 2004 and was found guilty of murder. He has maintained that Generosa hired a hit man to kill her husband. He will not be eligible for parole until 2031. When they faced him in court, aged 14, the twins were unforgiving towards the man they once loved. 'I hope you suffer and go through . just as much as my sister and I have,' Greg said at his sentencing, the New York Post reported. 'I just hope God can forgive you, because I certainly won’t.' Roots: They return to the Ukraine, where they learn that their biological mother was a prostitute . Reunion: Greg and Alexa also meet long-lost relatives including three biological siblings . 'It's hard to realise that the person . you loved stabbed you in the back and ruined the rest of your life. You . are a sick man, and I regret every single time I said I loved you.' His sister added: 'Mr. Pelosi might have had a nice time . for the past couple of years spending my parents' money, but that is . over now, and I hope he rots away in prison because he deserves nothing . better.' The bereft twins, who inherited $1 . million each after taxes and attorneys' fees, decide to use the . opportunity of the documentary to find their biological family. Searching . through documents at the mansion, they find papers leading them to the . orphanage in the Ukraine, from where they were adopted as malnourished . children. They learn that they were the result of a one-night tryst between their mother and a soldier. The government then took them from their mother as she struggled with alcoholism and mental problems. Killer: Daniel Pelosi was arrested for the murder in 2004 and will not be eligible for parole until 2031. He married Generosa Ammon three months after the death of her husband . She was also a prostitute, who begged for money on the streets to buy alcohol. She died in 2004 and left behind a total of eight children, some of whom went to the same orphanage as the twins. The documentary shows them meeting their three half siblings and speaking to another brother on the phone in Moscow. 'Ultimately, that story in the . Ukraine is very similar to our story in America,' Greg told The East . Hampton Press. 'When I’m speaking about our birth mother, I’m speaking . about my adopted mother, too. I try to tell both of their stories.' The film has already premiered at the . East Hamptons movie theatre and is scheduled to be shown again at Jazz . at Lincoln Center, of which Ammon had been a longtime supporter.

New cases are appearing every hour in a 'rapidly evolving outbreak' of rare fungal meningitis that has now sickened 91 people across nine U.S. states and left seven dead. The potential scope of the meningitis outbreak, linked to spinal steroid injections, widened dramatically as health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk. The outbreak of the disease, known as aspergillus meningitis, is caused by a fungus found in a spinal steroid injections, a fairly common treatment used to relieve back pain, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Outbreak: Meningitis cases have been reported inTennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio sickening 91 people . The latest fatalities were reported . in Michigan on Saturday, though the Michigan Department of Community . Health said they would not provide more information on the two deaths . until after the weekend. The . fifth victim, Diana Reed, died on Wednesday afternoon at St Thomas . Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee, surrounded by family members. Mrs . Reed, 56, is one of thousands of patients recently treated in Tennessee . hospitals for back pain with a steroid epidural - a fairly typical . treatment. But since then a tainted batch of steroids released across . the U.S. has been linked to dozens of cases of fungal meningitis. Beware: Health officials warned that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of patients who received steroid back injections in 23 states could be at risk (stock photo) Mrs Reed, of Brentwood, Tennessee, was the fifth person to succumb to the infection. A blog written by a close friend of . Reed's family, Brandon Scott Thomas, characterized her as 'hilarious, . beautiful, and full of life' and praised her for carrying for husband . Wayne Reed after he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - . more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease - almost 20 years ago. 'Over the course of the last week she has gone from someone brimming with life to someone in the process of passing from this life to the next,' wrote. The caretaker: Diana Reed dedicated her life to helping underprivileged children before a routine medical procedure infected her with a rare fungal meningitis . 'Her brain couldn't take the stress. After a series of strokes they moved her to hospice care. Wayne, one of . the longest surviving patients with ALS, there by her side.' Reed served on the board of her husband's namesake child care organization, the Wayne Reed Christian Child Care Center. The injectable steroids responsible . for Reed's death were produced by New England Compounding Center, a . specialized pharmacy in Framingham, Massachusetts. The company has shut . down operations, recalled all its products, and said it is working with . regulators to identify the source of the infection. Source: The outbreak of the deadly form of meningitis was traced to St Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee . It is not clear how many patients received tainted injections, or even whether everyone who got one will get sick. So far, 91 people in nine states - Tennessee, Virginia, Maryland, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota and Ohio - have contracted fungal meningitis, and seven have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In an alarming indication that the outbreak . could get a lot bigger, Massachusetts health officials said the pharmacy . involved, the New England Compounding Center of Framingham, has . recalled three lots consisting of a total of 17,676 single-dose vials of . the steroid, preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate. No solicitors: Specialized pharmacy New England Compounding Center has hidden from the public as its steroids are linked to multiple deaths and critical infections . An unknown number of those vials reached 75 clinics and other facilities in 23 states between July and September, federal health officials said. Several hundred of the vials, maybe more, have been returned unused, one Massachusetts official said. However many other vials were used. At one clinic in Evansville, Indiana, more than 500 patients got shots from the suspect lots, officials said. At two clinics in Tennessee, more than 900 patients received them. The incubation period before symptoms appear is 28 days, and its almost certain more cases will be reported say health officials, who are now calling this a national health crisis. Tennessee: The initial outbreak site with a suspected 16 cases, two of whom are in critical condition. Three others have already died. North Carolina: The second state to report infection with one case found at an unidentified clinic. Florida: Only two cases have been reported but health officials fear more may come forward. Virginia: One person has died from fungal meningitis and three more cases are still being treated. Maryland: Seven medical clinics in Maryland pulled their stock of a questionable steroid after one person died and two more cases were reported. Indiana: At least five people in Indiana are sick with fungal meningitis, with no fatalities yet reported . Michigan: There are at least eight confirmed cases of meningitis in Michigan, including two deaths . Minnesota: Fungal meningitis has been diagnosed in two women hospitalized in Minnesota . Ohio: Health officials reported Saturday of a 65-year-old man being treated for the meningitis after receiving the steroid . Unlike the more common viral and bacterial meningitis, fungal meningitis is not contagious. It is an inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include a severe headache, nausea, fever, and dizziness. The first patients identified in Tennessee experienced slurred speech, and difficulty walking and urinating. The pharmacy voluntarily recalled three lots of the steroid Methylprednisolone Acetate on September 26 according to the FDA. The drug is primarily used to relieve back pain. The drug was administered to patients in their late 40s to early 80s. Tennessee's S. Thomas Hospital, ground zero for the outbreak with a suspected 15 cases as of Wednesday with two in critical condition, reported having 2,000 vials of the steroid in stock before the threat was discovered. 'Some are doing well and improving. Some are very ill - very, very . seriously ill and may die,' Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan . said. In Tennessee alone roughly 1,000 people were administered the steroid. The link between the injections and the . meningitis was discovered by Tennessee physician April Pettit, who found . the initial cases were all people who'd recently received an epidural. Officials are still investigating how the steroid resulted in fungal meningitis. New England Compounding Center . released a statement promising to work with heath authorities to . discover what happened. But company president and licensed pharmacist . Barry J. Cadden has otherwise dodged interview requests and the company . web site is down. An archived version of the site notes the company is licensed to distribute drugs in every U.S. state. Critical condition: Tennessee health official Dr. David Reagan says the infected are 'very, very seriously ill and may die' New England Compounding Center is among the approximately 3,000 U.S. compounding pharmacies specializing in blending, liquefying, or combining medicines customized for patients unable to swallow tablets, require specific dosages, or who have allergies. Such companies are regulated by the . state boards of pharmacy that license them rather than facing the . broader regulations traditional drug companies deal with. The pharmacy has produced questionable . products before. In 2006, New England Compounding Center was one of . four companies ordered by the the Food and Drug Administration to cease . producing a topical anesthetic cream that was found to cause 'grave . reactions including seizures and irregular heartbeats.' The cream was the cause of two deaths, neither tied directly to New England Compounding Center. Ground zero: The first patients of the fungal meningitis were reported at St. Thomas Hospital which had roughly 2,000 vials of a dangerous steroid on stock . That same year the company was also cited for multiple violations of federal laws and regulations based on a 2004 review of its offices. They were charged with misbranding drugs prescribed for eye treatment, misbranding an anesthetic drug and failing to provide adequate directions for its use, and promoting the use of a cancer drug for an unapproved purpose. An FDA warning letter admonished the company that it was 'distributing an unapproved drug in violation' of federal regulations. In 2010 the company was sued by an Illinois firm that alleged New England Compounding Center illegally hacked its database violating the federal computer computer fraud and abuse act. The case was eventually settled.","Two more deaths have been reported in Michigan, bringing the total death toll to seven .

The 70-year-old music legend was responding to claims by the group’s lead singer Mike Love that he planned to keep touring with the Beach Boys – but without Wilson, Al Jardine and David Marks. Feuding: Brian Wilson (left) says he felt blindsided by a news release from Beach Boys bandmate Mike Love (right) that ended the good vibrations on the band's 50th anniversary tour . Writing in the Los Angeles Times . after Love made the announcement, Wilson said: ‘As far as I know I can’t . be fired – that wouldn’t be cool.’ He insisted he had been ‘blindsided’ by Love’s intention to go back on the road with a streamlined version of . the Californian band. ‘The negativity surrounding all the comments . bummed me out,’ he said. ‘What’s confusing is that by Mike not . wanting or letting Al, David and me tour with the band, it sort of feels . like we’re being fired.’ The creative force behind the Beach . Boys said their 75-date comeback tour that ended at London’s Wembley . Arena on September 28 exceeded his expectations, adding: ‘Mike kept . saying throughout the tour, “The whole is greater than the sum of its . parts”, and both Al and I agree, which made us all think that he wanted . to continue. Reuniting: The surviving founding members of the Beach Boys - Dennis Wilson, David Marks, Mike Love, Carl Wilson, Brian Wilson - are celebrating their 50th anniversary with a 50-date tour and new album . Play nice! Mike Love, David Marks, Brian Wilson, Bruce Arthur Johnston and Al Jardine perform in Central Park as part of Good Morning America's Summer Concert Series in New York in June . Iconic: The group formed in 1961, and produced hits like I Get Around and Good Vibrations . ‘We originally started out with 50 . shows, but the success and the demand kept growing and we obliged. No . one knew in the beginning that this was going to be so rewarding and . popular with our fans. Once we got cooking we were all stoked!’ The anniversary tour included original . members Wilson, Love, Jardine and Marks, who played guitar on the . band’s 1962 debut album Surfin’ Safari. Wilson said it was so successful, they were asked to do even more shows in Britain. Speaking of Love, he said: ‘I do and . always will love him as my cousin and bandmate. At the same time I’m . left wondering why he doesn’t want to continue this great trip we’re on. ‘Al and I want to keep going because we believe we owe it to the music.’ The feud is the latest of many between Wilson and Love. The Beach Boys, who sold 100million . albums after helping to define the California sound of the early . Sixties, were Wilson and his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Love . and Wilson’s friend Al Jardine. Marks covered for Jardine when he left . to attend college. Dennis drowned in a diving accident in 1983 and Carl died from lung cancer in 1998.

A movie fan has told of his delight after discovering a suit belonging to the late Hollywood idol Paul Newman, one of his favourite actors, while rooting around in the basement of his rented apartment. Peter Gamlen, a 23-year-old British illustrator, discovered the blue two-piece stuffed in a trash bag along with other clothes in the Victorian house in Connecticut. When he checked the tailor's tag on the inside of the jacket he was stunned to find the name Paul Newman and the date January 1986. Cool (2nd) hand suit: Peter Gamlen models the suit which belonged to . the late actor Paul Newman which he discovered in the basement of his . rented apartment in Connecticut . Mr Gamlen, who was given permission by his landlord to sift . through previous tenants' belongings, then discovered a . photo of Newman in the pocket of a sports jacket. The suit was by Henry . Stewart, so Mr Gamlen researched the tailor and found an obituary in the New . York Times from 1993 that listed Newman among his clients. Mr Gamlen, who said 'The Hustler' starring Newman is one of his favorite films, began screaming with delight after making the find and immediately called a friend to boast about the discovery. Evidence: As well as the actor's name written inside the suit, Mr . Gamlen also discovered this picture of Newman and three other men in . the pocket of a sports jacket .

'Guess where my legs are!,' he bragged. 'They're in Paul Newman's trousers!' Mr Gamlen described the suit as a two-piece lounge suit with surgeon's cuffs. 'This is incredibly well made,' said Mr Gamlen, who said he was surprised at how well the suit fit. 'The whole cut of this is absolutely beautiful.' Newman, who died in 2008, lived in Westport, about 30 miles from New Haven. Mr Gamlen, who came to the United States for work about a year ago and works in a clothing store, said he believes, at the very least, the suit with the tailor's tag belonged to Newman. 'It's certainly valuable to me in terms of being like an amazing coincidence and also a really beautiful set of clothes that look pretty damn good on me,' he said. Mr Gamlen said he's not sure what he's going to do with the suit. Style: Peter Gamlen poses in the suit he discovered in his basement which once belonged to Paul Newman and (right) the actor pictured in 1987, a year after the suit was made .

'It sounds like it really could have been Paul Newman's suit,' Hill said. She said her parents, who once lived in the building, met Newman at a Democratic fundraiser decades ago, and her late father in law once played tennis with Newman. 'They wouldn't have anything to do with the suit,' she said.

Beer company Heineken is changing the design of its iconic green bottle for the first time since 1946.

The Star Bottle will be available in 12 . oz and 22 oz sizes as before - but it features a taller, thinner shape, giving it a 'more modern and premium look', according to the company. Raise a glass: The instantly-recognisable bottle design has not changed for more than 60 years. The new bottle will be sold nationwide from March 2013. 'The newly-designed Star Bottle allows Heineken to take a huge step forward in the globalisation of the brand', said Colin Westcott-Pitt, Heineken USA VP of marketing. He added: 'The Heineken bottle has gone through a number of progressions but has always maintained its core iconography that has become a symbol of upscale premium beer, and this philosophy will remain the same with the new Star Bottle design.' The company says the 100-year-old recipe for the beer remains the same. The new bottle also features an embossed thumb groove that the company claims improves grip and encourages people to hold the bottle at a lower point, keeping the beer colder.

'Despicable': Kizzy Fawcett, 35, stole money from the vulnerable people she was . supposed to be caring for . A home help stole thousands of pounds from elderly people with memory problems because they would not remember her taking them to the bank to withdraw cash. Kizzy Fawcett, 35, has been described as 'despicable' for stealing money from the vulnerable people she was supposed to be caring for. Her victims, who are all in their 70s, say she has just been given a slap on the wrist after she was spared jail. Detective Constable Rebecca Handley says steps have been taken to ensure Fawcett is no longer allowed access to the elderly through her work. DC Handley said: 'She targeted elderly victims who had placed their trust in her and she betrayed that trust. 'The victims feel she has just been given a slap on the wrists for what she did. 'For a carer, it was despicable conduct. 'We have contacted the Safeguarding Adults Board to prevent her from working as a carer again to protect the elderly.' Hull Crown Court heard mother- of-three Fawcett worked for Independent Home Living in Beverley and was sent to the homes of dementia sufferers as a home help. Despite leaving her job at the firm, she continued to care for her victims and was employed privately. Over two years, she stole expensive jewellery and more than £12,000 in cash. Thefts included Rolex watches, a Cameo brooch and an antique watch fob amounting to £6,000. Fawcett, from Hull, stole cash from one woman’s purse and took some of her victims to the bank to withdraw cash, knowing they would not remember. The money was spent on phone top-up cards and takeaways. Court: Fawcett, from Hull, stole cash from one . woman’s purse and took some of her victims to the bank to withdraw cash, . knowing they would not remember, Hull Crown Court (pictured) heard . Prosecutor Nigel Clive said: 'All the victims were elderly and some were suffering from dementia. She admitted targeting such people because of their poor memory.' Fawcett was caught when Lockings Solicitors was given power of attorney over one woman’s affairs. They discovered large sums had been withdrawn from her account. When they investigated further and contacted the bank, Fawcett was seen on CCTV taking the victim to the bank to withdraw funds amounting to more than £6,000 from her account. Mr Clive said: 'Fawcett told the police she went with the complainant because she knew the woman would never remember going to the bank. 'The money was used to pay for the defendant’s credit card, council tax, takeaways and mobile phone. 'She said she used the money to live on.' Fawcett stole £150 from the purse of another woman and £375 which had been given to her to purchase a trophy for a junior football team. When she was arrested, detectives also found cannabis and amphetamines at her home. She pleaded guilty to 11 thefts and asked the judge to take a further 18 offences of theft into consideration. Recorder Tony Hawks has sentenced her to a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered her to carry out 280 hours of unpaid work in the community. He said: 'As a carer, either employed by a company or on your own briefly, you abused the trust of vulnerable people and you stole money and other valuable items from them. 'These were despicable offences because these were people who were vulnerable and reaching the end of their lives. 'They were people who were obliged to trust people like you and rely upon them not to defraud or steal from them and you betrayed that trust.' Recorder Hawks said Fawcett had started abusing drugs. He said: 'What you were doing that for when you have three young children to care for, I don’t know. 'It is the debt you got into that made you behave in this way. 'You have brought disgrace on yourself and your family.' Recorder Hawks said many people would say Fawcett deserved to go to prison for her crimes. He said: 'What saves you from immediate prison is the fact you had the good sense to plead guilty and you didn’t seek to put the blame on others. 'If I send you to prison, your three children will be deprived of their mother and they haven’t done anything wrong and a prison sentence will visit a punishment on them which they do not deserve. 'If you commit any further offences in the next two years you will be brought back to court and the court will consider locking you up.' Fawcett, who has no previous convictions, was not ordered to pay any compensation to her victims.","Kizzy Fawcett, 35, has been described as .

Allowing 16-year-olds to vote on Scottish independence would make a lower voting age ‘inevitable’ across Britain, David Cameron was warned yesterday. The Prime Minister is poised to extend a referendum on the issue to 16 and 17-year-old Scots as a concession to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond at a meeting on Monday. But a former Tory Scottish secretary said the precedent would make it ‘impossible’ to prevent youngsters voting in future general elections, and ‘bring politics into our schools’. David Cameron (pictured left) is poised to extend a referendum on the issue to 16 and 17-year-old Scots as a concession to Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond (pictured right) Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, who served in John Major’s government, claimed Mr Salmond was trying to ‘bully’ the Prime Minister into allowing a major constitutional change in a deal sealed ‘over whisky and sandwiches in Edinburgh’. He said: ‘Once that has happened it will be impossible to argue that 16-year-olds should not have the vote in all elections. You can’t pick and choose. ‘If you are going to make this step, which is a huge step . . . then a Bill should be brought before the House of Commons and people will then have an opportunity to consider the arguments properly and make amendments.’ His intervention came as Labour MP . Natascha Engel said she hoped lowering the voting age for the referendum . in October 2014 would open the door to extending it. ‘The time has come for it,’ she said. ‘Attitudes have shifted. We’ve been campaigning for a very long time to . lower the voting age to 16 and this is a very exciting opportunity . that’s being presented in Scotland to demonstrate that when you do give . the vote to 16-year-olds, the sky doesn’t fall in.’ Lord Forsyth of Drumlean (pictured right) claimed Mr Salmond was trying to bully the Prime Minister . Lord Forsyth said her comments suggested the Scottish referendum was a ‘backdoor way’ of lowering the voting age before the 2015 general election, but she insisted this would not happen as it requires a change in the law. The idea was last proposed in 1999 and was defeated by a majority of more than 400. However, it is the official policy of the Liberal Democrats and is supported by Labour leader Ed Miliband. Lord Forsyth said: ‘What is happening here is that Alex Salmond is attempting to bully the Prime Minister into agreeing to having 16-year-olds voting in the Scottish referendum in return for having a single question on independence. ‘The referendum will be towards the end of 2014. Are we going to say to these people on the register, “I know you got to vote six months ago, but you’re not going to be able to vote in the general election?”’ Downing Street sources yesterday played down fears about a change in the voting age in Britain, saying any legislation would apply only to the referendum.","Lord Forsyth of Drumlean claimed Mr Salmond was trying to bully the Prime Minister .

Nearly all of us have experienced the familiar butterflies when it's time for the dreaded trip to the dentist. Now one enterprising dental surgeon from Java, Indonesia, has created a new tool he hopes will put a smile instead of a grimace on his patients' faces. Dr Dhanni Gustiana has created a musical drill to drown out the ominous high-pitch whine of the tool. He hopes it will especially soothe his nervous younger patients. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dr Gustiana (pictured) modified a conventional dental drill, changing the buzzing sound to the music from a MP3 player . Dr Gustiana, 37, from Purworejo, Central Java province, decided to create the new appliance after finding out the drill was what children feared most. He said: 'The children are not afraid of doctor, many of them are afraid of drill. I modified this by putting a toy on the head of the drill and tell them that the toy will clean their teeth.' In 2006, after a year of research, Dr Gustiana created a musical dental drill. He modified a conventional dental drill, changing the buzzing sound to the music from a MP3 player. It also features colourful flashing lights. 'The patient will hear the music louder when they open their mouths compared to when they close their mouths,' said Dr Gustiana. The dental surgeon spent about six million rupiah (£372) to modify the instrument. His patients can even request songs loaded onto the MP3 player. Bringing fun into the dreaded dentist's room? The drill also features flashing lights and toys to distract children . Gustiana also has various figurines made from silicon which can be placed on the drill head. He treats more than 15 patients a day, of whom about half are children. He says some adults also ask him to use the singing drill on them. One young patient, Anavaya Siddartta, appeared to enjoy her dental treatment with the musical mouth implement at Gustiana's surgery. Her mother, Christine Ratnawati, said: 'Very interesting, the children listening to the music and they forget about the drill in their mouth. This is a good idea to overcome fear of dental drill.' Dr Gustiana said with the musical drill, most of his children's patients are not even aware of what he is doing.

Pervert: Violent sex offender Steven Strange attacked a lone woman after she rebuffed his advances . A sex offender who brutally attacked a young woman after she spurned his advances was tracked down because she had accepted his phone number in an attempt to get rid of him, a court was told. Convicted rapist Steven Strange, from Bristol, insisted on walking his victim home before knocking her out and then kissing and groping her as she lay unconscious in a graveyard. The terrified young woman, who was told if she screamed she would be stabbed, came round and managed to piece together what had happened before going straight to the police and handing them his phone number. Strange, 25, has pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sexual assault at Bristol Crown Court and was jailed for four years. Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said the woman had been out with friends and was walking home alone at 4am when Strange appeared, asked her for a light and chatted to her. Mr Hollier said: ‘The defendant insisted he would walk her home. ‘She was not keen to be walked to her home and walked past the turning to her road. She was on her phone to a friend. She was trying to go to his home, where she would then stay.’ The court heard Strange insisted he would walk her there and, to placate him, she took his mobile number and promised they would speak. Mr Hollier said: ‘He said he would text her when he got home. ‘He gave her a hug and she hugged him back, like friends would hug to say goodbye. ‘He then kissed her, which was not welcome, gave her a longer hug and when she said she should go home he grabbed her against a parked car and she was not able to break free.’ Disgusting: Strange beat the young girl before taking her to a graveyard and assaulting her . Mr Hollier said Strange pushed the woman to the pavement, where she banged her head, and said: 'If you scream I’ll stab you.' Frightened she would be raped, she screamed and the attacker punched her repeatedly in the face and mouth. The court heard she woke up bleeding in a churchyard, where she rang police with the details she had been given. Strange was arrested at 5.15pm that day and denied everything, but was picked out from an identity line-up. He had a previous jail term for rape, the court heard. Judge David Ticehurst was told the attacker could not face coming into court to hear his fate. He imposed a sentence comprising of four years’ prison and three years’ extended licence, for public protection. He described the victim as robust in spirit and told the court: ‘She says she feels partly responsible for the sexual assault because she was walking home alone. She says “I feel stupid”. ‘She should feel no sense of responsibility what so ever. ‘She is perfectly entitled to walk home in the early hours of the morning. She is perfectly entitled to think she will not be molested by a man of Steven Strange’s nature and character.' Rosaleen Collins, defending, said her client had shame and guilt and understood the impact on the victim. She described him as a lonely young man who had had no contact with his family since he was jailed in 2007.","Steven Strange, 25, insisted on walking the girl home before savagely beating and groping her .

Townend, who was stopped in his Mercedes SLK300 when police spotted him driving 'with excessive speed' and crossing double white lines, told magistrates his driving ban would 'seriously incriminate his chances of inclusion' in the British Olympic team'. The Olympic hopeful, who won the prestigious Badminton and Burghley Horse Trial in 2009 and was ranked 16th in the world in 2010, was stopped by officers in Dudleston Heath, Shropshire on May 3. Police spotted his car outside a Co-Op store and followed the horse rider when checks showed his MOT had expired. Kate Price, prosecuting, told Shrewsbury magistrates when officers stopped Townend he 'stumbled out of his vehicle and smelt of alcohol.' Townend, 28, was found to have 61 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35. Townend, of Ellesmere, Shropshire, pleaded guilty to driving with excess alcohol on Thursday, May 3. He told magistrates during the hearing where he was banned for two years from driving: 'This will seriously incriminate my chances of inclusion in the British Olympic team. 'Telling my parents has gone down fairly horrendously and it is an experience that will not be repeated. I will not put myself in this position again.' Hopeful: Townend, currently ranked Britain's top event rider for 2012, had high hopes of making the Olympic squad and winning a medal this summer . Plea: Townend had told Shrewsbury Magistrates Court the two year driving ban would 'seriously incriminate' his chances of representing Britain at the London Olympics . Townend had represented himself at the hearing, where he apologised to the court for his behaviour and for taking up their time. He was also ordered to pay a £110 fine, £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge and was offered the option of taking the drink drivers rehabilitation course with presiding magistrate, Patrica Edge wishing him luck as he left the court. The British Equestrian Federation said: 'We do not in any way condone drinking and driving which is a serious offence that will be dealt with by the courts. 'Oliver has an outside chance for selection to the eventing team; however, this offence will not impact on the selection decision which is based primarily on results and also the other criteria laid down in the selection policy.'","Oliver Townend receives two-year ban for drink-driving on May 3 .

Paul Ryan hopes to deliver a knockout blow to President Barack Obama's hopes of re-election tonight against Joe Biden who expects to come at him 'like a cannonball'. Paul Ryan has been taking time out from his workouts to prepare assiduously for tonight's vice-presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky with both camps predicting a muscular showdown between the two campaign attack dogs. If the pictures in the next edition of TIME magazine of the vice-presidential candidate working out last year are anything to go by, he's at least in physical shape for the showdown. Tough guy: Paul Ryan, pictured here demonstrating his workout technique last year, is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to Obama's re-election hopes tonight. PHOTO CREDIT: Gregg Segal for TIME . Ryan said this week he expects Biden to come swinging for him from the off after Obama's disastrous presidential debate last week: 'What was wrong with Obama? I don't know. It was really something,' Ryan said. 'President Obama was flustered. He has a terrible record to run on. It’s pretty indefensible as witnessed by the fact that he didn’t do a very good job of defending it last night.' 'That means the focus is going to be on Joe,' Ryan said, 'and I expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball. He’ll be in full attack mode, and I don’t think he’ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way.' Brains and brawn: Ryan is seen as the intellectual superior to Biden. PHOTO CREDIT: Gregg Segal for TIME . At the same time, Ryan aides have said their man will be aggressive, accusing Biden of misrepresenting his record. Biden this morning joked with reporters about his strategy, saying: 'You ever see me rope-a-dope?' While the Romney campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of Representative Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate, privately hopes are high that he could do very well. Advisor: Paul Ryan today tweeted this picture of him hugging one of his sons as he prepares for the showdown . Biden, who was a Senator for 36 years, is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the Romney campaign - most particularly when he said Republicans wanted to 'put y'all back in chains' and when he said the middle class had been 'buried' under Obama. Ryan, just 42, is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation, a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered Congress in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then Biden was when he became a Senator in 1972. Feeling good: Republicans are more confident than Democrats going into the vice presidential debate . Biden is expected to assail Ryan on his own budget plans in the House. But Ryan, who has fallen in line with Romney on policy issues, will want to keep the focus on his running mate. 'You have to remember this is a Romney-Ryan ticket, and there's one presidential candidate, there's one person at the top of the ticket,' Romney spokesman Kevin Madden told reporters. A new Pew Research Centre poll has found that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 Republican vice- presidential candidate Sarah Palin. By a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin, voters expect Ryan to beat Biden at their Thursday debate in Danville, Kentucky. Among independents, 42 to 25 per cent believe Ryan will win. This could create an expectations problem . for Ryan - much as was the case for Obama, who was heavily favoured by . voters before he was trounced by Romney in the first presidential debate . in Denver. At the weekend, Ryan said of Biden: . 'He's fast on the cuff, he's a witty guy. He knows who he is and he's . been doing this for 40 years. So you're not going to rattle Joe Biden.' All smiles: Biden joked with reporters after stepping off the plane with his daughter Ashley Biden today 'Have you seen my rope-a-dope?' Romney tried to damp down Ryan's . experience, telling CNN: 'I don’t know how Paul will take on the debate. Obviously the Vice President has done 15-20 debates in his lifetime—he . is an experienced debater—I think this is Paul’s first debate. I may be . wrong, he may have done something in high school, we don’t know. 'But, . it will be a new experience for Paul, but I am sure he will do fine. Frankly, he has policy, facts, and results on his side. So I think you . find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so . much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter, but the policies . and pathways being described.' Popularity contest: A new Pew Research poll has found . that voters view Biden less favourably than Ryan . Charmer: Ryan is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new Republican generation . In fact, according to ABC News, Ryan has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in Congress - though none of them anything like as high-profile as Thursday's clash, which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched Romney and Obama in Denver. According to Pew, Biden, whose role in the campaign is as attack dog and as the man who can connect with blue-collar voters, is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters. Four years ago, when he faced Palin, his favourability rating was 53 per cent. Romney has leapt to level pegging - or . even into the lead - in national polls since his much-praised debate . performance in Denver. While Obama still holds slim leads in . battleground states, his campaign badly needs to alter the trajectory of . the race. Biden has the opportunity to do that but . traditionally vice-presidential debate, while they have provided . entertainment and some big moments, have not had an appreciable effect . on the general election result. Losing ground: Biden is . viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters compared to four years ago, when he . faced Palin and his favourability rating was 53 per cent . In 1988, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas delivered one of the most famous put-downs in political history. When Senator Dan Quayle, then Vice-President George H.W. Bush's running mate, said he had nearly as much congressional experience as John F. Kennedy, Bentsen pounced. He said: 'Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy: I knew Jack Kennedy; Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. … Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.' Quayle responded lamely that this was 'really uncalled for' and his political career arguably never recovered . But in the November election, the Bush-Quayle Republican ticket was victorious over Governor Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts and Bentsen, the Democratic ticket.","Ryan says he expects Biden to come at him 'like a cannonball'

A convicted conman tried to hire hitmen to kill and decapitate the judge and young female prosecutor who put him in jail for 15 years, a court has heard. Joseph Romano, 49, offered the killers a bonus if they kept the heads in formaldehyde - a toxic chemical used to preserve dead bodies -  as souvenirs, a judge was told. Romano allegedly told an informant that he wanted to torture Judge Joseph Bianco and Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Gatz before they were killed. Romano wanted Assistant U.S. Attorney Lara Gatz, left, and Judge Bianco, right, tortured and killed after he was put in jail for 15 years . The informant reported the threat to the FBI, the authorities said yesterday. FBI special agent Reynaldo Tariche said in court papers: 'Romano requested that the heads of both the judge and the [prosecutor] be preserved in formaldehyde as souvenirs.' 'Romano was willing to pay extra . for the ""souvenirs"" if [the undercover] was willing to store them until . Romano’s release from prison.' Romano appeared emotionless at a brief court appearance in Central Islip, New York, yesterday. The FBI also arrested Dejvid . Mirkovic, a business associate of Romano, and charged him with acting as . the intermediary between two undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen, . according to court papers. Romano had pleaded guilty in 2010 to wire and bank fraud in connection with a 'boiler room scheme' in which victims were offered collectible coins at vastly inflated prices. There were more than 1,500 victims — most of them elderly investors who lost their life savings, it was reported in the New York Daily News. In total they were fleeced out of more than $40million. Authorities said Romano made about $4million.

Romano was sentenced to less than the 20 years maximum behind bars that he faced for wire and mail fraud. Since his conviction he was plotting for revenge against the government. Romano sought the help of the informant in finding a contract killer. The undercover agents met with him at the Nassau County jail where he was locked up during recent restitution hearings. He represented himself at the hearings. Romano proposed the undercovers assault another associate of his for $3,000 as a test, which, if successfully carried out, would lead to another 'big job, some serious work,' according to the complaint. Romano was involved in a financial dispute with the man he wanted attacked. The meeting was recorded with secret audio and video devices worn by the agent. Undercover agents told Mirkovic that the associate had been assaulted and showed him a staged photo of the attack.

A terminally-ill seven-year-old girl who travelled to Mexico for specialist cancer treatment has died two days after returning to Scotland. Olivia Downie died peacefully in the early hours of this morning. Her family said they were 'blessed' to have had her in their lives. Olivia and her family, from Fraserburgh in Aberdeenshire, flew to the Central American country earlier this month to get her treatment for neuroblastoma, an aggressive form of cancer. While there, she fell seriously ill and her family was told she would need expensive medical treatment on any flight home. Olivia, her mother Lauren and father Steven touched down in Aberdeen on a medical plane on Wednesday after a fundraising drive helped meet the £110,000 cost. She was taken straight to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital. In a statement released through NHS Grampian, her parents said: 'It is with great sadness that we announce that our darling daughter Olivia slipped away peacefully this morning after her long and courageous battle. 'We are so thankful that, thanks to the generosity of so many people, we have been able to take her home to Scotland so she could have her family by her side. Words cannot express how grateful we are that this final journey was made possible. 'We would like to extend our gratitude to the medical and nursing teams, both at NHS Grampian and overseas, who have also been part of our lives for so long. 'We were blessed to have had Olivia in our lives and her cheeky smile that shone like a star will be with us forever.' The charity Families Against Neuroblastoma (Fan) helped the family with fundraising to bring her home. Almost £155,000 was donated through a JustGiving page set up to raise money for their flights and medical costs. However, last weekend, online problems with NatWest bank delayed pledged funds . from appearing in the charity’s account, although FAN said the bank . worked all day to resolve the issue. The medical bill for the hospital in Mexico was eventually settled. Olivia and her family returned to Scotland on a private ambulance thanks to funding raised by people touched by her story . Olivia pictured at home during her battle with cancer. She was diagnosed in 2009 . Olivia was diagnosed in January 2009 after suffering severe backache and tiredness. Following visits to GPs, she was taken to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital and diagnosed with neuroblastoma.Fan said Olivia had a tumour the size of a grapefruit in her stomach. Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the nervous system and can occur anywhere in the body. Fewer than 100 children are diagnosed with it each year in the UK and most who suffer from it are younger than five years old. The charity now has a petition calling for a campaign to raise awareness of the illness. It states: 'We are requesting a Government-funded awareness campaign to educate the public to recognise the signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma, and empower parents and GPs to adopt a policy of early testing when symptoms first present.' There had been fears that doctors in Mexico would turn Olivia's life support machine off if funding had not been raised . At one point father Steven and mother Lauren, who is heavily pregnant, were told that the hospital had not received the money due to a NatWest glitch .

The talented modeller took nearly three years painstakingly making the 5ft long object and used 39,000 matchsticks. After he died the delicate model was handed down to step-daughter Lillian Garner who kept it out of the reach of children on top of her wardrobe.

The Government will not be deterred from going ahead with the High Speed 2 rail line by the 'grief and hassle' it is getting from backbenchers, the Transport Secretary said today. Patrick McLoughlin said he intends to fast-track the line, which will initially connect London and Birmingham and is later planned to be extended to Manchester and Leeds. And he said he hoped to work with Labour to get cross-party consensus on legislation to be included in the next Queen's Speech and taken through Parliament before the 2015 general election. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said he intends to fast-track the HS2 line, which will initially connect London and Birmingham . He said he would 'love to' complete the project within five years, although he accepted it will probably take longer. The new Transport Secretary told the Conservative conference in Birmingham earlier this week that he would like the HS2 line eventually to stretch as far as Scotland. Mr McLoughlin told The Independent: 'The easiest thing for any government to do on a project the size of HS2 is to say we are not doing it. 'All we get is grief. All we get is hassle. But one of the things that government have got to try and do is look to the long term future. 'Whichever route we are going to put it on we are going to upset people.' Mr . McLoughlin said he was assured, when he was appointed to the transport . brief in last month's reshuffle, that HS2 had the support of Prime . Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, despite the . opposition of some Tory backbenchers.

The news caused First Group’s shares to plummet by 20 per cent wiping £240million off its value within hours. Untypical Tory: Patrick McLoughlin is proud of his mining background . Patrick McLoughlin was born in 1957 in Stafford, the son and grandson of coal miners. Unlike many of his peers in the Tory party, he was educated at a comprehensive - Cardinal Griffin Roman Catholic School in Cannock, Staffordshire - leaving at 16. He later went on to Staffordshire College of Agriculture at Rodbaston College. In 1974 he began working on a farm, and five years later he began work at the Littleton Colliery in Cannock - becoming a member of the National Union of Mineworkers. McLoughlin was elected as a councillor on the Cannock Chase District Council for seven years from 1980, and also a councillor on Staffordshire County Council from 1981-87. In 1982, He served as the Chairman of the National Young Conservatives. His break into Parliament came in 1986, when Matthew Parris, the Conservative MP for West Derbyshire, resigned from the House of Common, and McLoughlin was chosen to fight the by-election. He held on to the sea with a narrow 100 majority. McLoughlin was made a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989, and served in the Department for Transport until 1992, when he was moved by John Major to serve in the same position at the Department of Employment. A year later he was moved again, this time to the Department of Trade and Industry. He joined the government Whips' Office in 1995 as an assistant, becoming a Lord Commissioner in 1996. After the Conservative Party's defeat at the 1997 general election, he remained in the whips' office in opposition, becoming the Deputy Chief Whip in 1998. He was then promoted to Chief Whip by David Cameron in 2005. Following the 2010 election, Prime Minister David Cameron made McLoughlin the government's Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury in the Coalition government. He was once reprimanded by Speaker John Bercow for inappropriate behaviour within the House of Commons. In September 2012, following a Cabinet reshuffle, McLoughlin was appointed Secretary of State for Transport.","Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin wants cross-party support .

Kimm & Miller said: 'We've spent ages staring at the bottom of the . jar to work out the best solution and I've got to say, its been a real . labour of love.

The Marmite Food Company was set up in 1902, later renamed Marmite Ltd, in Burton On Trent. The sticky black spread was made using the concentrated cells of brewer's yeast, and little has changed in the production method since then. What's in a name: Marmite originally came in a small earthenware pot, similar to the kind of French casserole dish called a 'marmite' The yeast is broken down to release soluble amino acids and proteins. This soluble material is then concentrated and filtered a few times before going through a unique process for flavour development. A blend of vitamins - as well as vegetable and spice extracts - is then added to create Marmite's unique taste. In fact, thanks to its high B vitamin content, Marmite was included in soldiers ration packs during the First World War. It also became a staple food in hospitals and schools. During World War II, Marmite became a dietary supplement in prisoner-of-war camps, and in 1999, it was sent to British peacekeeping forces in Kosovo. Marmite originally came in a small earthenware pot, similar to the kind of French casserole dish called a 'Marmite'. This may be where Marmite gets its name from. You can still see the original 'Marmite' dish pictured on the front of the pot, but the firm began using glass jars in the 1920s. The shape of the jar and the distinctive red and yellow label have remained pretty much the same since then, with the occasional novelty jar or tube being released on special occasions, such as Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee.

Anton Bailey said he was surrounded by French fishing boats in international waters off the coast of Le Havre in Normandy, France, and claimed one of the vessels even tried to ram his trawler. Mr Bailey, of Brixham, Devon, said: ‘They were just trying to stop us from our fishing activity. They were shooting flares at other vessels, every underhanded thing you could think of. 'Then they threw rocks at us and tried to ram us. I've never seen this before and I have been at sea 20 years.’ A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman confirmed an incident where ‘British fishing vessels were being confronted by French fishing vessels’ had been reported to the organisation.

Crime behind bars: Damien Miller will spend another ten years in jail after he masterminded a heroin and cocaine racket from his cell . A drugs baron will spend another ten years behind bars for masterminding another heroin and cocaine racket from his prison cell. Damien Miller, 31, was serving seven years for supplying drugs to his home city of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire yet he began a new criminal enterprise when he being transferred to an open prison. Whilst on day release from North Sea Camp Prison in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices. He then formed a new gang which peddled drugs in Stoke-on-Trent whilst he served out the rest of his stretch over 120 miles away. He even managed to pay £15,000 from drug dealing into his own bank account. Police began investigating after noticing a rise in violent organised crime in Stoke and discovered Miller was the ringleader. They alerted bosses at the jail and began a surveillance operation and discovered that he was organising new drugs deals. John Phillips, 29, was Miller’s ‘right-hand man’ in Stoke-on-Trent and controlled the day-to-day running of the drug crime while Miller remained in behind bars in Lincolnshire where he was said to be building a ‘comfortable life’ from the profits. Police arrested in Miller in June last year after seizing more than 2.2lbs of heroin and cocaine worth around £100,000 and using mobile phone records to link low-level couriers to Miller and Phillips. At Stafford Crown Court in Knutton, Miller admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine. Phillips of Stoke, was jailed for seven and a half years and another seven men and two women were jailed for a total of 23 years. Passing sentence Judge Michael Cullum told Miller today: ‘You had a role which was highly significant or borderline leading. ‘Clearly you conducted this enterprise while held at an open prison. This is a seriously aggravating feature.’ Former businessman Miller was initially jailed in 2009 after heading an operation to supply the dealers of Stoke with 2.2lbs of cocaine worth up to £88,000 which he bought from a Liverpool wholesale dealer. New criminal enterprise: While on day release from North Sea Camp Prison (pictured) in Lincolnshire, Miller used his employment as an odd job man on the outside as a cover to meet up with his old accomplices . He claimed he was ‘not an organiser’ and was acting ‘under orders’ and had once fled to Spain fearing he was about to be assassinated. But police began investigating him again in 2011 after reports of wide scale drug dealing in the city. Between March and June police carried out a series of raids and intercepted deliveries of varying amounts of cocaine, heroin and cash. After each seizure of drugs, police observed increased contact between Miller, Phillips and other accomplices. Over the course of the investigation, police seized more than 2.2lbs of cocaine and heroin from the conspirators. Miller deposited £15,000 in his bank account over the three month period, while Phillips’ income totalled £2,680. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Clews, head of Staffordshire Police’s Serious and Organised Crime Unit, said: ‘Building a case against Miller, Phillips and their associates took a considerable team effort involving several agencies and police departments. Miles away: Miller began building a 'comfortable life' from the profits of the drug ring while in the open prison . New gang peddling drugs:  John Phillips (right) was Miller's 'right hand man', controlling the day-to-day running of the drug crime and and was convicted along with seven men, including Dane Parker (left), and two women to over the enterprise . ‘Miller did not handle the drugs himself, but got other people to do his dirty work for him. As head of the group he was controlling everyone, and everything, from a distance. ‘But by piecing together a series of events we were able to uncover Miller’s involvement and the extent of his crime, along with that of all the others involved. ‘We gathered evidence of events which led to cash and drugs being recovered. We have CCTV footage of Phillips meeting Miller at a pub in Nottingham. All aspects of Miller’s life in Lincolnshire were thoroughly investigated. ‘This case has also shown that some of those involved in this Organised Crime Group were vulnerable individuals who were easily manipulated by Miller and Phillips. People like this, who are so easily exploited by criminals, end up paying a high price.’ Governor of North Sea Camp Prison, Graham Batchford, said: ‘We are not complacent about prisoners who breach their licence conditions. ‘Today’s outcome is proof that we will take every measure possible, including working close with the police, to ensure that those who fall foul of the terms of their temporary release are swiftly brought to justice.’ Dane Parker, 23, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and conspiracy to money launder. He was jailed for three years, eight months. Scott Mosedale, 26, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He was sentenced to two years, eight months. 'Borderline leading': While Miller claimed he was not 'an organiser' and was acting 'under orders', Judge Michael Cullum said in Stafford Crown Court (pictured) today that he had clearly conducted the enterprise while in an open prison . Ryan Jones, 27, of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted possessing criminal property and conspiracy to money launder. He received a sentence of one year, two months. Stephanie Pitchford, 22, and Kerry Wilkinson, 25, both of Stoke-on-Trent, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. They were sentenced to two years and one year, eight months respectively. Anthony Bostock, 32, of Stoke-on-Trent, . admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine. He has been jailed for two years, . three months. Byron Dunkley, 21, of Stafford, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin. He has gone to prison for 16 months.

Thousands of you sent in your protests against A&E closures – and this week we delivered two bulging mailbags full of your demands to David Cameron's doorstep. Nearly 30,000 Mail on Sunday readers have called for the Government to reverse the policy of downgrading and axeing local casualty departments across England and Wales. A total of 28,619 protests were lodged – 17,170 coupons, 7,377 emails and 4,072 text messages – all prompted by fears that the policy for big, centralised A&E departments could risk lives as it leads to longer journey times to hospital. Sackful of protests: MoS reporter Nick Craven hands in your petition to No. 10 . As your protests reached Downing Street, it emerged that: . A London Ambulance spokeswoman last night confirmed that the hard-pressed service is currently spending £60,000 each weekend on the private firms, plus unspecified further sums at what she termed 'busy periods'. Yet under the closure plans, London is set to lose no fewer than seven casualty departments (one has already been lost). This will hugely increase the burden on the ambulance service. Critical: Campaigners say changes are about cuts, not a better A&E service . As as well as travelling longer distances after answering 999 calls, it will have to pick up seriously ill patients who turn up at the so-called 'urgent  care centres' which are set to replace A&Es but in reality cannot treat any life-threatening conditions. At just one of the hospitals where A&E is due to close, Ealing, there is already an urgent care centre which transfers up to 50 patients a day to casualty. Currently, this is a short journey down a corridor, but if casualty closes, as planned, all the patients will have to be transferred by blue-light ambulance to an A&E somewhere else, probably West Middlesex 20 minutes away, or Northwick Park, 45 minutes away. 'There is a limit to what paramedics can do' The ambulance service spokeswoman said that it hoped to be able to recruit new staff, and would discuss how to fund the extra demands A&E closures would create once a final decision on the cuts had been made. Yet the ambulance service is facing steep cuts itself, with a requirement to slash £53 million – or 19 per cent – of its budget by 2015/16, which will include the loss of 560 front-line staff. The pressure on paramedics is not confined to London. Alan Bush, who has recently retired after 35 years as a paramedic in Newark, Notts, where the A&E closed early last year, said: 'The closure meant we had to drive much further, and often you wouldn't know which hospital you were supposed to take a patient to. 'There is a limit to what paramedics  can do. Travelling further means you have to provide more treatment to try to keep a patient stable. On the other hand, you can't do much when you're hurtling along at 70mph.' On average, it now takes emergency patients from Newark almost two hours after a 999 call to be handed over to an A&E department. A&E scandal: Readers want the policy of downgrading and axeing casualty departments reversed . Meanwhile, casualty departments in London will face a huge increase of 47 per cent in the number of residents they will each serve if the closures go through, it was forecast last night. New analysis shows that if the 32 A&E departments which existed in 2010 are cut to 24 across the capital, the number of people in the average catchment area will soar from 255,000 to 375,000 in 2020, once forecast population increases are taken into account. Labour's City Hall health spokesman, Murad Qureshi, who compiled the analysis, said: 'Londoners face being caught in a pincer of far fewer A&Es and a thinly stretched ambulance service. It is truly shocking that the Government has left the NHS in such a mess.' But an NHS London spokesman said: 'Any changes to NHS services will be led by clinicians, and local people will be fully consulted. Clinicians would not recommend change unless it improves patient care. 'Hundreds of lives have already been saved by treating life threatening injuries in fewer specialist centres and expert stroke units.' Under pressure: Prime Minister David Cameron and Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, right, must act now . Last week, we revealed how a powerful lobby of 140 senior physicians, academics and surgeons signed an open letter to David Cameron calling for an end to the 'indiscriminate' closure of A&E units that will affect 26 hospitals. Their letter accused health chiefs driving through changes just to save money, rather than for valid clinical reasons. The A&E closure in one area where the department is under threat, according to an official poll.Campaigners say the result undermines the local NHS chiefs' claim that their plan is supported by clinicians – an assertion repeated last month in newspaper advertisements designed to convince patients that closure would be a good idea. They were placed by NHS North West London, where four out of nine existing casualty departments are set to close, including the one at Ealing Hospital. A public 'consultation' on this plan ended last week, with a decision expected early next year. But new figures from an official poll of GPs carried out as part of the consultation disclose that in Ealing only four per cent of the doctors – or one in 25 – supported 'Option A', the choice being backed by NHS bosses which involves the closure of the local A&E. More... One in 10 babies born within 24-week abortion limit lives to see their first birthday, official figures show . Less than half of the doctors eligible to vote did so. However, of those that did, 54.2 per cent backed 'Option C', under which Ealing A&E would stay open. 'The claim that the closure has clinical support is simply misleading,' local campaigner Colin Standfield told The Mail on Sunday. He also called into question the way the survey was framed, as there was no option given for keeping all of the hospitals' A&E departments open. 'It was a case of ''which poison do you prefer, strychnine, arsenic or cyanide?'' ' he said. Axe: Ealing Hospital is one of four casualty departments set to close in north west London . He added that he and his fellow campaigners, including many doctors, are now consulting lawyers and intend to launch a High Court challenge if the closure plan is ratified. 'If this should go ahead, we would be looking at going for a judicial review,' he added. In NHS North West London spokesman said it was 'not true' that the proposals lacked clinical support, saying: 'All medical directors of all the Trusts in North West London have publicly signed up to the case for change.' He said the GP survey was 'all part of listening to concerns raised during consultation, and we are now analysing the thousands of responses we have had to see how we should develop our recommendations'. The doctors' opposition has been shared by Ealing Council which has called on the Government to scrap the 'half-baked' plans to downgrade local hospital services. The Labour-run council's cabinet held a special meeting to discuss a report from former NHS executive Tim Rideout, which raised serious concerns about the closures and dismissed the business case from health bosses as fundamentally flawed. The council has also joined authorities from across West London to deliver 60,000 signatures in protest to NHS North West London headquarters. Councillor Jasbir Anand, Ealing leader for health and adult services, said: 'We won't gamble with our health or be bystanders as our hospital services are dismantled.'","We deliver YOUR protests to the door of Downing Street .

Desperate: Michael Hill carried out a terrifying £20,000 armed robbery after he was kicked out of university for failing to pay his tuition fees. He was jailed for three years . A student who could not afford to pay his tuition fees carried out a terrifying £20,000 armed robbery, a court heard.

In thousands of pounds worth of debt, and evicted from his student accommodation, Hill  got a bus to a Co-op store, where he had previously worked, and carried out the raid armed with a knife. The court heard that on August 26 . after wandering around Manchester with his rucksack containing his few . belongings and £6 cash, he got a bus to Astley, Wigan, and carried out . the raid. Just after 10pm Hill, who had his . face covered by a scarf, produced a knife, which he had since working at . a DIY store, and demanded staff open the safe. He pushed a security guard over and . grabbed hold of the store manager and claimed there was a bomb in a bag . on the garage forecourt outside.

Downie, prosecuting said Hill had been working part time but . due to lack of business that job fell through. He said he was then thrown out of his . student accommodation because he could not pay his rent and he amassed . considerable debts with his bank and family and friends .

The parents of twins dying from a rare . genetic disorder which will kill them before they're 12 are planning the . family’s final holiday together. Seven-year-old brothers Freddie and Louie Dawkins were born apparently perfectly healthy but were diagnosed with deadly Batten’s disease when they were three. They are the only identical twins in the world with the neurological condition which affects just one in every 300,000 births. Doctors told devastated parents Sarah Finney and Andrew Dawkins their sons would probably die before they were teenagers. Freddie and Louie Dawkins (pictured with parents Andrew and Sarah) are the only twins in the UK suffering from Batten disease, a rare degenerative condition which means they will die before their 12th birthday . The boys were born apparently perfectly healthy but the one-in-a-million illness has left them blind and autistic . The boys are now almost completely blind and suffer from autism. In the coming years they are also likely to become wheelchair bound. Blood tests revealed their parents - who were initially told they could not have children - both carry the Batten gene which they passed onto their sons. Now the couple, from Nottingham, are planning a final dream holiday for the family before their sons - who turned seven on last month - become too ill to travel. Mr Dawkins, 34, who quit his job as a furniture maker to care for his sons, said: 'It is heartbreaking watching the boys deteriorate and knowing that there is nothing that can be done. 'We are just making the most of each day that they are still here. 'The boys both love swimming, so we take them to the pool four times a week. But what they really love is the sun. Even though they are blind they can tell it's is bright when it’s sunny so they are much happier in summer. We went on holiday to Portugal thanks to the charity Starlight. We now want to take them on holiday to Florida where they can swim with dolphins. The twins aged three months with mother Sarah (left) and today (right). Their birth was remarkable as the couple had been told they would be unable to have children . 'When Sarah and I got together we swam with dolphins in the Caribbean and we always said if we had children we’d do it with them. It’s our final wish to do that one thing for our boys. 'That would be a real dream for us to do that but obviously that costs a lot but we are saving up.' The couple, who have been together for 10 years, were delighted when Sarah fell pregnant in 2004. Doctors had told Mr Dawkins he was unlikely to be able to father children after undergoing gruelling chemotherapy after being struck down with leukaemia aged 19. Ms Finney was also warned the chances of her being able to conceive were low after suffering from endometriosis. But against incredible odds, her pregnancy was healthy and Freddie was born weighing 3lbs 11oz while Louie was born minutes later weighing 4lbs 20z. They sat up at the age of 11 months, took their first steps at 21 months, and even started to say their first words. But before the age of three, their mother noticed their eyes started to flicker and they tripped over things. The boys' parents, pictured in the Caribbean several years ago, are planning a final family holiday to Florida to swim with dolphins . The boys were referred to a paediatrician at the City Hospital in Nottingham where tests discovered they were both blind, despite having been born with perfect eyesight. In August 2010 they were diagnosed with Late Infantile Batten Disease (LIBD) and their parents were told the boys had less than 10 years to live. The disease is an inherited disorder of the nervous system which emerges in early childhood. The cruel disease leaves youngsters blind, bedridden, and mentally impaired - with the life expectancy for children with the disease between 8-12 years. A spokeswoman for the Batten Disease . Family Association said the charity was not aware of any other twins in . the UK with the condition. Ms Finney, a nurse, said: 'At first I thought that it was because the sun was in their eyes, or it was just that they were being clumsy. 'But when their eyes started to flicker, I knew something was wrong. Now blind and autistic, the twins cannot understand why they can no longer see, read or stand for themselves . 'They would try and pick up objects from the floor and completely miss them. It was as if they were struggling to see. 'We were so shocked when we were told that they had lost their sight, as when they were born there had been nothing wrong with their vision. 'I’d heard of Batten Disease, and I knew it was something terrible. When the doctors told us that they both had it, it was devastating. 'We'd never imagined it could be anything as serious as that. We were so shocked, we couldn’t speak.' She said the twins' frustration at the situation makes the situation even more heartbreaking. 'It is very difficult and frustrating for them as they don’t understand why they can’t see any more, or read their favourite books. 'It’s also hard because it’s like having toddlers who can reach anything, so we have to be with them constantly. 'All our efforts are focused on making the most of the time we've got left.'","Freddie and Louie Dawkins the only identical twins in the world with deadly neurological condition Batten disease .

A father mourning the loss of his one-year-old daughter, who was allegedly drowned by his wife last week in the family’s bathtub, made the heart-wrenching decision to take his second daughter, five, off of life support Monday. Jose Humberto Lopez said that he hoped some good would come of Marian’s death, as he had chosen to donate her organs for transplant. He told police he found his wife, 32-year-old Lorna Valle, pushing their two daughters underwater last Wednesday in a bath inside their Los Angeles home. Scroll down for video . Heart-wrenching: Jose Humberto Lopez decided to take his five-year-old daughter off life support Monday . Lorna Valle (centre) was arrested on suspicion of killing her one-year-old daughter Lindsay (right) and five-year-old daughter Marian (left) who was taken off life support yesterday . One-year-old Lindsay was declared dead when fire-fighters arrived on the scene. Mr Lopez said Monday with tears . streaming down his face outside Children’s Hospital in Los Angeles: ‘I . made a humanitarian decision to donate my daughter’s organs so another . person can live.’ Officer Karen Rayner, a spokeswoman . for the Los Angeles Police Department, told City News Service that . Marian had died, ‘but I have not yet had that confirmed.’ Valle, was charged with murder and . attempted murder Friday and is being held on $1.5million bail. If . convicted, she could get 50 years to life in prison. Police suspect that Valle ‘snapped’ when she decided to try to drown her . daughters Marian, five, and Lindsay, one. Valle . was stopped by her husband who returned to their south Los Angeles home . from the grocery store around 7.30am last Wednesday morning after going . to pick up juice and milk for his daughters. Tragic: Both Lindsay (left) and Marian (right) were unconscious when police arrived on scene -Lindsay was declared dead at the scene and Marian was taken off life support Monday . When the father arrived in the house, neighbours heard screams of ‘My babies! My babies!’ and police were called. Both girls were not breathing and unconscious when police arrived and found them in the bathroom of the family’s converted garage. They were taken to Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, and Marian remains there in extremely critical condition. Witnesses said that 'the little one' was 'in really bad shape' and almost purple when police arrived. 'We believe she is responsible for what happened to these two children,' said Los Angeles police commander Andy Smith. The family emigrated from Guatamala to California about ten years ago, and neighbours said that they were hard working and friendly. Now questions are being raised about Lorna Valle’s mental state, and some say that she had appeared depressed in recent weeks. ‘A neighbour said she told her that if . anything happens to her, she would leave the girls to the father or to . them,’ said Dina Ceballos. Arrested: Though Lorna Valle did not have a history of mental illness, neighbours reported that she had seemed depressed recently . ‘She was asking for psychological help and she didn't receive it. It's a sad story. It's a sad ending. She needs help. Ms Ceballos was nearby at the time of the incident and heard the father scream ‘If I didn’t get out, my girls would still be alive! 'Why didn’t she kill herself instead of trying to kill my girls?’ Others also suspected mental issues, like neighbour Jennifer Houston who told The Los Angeles Times that the mother seemed ‘like she was disturbed’. The name of the father has not been released, by another neighbour had good things to say about him. ‘He’s quiet. He’s the one who seems more adept,’ said Judy McCann. ‘He’s the one who had all his marbles. ‘She stays in the house. She never comes out.’ Because the police department found the scene so traumatic, the first responders from the police and fire departments are being offered counselling services to help them cope with what they saw. 'This is a tragic and horrific incident. Something no one likes to see,' said deputy police chief Pat Gannon.

Police say that Thomas Wane Rady, 29, and David McKee, 22, originally reported they . had been drinking and smoking pot with McLendon when an armed man busted in and blasted McLendon in a botched robbery. The two then changed their . story, telling police that the gun went off during McClendon's turn to pull the trigger while playing 'Russian Roulette.' Rady . and McKee said McLendon was the third player to hold a 44-caliber . handgun to his head loaded with one bullet, as the game's rules go . taking a chance that the shot fired would not be the one filled.

Three Army instructors have been sacked amid allegations cadets where physically abused at a camp. It’s alleged teenagers from Merseyside where bullied, hurt and humiliated at the national cadet camp in Crowborough, Sussex. Police, Army and council officials are investigating claims that recruits were whipped and tied up as part of a catalogue of abuse. It’s claimed cadets - aged between 15 . and 17 - were struck with elastic cords, forced to walk across rubble on . their bare knees and had water poured over them. Disturbing . photos have emerged which allegedly show one a female recruit with . extensive bruising to her legs caused by her being repeatedly struck . with a bungee cord. The probe centres on the Merseyside Army Cadet Force (MACF), based in Altcar, near Formby, Merseyside. Three sergeant instructors were . dismissed following complaints from cadets and their parents while . another three sergeant instructors have been demoted in rank, the . Liverpool Echo reported. Files have been passed to child welfare officers at Sefton Council after a complaint to the NSPCC. The allegations surround a trip to the camp in August involving around 400 young recruits from MACF, which has 34 detachments across Merseyside. A source told the Liverpool Echo that recruits had been 'beasted'. 'The kids had been bullied, whipped, flicked with bungees, had water poured down their necks as punishment and were made to do stupid things,' the source added. An Army spokesperson said they were aware of the claims. He said: 'These have been investigated and action has been taken. 'All those who are found to fall short of the army’s high standards or who are found to have committed an offence under the Armed Forces Act are dealt with administratively (up to and including discharge) or through the discipline process, as appropriate.' He added: 'The army takes duty of care very seriously. The wellbeing of our personnel remains fundamental to the core values and standards of the Armed Forces. 'The army has zero tolerance of bullying and all allegations are thoroughly investigated and action taken where necessary. 'Personnel have the right to live and work in an environment free from harassment, intimidation and discrimination (Armed Forces Diversity Policy). 'All personnel who feel they have been mistreated or bullied have the recourse to complain through the chain of command or direct to the RMP (Royal Military Police) or civilian police. 'Individuals may also speak to the padre, welfare staff or ring the confidential support line. 'All commanders are made fully aware of their responsibility to protect others from the differing forms of harassment, physical and mental intimidation and discrimination, and any suspicion of bullying should be dealt with immediately. 'This is reinforced throughout all military training.' Sussex police confirmed a report of child cruelty was being looked into. A spokesman said: 'On September 16, Sussex Police received a telephoned report alleging that army cadets from Merseyside had been assaulted whilst at Crowborough Army Camp in August this year. 'The matter has been looked into and we have liaised with Merseyside police. 'We have now just received one complaint of alleged assault on a teenage girl whilst she was at the camp. 'Full details in writing of this complaint are still awaited but it will be investigated, as would any other such complaints if received in the future.' A spokesman for Sefton council said: 'We have recently been made aware of allegations which have been made anonymously via the NSPCC.' The army cadets force is one of the country’s oldest and largest voluntary youth organisations. Cadets undertake community and military activities and work towards Duke of Edinburgh awards, BTEC and First Aid qualifications. Cadets from around the UK attend the annual camp in Crowborough, with the aim to provide an extensive amount of training over ten days. The Army cadet website says: 'With such a large attendance of both adults and cadets, annual camp is an ideal opportunity to recognise achievements gained not only during the 10 day camp but some may have been achieved prior to going away. 'This is a great way for fellow cadets and adults to see what they cadets from across the county are achieving and aims to motivate other cadets to follow suit. 'These achievements are not only something that benefit the cadet whilst they serve with the ACF but can build confidence, motivation and leadership skills that can be used beyond their cadet years.'","It’s alleged teenagers from Merseyside where bullied, hurt and humiliated at the national cadet camp in Crowborough, Sussex .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 24 February 2012 . Chyna Young was three months pregnant when she was shot four times by her ex-boyfriend Patrick Guillory as he chased her through a street after breaking into her mother's home. The 18-year-old was hit in the arm, twice in the back and in the neck on the near fatal night last June - the last shot left her paralysed from the neck down. Despite her devastating injuries, Chyna's bravery and determination saw her give birth to a premature, yet healthy, baby girl in October. Motherly love: Chyna Young, 18, wanted nothing more than to raise her baby daughter, Jada, herself despite her devastating injuries . Jada was born by cesarean section weighing just over three pounds. The young mother wanted nothing more to fight her tragic circumstances and raise baby Jada herself, but on Wednesday she tragically lost that battle and died in a Louisiana hospital, reports the Houston Chronicle. She had spent months at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston for her rehabilitation and had last month moved to a nursing home in her hometown of Crowley. She had apparently developed a respiratory infection and was transferred to American Legion Hospital, where she died. 'She was such an amazing young woman and an amazing young mother,' Kristen Soudelier, a social worker at Memorial Hermann-The Texas Medical Center, told the Chronicle. 'She wanted Jada so bad, and wanted her to be healthy. I think she struggled and was strong for Jada all along.' Patrick Guillory, 22, right, shot his ex-girlfriend Chyna Young, 18, four times after breaking into her home . Jada's birth and Chyna's efforts to become a mother despite her injuries became an inspirational story for many. 'I just want to play with Jada,' she told the Chronicle last month as she prepared to leave TIRR. 'I'm so happy when I see her.' At the time of the shooting, Chyna was preparing to begin classes at McNeese State University and had hoped to become a nurse. Instead, she spent the next seven months relearning basic skills - breathing without a respirator, eating and using a mouth-stick to work a laptop. Her mother, Sherry Yokum, had taken Jada home to Crowley in November and Chyna had hoped to join her daughter. But doctors felt she still needed round the clock care and she was moved into the nursing home. Jailed: Patrick Guillory, 22, shot Chyna and left her paralysed from the neck down three days after her 18th birthday . Acadia Parish coroner Dr. Mark Dawson told the Chronicle that he had not yet delivered a verdict on the cause of death. Even though a respiratory infection may have been the immediate cause, Dawson said, 'I'm sure it was a complication of the gunshot.' Guillory pleaded guilty to attempted murder and was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the shooting. He could face more charges if the cause of the death is linked to the shooting. Crowley police said the motive for the attack was unclear and it was not known by them if Guillory is Jada's father. K.P. Gibson, Chief of Crowley Police, said: 'As far as we are aware a paternity test has not been carried out. Guillory did not cooperate during our investigation so we don't know what his motive was.' Guillory had forced his way into Chyna's mother's home on the night of the shooting, Ms Yokum had tried to hold him back and screamed at her daughter to 'run'. After pistol whipping her mother, Guillory chased his pregnant ex-girlfriend through the street and fired his gun four times. Her mother later found her choking on her own blood in a neighbours garden. Soudelier told the Chronicle that Chyna's death had had an impact on everyone who had worked with Chyna. 'She allowed us to be part of her life, and to be part of Jada's life,' said Soudelier. 'I was with her in the delivery room, and everything she was worried about was for Jada, not for herself.'","Chyna Young, 18, was left paralysed from the neck down after being shot several times .

Noel Polanco, 22, was posthumously promoted to sergeant at his funeral in Queens, New York on Friday, a week after he was killed by an officer who had pulled his car over for driving erratically. Detective Hassan Hamdy claimed he pulled the trigger after seeing Polanco, who was unarmed, reach for the car's floorboard, yet his passenger said he never took his hands from the wheel. Friends and family members, including . his mother and siblings, were overcome with emotion as they paid tribute . to Polanco and sobbed as they clutched his lifeless body dressed in . uniform. A mother's grief: Cecilia Reyes looks down at the body of her son, National Guardsman Noel Polanco, at his funeral on Friday. He was shot dead by a police officer during a traffic stop on October 4 . Remembered: Pall bearers carry the casket of Polanco from the Eternal Love Baptist Church in Queens . Loss: Polanco, 22, was promoted posthumously to sergeant as colleagues remembered him as devoted . His mother, Cecilia Reyes, addressed the flag-draped coffin bearing her son in the Eternal Love Baptist Church in Corona, Queens as she paid tribute, the New York Post reported. 'My son was an amazing child,' she said. 'My son was an angel, and I'm going to miss him with all my heart.' Of the promotion, First Sgt. Gregory Sinclair said, to cheers from the mourners: 'This is a promotion for outstanding accomplishments and service.' 'They say the Army is like a family and I can tell you that saying is correct,' added Capt. Dan Colon. 'Noel was a good soldier. Always wanted to participate and always wanted to help.' Reverend Al Sharpton eulogized Polanco and reminded mourners he had dreamed of becoming a New York City police officer. 'Why are we here?' he said. 'No crime. No weapon. No record. 'There is nothing this young man did to be here today. He was as right as you can get. He was a right as real folk can get.' Speaking about the police, he added: 'When you saw him you saw a suspect. When he really was a sergeant. You saw a gang member. His gang was the U.S. Army.'

Farewell: Reyes is comforted by Rev. Al Sharpton as she stands over the body of her son . Missed: Rev. Al Sharpton eulogised Polanco. 'There is nothing this young man did to be here today,' he said . After the service, Polanco's remains were buried with military honors. 'I want my brother to rest in peace,' Sgt. Jonathan Polanco, Polanco's brother, told the New York Times. 'But along with peace, you need to have justice as well.' Justice is being worked on: Conflicting accounts of the events leading to his death have led New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly to call for a grand jury investigation into the shooting. Polanco was killed on October 4 when Hamdy, a former Marine and 14-year veteran of the NYPD, fired a single bullet during an early-morning traffic stop near La Guardia Airport.

But witness Diane DeFerrari, 37, a bartender whom Polanco was driving . home from her work at a Queens nightclub, said Polanco's hands never . left the wheel. After the shooting, Ms DeFerrari said she and a backseat passenger, an off-duty NYPD officer, were ordered out and told to put their hands on the car. 'The cop said, ""Your friend just shot himself"",' said Ms DeFerrari. 'I didn’t dispute what I saw because I was afraid. They wouldn’t let me look at him.' Crime scene: Polanco was shot near LaGuardia Airport by an officer who said the man reached for the floorboard of his car. No weapon was found and a grand jury investigation will be carried out . The officer riding in Mr Polanco’s . car, 29-year-old Vanessa Rodriguez, was waving her police ID out the . window just before the shooting, sources said. Karasyk said Hamdy, who has lost his job since the shooting, is 'more than eager' to tell his side of the story to investigating authorities. His 'pulling the trigger did not occur in a bubble,' said . Karasyk. 'Way before that happened, the driver was acting in such a . manner as to continuously raise the level of threat' to the police.

A former volunteer firefighter has pleaded guilty to setting a fatal fire in 1986 that killed a Connecticut couple one year before he was dismissed for having a suspicious knack for finding fires. Peter Waraksa, nicknamed 'Pyro Pete' by fellow firefighters in East Windsor, pleaded guilty on Thursday to two counts of negligent homicide, arson and burglary. The 50-year-old was arrested in July 2010 – more than 23 years after the crimes – in connection with the deaths of 59-year-old Orie Weeks and his wife, 57-year-old Assunta Weeks. Guilty: Former volunteer firefighter Peter Waraksa has pleaded guilty to setting a 1986 fire that killed a Connecticut couple in their home more than 23 years ago . The couple were found dead in their home on Oct. 7 one year before Waraksa was dismissed by the Warehouse Point Volunteer Fire Department in 1987 on suspicion of setting fires throughout the area according to an arrest report. A retired fire chief and fire marshal of Warehouse Point told investigators in 2010 that the number of brush, grass and structure fires significantly increased after Waraksa became a firefighter. He said 45 fires were found within a one-mile radius of his home between 1984 and 1987. He was also said to often be the first to arrive at fires, called in many himself, and found grass and wood fires no other firefighter could find. Dismissed: Waraksa, nicknamed Pyro Pete, was dismissed by this East Windsor firehouse in 1987 after the area saw an increase in fires and Waraksa showed a suspicious nose for finding them . Laurence Johnson, a retired East Windsor police officer, told police he was surprised when arriving at the 1986 fire that killed the Weeks couple and seeing Waraksa immediately there in full uniform. Pleading guilty to two counts of negligent homicide, third-degree arson and second-degree burglary, Waraksa was sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison with 10 years of parole following. At the time of Waraksa's arrest in 2010 he was already serving an unrelated five-year prison sentence issued in 2007 for sexually assaulting five boys.","Peter Waraksa, nicknamed 'Pyro Pete' by fellow firefighters, has been sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison .

A Philadelphia woman known as 'the Black Madam' performed deadly cosmetic surgery on a London dancer in an airport hotel room - then used Krazy Glue to close the wounds, a court was told. A judge upheld a third-degree murder charge against Padge Gordon after hearing that the client then went into respiratory distress. The victim's friend, Theresa Gyamfi, testified about getting silicone injections to enlarge their buttocks in February 2011. She said that Gordon gave them the injections in their room at the Hampton Inn, and then left when 20-year-old Claudia Aderotimi started having trouble breathing. Pumping: Padge Victoria Windslowe, 42, also known as the 'Black Madam,' stood trial today on allegations she administered illegal buttock-injections using silicone from Thailand and Krazy Glue . The Londoners had no contact . information for the woman, who they had met through an intermediary . online and knew only as 'Lillian'. Gyamfi, 22, said they had had the same procedure done by Gordon at the hotel months earlier and had no problems. They then came back for a 'touch-up.' But Aderotimi had trouble breathing almost immediately after the second . procedure, Gyamfi said. Aderotimi died at a hospital hours later. Gordon, who remains in jail on . $750,000 bond, looked down at the defense table when Gyamfi described . learning of her friend's death and viewing the body at the hospital. Delaware County Medical Examiner . Frederic Hellman testified that the industrial-grade silicone went into . the woman's blood, liver, lungs and brain. He said Aderotimi died of a . pulmonary embolism. Dead: Claudia Aderotimi believed a 'bigger booty' would help her to appear in more music videos, according to her distraught friends . Defense lawyer Christopher Mannix . said he plans to challenge those medical conclusions at trial, along . with allegations his client performed the injections. The 42-year-old Gordon, also known as Padge Windslowe, is also charged with practicing medicine without a license. Police believe Gordon has performed . at least 14 cosmetic surgeries, moving locations and using different . names to avoid detection. They investigated Aderotimi's death . for 18 months, with help from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, . before filing the murder charges. In the interim, Gordon was charged . with aggravated assault for allegedly injuring an exotic dancer at a New . Year's Eve 2011 'pumping party' in Philadelphia, when she allegedly . injected a group of dancers on a dining room table. Windslowe (pictured) has also been charged with . injuring an exotic dancer who spent two weeks in the hospital after she . was injected with silicone and Krazy Glue in a similar procedure . Black Madam: Windslowe has been jailed since March, when she was arrested on charges of administering a series of injections to an exotic dancer in Philadelphia . The injured woman spent two weeks in . the hospital with respiratory problems, after silicone particles . attached to her lungs were too small to remove surgically, her doctor . has said. In court Wednesday, Gyamfi explained why she and her childhood friend traveled to the U.S. 'We basically came here to get injections to enhance our figures,' she said. They also were celebrating . Aderotimi's upcoming birthday on the second trip. They paid Gordon about . $2,000 each on the first trip and $1,800 on the second trip for the . injections. Gordon arrived at the hotel room on . February 7, 2011, took needles from a bag and silicone from a jug to . enlarge the women's buttocks, and then closed the wounds with cotton . balls and glue, Gyamfi testified. Method: Windslowe is accused of injecting a substance she described as silicone into her client's buttocks and then sealing the wound with super glue (file photo) Gordon left the hotel after Aderotimi became ill - and told them to call an ambulance if she didn't get better, Gyamfi said. Gyamfi said she and her friend . thought Gordon was a nurse. But Mannix questioned whether they really . thought they were signing up for a legal procedure. Third-degree murder carries a potential 20- to 40-year sentence in Pennsylvania. 'She took a product meant for . industry and food grain and she injected it into a young woman who was . otherwise healthy, at age 20 ... who then died,' Assistant District . Attorney Bridget Kirn said. 'That is ... clear, clear evidence of malice, and disregard of the known and unknown risks she caused to other unknown women.'","Padge Gordon to stand trial for murder after cosmetic procedure on Claudia Aderotimi .

The local news anchor who spoke out after a viewer criticised her for being overweight has now leapt to the defence of her attacker. Jennifer Livingston sprang to national fame after she denounced Kenneth Krause for saying that her weight meant she was not a 'suitable example' for her younger viewers. He apologised for the attack last week after Ms Livingston received a flood of supporting her brave stand against the bullying behaviour. But she now seems to have accepted his apology - and even said, 'I hope people leave him alone.' Scroll down for video . Weighty issue: Reporter Jennifer . Livingston responded to a viewer email that chided her over her weight . The anchor for WKBT in Wisconsin told TMZ she had 'no hard feelings' towards Mr Krause despite his unprovoked attack on her. 'I hope people kinda leave him behind and leave him alone,' she continued. Ms Livingston said she was pleased to have started a national debate about bullying, adding: 'I just think it's a discussion that needs to happen across the country.' Mr Krause on Friday told ABC News of his regret at criticising the anchor's weight, saying: 'I'm in no position to bully her.' He continued: 'She's a big media personality - I'm just a working stiff. If Jennifer's offended then I truly apologise to Jennifer, that's the last thing I wanted to do.' No offence: Kenneth Krause apologised for the attack which provoked a nationwide response . In his initial email to Ms Livingston, first published by her husband and fellow anchor Mike Thompson, the security guard wrote: 'Surely you don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young people, girls in particular.' An ABC reporter asked Mr Krause: 'She says she has a thyroid problem - did you consider any of that before writing the email?' 'Of course, I was obese as a child - I've been fighting with that all my life,' he said. 'Boy I can sure empathise with that.' Speaking about Mr Krause and his letter on the Today show, . Ms Livingston said she was more insulted by being called a . bad role model to young girls than by being called fat. 'The person called me obese and I can deal with that and being called fat, . but it was calling me a bad role model that really rubbed me the wrong way,' she said. Weight control: Mr Krause claims he was obese as a child and has had a life-time fight with his weight . 'Not . only for our community but in particular for young girls, I am a mother . of three young girls and I felt that was an unfair judgement of someone . who didn't know me. 'I have a pretty thick skin, I'm a tough gal and can handle this type of thing, but what I was . thinking instead was that I'm having conversations with my 10-year-old daughter right now about bullying. 'I'm trying to inspire her and teach her that if she sees bullying - the importance of taking a stand. 'But . what kind of message am I teaching her if my husband and I are talking . about this mean email I've received and I'm not taking a stand for . myself?' The letter that Mr Krause wrote to Ms Livingston states that he was 'surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years. 'Surely you . don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young . people, girls in particular.' Aftermath: Jennifer Livingston spoke to the . Today show about the comments saying she is trying to inspire her . daughter to take a stand against bullying . Husband's support: Anchor Mike Thompson, pictured left and with his wife Ms Livingston on the right, said he found the email infuriating when he first published it on his own Facebook page . After the issue became national news, Mr Krause was asked to explain why he made his comments. Though he refused to go on air, he released a statement saying: 'Given this country's present epidemic . of obesity and the many truly horrible diseases related thereto, and . considering Jennifer Livingston's fortuitous position in the community, I . hope she'll finally take advantage of a rare and golden opportunity to . influence the health and psychological well-being of Coulee region . children by transforming herself for all of her viewers to see over the . next year. 'And to that end I would be absolutely pleased to offer her any . advice or support she would be willing to accept.' His harsh words drew much criticism and caused a major debate across the U.S. Ms Livingston said on the Today show that though Mr Krause made a valid point about the dangers of obesity, she blasted his approach for being 'totally inappropriate'. 'I have never gone in public saying I am the shining example of what your health should be', she said. 'I've never said girls should aspire to have a body like mine, I've never told anyone to eat the way I do or exercise as much as I do. 'If someone wants to talk to me about the story I've covered then I am all about that. My job is to go out and report the news. But when you attack someone on a personal level it's not fair at all, I don't care if I'm in the public eye or not.' Admission: The anchor said, 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat' Hi Jennifer, . It's unusual that I see your morning show, but I did so for a very short . time today. I was surprised indeed to witness that your physical condition hasn't improved for many years. Surely you . don't consider yourself a suitable example for this community's young . people, girls in particular. Obesity is one of the worst choices a . person can make and one of the most dangerous habits to maintain. I . leave you this note hoping that you'll reconsider your responsibility as . a local public personality to present and promote a healthy lifestyle. In a special four-minute broadcast that aired before the news Ms Livingston spoke directly to her critic. She said she tried to laugh off the comment as she was so used to criticism from being in the public eye, but was encouraged by hundreds of supporters to speak out. She acknowledged: 'The truth is, I am overweight. You can call me fat - and yes, even obese on a doctor's chart. 'But to the person who wrote me that . letter, do you think I don't know that? That your cruel words are . pointing out something that I don't see? 'You don't know me. You are not a . friend of mine. You are not a part of my family, and you have admitted . you don't watch this show. 'You know nothing about me but what you see on . the outside, and I am much more than a number on a scale.' And perhaps to address the writer's comment that she was not a good role model for young people, she used the opportunity to focus on bullying, pointing out that October is anti-bullying month. Ms Livingston said: 'That man’s words mean . nothing to me, but really angers me about this is is there are children . who don’t know better - who get emails as critical as the one I . received, or in many cases even worse, each and every day. 'The internet has become a weapon and is passed down from people like that man to those who don't know any better. 'If . you are at home and you are talking about the fat news lady, guess . what? Your children are probably going to go to school and call someone . fat.' Standing up: Ms Livingston refused to give in to those who criticised her over her appearance . Viral: After Mr Thompson revealed the letter, messages of support for the couple started to flood in . She then thanked the hundreds of messages of support and courage she received from those in the community and further, saying it was 'overwhelming' and 'inspiring'. She finished the broadcast with a strong and powerful message: 'To all of the children out there who feel lost, who are struggling with your weight, with the color of your skin, your sexual preference, your disability, even the acne on your face, listen to me right now. 'Do not let your self-worth be defined by bullies. Learn from my experience - that the cruel words of one are nothing compared to the shouts of many.'

The 56-year-old Braveheart and Mad Max actor checked into the exclusive Miraval Spa in Tucson, Arizona, last week to attend a self-help 'behaviour modification programme'. Gibson, who divorced wife Robyn last December with the largest ever Hollywood payout of £250 million after 31 years of marriage, is on probation after last year pleading no contest to a charge of violence in 2010 against his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva. He was said by fellow guests on the course to be 'relaxed and happy' and spoke openly about wanting to improve his life. A source said: 'You always hear about ''Mad Mel'' but he couldn't have been nicer. 'He took part in many of the self-development courses, including meditation and equine therapy. 'He said he particularly enjoyed working with the horses.' According to the spa's website, the equine course involves using the horse 'as an energetic mirror' that might help people 'identify patterns of learned behaviour that either enhance or detract from the quality of life that you experience'. Part of the equine therapy involves learning how to communicate with the horse 'through gentle murmurs rather than screaming orders'. A fellow spa guest said: 'Mel has  been getting in touch with his inner child and learning to confront his demons.' Gibson's spokesman declined to comment.

One of the most prominent characters on the campaign trial in the wake of the first Presidential debate was Big Bird, the Sesame Street puppet beloved by millions but targeted by Republican nominee Mitt Romney. After the former Massachusetts governor took aim at PBS- and, as a result, Big Bird- during the debate, it was one of President Obama's top advisers who turned that comment into a major talking point. A profile in The New York Times details how Stephanie Cutter, one of the President's deputy campaign managers, turned the television puppet into a manifestation of Mitt Romney's vision. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Attack woman: Stephanie Cutter frequently appears both in Obama campaign videos or on news shows in support of the President's re-election campaign . 'She spotted right away that this was something that was trending out there and that was making an impact,' chief Obama strategist David Axelrod said. Two days after the debate, Ms Cutter posted a photo to Twitter of a person dressed as Big Bird at a Romney rally, with the caption 'looks like somebody showed up in (Virginia) to ruffle @mittromney's feathers'. Making the point even more clear, she included the hashtag #protectsesamestreetnotwallstreet. From there, the Big Bird argument picked up steam and the campaign went on to create a 30-second advertisement that jokingly compared notorious banking scammers like Bernie Madoff to the Sesame Street character who was described as 'big, yellow, a menace to our economy'. Picking a fight: Two days after the debate, Cutter used her Twitter feed to stoke the fire . Big bird: She tweeted this photo (left) and then the campaign created a similar television ad (right) Though Ms Cutter, 43, was not directly involved in the creation of the ad, the premise that she established in her original Tweet was very clearly the inspiration behind it. Ms Cutter has long been a prominent operative for Democratic candidates, but she has begun to step in front of the camera more frequently during this election as a result of the prominent role she holds and the degree to which she has made herself an integral part of the Obama administration. A close confidante to the late Senator Ted Kennedy, Ms Cutter first became involved with the Obamas when she helped arrange for former first daughter Caroline Kennedy's endorsement of the then-Senator from Illinois. When it came time for Obama to take the realm, she had already gone through her own battles within the party as she was given much of the blame for John Kerry's failed presidential bid in 2004, even though Mr Kerry defended her in saying that it was not her fault. With the boss: Cutter (left) is seen here in a Situation Room meeting with the President and then-chief of staff Bill Daley in July 2011 . Predecessor: She worked closely with John Kerry when he ran for President in 2004 against George W. Bush . The New York Times explains that following that fall from grace, she took what many viewed as a demotion by working with politicians seemingly in crisis mode: treasury secretary Timothy Geithner after the TARP bailout, and First Lady Michelle Obama after she made the gaffe in saying that her husband's nomination was the first time she was proud of her country. Friends say that it is Ms Cutter's exacting nature that has helped her handle even the most tricky of trouble spots, justifying why she was given the delicate assignment of telling then-Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor to tone down her earring selections in order to pass through her confirmation hearings. 'She has an attention to detail that builds huge confidence on the part of the people she works for and, I say this parenthetically, especially women,' Anita Dunn, former Obama White House communications director told The Times.",Stephanie Cutter is a deputy campaign manager for President Obama .

Federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Hotton of conning the 'Rebecca' producers by convincing them he had lined up $4.5 million in financing and the possibility of a $1.1 million loan for the show.

'Hotton concocted a cast of characters to invest in a major musical - investors who turned out to be deep-pocketed phantoms. To carry out the alleged fraud, Hotton faked lives, faked companies and even staged a fake death, pretending that one imaginary investor had suddenly died from malaria.' The planned Broadway production of the 1938 novel collapsed earlier this month amid questions about its financial backing, and a growing suspicion that one of its primary investors — a secretive businessman named Paul Abrams who had supposedly pledged $4.5 million, then suddenly died — never existed. Lead producer Ben Sprecher 'is extremely gratified that Mr. Hotton has been taken into custody,' said his attorney, Ronald Russo, adding that Sprecher has 'cooperated completely with the investigation.' 'Mr. Hotton's fraudulent conduct did enormous damage to Broadway and to 'Rebecca,'' Russo said. 'Mr. Sprecher is totally committed to bringing 'Rebecca' to New York.' Hotton was charged with two counts of wire fraud, each punishable by up to 20 years in prison. His attorney, Heath Berger, did not immediately return a call for comment. According to the criminal complaint unsealed Monday, Hotton tricked the producers into believing he had secured the money from four overseas investors, who weren't real. The producers agreed to pay Hotton $15,000 in fees and commissions between March and June 2012, prosecutors said. He was also paid an additional $18,000 'advance' against his 8 percent commission, they said. The final curtain? Although Broadway productions are always cloak-and-dagger operations, the financial wrangling behind Rebecca has left many in the theater community stunned . When it became obvious that investors' commitments would fall through, Hotton allegedly tried to broker a $1.1 million loan for the producers, prosecutors said. The prosecutors say Hotton 'enlisted his same cast of invisible men to carry out a real estate scam.' They did not name the Connecticut real estate company. Hotton also was accused of using a similar scheme to con a Connecticut-based real estate company into paying $750,000 to him and entities he controlled, Manhattan prosecutors said. Drama: Ben Sprecher's production of Rebecca has been left with a $4.5million shortfall . In the separate Long Island case, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn accused Hotton and his wife of cheating business partners out of $3.7 million. An indictment alleges that the couple, while operating three electrical contracting companies, created fake invoices showing money owed by third parties. They then allegedly sold the purported debts to other companies. It was revealed last week, according to the New York Times, that Mr Sprecher had never even met Abrams. Mr Sprecher confirmed to the Times . that his cast would be paid this week but rehearsals delayed until new, . unnamed investors paid up. Sprecher, a seasoned off-Broadway . producer, had dealt with Abrams only by phone after his leading investor . canceled a trip to New York for a face-to-face meeting. After Abram's death, Mr Sprecher flew to London to try and extract money from his investor's estate. However he never met any representative in person, dealing only with 'Wexler' by email. The disappearance of such a wealthy investor left a huge hole in funding for the $12million musical. It also left Sprecher's companies liable for millions of dollars to other investors. Robert E. Wankel, a major Broadway . player, invested a vast sum . in Rebecca and owns the Broadhurst Theater where it is intended to be . staged come November. He told the Times: 'Broadway does business in its own . strange way, I’ll grant you. But this is the . strangest bit of show business to come along in a long time.' On the show's website it states that rehearsals for Rebecca have been postponed due to the 'tragic death of one of Rebecca's key investors'. Star attractions: Performers Jill Paice and Ryan Silverman were due to take lead roles in the Broadway production of Rebecca . Show must go on? The Rebecca billboards adorn the Broadhurst Theater close to Times Square in Manhattan . However, tickets are still available for purchase via the website.

Clear vision: Britain's biggest trade union, Unite, has set up a new wing - which can only be joined by the unemployed. The union's leader Len McCluskey is pictured . Britain’s biggest trade union has set up a new wing – which can only be joined by the unemployed. Tory MPs said it was ‘scandalous’ that Unite, led by the hard-Left former docker Len McCluskey, was trying to exploit benefit claimants for political and financial purposes. In return for £26 a year in ‘subs’,  the jobless members of Unite Community receive perks including discount designer glasses, advice on ‘claiming the right benefits’ and a  pre-paid debit card offering cashback in high street stores. The union, which is a key backer of the Labour Party, last month called for the first general strike in the UK since 1926 in protest at the Government’s austerity measures. Benefit claimants will bear a significant part of the impending public spending cuts, with Chancellor George Osborne planning to slash an extra £10 billion from the welfare budget. But the recruitment drive could also help to shore up Unite’s bank balance: the union has been shedding members at a dramatic rate in recent years,  losing 262,740 of its 1.4 million strength since 2007. This decline has alarmed Labour, which has received more than £6 million in donations from the union since Ed Miliband became leader. A new poster campaign, timed to coincide with an anti-austerity rally on Saturday, will promote Unite  Community as ‘the union for people who aren’t in paid work’. It claims membership ‘provides a way people can find and use their political voice’. Other perks include a debit card that offers six per cent cashback at ‘high street retailers’, a tax-refund service – under which the union checks whether the member has overpaid tax when in work, and takes a cut of any refund – and a ‘welfare benefits check-up’ to target the ‘millions of pounds per year that goes unclaimed by  people who are entitled to benefits’. Members are also entitled to discount vouchers from Vision Express, and can get deals including ‘designer 2-for-1 glasses’. Those who find work again no longer qualify to belong to Unite Community. If they then switch to full membership of the union, it will cost them £132 a year. Controversial: A new poster campaign, timed to coincide with an anti-austerity rally on Saturday, will promote Unite Community as 'the union for people who aren't in paid work' Last night Tory deputy chairman Sarah Newton said: ‘It is scandalous that Labour’s largest donor, Unite – which backed Ed Miliband for the leadership – is looking to politically mobilise the unemployed and plug its falling membership subs. ‘The public expects trade unions to protect the rights of their members in the workplace – not try to fill gaps in their funding off  the back of the unemployed. Is  Ed Miliband really comfortable taking money from a union that  is acting in such a cynical way?’ A Unite spokesman said last night: ‘I am surprised that the Tories  are opposed to us trying to help people to get back to work. ‘This is an effective way of  giving unemployed people  and students the access to financial and employment advice, which they lack. ‘It is complete nonsense to suggest that we are trying to “mobilise” benefit claimants for political purposes, or as a new way to fill up our coffers.’","Tory MPs said it was ‘scandalous’ that .

A three-year-old boy who suffered a massive stroke in the womb has stunned doctors by learning to walk, talk and see in time for his first day at nursery. Liam Maule was delivered six weeks early in August 2009 after midwives could not find his heartbeat.While twin sister Laura was born healthy, Liam had experienced massive bleeding in the left side of his brain and was severely brain damaged. The stroke could have killed an adult and mother Rosie, 34, and father Jason, 37, from Swindon, were warned he would not develop normally. Liam, now aged 3 (left), suffered a brain bleed while still in the womb. He has surprised doctors with his progress and can now walk and talk. Pictured, right, aged one, wearing electrodes during a brain scan . But now Liam has joined his sister at preschool, where he is walking, talking, and can see to a distance of six metres. Rosie, from Swindon, said: 'As far as I knew, I had been carrying healthy twins, until I had a routine checkup when they couldn’t find his heartbeat. 'I knew my children had to be delivered as quickly as possible. I was rushed for an emergency c-section. 'Laura came out first, crying at the top of her lungs. Liam came out two minutes later, but he wasn’t crying. The quiet made me panic. 'I was able to hold Liam for a few minutes and I noticed his thumbs were sticking into his hands. I thought it was just a result of how he had been positioned in the womb.' But two days later, a CAT scan revealed that Liam had suffered bleeding in his brain while he was still in the womb, five days before he was delivered. Doctors battled to stabilise Liam by attaching him to a drip and boosting his immune system, but there was little they could do other than wait to see what happened. Rosie, who split with Liam’s father before the birth, was told her son was still bleeding and she should prepare for the worst. She said: 'Tears were streaming down my face. I couldn’t believe what was happening. 'I was told to consider Liam’s quality of life. If the bleeding didn’t stop and the brain damage got worse, I would have to prepare to let Liam go. 'I told the doctor I didn’t want to have to make that choice. I couldn’t face turning off a life-support machine.' Liam (right) pictured with his twin sister Laura who was unaffected in the womb. Their mother said it was difficult seeing their different rates of progress . Liam learnt to walk with the help of a walker aged two . Even if Liam survived, he would be left with 14 serious health conditions, including cerebral palsy, microcephaly disorder, epilepsy, swelling on the brain, and respiratory problems. Rosie said: 'The news was like a slap in the face. Doctors told me it was unlikely that Liam would ever walk or see. 'The part of his brain which affects his speech was also heavily damaged, so talking was another milestone he would find difficult to reach.' Incredibly, Liam survived and left hospital three months later to join Laura, brother Lewis, 13, and sisters Erin, seven, and Emily, 15, at home. By the end of the year, doctors were amazed at his progress. Rosie said: 'He first started seeing shadows at nine months old. Shortly after his first birthday he reached out for a teddy bear. 'I got the video camera out and videoed him doing it again. I couldn’t believe he could recognise it. 'His first words were ‘dada’ and ‘dandan’ - his godfather Daniel. He can now say ‘Daniel’ as well, and uses that for ‘serious conversation’ like asking him if he can use his iPad. 'When he took his first steps in June this year I thought it was a miracle. 'My biggest fear was that he wouldn’t be able to walk. A defining moment was at his godfather’s wedding in July 2011, when he walked down the aisle. 'We were so proud of him making his own way down with his zimmer frame covered in ribbons and bows. 'When Liam walked into the consultant’s room for his most recent CAT scan in March, our doctor couldn’t quite believe it. 'Looking at the scan of his brain he turned to me and said ‘Rosie, he shouldn’t be doing any of this. Walking, talking - it’s incredible’.' Liam with his proud mother Rosie, from Swindon. Sadly Liam is not expected to survive beyond the age of 30 . Last month Rosie proudly dropped Liam and Laura off at the Coleview Preschool in Swindon, where his progress has continued. Preschool keyworker Sandra Cullen said: 'I first met Liam in January and it’s amazing how much he’s improved since then. 'He’s settled in extremely well. He loves playing with the other children and he’s very popular . 'He has developed beyond what anyone expected, both physically and in his level understanding. He is very communicative.' Although strokes are usually associated with adults, around 400 infants and children are affected by the condition each year. Consultant pediatric neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, Dr Mike Carter, said Liam’s continual improvement can be partially attributed to the fitting of a tube which drains excess fluid from Liam’s brain to his stomach, where it can be absorbed. Liam’s young brain has been better able to adapt to the trauma caused by the stroke. Dr Carter said: 'Children up to seven years old have increased plasticity, allowing functions within the brain to swap from one side to the other. 'The stroke Liam suffered is often fatal in adults. Children have a great capacity for recovery. 'In Liam’s case, functions of the brain on the left side, which had been damaged, have been taken over by the right side.' Rosie believes Liam has also responded well to her use of music, light and sound therapy in his daily routine. She said: 'Music therapy is his favourite. He loves Adele, as he knows that means nap time. Before Liam arrived, I took developmental milestones for granted. 'I’ve always taken photos when my children get their first pair of shoes. Unfortunately, when I took Laura to get her first pair, Liam wasn’t walking and had some problems with his feet. 'Watching Laura pose for photos, it saddened me that her brother couldn’t be there too. 'Twins are meant to do everything together, but she walked before him, talked before him - she did everything before him. Liam (left) pictured with sister Laura aged one month old . Liam in an incubator two days after he was born. He needs constant care and medication . 'I wasn’t giving up though - I wanted that photo. I got it, a year later, when Liam was ready for his first pair of shoes. It was an emotional day, but everything is more emotional with Liam. 'It seems unfair that, of the two twins, Liam had to draw the short straw. I have no idea why it happened to him and not Laura, apart from that she was always the more dominant one in the womb. Scans showed her to be heavier and taking up more room. 'It is a struggle to watch them grow up side by side, knowing that their lives will be so different.' Rosie has been advised that Liam, who needs constant care and medication to control his various health conditions, is unlikely to live beyond 30 years old. Despite the heartache and challenges, Rosie says she draws strength from Liam every day. She has started a Facebook group, called Eye Love Liam, to give hope families in similar circumstances. She said: 'I’m so proud of everything that Liam has achieved. It’s really inspiring. 'I want to raise awareness, not just of the fact that babies and children can suffer from strokes, but also of ways that parents can encourage progress. 'I started the ‘Eye Love Liam’ campaign to share my experiences with other mums in my position and let them know there is hope for the future.'","Mother told she had to prepare to let her son go, after he suffered a brain bleed five days before he was born .

A veteran who served in Iraq for 14 months has been denied in-state tuition by the University of North Carolina as she moved away briefly to a base in Texas where her husband was stationed. Hayleigh Perez, 26, left the state for just six months in 2009 but continued paying the mortgage and taxes on their Raeford, North Carolina property, which they have owned since 2006. Yet when Perez went to use her G.I. Bill for classes at UNC in Pembroke, near her husband's base in Fort Bragg, she was told she did not qualify as a state resident because of her time away from it. Officials said she had not paid income tax in North Carolina during her time in Texas and Iraq - even though she had been moved on orders from the Army. Rejected: Hayleigh Perez, with her daughter Calleigh, was denied tuition as part of the G.I. Bill by the University of North Carolina as she had not paid state taxes when she moved away - on the army's orders . 'I got frustrated. When I tried to inquire, they kept putting up roadblocks,' she told FoxNews.com. 'It’s just disgraceful that life in Iraq, where you could die, is easier than trying to go to school here.' Perez told the news channel that she enlisted in 2005 and was stationed in Fort Bragg, where she trained as a radiology technologist. She was later sent to Camp Bucca in Iraq, where she met fellow soldier, Jose Perez-Rodriguez. They married and when they returned to the U.S. in 2006, they bought a home in Raeford. They lived there until 2009, when Perez-Rodriguez was assigned to a base in Texas. 'We were simply living there temporarily on orders from the United States Army,' she told WREG. Perez returned to the home in 2009 and . left the military that September. She went on to have her daughter, . Calleigh, and began looking to the future - and different career . options. Military family: Hayleigh was sent to Iraq in 2006 for 14 months, where she met her husband Jose . The G.I. Bill was enacted in 1944 following World War II to help soldiers readjust into civilian life. It gave them help with loans, education and living expenses. There have been numerous amendments since. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers financial support for education and housing to people who have served in the U.S. military for at least 90 days after September 10, 2001. To receive the support, soldiers must have been honorably discharged from duty. The benefits last for 15 years following release from active duty and provide 36 months of coverage. The Bill covers full tuition and fees paid directly to the school for public school, in-state students. Some funds are covered for private or foreign schools but they are capped. It covers training including undergraduate and graduate degrees, vocational training and flight training. She began applying for colleges to study for a master's as a physicians assistant, and was accepted to UNC's Fayetteville and Pembroke. When she began studying at Pembroke, she was stunned when officials said she was not considered an in-state resident. In an unfortunate twist, UNC Fayetteville said she was. She appealed the decision and said she was met with 'hostility and aggression'. Again, it was denied. She later learned she was rejected as she had not paid income tax in North Carolina in the years in which she was in Iraq and Texas. 'The process was demeaning,' she told . Fox. 'They [Pembroke] treated me so poorly I felt like I was a criminal . on trial. They told me I couldn’t reapply.' Sgt. Jason Thigpen, founder and . president of the Student Veterans Advocacy Group, added that nearly . 250,000 other veterans have to pay for their tuition because of 'adverse . and short-sighted changes our federal government made'. A . spokesperson for UNC did not comment on the specific case but denied it . would be granting in-school tuition for illegal immigrants, as had . previously been debated. Perez launched a petition on Change.org and has gathered 120,000 signatures in five days. The Students Veterans Advocacy group, . which is representing Perez, and where she now runs social networking, . will sue UNC and the federal government if the decision is not reversed. Support: Even when they moved to a Texas base for six months, they paid property tax in North Carolina . Battle: Even after she appealed, UNC Pembroke refused to help her tuition so she left the school . 'Hundreds of thousands of veterans across the country are facing an arduous battle proving their residency to a state - because of the unique circumstances that encompass our military duties,' she told WREG. 'We need and deserve the Post-9/11 GI Bill Benefits we have rightfully earned through blood, sweat, and often tears.' She added that she would not be returning to UNC-Pembroke and is now taking classes at a private college. 'I don't want to be associated with an institution that treats veterans this way,' she said.","Hayleigh Perez, 26, denied tuition as she did not pay income tax in North Carolina when she was sent to Iraq and Texas - on the Army's orders .

Busted: Brian Lanza had been cited in the melee, and turned himself in to police on Monday . A second man faces felony charges in a brawl between two wedding parties that was caught on video at a downtown Philadelphia hotel. Prosecutors said Westfield, New Jersey, resident Brian Lanza, 29, was charged Tuesday with aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy and other counts in the October 7 fight at a hotel in the city's Society Hill section. Lanza was one of the wedding guests who had been cited for allegedly attacking one of the police officers who responded to the scene. He was charged with aggravated assault, resisting arrest and criminal conspiracy, according to the Philadelphia Inquirier. The altercation involved dozens of people in ball gowns and tuxedos and was caught on tape by a teenage hotel guest as dozens of police struggled to break up the fracas. Authorities said a 57-year-old man suffered a fatal heart attack. Investigators have been reviewing the video and Lanza is the second person facing felony charges. A message at a telephone listing for him said the number was not accepting calls. Last week, brother-of-the-groom Matthew Sofka denied assaulting a police officer and said he intends to fight all charges against him. Sofka, 26, was taken into custody after the violent melee broke out at the Sheraton Society Hill hotel. Charged: Matthew Sofka, 26, from New Jersey denies all charges against him after he was arrested, right, on Saturday at the wedding of his brother Michael and bride Nicole Sanutti . The dust-up - involving 50 to 100 people . - was caught on video by another guest and posted on YouTube. It has . since been watched more than 1,000,000 times. Sofka's attorney said his client neither assaulted police or resisted arrest. In fact, he said he was repeatedly struck by officer's batons and subdued with a stun gun. The wedding of his brother Michael Sofka to Nicole Sanutti had taken place in another venue nearby but some of the guests returned to the Sheraton later where they were staying. There, they ran into trouble with the other wedding party. Attorney Fortunato Perri Jr said the fight was already underway when Sofka arrived at the hotel and that he did not assault the officers. 'He has the highest respect for law enforcement. His father is a retired police officer. 'There was absolute chaos going on from a prior incident,' he told Philly.com last Tuesday, adding that there was still no idea as to how it started. The wedding of Michael Sofka and Nicole Sannuti ended in tragedy after a drunken brawl between two wedding parties claimed the lif of her uncle and left the groom's brother in jail . The bride's uncle Vincent Sanutti, 57, suffered a heart attack in the hotel parking lot and was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Mr Perri said: 'This was supposed to be a joyous and . happy affair, but it turned into tragedy. It was bedlam . when they walked in there.' Hotel guest Max Schultz, 15, videotaped the 2am altercation. He was not a part of either wedding party. Police said Sofka, Lanza and another man, who was not identified, punched and kicked Officer Sean Dandridge, striking him in the head. Yesterday, a picture was released of the bride and groom before their wedding day with details of what Nicole Sanutti expected her big day to be like - none of which included a brawl. The 28-year-old planned everything on social-media website Pinterest and it shows she was planning a fairytale day, rather than the nightmare it turned out to be. On her page, she pinned links to the perfect cake, sparkly centerpieces, hairstyles and shadow boxes to hold her wedding memorabilia. Chaos: Police can be seen wrestling with wedding guests (right) while the horrified bride watches the brawl unfold (left) Break it up: Officers can be seen using their batons to untangle two wrestling guests. Two people were cited and one was arrested . One pin suggested a heart-felt message . written on the sole of a bride's shoe from a groom. Another showed . unique floral arrangements and even a tree on which guests leave their . fingerprints. She was also taken with a service where you can stitch the date of the wedding in the hem of the dress. Nicole will never be able to forget the date of her big day, but for very different reasons than she hoped. In the video, women can be heard screaming as men shove each other around near the wedding party table. Suddenly, Philadelphia police can be seen charging into the reception with nightsticks and . pulling fighting wedding guests off each other. Hotel guests . said up to 100 cops showed up to control the 50 to 100 wedding guests . who were fighting. Melee: Police say that two wedding receptions were taking place at the hotel and a fight broke out near the bar . At least five officers can be seen yanking the combatants away from each other. Tragedy: The bride's uncle reportedly died outside the wedding reception fight, which broke out at the Sheraton Society Hill hotel in Philadelphia . Police and hotel guests said the fights appeared to be fueled by alcohol. 'Did they just deck the bride?' the man behind the camera asks at one point. Lt Ray Evers, police spokesman, said it's still not clear what sparked the fights. 'I don't have a solid answer how it started,' he said, 'but we had to come in and clean it up.' More arrests are expected as police . interview more guests and responding police officers, and as they pore . over additional surveillance footage. Contrary to the poster's assertion, the video does not appear to show that one of the brides was punched. A woman in a wedding dress can be seen standing outside the fray.","Brian Lanza charged with felony assault for his role in October 7 wedding fracas in Philadelphia .

A woman of 24 who cannot conceive naturally must wait six years before she is eligible for IVF treatment on the National Health Service. Andrea Heywood, a nursery nurse, was left infertile after a childhood illness. When she and her husband Aaron applied for fertility treatment to their primary care trust, NHS Portsmouth, they were told that they would not be considered until she turned 30.

National guidelines suggest that . women should be eligible for IVF from the age of 23, but this is not an . obligation and each trust is free to impose its own restrictions, . creating a postcode lottery. The couple, who married three years . ago, say they are the victims of age discrimination and that delaying . treatment could reduce their chances of conceiving. Mrs Heywood said: ‘It is bad enough . not to be able to have children naturally, but this is like someone is . saying, “No, you can’t have children – you have got to wait”. ‘I feel guilty for my husband because I am the one with the problem. I feel as if I have let him down.’ Mrs Heywood suffered severe scarring . to her fallopian tubes at the age of six when her appendix burst, and it . was confirmed later that she was infertile. St James' Hospital, Portsmouth. n Portsmouth, a woman must be aged 30-34 to qualify for an NHS funded cycle of treatment . The couple were bitterly disappointed . when they were turned down three times for a free round of fertility . treatment worth £5,000. They initially threatened to sue the . trust in a strongly worded legal letter, but decided not to pursue their . case through the courts when NHS chiefs refused to back down. Mr Heywood, 25, said: ‘We have just got to wait or find the money ourselves. ‘Some people might say it is not a lot of money to have children but it is a lot of money if you have not got it. ‘All our friends from school and college are having children now. So when we go round to see them it can be upsetting.’ The National Institute for Clinical . Excellence (NICE) states that couples should be considered for free IVF . between the ages of 23 and 39, and is considering expanding its criteria . for free treatment. Recent draft guidelines recommend . scrapping the lower age limit and suggest infertility should be treated . as soon as possible because the chances of success decline with age. The rationing body is also considering offering IVF to women aged 40 to 42, and extending it to gay and lesbian couples. However, NHS Portsmouth provides free IVF only for women aged 30 to 34. The couple’s lawyer, Louisa Ghevaert . of solicitors Porter Dodson, said: ‘NICE guidance is not mandatory and . it remains to be seen whether the new draft proposals will bring greater . recognition of IVF as a legitimate clinical need. ‘We need greater fairness in . accessing fertility treatment on the NHS for couples like  Andrea and . Aaron who are battling with the postcode lottery and varying . restrictions imposed by PCTs, which continue to flout the guidance . across the country.’ NHS Portsmouth was unavailable for comment.","Andrea Heywood must wait until she's 30 to qualify for a free round of treatment .

A young girl with cerebral palsy who dreams of being a ballet dancer, is one step closer after a life-changing operation in America. Ria Stonehouse, six, underwent an operation on her back and legs to help her walk totally independently. Now just six weeks after the operation, the schoolgirl has been able to walk 18 steps without a walking frame or sticks. Write caption here . Ria’s mother Michelle, 32, and father Paul, 47, spent almost two years trying to raise the £50,000 to take her to St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri as the procedure - called a selective dorsal rhizotomy - is not widely available in Britain. During the operation surgeons gain access to the nerve roots in the spinal cord by opening up one vertebra. The abnormal nerve roots causing the spasticity are identified by . electrical stimulation. The nerves that are not 'transmitting' effectively are . partially cut. Physiotherapy is then essential to build up the leg muscles as they are weaker through not being used. It means that Ria, from Dukinfield in Greater Manchester, could soon take ballet classes. Mrs Stonehouse said: 'The hospital was amazing and all the staff were so nice and so kind. Even the day after the operation her legs were very different. 'She can now move her toes separately and I’ve noticed she can tap her foot in time to music - before it was her whole leg. 'They’re small changes and most people just take those things for granted but to us they’re amazing to see and it makes a massive difference to us.' Her family and friends worked tirelessly for almost two years to organise fundraising events including charity nights, sponsored slimming, walks and runs, coffee mornings and dress down days. While the operation is complete, Ria now faces months of gruelling physiotherapy to build her strength and coordination. Mrs Stonehouse added: 'She can now stand very, very straight and her doctors believe that within six months she can move on to the sticks all the time and then in a year or so, hopefully, she will walk independently. 'We’re so grateful to everyone who’s helped us do this, we just wish there was more awareness in this country of the procedure so that parents have a choice.'",Ria now faces intense physiotherapy to build up the leg muscles she hasn't used properly before .

Nonamum: Pregnant Mexican woman Karla Perez, who is expecting six girls and three boys . Proud father: Karla's husband Bernardo . The doctor said the health authority would now be investigating the claims and planned to find out if Perez really is . pregnant, according to TMZ. Perez, who already has triplets, was . described as coming from the north-eastern state of Coahuila, which . borders the U.S. state of Texas. She claims she is being treated for the pregnancy at a hospital in the state capital Saltillo, the broadcaster said in the report. Perez, whose age was not given, said she had fertility treatment with her husband Bernardo leading to the multiple pregnancy, it said. State-owned news agency Notimex also reported the pregnancy, saying Perez was due to give birth on May 20. 'It's very early to think of names for the babies,' Perez told Notimex. 'First I hope that everything goes well.' The successful delivery of nonuplets would be one of the highest multiple births ever recorded. The garage where Karla's mechanic husband Bernardo works .

Greek, ennea. Karla Vanessa Perez's children are not the first nonuplets to be born, but if they all live they will be the first to survive. A set was born on June 13, 1971 in Sydney, Australia, to Geraldine Brodrick. None of the five boys and four girls lived. Two were stillborn and the last to survive died six days after birth. Nonuplets were also born on March 26, 1999, in Malaysia to Zurina Mat Saad. She had five boys and four girls (Adam, Nuh, Idris, Soleh, Hud, Aishah, Khadijah, Fatimah and Umi Kalsom) but none of them survived more than six hours.

Argentina declared British oil exploration off the Falklands 'illegal' and immediately set about suing five companies for . pursuing activities around the contested islands. Britain . responded almost immediately, saying the islanders were entitled to . develop their own natural resources and it was Buenos Aires that was . breaking the law with its campaign of harassment and intimidation. 'These . latest attempts to damage the economic livelihoods of the Falkland . Islands people regrettably reflect a pattern of behavior by the . Argentine government,' a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Row: Argentina has declared British oil exploration off the disputed Falkland Islands 'illegal' 'From . harassing Falklands shipping to threatening the islanders' air links . with Chile, Argentina's efforts to intimidate the Falklands are illegal, . unbecoming and wholly counter-productive.' Argentina last month pressed Britain in a diplomatic note to let it launch direct flights to the islands. Three . decades after the Falklands War, the promise of oil reserves is . inflaming tensions between Britain and Argentina while also boosting the . economic hopes of the islanders - estimated to number just 3,140. Britain . has ruled the archipelago - 8,000 miles (12,900 kilometers) from its . own shores and less than 300 miles off the southern coast of Argentina -  since 1833 as a self-governing overseas territory. Argentina says it acquired the windswept islands, which it calls the Malvinas, from Spain in 1816. On . April 2, 1982, Argentine forces invaded and occupied the Falkland . Islands and South Georgia, a smaller island governed by Britain further . out in the South Atlantic. Anger: Argentine President Cristina Kirchner on Monday declared the British oil hunting activity 'illegal and clandestine' Britain dispatched a naval task force . and regained control of the islands when the Argentine forces . surrendered on June 14, but not before 649 Argentine and 255 British . servicemen had died. The renewed war of words over the Falklands has intensified around the 30th anniversary of the bloody 74-day conflict. Argentine . President Cristina Kirchner on Monday declared the British oil hunting . activity 'illegal and clandestine' and accused the firms of operating 'in the sovereign area of the Argentine nation.' Her government said the classification formally paved the way for criminal proceedings to begin. 'The . declaration of clandestineness clears the way for the immediate launch . of civil and criminal action against these businesses,' said a foreign . ministry statement that spoke of seeking fines and penalties. It . said the Argentine government would soon be in communication with . Britain's Treasury, its Financial Services Authority, the International . Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the New York Stock . Exchange. Argentina first announced in March that it intended to . take legal action against the British oil concerns but it has never made . clear how it intends to go about it or where it intends to file suit. The . companies -- Desire Petroleum, Falkland Oil and Gas, Rockhopper . Exploration, Borders and Southern Petroleum and Argos Resources -  'are . not authorized by the Argentine government under law,' read a resolution . published Monday in Argentina's Official Bulletin by Energy Secretary . Daniel Cameron. The islands' oil reserves, which have remained . untapped until now but which analysts predict could be worth tens of . billions of dollars, have been a major source of tension between the . countries since their discovery in 1998. At the time, a barrel of . crude sold for less than $10 - today it would fetch $125 - and firms . led by Anglo-Dutch energy giant Shell abandoned their exploration on the . grounds it was not profitable enough. The rocketing price of oil . since then has enticed the five companies back to the islands, hoping to . cash in on what might be one of the world's last new sources of fossil . fuels. To Argentina's dismay, drilling resumed in 2010 with Rockhopper and Desire Petroleum taking the lead. Three . small companies followed suit, but until now only Rockhopper - named . after one of the Falklands' resident penguin breeds - has confirmed . significant reserves, in the Sea Lion field to the north of the islands.

Pinault had criticised Evangelista for her outlandish demands, suggesting the money was in fact for 'mom support'; she maintained she was modelling or working on her image at all hours of the day. In a move that shows they are readying for a bitter feud, Evangelista's lawyer William Beslow recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006. 'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate. Attention: The model drew a scrum of photographers to the family court hearing in Manhattan . Surrounded: Ms Evangelista and her lawyer fought through the press pack on their way in to court . In court: Evangelista, seen undergoing a security check in the Manhattan court, claims she needs the large sum to cover around-the-clock nannies and armed drivers . Evangelista, who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby, the Post reported. 'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.' Arriving at court, Evangelista, 46, looked ready for business, dressed in a smart floral-print shirt, knee-length black skirt and sunglasses, with her hair cut into a sleek bob. Pinault, who began dating Hayak while Evangelista was pregnant, watched his former girlfriend with a bemused smile, the Post reported. As he took the witness stand, Pinault said he found out she was pregnant in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news. 'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' Hectic: Evangelista was spotted out with her son Augie, right, ahead of the court appearance . Motherly love: In court, Augie's father said he broke up with Evangelista when he found out she was pregnant . He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.' He went on to say he believed she had intentionally become pregnant and that he had no part in deciding whether she should keep the baby or not. He added: 'I told her I would recognize the baby, which I did. I would take my responsibility and I did.' Asked why he didn’t pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didn’t ask and I didn’t offer.' The 49-year-old is chief executive of PPR, . the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta. He has an annual income is heir to an $11.5 billion family estate. In opening statements on . Thursday, Beslow insisted Evangelista is not hoping to improve her . station in life but that she has paid all of his expenses without a . single cent from Pinault. 'Ms. Evangelista is not looking to piggyback on the lifestyle of Mr. Pinault,' Beslow added. 'She is looking for a continuation of the . reasonable lifestyle of Augie.' Happier times: Evangelista dated French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault for four months at the end of 2005 . Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court . Pinault's . lawyer, David Aronson, argued that his client had repeatedly reach out . to Evangelista's prior lawyers about child support payments, only to be . met with silence. He added: 'Most of the expenses do not relate to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista.' He . continued: 'These people have more money than a lot of people. But our . position is that what we understand is being asked for is just . ridiculous.' Evangelista is . due to testify in the trial tomorrow. If she is granted the $46,000 of . her demands, it will shatter records for childcare payouts. 'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February. Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked. 'When I work, it can be a 16-hour . day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am . working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I . have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an . athlete.' Moving on: Pinault began dating Salma Hayek, left, when Evangelista was pregnant. Evangelista says her son should get the same trust fund as Hayek and Pinault's daughter Valentina, right . Evangelista, herself worth $8 million, is also demanding Pinault give her . son a home similar to the $13 million California mansion he put in a . trust for his and Hayek's four-year-old daughter, Valentina. His family estate includes the . Christie’s auction house, the Château-Latour vineyard in Bordeaux and . the French premiere league football team Stade Rennais, the Daily News . reported. Earlier this week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder . said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely. He pointed out that judges . consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth . of the parents. 'She’s in for a big surprise. I wouldn’t be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News. She is worth $8 million and owns a . penthouse in the desirable Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her . son’s school on the upper East Side. Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots . She . broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton . last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up. Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed. The couple dated from . September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when . Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009.

"World map showing where radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly in Marconi's office . By . Nick Enoch . PUBLISHED: . 12:25 EST, 18 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:05 EST, 18 July 2012 . Visitors arriving in Essex’s county town are met with the proud sign ‘Welcome to Chelmsford, the birthplace of radio’. It was there, exactly 100 years ago, that Guglielmo Marconi opened the first ever wireless factory, from which he broadcast to the whole world. But rather than being a source of pride for the residents of Chelmsford - recently upgraded to city status - the building from which the first airwaves sprung has instead become an embarrassment. The premises now lie in tatters - a pigeon-infested, crumbling graveyard . of memories. The Marconi factory in Chelmsford, Essex, the first place to ever broadcast radio 100 years ago, now lies in tatters . There is still no decision on which developer will take a £14m gamble on the site after its previous owners, Ashwell Property Group, collapsed at the start of the recession . Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radio, is seen here at Signal Hill, St John's, Newfoundland in 1901 after the first transatlantic wireless transmission had been received .

Also pictured, members of the Changing Chelmsford group . Marconi's own office is empty and gloomy, thanks to the bedraggled brown drape hanging in the window. But a world map showing where his radio waves conquered still hangs defiantly above a grimy mantelpiece. Earlier this month, 60 . environment, architecture, arts and community representatives from the . Changing Chelmsford Group toured the historic listed building in New . Street in the hope of finding a way to salvage its past glory. Marconi's invention had helped save the lives of more than 700 people on board the Titanic, which sank in April 1912, and orders for maritime wireless equipment were piling up. In the wake of the disaster, 200 ambassadors and delegates travelled to Chelmsford to praise the pioneer for his vision at the International Telegraphic Conference, and the town's burgeoning future was set. Octogenarian Terry Heaton, who came from India to work at New Street from 1964 to 1991, was on the tour. Broken pipework and bare walls litter the now derelict 1912 building; right, Marconi at his desk in Electra House, Moorgate, London in 1934 . The factory has been empty since 2008, when one of the successors of the former Marconi Company moved to Basildon (above in 1955), leaving the building at the mercy of the elements . The state of the factory is a far cry from the grand opening in June 1912, when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the London International Telegraphic Conference after the Titanic disaster . 'All the iPads and mobile phones, televisions and computers we have were down to Guglielmo Marconi, who chose Chelmsford as the place to pass his gift to the world,' he said. 'That building has to be saved. I used to work in there days on end. A place like that becomes part of you. 'It is one of the most important places in the modern world, but its present state is a disgrace.' Marconi needed premises for his new company - somewhere a relatively short distance from London and easily accessible by rail. Chelmsford proved to be the perfect location. The first offices he established in Hall Street in 1898 were soon deemed unsuitable for the growing enterprise. By 1912, the first purpose-built radio factory - the Marconi Works at New Street - ultimately became the company headquarters. There is still no decision on which developer will take a £14million gamble on the site after its previous owners, Ashwell Property Group, collapsed at the start of the recession, leaving the property in the hands of the administrators Zolfo Cooper. The Chelmsford Changing group hope the land could become new homes, businesses, art spaces and workshops, either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings .

The factory has been empty since 2008, when one of the successors of the former Marconi Company moved to nearby Basildon, leaving the 1912 building at the mercy of the elements. The Changing Chelmsford team, linked to the Royal Society of Arts, was allowed into the crumbling premises on Saturday to explore ideas for its future, in the hope of inspiring a new owner with its own vision. Guglielmo Marconi was born in Bologna, Italy, on April 25, 1874. As a child, he showed a keen interest in science - and, in his early twenties, began experimenting at his father's country estate at Pontecchio where he managed to send wireless signals over a distance of one and a half miles. A year later, Marconi moved to England where he was introduced to William Preece, the Post Office's engineer-in-chief. Shortly afterwards, he was granted the world's first patent for a system of wireless telegraphy. In 1897, he set up The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company Limited, which was renamed Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company Limited in 1900. He then performed a demonstration to the Italian Government (where wireless signals were sent over 12 miles) - and also established wireless communication between France and England across the English Channel. Marconi created permanent wireless stations at The Needles, Isle of Wight, at Bournemouth and later at the Haven Hotel, Poole, Dorset. In 1900, he took out his famous patent No. 7777 for 'tuned or syntonic telegraphy'. And to prove that wireless waves were not affected by the curvature of the Earth, he used his system for transmitting the first wireless signals across the Atlantic between Poldhu, Cornwall, and St John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 2,100 miles in December that same year. In 1905, he married the Hon. Beatrice . O'Brien, daughter of the 14th Baron Inchiquin - but the marriage was . annulled in 1927. That year, he married the Countess Bezzi-Scali of . Rome. Various other patents followed before he joined the Italian Army in 1914 where he was to reach the rank of navy commander. In 1923, he revisited his studies of short waves, conducting tests between installations at the Poldhu Station and in his yacht Elettra. These experiments would give rise to the beam system for long distance communication - used three years later by the British Government to link England and Canada. In 1932, he set up the world's first microwave radiotelephone link between the Vatican City and the Pope's summer residence. And in Italy in 1935, he demonstrated the principles of radar. Marconi received many honours during his lifetime, including the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1909, which he shared with Professor Karl Braun - and was awarded the hereditary title of Marchese in 1929. He died in Rome on July 20, 1937. Source: Nobelprize.org . The group met at Anglia Ruskin University's Marconi Building down the road, before heading for the damp and disused complex. It was a far cry from the grand opening in June 1912, when hundreds of world ambassadors and delegates attended the London International Telegraphic Conference after the Titanic disaster. Marconi was the star in a posse of dignitaries from America, Japan, Thailand, Egypt, and even warring Turkey and Italy, who had travelled to Chelmsford to congratulate him on building the world's new home of radio in less than two months. Later that day, Marconi even hosted a lavish Savoy Hotel dinner for delegates, including press magnate Lord Northcliffe. But there are signs of a fight-back. Yesterday, the windows of the listed building were set to be plastered with giant posters made by a local printing firm, depicting Marconi. The group's members came up with a range of ideas for phased development of the site. They hope the land could become new homes, businesses, art spaces and workshops, either newly-built or in the existing art deco buildings. Professor John Worthington, of the Academy of Urbanism, which financed the day, saw big possibilities for a gallery or theatre in the old Marconi Road power plant. 'It's a marvellous, airy, vibrant space,' he said. Another suggestion was a restaurant for diners to muse over the city landscape in a new tower block overlooking the Victoria Road rail embankment. Roger Estop, a Chelmsford City Council architect, who attended in his private capacity as a member of the action group, said: 'We have a completely new opportunity with an open canvas.' But he warned the audience: 'We are currently dealing with clients who have no feeling for the place; all they want is their money back.' He added: 'It is true that a previous planning permission allowed for demolition of the building with the wavy roof and the one that looked like an old art deco cinema, and we could not prevent a new developer doing that if he insisted. 'But we hope we can negotiate to get a gradual development that is meaningful to the community, with intelligent re-use of the existing buildings. 'We start next week with the message sent by the posters that the 1912 building is of world importance.' Changing Chelmsford will meet again to thrash out a policy document to encourage community-minded development of the land. Marconi Veterans Association's Chris Gardiner said: 'I have a hard-nosed view about this now after so many disappointments. 'The answer is to demolish everything apart from the 1912 building and turn it into housing, like high rise flats and houses that people need and will give the developer return on his investment. 'No developer is going to have money to spare for saving buildings with concrete cancer, but they could rebuild in a style hinting at what was there before. 'Even the 1912 building is compartmentalised so would be costly to open up, and the main walls are single skin, making it a cold winter prospect and costly to heat. 'It may be possible to get a developer to invest in the 1912 building, but not much more.'

An Islamist who has repeatedly pledged to introduce sharia law was yesterday declared Egypt’s first democratically-elected president. The Foreign Office last night described the election of Mohammed Morsi – of the once shadowy banned group, the Muslim Brotherhood – as ‘the least bad result’. But his leadership will present the West with a challenge. During his campaign Morsi vowed to . introduce tough religious laws, which raised the spectre of a ban on . alcohol and even bikinis on the country’s beaches. Mohammed Morsi has been announced as the new president of Egypt and Britain's Foreign Office described it 'as the least bad result' Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood supporters chant slogans and carry posters with a picture of the newly elected Mohammed Morsi. It reads 'Mohammed Morsi, president for Egypt, revival is the will of the people' Emotional moment: Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood's presidential candidate Mohamed Morsy celebrate in front of his picture at his headquarters in Cairo today . Jubilation: The Egyptian capital's Tahrir Square is thronged with cheering supporters following the official announcement that Morsy has won with just under 52 per cent of the vote . Members of the presidential election campaign of Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice party celebrate following the announcement of Mohammed Morsi . In recent months he has sought to tone down his rhetoric, promising to protect Egypt’s vital tourism industry. However, there are fears the Brotherhood’s hardline traditionalists could hijack his aims. Thousands packed into Cairo’s Tahrir Square as the US-educated engineer was named president after gaining 13.2million votes – a share of just over 51 per cent. The historic announcement came after weeks of political tension which saw the country’s military make a grab for power. His rival Ahmed Shafiq, 70, who was president Hosni Mubarak’s last prime minister, gained 48 per cent.

Tens of thousands celebrate the win of Mohamed Morsi and fireworks lit up the night sky in Tahrir Square . Accidental leader: Mohammed Morsi waves to the crowd during a presidential campaign rally in Cairo last month . His supporters were seen crying in the streets as the result was announced. But there were scenes of jubilation in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the Egyptian revolution. People waved flags, danced and set off fire crackers, chanting ‘Allahu Akhbar’ [God is great] and ‘Egypt is free today! Egypt is free!’ William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, congratulated Morsi, saying: ‘This is an historic moment for Egypt. It will be important for the new government to stand for national unity and reconciliation, to build bridges across Egyptian society and to uphold human rights, including the rights of women and religious minorities, and the rule of law.’ The rise of an Islamist as leader of the Arab world’s most populous state will present a new challenge for the West which for years counted Mubarak as a staunch ally. Historically the West has viewed the Brotherhood with suspicion. Under Mubarak, many of the group’s members were arrested and persecuted. Baited breath of thousands: Cairo extends into the distance behind Tahrir Square, packed with Morsy supporters as they await confirmation that their man has won . It's official: Farouq Sultan, head of Egypt's elections presidential committee, announces the results during a televised press conference today . Welcoming change: One of the Morsy faithful rises above the crowd in Tahrir Square, which was at the heart of the Arab nation's uprising last year . The election outcome has alarmed many secular liberals and Egypt’s Coptic Christian minority who fear an Islamic takeover. But there was some relief last night at the result. If Shafiq had been awarded victory, there were fears of growing civil unrest. A Foreign Office source said: ‘The Muslim Brotherhood are a different beast from Al Qaeda, they are not part of any international terror conspiracy. We are breathing a sigh of relief. It is the least bad result.’ Morsi has also pledged to stick by the Camp David peace agreement with Israel, but has warned it could be reviewed if Israel does not respect the terms of the deal. In an effort to reassure Egyptians that the rights of minorities will not be threatened under his rule, Morsi announced an alliance with leading liberal and revolutionary groups. Triumphant: Women loyal to the Muslim Brotherhood roar in approval following the announcement . Close race: Morsy (right) edged out main rival Ahmed Shafik (left), a former general . Fresh start: The square erupts in a riot of red, white and black as word of the official results filters through . He has also said he will resign as leader of the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood’s political arm, in a gesture signalling he would be a president for all Egyptians. Morsi was initially dismissed as uncharismatic and an unlikely winner. His success is a measure of the power of the Brotherhood movement which is popular among the poor for its record of charity work. The win is seen as a victory for the revolution and marks the first time Egypt has elected a civilian president in 7,000 years. ‘The revolution passed an important test,’ said Yasser Ali, a spokesman for Morsi’s campaign. ‘But the road is still long.’  The long awaited results came after a tense week of uncertainty overshadowed by a military power grab that has sought to limit the powers of the incoming head of state. Let down: Supporters from the pro-Shafik camp hear the results as one buries his head in his hands . Overwhelmed: Three pro-Morsy voters embrace after hearing of their party's long-awaiting win at the polls . Bitter defeat: Meanwhile, a supporter of Ahmed Shafiq presses a photograph of the losing candidate to her mouth . Sickened: A woman in Cairo clutches her stomach in anguish after learning of Shafik's loss . Under a constitutional declaration announced by the army the powers of the new leader have been significantly curtailed. The president will not be commander in chief and the army will retain legislative authority until a new parliament is elected. Morsi will now have to battle the military for real power, raising fears of further political tension in Egypt – and the region – over the coming months. The army is expected to hand over power to the president in a ceremony later this week. By MICHAEL BURLEIGH .

A supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Morsy celebrates at Tahrir square in Cairo yesterday . The tears of supporters of Ahmed Shafik: This is a victory which will send shock waves throughout the Middle East . Although optimists hope that . Egypt will evolve along the lines of Turkey, which has a moderate . Islamic government, the reality is that it is likely to see protracted . strife between a still-powerful military – which has until now held all . the power – and a strong Islamist movement that will make it more like . strife-torn Pakistan. The army have a lot to lose, while the Brotherhood has everything to gain. Morsi’s background is typical of the . middle class, academic professionals who dominate the Brotherhood’s . leadership. He has a doctorate in engineering from the University of . Southern California, and worked at Egypt’s Zagazig University. But he is . leader in name only, which is why he is known as the ‘spare tyre’. He . only ran for president after the ruling Supreme Council of the Army . disqualified  62-year-old businessman Khariat Al Shater, the real . strategic mind within the Brotherhood. Al . Shater has been in prison four times. He and Morsi represent the . conservative strain of the Brotherhood, and rule out women and . Christians ever standing as president. They want Egypt to be run along . the lines of Saudi Arabia, where women are covered from head to toe and . banned from driving, alcohol is forbidden and sharia law is commonplace. The wives of these two men wear the niqab, which covers the face and is . unusual in Egypt – except in areas where the Brotherhood’s huge . charitable involvement acts like a chill draught in a room. The . military, which thanks to its vast grants from the US  still retains . considerable power in Egypt, has made a deal with  the Brotherhood . drastically reducing the new president’s untested powers. In . a sense both sides have been engaged in a game of chicken. The . Brotherhood has been using its supporters to flood Tahrir Square and . threatening to unleash its trades unions to paralyse an Egyptian economy . already limping along because of the collapse of mass tourism. The generals – who could always fill the streets with troops – have issued a decree which restricts what president Morsi can do. Morsi . has no power over budgets, internal affairs or the army, in a country . where the defence budget is 40 per cent of revenue. He may chair a new . National Defence Council, but 11 of its 16 members will be serving . generals. But . while the army holds many cards, the military’s commercial and . industrial interests make it highly vulnerable to charges of . institutional corruption of the sort that saw the ousting of Mubarak, . himself a former air force general. Fragile peace: In an echo of last year's turmoil, military police are deployed outside the electoral commission's offices in Cairo following the announcement, and it is the military who still hold much of the power . Since Mubarak went, relations . with Israel have become far chillier. Morsi is a fervent supporter of . Israel’s enemy Hamas, the Egyptians have cut off deliveries of natural . gas to Israel, and they’ve opened the Sinai border to waves of African . migrants who are causing serious law and order problems for the citizens . of Tel Aviv. The . world can only watch and wait to see if Israel reacts – and how this . uneasy partnership between the generals and the Brotherhood plays out.

A woman who has been living in a horse box for five years after falling on hard times is facing eviction after residents complained to the council. Victoria Hartfield moved into the green van after ill-health forced to sell her Bristol home in 2003. The 50-year-old had to give up her job as a university researcher and she bought the £10,000 horse box to keep a roof over her head. She moved on to piece of common ground at Cleeve Common, north Somerset in 2007 - a location which is currently being used as a car park. In response to pressure from local residents, Cleeve Parish Council has tried to move Miss Hartfield on a number of occasions - despite the fact the authority does not own the land. Residents claimed the van caused congestion and raised concerns about the lack of sanitation and waste disposal facilities at the site. However no one could be prosecuted for failing to comply with enforcement action because there was no identifiable owner of the land. The council now plans to use powers under the Common Act of 2006 to evict Miss Hartfield, who suffers from chronic fatigue, from the site. But Miss Hartfield says if the council presses ahead with the eviction it will force her to lead a nomadic lifestyle, moving from site to site until she finds somewhere else to settle. Unemployed Miss Hartfield said: 'The initial plan was to buy the horsebox, get some work and try to get back on my feet. 'I did find a site before I came here and contacted the council but they never replied so I parked up in Cleeve. Miss Hartfield moved into the green van after selling her home in Bristol home in 2003 .

'I want to stay in north Somerset as I have a support network and friends here. There are lots of landowners that would be happy to accommodate me, But I won't go in case they get into trouble with the council.' Her horsebox has no electric link up, no mains water supply and no toilet. But it does have a shower and cooking facilities and a system to heat water which she buys in. Miss Hartfield, who is a volunteer with the NHS, said: 'The majority of local people don't see a problem with me being here.' There are 42 residential traveller pitches in six locations across north Somerset at the moment. However there are no transit pitches, although the council is planning more. Basic living: Her horsebox has no electric link up, no mains water supply and no toilet . The mobile home has a shower and cooking facilities, along with a system to heat water, which she buys in . Cleeve Parish Council clerk Gemma Richards said: 'This land is for the enjoyment of all local residents and villagers have attended meetings on a number of occasions to complain about the encampment and the fact it is not an appropriate place for anyone to live.' North Somerset Council said it had contacted Miss Hartfield in the past and offered her support and advice to seek alternative housing. The authority intends to serve an order asking her to leave the site and if she fails to comply it can apply to the magistrates court for an order allowing it to take steps to ensure the land is vacated.","Ill-health forced woman to give up job and sell her home in 2003 .

The washout spring and summer may have meant misery for the High Street shops as they were forced to start the sales early. But it has not been all bad news for the retailers – wet weather gear is booming with sales up as much as 400 per cent on 2011. Marks & Spencer, which has suffered dire slump in general merchandise 6.8 per cent this spring, is selling a rain mac every minute, as shoppers adjust their wardrobes to cope with the rain. Lightweight parkas are also proving popular because they are more versatile and can be used everywhere from the school run to music festivals. A spokesman said: ‘Our Stormwear Mac sales are up 114 per cent on this time last year. Price points range from £39.50 for a plain coloured mac to £45 for a printed style. ‘We have sold 292 per cent more umbrellas compared with last year. Festival parkas are also up 48% on last year with the animal print parka selling 50% more than a similar style on sale this time last year.’ Although the terrible weather from March to July caused a slump in clothing and footwear prices by 4.2 per cent, sales of umbrellas, raincoats and wellington boots are sky high.

The Cambridge Raincoat Company has also seen its sales leap by 312 per cent. It has traditionally been a popular choice for cyclists because of its longer design, which protects those on a bike in wet weather.

Convicted fraudster Colin Fell plundered almost £400,000 of company cash to live the life of a wealthy 'country gentleman' A greedy managing director who stole company money and lived the high life of a ‘country gentleman’ whilst his staff was made redundant was today ordered to pay back more than £400,000. Already a convicted fraudster, Colin Fell set up fake PR and advertising firms to divert money into his own bank accounts. The 54-year-old refrigeration business boss used the money to pay for renovations of his half million pound farmhouse, luxury holidays and private schooling for his two children. His £527,000 home on moorland near Rawtenstall, Lancashire included stables, horses and a fleet of quad bikes. The extensive thefts forced the owners of the refrigeration firm ran to make stringent cost cutting and ultimately led to the majority of the staff being made redundant. Mr Fell was given six months to pay back over £400,000 at Liverpool Crown Court today. A total of £560,000 went missing from international commercial refrigeration firm Norpe UK. When the loss was discovered Fell tried to frame a colleague by claiming the senior figure knew of his illicit activities. Fell of Roe Green, Salford, was caught after Norpe UK made an internal investigation which exposed the phantom firms which had invoiced Norpe for non-existent advertising and promotional campaigns. It also emerged that Mr Fell had already served time for a £1m fraud in the eighties for which he served four years. After admitting stealing £390,000 between 2003 and 2006 Mr Fell was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Manchester Crown Court. Allegations relating to another £170,000 were not proceeded with. Liverpool Crown Court ruled today that he is to be was given six months to pay back £410,092.29 under the Proceeds of Crime Act - or face another four years in jail. Greater Manchester Police said the amount took into account the loss of revenue for the company on the stolen proceeds. Lavish: Pictured is Fell's former farmhouse home in Rawtenstall, Lancshire . Ian Horrocks, Financial Investigator said: ‘Fell helped himself to thousands of pounds by deceiving the system. ‘He lived a life of luxury as a result and, meanwhile, other ordinary people trying to make a living were left jobless as the firm went through stringent cost-cutting measures to off-set the missing money. ‘Fell has now lost the wealth he made off the backs of the company that employed him. ‘Today’s result once again demonstrates that we will not stop until criminals have paid back their debt to society and their victims - in this case the company.’ Fell began working for Norpe UK in Stockport, the UK subsidiary of Norpe - a Scandinavian refrigeration company, in 1996 and was in a position of trust as managing director. But Fell set up bogus companies and invoicing Norpe for products and services that were non-existent including technical support, public relations campaigns and trade exhibition services. In attempts to cover his tracks he invented a series of different personalities behind the firms as well as even crashing Norpe’s accounting systems by deleting incriminating records. He had hoped that his thefts would go unnoticed because the company was making losses. Norpe’s international financial . director brought in a forensic accountant in November 2006 after . receiving complaints about the management of its UK branch and . identifying some irregularities with suppliers. Fell was immediately suspended and the . accountants discovered a number of forged and falsified invoices and . called in police in October 2007. It took the inquiry team until . February 2010 to get to a stage where they were able to arrest Fell due . to the complexities involved in the theft of the money. Repayment: Mr Fell was ordered to give back £400,000 at Liverpool Crown Court earlier today . Fell failed to accept any responsibility for his actions during a series of interviews and falsely claimed at one stage that a senior figure at the firm had known what he had been up to. He maintained his innocence until his trial in June 2011 at Manchester Crown Court where he pleaded guilty to seven counts of theft on the first day. The court heard that Fell had been . jailed for 42 months in the 1980s after defrauding finance companies he . worked for in a plant machinery scam although there is no evidence that . he hid this conviction from bosses at Norpe. Passing sentence upon Fell Judge Clement Goldstone QC said ‘This was a massive breach of trust. ‘You . were given a golden opportunity to get back into the world of commerce . and yet you abused it. You did not learn your lesson from your first . experience of prison. ‘When . it suits you, for your own purposes, you can be utterly and shamefully . dishonest with no thought for the consequences as far as others are . concerned.’ Mr Fell has since split with wife Susan. Fell was disqualified from acting as a company director for seven years.","Colin Fell, 54, stole money to pay for holidays, private schools and renovating his £527,000 country home with stables and quad-bikes .

Disbelief: Actor Ricky Tomlinson had been using the caravan as a base while filming a wildlife documentary . When Ricky Tomlinson bought a six-berth static caravan he found it to be the perfect place for a ‘bit of peace and quiet’. But the 72-year-old actor’s peace has been shattered after thieves stole the £12,000 retreat from its picturesque riverside site. Mr Tomlinson – who played Jim Royle in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family – said yesterday that he was ‘gutted’. A gang took the 27ft caravan from the banks of the Dee in what the actor described as a ‘well-organised’ crime. He pleaded for the return of his ‘hobby’ home, which he was using as a base to film wildlife for a  TV documentary, and said: ‘I can’t believe it happened. It must  have been a well-organised gang of thieves because it is a big, six-berth caravan which was not even on wheels. ‘It was 2ft off the floor and resting on railway sleepers and breeze blocks because it was on a flood plain. The caravan was down a country lane over a mile long within a gated private meadow. ‘They took the gate off its hinges and must have had a decent-sized vehicle to take it away. ‘I am gutted because I was in the process of letting one of my mates use it for a little outing for his two kids.’ Although Mr Tomlinson didn’t discover the theft until the weekend he believes the caravan may have been taken late last Wednesday or Thursday. He added: ‘I have only had it for a couple of years and it is still in sparkling condition – it is immaculate. The plastic covering was still on the seats.

"By . Emma Reynolds . PUBLISHED: . 09:07 EST, 11 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:29 EST, 12 June 2012 . A four-year-old boy who went into hospital to have his tonsils out died after drowning in his own blood as a result of a 15,000-to-one complication, an inquest heard. Oakley Gould seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at his local hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, and was sent home. But six days after the surgery, he began losing large amounts of blood during breakfast and his terrified parents paramedics Hayley Clark and David Gould called an ambulance. Doctors at the same hospital were unable to save Oakley, who had suffered cardio-respiratory failure when his lungs filled up after a 'catastrophic bleed' from a tiny artery. Procedure: Oakley Gould had seemed to be recovering well after the routine operation at Lister Hospital in Stevenage . The inquest heard that Oakley had been back to hospital with a temperature and with low blood oxygen levels but was discharged again, with no indication of what was to come. Coroner Edward Thomas told his grieving mother and father: 'I have heard what happened that day. 'Oakley left hospital. He seemed OK and suddenly, during breakfast, he had this catastrophic bleed. 'What happened then will always be with you. I feel so sorry for you because it must have been absolutely awful.' Clinicians had recommended surgery for the youngster because he suffered from obstructive sleep apnoea, where his pronounced adenoids and tonsils made it hard for him to breathe, especially at night. Dr Petros Vlastarakos said the operation on the boy's tonsils was one of three similar ones on the day, and that he had carried out 142 of the procedures in the UK and about 40 more in his native Greece. He used a bipolar diathermy, which uses a low electrical current to heat a concentrated area of tissue to cauterise arteries and veins to stop bleeding. He also tried to attach ties as an added measure but could only manage it on one of them, despite trying twice on the second one. His senior consultant colleague also tried but could not fit the tie. 'I couldn’t get a grip on the tissue,' he said, yet he added that he believed he was the only surgeon in his department who used both diathermy and ties, as his colleagues were satisfied with just diathermy. He explained how, following the operation at the Lister Hospital, the usual checks were conducted and Oakley was not bleeding. Tragedy: The post-mortem examination on Oakley was carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital . Marian Malone, who carried out the autopsy at Great Ormond Street Hospital, told the coroner: 'At post mortem examination there was actually very little to see with the naked eye. It seemed to have healed as well as expected. 'I also examined to see if any damage had been done to the major arteries supplying that area and they were all intact.' She said it was only when she examined samples under a microscope that she found an artery with necrosis, or dying tissue, in its wall. In the absence of any infection, she suggested a possible cause of the so-called secondary haemorrhage could have been part of the healing process itself. 'Granulation tissue is healing tissue and it has lots of blood vessels growing in it because it is the new tissue growing in to repair. It is very vascular,' she said. 'The granulated tissue is all healing and you have the broken surface on top. The tissue is gradually replaced but just at the stage when the damaged tissue is coming off it is possible to have secondary haemorrhage. 'The next area is very rich in vessels and is exposed to the surface. It is typical of how catastrophic haemorrhage happens.' Explaining that the condition was 'recognised, albeit rare', she warned: 'There are many publications demonstrating that it can even happen in hospital, that patients can die because of the rapidity.' Dr Vlastarakos added that the only way Oakley would have stood a chance of survival were if he and an anaesthetist had been standing by him with their equipment when the haemorrhage occurred. Mr Thomas recorded a narrative verdict on Oakley at the inquest in Hatfield, adding: 'I will record that Oakley died from a recognised late complication from an operative procedure.' He told the parents: 'One of the sad things is that what happened here is extremely rare but not rare to the people who suffer from it, because it happened to you.'",Oakley Gould died after he suffered cardio-respiratory failure when his lungs filled up after a 'catastrophic bleed' from a tiny artery .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:46 EST, 20 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:07 EST, 21 July 2012 . A man who last month allegedly locked his girlfriend’s 10-year-old malnourished daughter in a dingy, dark closet without food or water was charged Friday with two felonies. Prosecutors filed two felony child endangerment charges today against Marcus R. Benson, after they found him hiding in a Kansas City attic. The girl’s mother, Jacole Prince, 29, was charged earlier this month with assault, child abuse, and child endangerment. Her daughter, identified in court documents only as LP, weighed a shocking 32 pounds when found, less than half the average weight for a child her age. Cruelty: Jacole Prince, left, was arrested earlier this month after authorities found her neglected daughter, 10, barricaded in a filthy closet; Prince's boyfriend Marcus R. Barnes, was arrested and charged today . Prosecutors requested a $100,000 bond for Benson. The charges were filed July 11, but Benson wasn't arrested until Thursday night after police received a tip that he was at a home in the Kansas City suburb of Independence, said Police Sgt. Stacey Graves. Police found Benson hiding in the attic, even though a woman said he wasn't there. The woman was arrested for interfering with police, Graves said. Online court records don't list a lawyer for Benson. He hasn't spoken publicly about the case or the charges, but was interviewed by police after the girl was discovered. On June 22, authorities responding to a child abuse hotline call found the 32-pound girl barricaded inside a closet that reeked of urine. Neighbours said the girl's 2- and 8-year-old half-sisters - Benson's daughters - were well cared for, but that neighbours didn't know about the 10-year-old. The 10-year-old was taken to a hospital but later was released and placed in protective custody along with her two younger sisters, said Mike Mansur, a spokesman for the Jackson County prosecutor's office. According to the probable cause statement filed in the mother's case and later in Benson's, the mother told police she didn't let the girl leave the house because the child is malnourished and she would 'get in trouble if someone saw her.' The Associated Press isn't naming the mother to protect the 10-year-old identity. The mother was charged June 23 with assault, child abuse and child endangerment. She has pleaded not guilty and waived the right to a preliminary hearing. Her attorney, public defender Curt Winegarner, has declined to comment. Locked up: The girl was allegedly locked in a small, dark closet in this housing complex and was starved down to a shocking 32 pounds . Inside: Prince lives in this Kansas City apartment . During an interview with police before he was released, Benson said he didn't live in the apartment. He said he often visited to see the two younger girls, but hadn't seen their half-sister in about a year, according to the probable cause statement. Benson said that when he asked the mother about the 10-year-old, she told him she was with her aunt or in her room because she was in trouble. He said he never knew the mother put the girl in the closet or 'he would have done something about it,' the probable cause statement said. But witnesses told authorities that Benson did live with the mother and had seen the girl, according to probable cause statements filed in Benson's case. One of those witnesses who said the couple lived together also told investigators she was worried about the 10-year-old. She said she hadn't seen the girl since Thanksgiving and recalled her eating 'a lot' that day. When the woman asked about it, the mother told her the girl was 'just greedy,' the probable cause statement said. The 10-year-old told police that Benson lived with her during a July 3 interview. According to the probable cause statement, the girl said that within the last year, Benson lifted up her shirt so he could see her stomach and slapped her in the face because she snuck a drink from her 8-year-old sister's cup, the probable cause statement said. The girl said her mother and Benson argue about putting her in the closet and Benson didn't want her there. However, the 10-year-old also recalled that once Benson told her mother to put her in the closet, but her mother put her behind the couch instead, the probable cause statement said. The girl's 8-year-old sister said she never told anyone that she has another sister and that her mother told her she would get in trouble if she did. The girl also said Benson doesn't lock her older sister in the closet, according to the probable cause statement. Location: The girl was discovered in the apartment in the 1300 block of Highland Avenue in Kansas after officers were sent there on a welfare check . Locked up: A utility closet similar to the one the 10-year-old girl was found in, surrounded by her own waste . A social services worker said there . should be three children at the home. But the women insisted, 'No, we . have lived here for several years, and she only has two daughters that . stay here, and we have never seen the other girl, but we heard she stays . with the father or an aunt,' the probable cause statement said. Officers ultimately made their way into the apartment, where they found a portable crib pushed up against a bedroom closet, which was tied closed. The officers asked if anyone was inside. A child's voice answered 'yes,' the probable cause statement said. The girl told officers that her mother took her sisters out to breakfast, but she didn't go because 'she messes herself.' The girl was transported to a . Children's Mercy Hospital, where she was diagnosed with multiple skin . injuries. Hospital staff said she had gained just 6 pounds since she . last was at the hospital six years earlier. KMBC reported that the girl had been in hospital for 'failing to thrive' in 2006 and it wasn't clear why she had fallen through the net. The girl told detectives who interviewed . her at the hospital that that she 'does not want to go back home . anymore' and she said she gets in trouble 'because she keeps peeing on . herself,' according to the probable cause statement.

She collapsed for a first time in her cell at Bali police headquarters and was put on an intravenous drip to help her recover. However, when she collapsed a second . time she said that spices from the hospital food were bringing about the . asthma attacks.

'Once she is well enough we have to inform the police and we believe she will then be taken back to the police station.' Questioning of Miss Dougall and the . three other Britons - including 56-year-old Mrs Lindsay Sandiford, who . is said to be 'telling all' about the alleged drug syndicate - could go . on for weeks before a decision is made about bringing charges. But police say they have a 'very . strong case' and all four are expected to be charged with trafficking in . cocaine - a Class A drug - for which there is a mandatory death . sentence by firing squad. She, along with three other Britons . including her partner Julian Ponder, face the death penalty after being . arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle cocaine worth £1.6 million. Police believe Dougall, 38, and . Ponder, 43, were the lynchpins in a crime syndicate supplying the drug . to rich tourists on the Indonesian island of Bali.  If convicted, they . could be sentenced to death by firing squad. Dougall's six-year-old daughter Kitty, . is currently being cared for by the family's maid and her gardening . husband, although Dougall's parents are believed to be flying out from . Britain. Depressed: Dougall was moved to hospital after collapsing twice and constantly calling out for her daughter . Speaking from her guarded room at . Bali's Trijata Hospital, Dougall appeared frail and confused as she . asked if the story was in British newspapers. When she was told it was, she said she feared for her daughter Kitty's life. Propping herself up on her elbow, she said: 'Oh my god, is my daughter safe? 'I am afraid for my daughter's life. I am sick. I am suffering from stress. My mother and father are arriving.' A Bali police spokesperson earlier . confirmed officers had been forced to stop questioning Ms Dougall . temporarily due to her bad health. 'We don't interrogate sick people,' he . said. 'It will be against their human rights. We will be waiting until . she is healthy again and then we will continue the questions.' Dougall has consistently protested her innocence since her arrest, insisting she was the victim of a 'fit-up'. Bewildered: Six-year-old Kitty Ponder standing with her family's maid Dayu Ariani and her gardening husband Ketut Suranchan . The four suspects were held in a sting . operation after British housewife Lindsay Sandiford, 55, was allegedly . caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase after . being stopped at Bali's Denpasar airport after she arrived from Bangkok . on May 19. Customs officials allegedly found 10.3lb of cocaine wrapped in pink gift paper. Bali's head of Customs, Mr Made Wijaya, said: 'It was stupid. There had been no attempt to conceal it.' He claimed that Sandiford had . previously met up with Dougall in a Bangkok airport cafe. She had been . given a sim card for her mobile phone and that Sandiford made a 'dry . run' a few days before she was found with the drugs. Problems: Ms Dougall is also believed to be seeing a psychiatrist in hospital . Starved: Reports have said she did not eat anything for more than five days . He said: 'She came into Bali on  May 5 . and left a few days later. Then she came in on May 19, which is when . she was arrested. I believe she only did this because she was forced . to.' Referring to Dougall, he said: 'She . ordered the drugs. She organised this. Rachel was telling Lindsay what . to do. Rachel made the first contact with Lindsay.' It is believed Sandiford decided to co-operate with the police over a £1 bowl of chilli fried rice. They told her she would face the death penalty unless she helped trap the other suspected members of the drugs gang. A sting was set up allowing Sandiford . to keep the drugs with her in a £25-a-night hotel room, where she was . accompanied by an undercover police officer while she waited to be . contacted by one of the others in the alleged syndicate. Police claim Ponder turned up at the . hotel while another Briton, Paul Beales, whom they believe was the . gang's 'muscle', waited nearby. Ponder has alleged that he was set up by Sandiford as he went to pick up a birthday present for his daughter. Accused: Ms Dougall is pictured with her partner and fellow suspect Julian Ponder . Drugs: Lindsay Sandiford was allegedly caught with 4.8kg of cocaine stuffed in the lining of a suitcase as she arrived on the island . Dougall and Ponder's plush Bali villa . was built on 17,222 sq ft of land bought in 2009 — the year after Mr . Ponder's UK-based party-organising business was liquidated with huge . debts. The luxurious property is worth at . least $300,000 (£195,000) on the local market — a small fortune in . Indonesia, where the minimum wage is about £100 a month. It is located in the village of Desa . Belalang in Tabanan, about an hour's drive from Bali's main tourist . areas. The couple began living here with their daughter a few months . ago. The couple are also believed to own a property in Cyprus. The Foreign Office said British officials were helping Dougall's daughter as well as the arrested Britons. Informant: Sandiford reportedly gave police information about the other suspects over a £1 bowl of chilli rice . Suspect: Paul Beales, right, has also been arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking . A spokesman said it did not have any information regarding the reports that Dougall had been taken to hospital. Customs officials have said that . Sandiford, originally from Redcar, Teesside, may be spared the death . sentence because she helped catch three other members of the smuggling . operation, who could face a firing squad. Police have 60 days before they have . to hand over their files to prosecutors, it is believed Sandiford is . thought to have told police she only agreed to make the smuggling trip . because her children in England were being threatened.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:06 EST, 17 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:31 EST, 17 October 2012 . Probe: Mark Thompson becomes CEO of the New York Times . Company next month - but a scandal at his former employers, the BBC, hangs . over him . A growing scandal at Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, over allegations of sexual abuse at the hands of a once-beloved TV host has cast a shadow over the arrival of the New York Times' new boss. Mark Thompson left his position as the BBC's Director General to take up the role of the Times company's chief executive, but now a police inquiry into the accusations could force him to answer tough questions as he begins the job in November. In a case that has been referred to as 'Britain's Sandusky scandal', a group of alleged victims - some as young as 13 - have claimed that late TV host Jimmy Savile abused them over six decades - during which time he was employed by the broadcaster. Savile was the eccentric host for BBC favourites, including Jim'll Fix It, where he granted children's . wishes over its 20-year run, and Top of the Pops, a popular chart music show that aired for . more than four decades. Savile, who was knighted in 1990, died last year at the age of 84 after a visit to hospital with pneumonia. Now, . scores of men and women have stepped forward to claim he abused them . when they were young after rival broadcaster ITV reported on the . allegations earlier this month. Much . of Savile's career involved working with children, including visiting . schools and hospital wards, and many of his victims have claimed he . seized these opportunities to molest them. The . Metropolitan Police in London has confirmed they are investigating 40 . cases involving incidents across the country dating back to 1959, yet . they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry. Host: Savile hosted BBC show Jim'll Fix It, on which he granted wishes to children, for two decades . Long-serving: Savile also hosted Top of the Pops, a chart music show which ran between 1964 and 2006 . While he was interviewed by police in his lifetime, allegations were dropped due to lack of evidence. Former BBC executives admitted there had been rumors about Savile, but dismissed suggestions they had turned a blind eye to the indiscretions of celebrities. Some of the alleged abuse is believed to have taken place on the BBC premises. On Sunday, Times' former executive editor Bill Keller wrote a column drawing a parallel between Savile and Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky, sentenced to life in jail for molesting children. 'Whether the BBC fell short in its reporting and missed the story or had the story and lacked the nerve, it is a significant embarrassment, compounded by the hard question of why the widespread rumors of Savile's behavior were ignored for so long,' Keller wrote. The allegations mean that Thompson, who joined the BBC as a trainee in 1979, will not be able to leave the job behind just yet, as he may become embroiled in the police and parliamentary inquiries. Scandal: The case has been likened to that of former Penn State football coach, Jerry Sandusky, who has been jailed for the rest of his life for sexually abusing children. Colleagues failed to report the abuse . Thompson quickly rose up the ranks at . the broadcaster, working on shows such Newsnight, a nightly current . affairs program known for its analysis and examinations of the country's . politicians. In fact, Newsnight had worked on its own investigation into the Savile allegations in December last year but cancelled it, leading to accusations of a cover up. The BBC has denied this and is currently investigating the matter and cooperating with police. Newsnight's . editor, Peter Rippon, said they had shelved the program after public . prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence. An . article in the New York Times on Saturday noted Thompson was at the top . job at the BBC when the Newsnight investigation was dropped. Thompson, 55, . said in a statement: 'I was not notified or briefed about the Newsnight . investigation, nor was I involved in any way in the decision not to . complete and air the investigation. Television stalwart: Saville was knighted by the Queen in 1996. He died last year, aged 84 . Scandal: The London police are now investigating 40 allegdations of sex abuse at the hands of Savile dating back to 1959. Some incidents allegedly took place on BBC premises . Earlier this month, ITV, a rival network to the BBC, aired a documentary, Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile. On the program, which was researched by a former police detective, several women claimed they had been molested by the long-serving TV host after he obtained access to them through his shows and charity work. Ex-BBC staff said bosses had 'turned a blind eye' to his behaviour and that it had been an 'open secret'. A revered advocate of child protective services, Esther Rantzen, said she had heard rumours that he was inappropriate with children. And one BBC radio boss, Douglas Muggeridge, called for an investigation into the allegations in 1973 as he feared them coming out in the press - but did not make full inquiries as 'he felt they lacked weight'. It also emerged that current affairs program Newsnight had planned to air an investigative report into the allegations in December 2011, but later dropped it. Bosses denied a cover up, instead insisting they shelved the program after public . prosecutors dropped their case due to a lack of evidence. Following the documentary, an investigation was launched and other victims - both men and women - started coming forward. Witnesses to the alleged incidents, including a hospital worker who claimed she saw Savile molest a brain-damaged patient in 1971, also spoke out. Police said they are investigating 40 . cases dating back to 1959, yet . they have received a total of 340 lines of inquiry. Savile, who died last year aged 84, was interviewed by police in his lifetime but investigations were dropped due to lack of evidence. 'I . have no reason to doubt the public statement by the program's editor, . Peter Rippon, that the decision not to pursue the investigation was . entirely his, and that it was made solely for journalistic reasons. 'During my time as director general of the BBC, I never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Jimmy Savile.' There is no evidence to suggest that Thompson knew about the decision to axe the program or about Savile's alleged behaviour. Colleagues insist he had nothing to do with the editorial process of Newsnight. 'The chances that Mark interfered in the . decisions of Newsnight as to whether or not they were going to broadcast . the story are precisely zero,' said Mark Damazer, a long-time colleague . at the BBC. In the years when their careers overlapped, Thompson was in the news and current affairs area of the company rather than in its entertainment arm where Savile worked until retiring in 1994. George Entwistle, who took over as director general from Thompson, said the allegations have 'truly shocked' him. He added: 'If there are lessons we can learn then we must do so to ensure that the mistakes of the past should never be repeated.' A representative for the New York Times would not comment on the BBC investigations. Yet the situation is far from ideal for Thompson or the New York Times, Kelly McBride, a senior faculty member for ethics at the Poynter Institute, a journalism school and media think tank, told Reuters. 'It really depends what else comes out and how closely he can be tied to the scandal at the BBC,' said McBride. 'If it's just guilt by association most of the time organizations are fine with that.' Thompson was named CEO of the New York Times Co in August, capping an eight-month search for an executive to lead the company after chief executive Janet Robinson was abruptly ousted last year. He was hired by the Times Co in part . because of his extensive experience in video and digital, and because of . his skills in corporate diplomacy. Shaky start: Thompson was named as CEO of the New York Times company in August and starts in November . While at the BBC, Thompson helped develop the digital iPlayer, which enables viewers to catch up on missed programs online for free. It was considered a huge hit among those viewing the Olympics. He has been lauded for guiding the public broadcaster through morale problems, assaults from Rupert Murdoch's media empire and threats to its funding by the British government. Indeed, News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, whose own company's U.K. phone-hacking scandal has been covered extensively by both the BBC and the New York Times, seized on the opportunity to jab at his rivals on Twitter. 'Look to new CEO to shake up NYT unless recalled to BBC to explain latest scandal,' Murdoch tweeted.","Mark Thompson joins New York Times Co. in November following role as Director General of Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC .

Fire destroyed a couple's Grade II listed home on an estate owned by the Earl and Countess of Arran. Bob Rines, who rented the gatehouse of the Arran family seat, died in the fire which ripped through the property he shared with his wife Joan on the Castle Hill Estate, in Devon. Fire probe: Two firefighters investigate the damage at Meadow Park Lodge after a man was killed. A second person is feared to still be inside the property . Tragedy: The burnt out Meadow Park Lodge property on the Castle Hill Estate where the fire happened in the early hours. Two bodies have now been found . A police spokesman said: ‘One body was found and recovered after a very careful search this morning. ‘A second body has just been located in the property in the last five minutes. ‘Police priorities now lie in identifying the deceased and informing the next of kin.’ The couple, aged in their 60s, had lived in the property for the last seven years. The Countess of Arran, Eleanor Gore, said it was a 'hideous thing' to have 'happened to such lovely people'. The countess, who was Eleanor van Cutsem before she married, and her husband Arthur Gore, the 9th Earl of Arran, let out 50 properties on the 5,000-acre Devon estate. Lady Arran's family, the Fortescues, have lived in Devon since 1454 and she is the 16th generation to live on the site after her ancestors arrived in England with William the Conqueror in 1066. Her husband Lord Arran is one of the 92 surviving hereditary peers in the House of Lords and the couple have two children. Their daughter Laura married Major James Duckworth-Chad, MVO, former Equerry to The Queen, in 2004. Mr Rines worked for South West Water and today his van was still parked outside the property he had lived in with his wife since 2005. The police and fire service are carrying out a joint investigation into the cause of the blaze. Possible double death: Bob Rines died in the blaze and his wife Joan is also feared to have been killed . Probe: An investigation into the cause of the fire is under way. Firefighters entered the property this afternoon and found a second body . The . site, set in countryside near Barnstaple, Devon, employs around 30 . staff is frequently used for weddings and corporate events. The main house there burned down in 1934 when two people lost their lives. A . cordon was moved back along the driveway of the estate as fire crews . went into the burned out lodge to search for the second body they expect . to find inside the gutted building. Tragedy on their land: The Earl and Countess of Arran own the estate which has approximately 50 houses on it . Joan Rines was described as older than her husband and has five grown-up children who have long since moved away. Lady Arran said: 'We're just completely devastated. That such a hideous thing has happened to such lovely people. 'I looked out of the bedroom window and all I could see was flames licking in to the sky. So we rushed down there. 'There was not much we could do except pray. I've been to see some of the family today - our hearts go out to them.' Paul Smalley, the Castle Hill house estate manager. paid tribute to the couple. Although only one body has been found, residents and staff are braced for more bad news. 'We are all in shock. They were very well known and very well respected residents on the estate,' he said. 'They have lived in the house since 2005. Their house is at the end of the front drive and all of us would see them as we drove in and out. Country residence: Castle Hill House at Filleigh, Devon, which is primarily used for weddings. A property on the estate was gutted by fire in the early hours of today . 'They were friendly figures - always giving a wave and a smile and sharing normal chit chat. 'We will all miss them terribly and our thoughts are with the five children of Joan Rines. 'Robert, or Bob, as he was known worked for South West Water. There was nothing to suggest they wouldn't be living with us in this close-knit community for many more years.' Crews were called out to the large fire at Meadow Park Lodge at around 2.30am this morning. Earlier a spokesman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the blaze was to be investigated. 'One person was found dead and a joint investigation will be carried out with the police,' he said.

Off the hook: Zak Whitbread was caught driving an Audi at 97mph on the A14 in Cambridgeshire . A speeding Premier League footballer has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite having 17 penalty points - after he pleaded exceptional hardship. Zak Whitbread, 28, was let off the hook by magistrates after he was caught driving an Audi at 97mph, because he said he needed his licence to find a new club. He was released by top-flight team Norwich City in May. Sources claim a player in his position would have been earning between £4,000 and £7,000 a week - at least eight times as much as the average British worker. The average gross salary for full-time employees in Britain is £26,200 - or about £500 a week, according to data published by the Office for National Statistics. Whitbread, a defender who has also played for Liverpool and Millwall, escaped a ban despite admitting two speeding offences. He was given eight more points to the nine already on his licence, taking the total to 17. Drivers usually face a ban if they rack up 12 points, but Whitbread pleaded that he was now unemployed and would be unable to find a new club if he couldn't drive. Simon Nicholls, defending, told Norwich Magistrates' Court that if the player had a job he would not have been able to make a special plea and would have been forced to make alternative travel arrangements. But he said that, as Houston-born Whitbread was out of work, the player qualified for the 'exceptional hardship' defence. Defence: Zak Whitbread (left), pictured in action for Liverpool, pleaded that he was now unemployed and would be unable to find a new club if he couldn't drive . Magistrates accepted the footballer's argument and fined him £780 with a £15 victim surcharge. Whitbread was also ordered to pay £85 costs. The chairman of the bench, Amjad Malhis, warned Whitbread he had come very close to losing his licence and said he would not be able to use the same defence in future. Whitbread, of Little Plumstead, Norfolk, admitted driving his powerful Audi at 37.1mph in a 30mph limit zone in Grapes Hill, Norwich, on October 15 last year. The footballer also admitted doing 97mph on the A14, which has a 70mph limit, at Fen Ditton, Cambridgeshire, on January 8 in another Audi. Ellen Booth, a campaigner for road safety charity Brake, said the magistrates' decision had 'undermined the whole system'. She said: 'Penalty points are given for a reason. Once you reach 12 points you have had multiple opportunities to change your ways. 'We believe that drivers who reach 12 points should face a ban.' Mrs Booth went on: 'We have campaigned to raise awareness of this issue. 'By failing to ban a driver with more than 12 points on their licence it does undermine the whole system and sends out the wrong message. 'We therefore feel in this instance that the footballer should have faced a ban.' Whitbread failed to earn a new contract with Norwich after playing only 18 games in the Premier League last season. He made 48 appearances in total for the Norfolk club after joining from Millwall in January 2010. It is not the first time a top sportsman has kept his driving licence after using the 'exceptional hardship' defence. Last year champion jockey Keiron Fallon escaped a ban at Lincoln Magistrates' Court after arguing he could not afford to add a full-time driver to his entourage. Whitbread was fined and ordered to pay costs by JPs sitting at Norwich Magistrates' Court .","Zak Whitbread, 28, was allowed to keep his licence despite having SEVENTEEN points .

Tourism bosses fear London will be left deserted in the weeks immediately following the Olympic Games. The influx of athletes and spectators during the Games, which run from July 28 to August 12, is expected to push the capital's infrastructure to near breaking point.

This has resulted in hotels slashing . their prices to as little as £10 a night the weekend after the Olympic . party comes to a close. Ghost town: Tourism bosses fear London will be left deserted in the weeks immediately following the Olympic Games . One hotel adjacent to the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, is offering a £39 rate for a family of four on Friday August 17, reports the Independent. The hotel, a new-build Premier Inn, is charging £199 per night during the Olympics. But while it is to be expected for hotel prices in and around the Olympic site to slump considerably following the Games, the same pattern is occurring in central London as well. The Travelodge in Covent Garden is charging £170 for a twin room on Friday August 10 - one week later and this price has shrunk to just £42.75. Elsewhere, the Savoy offers its Signature River 1-Bed Suite King for £5,750 on August 10; a week later it costs 'just' £2,195, a saving of more than £3,500.

Nick Varney, chief executive of attractions operator Merlin, said: 'The travel trade who normally bring tourist groups have basically switched away from London. 'Hotel rooms have gone up in price, and they've thought, ""We don't even want to deal with being in London through that summer period."" So immediately, there's a trade hit.' Kit Malthouse, London's deputy mayor, said that a slump in tourism is to be expected in the aftermath of hosting the Olympics.He said: 'After the Games, there will be an exaggerated effect of people staying away because they're uncertain about what state the city is in.' However, the effect is expected to be short-lived as the Paralympic Games start on August 29 and run until September 9.","'Normal' visitors are staying away from London this summer because of concerns over congestion .

A court heard Peckham, who hoped to use the cash to pay for his impending wedding and to buy a house, got the idea after reading about a similar plot to extort the wealthy family. Peckham’s ‘amateurish’ plot was inspired by the case of Derek Rose, 32 and Jakir Uddin, 19, who last month denied attempting to blackmail Miss Ecclestone for £200,000 by threatening to reveal details of her sex life. The technician, who runs a family business with his father and brother, appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today where he pleaded guilty to a single count of blackmail. Dressed in a black shirt and black trousers Peckham spoke only to confirm his name and enter his plea. Judge Alistair McCreath granted him bail but warned he faced a ‘significant and substantial’ jail term when he is sentenced on September 3. Close family: Miss Ecclestone with her father, the billionaire racing boss, Bernie at the The F1 party at Battersea Evolution earlier this month . The judge said: ‘There can be no doubt about it that an offence of this kind inevitably leads to a significant and substantial prison sentence. ‘But, I’m prepared to adjourn sentence for a report, not to help the court with what the outcome should be but as to how long the sentence should be. ‘I give you no false hope, you understand what the inevitable outcome of this offending must be.’ Last week prosecutor Peter Zinner told the same court: ‘The Crown’s case is that Mr Peckham became aware of another separate case, and he is said to have tried to exploit that situation for his own gain but it is not linked in any way.’ Rose and Uddin are to stand trial on February 18 next year, where Miss Ecclestone is expected to a witness. At an earlier hearing prosecutor Philip Lemoine said: ‘This was a crudely-executed, perhaps not frivolous but rather amateurish, attempt to obtain money from Mr Ecclestone. ‘Amateurish it might have been, but it was a targeted offence. The family is vulnerable and Mr Ecclestone took it seriously.’ Peckham, from Colchester, Essex, pleaded guilty to one count of blackmail. He was bailed on the condition he live and sleep at his home address and observe an 8pm to 7am curfew monitored by an electronic ankle tag. He must also surrender his passport to police and is banned from contacting Bernie Ecclestone, his business office, Tamara Ecclestone, and her boyfriend Amre Al Khyami.","Martin Peckham, 41, from Chelmsford, Essex, is accused of making his demands during phone calls to Bernie .

Desperate for success: Policeman George McNaught falsely issued hundreds of fines to be successful at work . He made a name for himself after wrestling a gun from the hands of a woman who was pointing it at a young boy. And after his spell in the limelight, it appears PCSO George McNaught was determined to keep up the crime-fighting. But the 48-year-old’s desire for success ended in shame yesterday when the Blunkett Bobby was jailed for six months for issuing hundreds of false fixed penalty notices. McNaught was the first PCSO in London to be awarded the commendation of the High Sheriff of London after wrestling a gun from a woman’s hands at Victoria Station in 2009. He was given the award by then Met police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson for pinning down the armed suspect after she pointed the weapon at a boy. But the Westminster-based PCSO was so hungry for success he began inventing bogus penalty notices, usually for cycling on the pavement. McNaught targeted members of  the public after finding their names and addresses on items of  lost property. Some victims paid the fines – which started at £45 and quickly increased to £320 – while others spent hours arguing about them in court. One woman who was issued a false notice had bailiffs come to her home chasing £320 in fines. Another ticket was issued to a man who had suffered nerve damage to his arm and could not even ride a bike. Although the exact number of false notices issued is unknown, investigating detectives found at least 350 suspect tickets between February 2010 and September last year. McNaught was caught out after a man fined for cycling on the pavement on the Strand complained. When police searched the officer’s home they found a canister of CS gas which had been reported missing from a police locker room. Humiliated victims: One woman was falsely fined £320 by Mr McNaught and was left embarrassed and humiliated . Fallon Alexis, prosecuting, said: ‘One woman was stopped at Victoria Coach station with friends and had bailiffs come to her house after she was ordered to pay £320 in fines. ‘She had to come to a subsequent court hearing, and in her own words felt embarrassed and humiliated, due to Mr McNaught. ‘Another man who paid a £45 fine later told police that he had an accident in 1997 and suffered nerve damage to his left arm and shoulder. He said he could not use a bicycle if he wanted to.’ McNaught, of Paddington, admitted one count of misconduct in a public office and possession of a prohibited weapon. Judge John Hillen said: ‘It’s an abuse of power by someone who is given power and then decides to use that power in a bad way. As a PCSO he had a power and used it in a crazy way which is extremely harmful. ‘You have a positively good character, for some seven years as a PCSO in which I’m told you loved, and indeed did extremely well in. ‘You were serving the public but that trust placed in you, you abused. Lost property: Mr McNaught targeted cyclists using personal details found on lost property . ‘What motivated you is and remains entirely unclear. There was no financial gain, there was no corruption, there was no acting on behalf of criminals or friends. ‘It seems to me, what you chose to do having been given power, was to abuse that power. ‘The public have to be confident in the fixed penalty notice system and you undermined that confidence. ‘Confidence in the PCSO community has also been undermined.’ Ann-Marie Talbot, defending, said McNaught had been sacked as a PCSO and had moved back to his native Scotland, where he worked as a part-time cleaner. She added: ‘It would appear there was no motivation other than a desire to be successful in his job. ‘I don’t think he understands himself though what led him to take these actions.’","George McNaught falsely fined victims £45-£320 .

A racist has been jailed for spraying ammonia into a man's eyes and threatening him with a dagger he had concealed in a walking stick. Sadar Ahmad feared he would be blinded after Simon Southern approached him in a public park, took out a bottle of the caustic chemical and aimed it at his face, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Southern, 26, then drew a 10-inch dagger from his walking stick and tried to goad Mr Ahmad and his friends into fighting him. Deadly: Simon Southern (left) concealed a 10-inch dagger inside his walking stick (right) and wielded it in an attack in which he sprayed ammonia at two men . The court was told that he had adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship. Shortly before the attack in Newcastle's Leazes Park, Mr Ahmad and his friends had heard a group of white men, including Southern, shouting racist slurs. Prosecutor Stephen Duffield told the court: 'The defendant had a squeezy bottle which had ammonia in it and he sprayed that into Mr Ahmad’s face. 'Mr Ahmad immediately felt his eyes burning.' Southern, who at the time was on bail for another offence, then sprayed the ammonia at one of Mr Ahmad's friends. Fortunately, the second man was able to cover his face with his hands and protect himself. Moments later, Southern pulled out the dagger. Mr Duffield said: 'The weapon was concealed in the walking aid. It was produced and he used it to threaten the group shouting ""come on, come on"".' In a victim statement read out in court, Mr Ahmad said that he had been left with badly blurred vision in his left eye, but a consultant at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary was confident that he would make a good recovery. Newcastle Crown Court heard that Southern adapted the crutch to protect himself because he felt threatened over the break-up of a relationship . Southern, of Wallsend, North Tyneside, admitted grievous bodily harm with intent and possessing an offensive weapon. The court heard that, at the time of the attack in September last year, Southern was already on bail for an affray incident in which he was caught with an axe in Wallsend. Kieran O’Neil, defending, told the hearing that Southern had only recently been released from hospital after five weeks of treatment for a blood clot. On the day of the attack he had mixed alcohol and drugs with a ‘cocktail’ of prescribed medication. Sentencing Southern to six years in prison, plus an extended four-year licence period for public protection, Recorder William Lowe said the crime had a number of 'aggravating features'. The recorder said: 'There was the use of weapons, there was an intention in my judgement to cause more serious harm than actually resulted, and the location was a public park where people of all ages spend their leisure time.'","Simon Southern, 26, drew 10-inch dagger from his crutch during attack on Sadar Ahmad .

Two lovers who beat a woman with a riding whip when they caught her trying to steal a wristwatch during a threesome have been locked up. Aaron Samuels, 27, and Brooke Reid, 22, continued to pleasure each other as they took turns to torture the terrified 21-year-old victim during a two-hour ordeal. Samuels had organised the romp on Facebook and invited mother-of-one Reid and the victim to his house in Barking, Essex. Demeaning: The attack took place at Samuels' home on King Edwards Road (pictured), in Barking, Essex . But things turned ugly when the victim became jealous of the attention Reid and Samuels were paying each other, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Violence flared when Samuels - a youth worker with Barking and Dagenham Council - caught her trying to steal his watch. He slapped her repeatedly around the face before forcing her against a CD rack, sending discs tumbling to the floor. When she failed to replace them in the correct slots he slapped her again and held a baseball bat aloft over his trembling victim before Reid grabbed a screwdriver and threatened to stab her. She then kicked and punched the woman before biting her on her face. Samuels grabbed the whip and forced the victim to pull her jeans down before beating her on her back and buttocks. Reid whipped her on her forearms before forcing vodka down her throat. The woman eventually escaped and was found in a distressed state by a passer-by, who called the police. She suffered two black eyes, numerous injuries to her face and bruising, as well as red marks on her back, buttocks and forearms. Shocking: Two lovers who beat a woman with a riding whip when they caught her trying to steal a wristwatch during a threesome have been locked up by a judge at Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured . In a victim impact statement, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she became depressed and lost her job as a result of the assault. She struggles to sleep and has become distrustful of people outside her family. At the time of the attack, on July 14 last year, Reid was subject to a one-year suspended sentence for unlawful wounding after she hurled a glass bottle in a woman's face at a nightclub on March 11 last year. Samuels was jailed for 14 months while Reid received two years with an additional nine months for breaching the suspended sentence. Sentencing, Judge Jacqueline Beech said: 'This was a joint enterprise and a nasty and demeaning attack.' Addressing Reid, she added: 'It is clear you have a tendency towards violent behaviour towards young women and a propensity to cause harm to others.' Samuels wept in the dock throughout the hearing while Reid laughed as the details of the attack were read out. Edward Boateng-Addo, for Samuels, said the offences were out of character and his conviction has had a 'substantial impact' on his family, including his mother whom he was caring for. He added: 'He was an impressive member of society, for two years worked as an intervention worker dedicated to helping youths and gained employment in that field. 'For a man who had such potential and support from his family, friends and colleagues, it can only be described as tragic how his life has turned out to date.' Rishy Panesar, for Reid, said his client was attending anger management counselling. Reid, of Chafford Hundred, Grays, Essex, admitted causing actual bodily harm and common assault but denied sexual assault. Samuels, of Barking, Essex, denied causing actual bodily harm and sexual assault. They were convicted after a trial in March. Both were also ordered to sign the sex offenders register for ten years.","Aaron Samuels, 27, and Brooke Reid, 22, tortured the terrified 21-year-old victim during a two-hour ordeal ."

A female driver who rammed into a pedestrian and drove with him through crowded streets as he clung desperately onto her bonnet has blamed her hormones for the bizarre incident. Suzanne Gilchrist, 37, carried 22-year-old Stuart Morris along on her Ford Focus for around 300 metres after driving into him as she tried to escape from a store detective. CCTV footage shows 'vividly' how she had put Mr Morris’s life in danger, a court heard. Scroll down for the video . Clinging on for dear life: Stuart Morris grabs hold of the bonnet after being struck by Suzanne Gilchrist and driven for more than 300 metres in a bizarre incident she blamed on her hormones . Emma White, prosecuting, said the incident began with the mother-of-one trying to get away from the security officer at the Howgate Shopping Centre in Falkirk at around 4pm. She drove away as the guard, Lorne Stevenson, tried to open her driver’s door and snatch her keys from the ignition. Mr Stevenson was trying to speak to her about an alleged theft from Boots. Stirling Sheriff Court heard that as Gilchrist sped off, Mr Morris, an 'unconnected' passer-by, happened to be crossing the road and was in her way. No stopping her: CCTV footage shows Gilchrist driving her Vauxhall Corsa towards Mr Morris as she flees a store detective after an alleged theft from Boots .

Serving time: Gilchrist hides her face outside court, where she admitted assaulting Mr Morris (right) Miss White said Gilchrist drove towards him and struck him, causing him jump onto the bonnet to avoid being hurt. She then drove off 'at speed' down Manor Street in the town and through a series of other short streets, weaving from side to side. Miss White said: 'She was driving really fast, swerving over the road, and trying to force him off the bonnet. 'Her wheels were spinning as she turned from Manor Street into Princes Street in the town centre and she never even tried to stop at the junction. 'He said she was ""screeching over the road trying to get him to fall off"". 'The roads were being used by other members of the public and vehicles during the course of the incident.' Gone in 60 seconds: Gilchrist was jailed for four years after pleading guilty to assaulting Mr Morris and trying to throw him from her car to the danger of his life . Imminent danger: Mr Morris was taken to hospital on a spinal board after the incident and found to have spinal bruising and bruising to his legs and fingers . Miss White said the whole incident was captured on town centre CCTV, which she played to the court. The footage featured close-ups of Mr Morris holding on to try to stay on. The depute fiscal said the incident came to an end when Gilchrist was held up by other traffic at lights and 'had no option other than to come to a halt'. Mr Morris is then seen to stand up on the bonnet of the car and kick the windscreen to try to smash it so Gilchrist could not continue. Miss White said he later told police he had done so 'because he was scared, and his adrenaline was going'. Mr Stevenson, who had been following on foot, ran up and tried to open the car door, but Gilchrist slammed it closed. Miss White said: 'The lights then turned green and she again tried to drive off with Mr Morris still on the bonnet. Mr Stevenson then managed to force open the door and after a struggle with Mr Stevenson managed to switch off the ignition.' Police arrived and Gilchrist was arrested. Manic manoeuvres: Gilchrist drove off 'at speed' down in the town of Falkirk and through a series of other short streets, weaving from side to side, a court heard . Mr Morris, 'plainly overcome', told officers he 'thought he was a goner'. He was taken to hospital on a spinal board, and found to have spinal bruising, and bruising to his legs and fingers. He was given painkillers and discharged. Miss White said: 'The total distance driven by the accused while he was on the bonnet was 285 metres.' Gilchrist, from Edinburgh, pleaded guilty to assaulting Mr Morris, failing to give way at junctions, and trying to throw him from her car to the danger of his life on June 12 last year. Her plea of not guilty to stealing a bottle of aftershave was accepted. Rhona McLeod, mitigating, said Gilchrist had 'believed herself to be in danger'. She said: 'She had thought that she was pregnant and was obviously suffering from some sort of hormonal imbalance, and was on such a knife-edge that she panicked. 'She was hysterical. She thought Mr Morris had walked out in front of her trying to make her stop. She extends to him her unreserved apology.' 'Thought he was a goner': At one point, Mr Morris stood up on the bonnet and tried to smash the windscreen. The terrifying journey finally came to and end when Gilchrist was held up at traffic lights . She added that Gilchrist was in employment, and had a 16-year-old daughter, currently in the middle of exams. Sheriff Wyllie Robertson jailed Gilchrist for four years and three months. He said: 'You deliberately drove at the victim, who was innocently crossing the road, and he was forced to jump on the bonnet for fear of being run over. 'Your car was screeching around corners, while this man feared for his life. The danger to his life was real and obvious, and there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' Stuart Morris . Mr Morris, a builder’s labourer, said Gilchrist deserved a jail term. He said: 'I had just come out of McDonalds after getting a burger. I saw her arguing with the security guard, and the next thing as I crossed the road - bang she hit me. 'I had to cling onto the top edge of the bonnet for dear life. She was zig-zagging trying to throw me off. 'If it’d been a child she hit, the child would have been killed, as they wouldn’t have been able to hang on. 'She was crazy. When my girlfriend gets hormonal, she just shouts a bit, she doesn’t try to kill anyone. 'It was quite scary. Gilchrist only stopped in the end because I smashed her windscreen. 'She deserves the jail - no-one like that should be free.' Les Brown, Procurator Fiscal for Stirling, said Gilchrist could have killed Mr Morris. He said: 'As she drove through Falkirk city centre, with her victim clinging for his life to the bonnet of her car, Suzanne Gilchrist chose to drive at speed and from side to side in an attempt to throw him from the vehicle. She used her car as a weapon, and her driving could have led to his death. 'Such needless endangerment of life is taken extremely seriously by the prosecution service, and today she has rightly been brought to face the full force of the law.'","Suzanne Gilchrist hit Stuart Morris while trying to escape a store detective .

"By . Sam Greenhill . PUBLISHED: . 18:43 EST, 17 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:43 EST, 17 July 2012 . Ministers issued a dramatic confession yesterday that prisoners were tortured and sexually abused under British colonial rule in Kenya. It is believed to be the first time the Government has made such a public declaration that atrocities were carried out ‘at the hands of the colonial administration’. The admission came via a Whitehall lawyer addressing three elderly Kenyans who had gone to the High Court in London to demand damages and an apology. Our ordeal in detention camps: Three Mau Mau survivors tell their horrific stories . Now in their 80s, one of them told the court how he had been brutally castrated in a British detention camp during the Mau Mau rebellion – Britain’s bloodiest colonial war. If the trio win their case, it would open the door to up to 20,000 Kenyan survivors of the Mau Mau purge to sue Britain for millions of pounds, using no-win, no-fee lawyers. The Foreign Office is contesting the case because it officially denies liability and maintains the Kenyans have left it too late to make claims. Yesterday, each of the three claimants walked slowly to the witness stand to deliver their graphic testimony. But before Guy Mansfield, the Foreign Office’s QC, cross-examined them, he said: ‘I wish to make it clear that the British Government does not dispute that each of you suffered torture and other ill-treatment at the hands of the colonial administration.’ Seeking damages: Four Mau Mau survivors who are suing the British government over allegations they were tortured during uprisings in Kenya in the 1950s and 1960s . Turning to Paulo Nzili, 85, who was castrated with a pair of pliers, he said: ‘I do not dispute with Mr Nzili that terrible things happened to him.’ Last night Martyn Day, senior partner at Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘Our clients are very pleased that the Government has accepted that they were tortured.’ The Mau Mau uprising began in 1952 to end British colonial rule. Britain initially dismissed reports of unrest, but later declared a state of emergency – introducing the death penalty for Mau Mau members. The violence ended in 1956, but the state of emergency was only revoked in 1960. The then Colonial Secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, offered to resign over British troops’ actions during the rebellion. He was persuaded to stay in office by Harold Macmillan. Atrocities: A British guard in a Mau Mau camp in 1953. One survivor has told how he was brutally castrated in a detention camp during the rebellion . In July 1959, Enoch Powell attacked government policy over the Mau Mau. Speaking about the Hola camp, where 11 Mau Mau were killed after refusing to work, Mr Powell noted that some MPs had described the 11 as ‘sub-human’. He told MPs: ‘I would say that it is a fearful doctrine, to stand in judgment on a fellow human being and to say, “because he was such-and-such, therefore the consequences which would otherwise flow from his death shall not flow”.’ A year ago, the three Kenyans were told by Mr Justice McCombe that they had ‘arguable cases in law’. He will now decide if a fair trial is possible. The Government says it is not. Mr Mansfield said the Foreign Office faced ‘irredeemable difficulties’ defending itself because key witnesses had died. In a written submission, the FO declared: ‘After so long, it is simply impossible.’ Last night a FO spokesman said: ‘We understand the pain and grievance felt by those on all sides in the bloody events of the Kenya emergency period in Kenya.’","Thought to be first public declaration by Government that brutality occurred .

Bruno Venturi, 41, was left 'euphoric' after turning the €20 in his account into a whopping €707,000 - then worth roughly £650,000 - whilst playing Eurobet.com's 'Sixty Seconds' game in 2009. But Surrey-based Eurobet UK Ltd, which operated the website, insists a software bug meant chance had nothing to do with it. As he was mistakenly charged for only one in six of his bets, his winnings are null and void, the company claims. Eurobet refused to pay up, sparking a legal battle - which Judge Simon Brown QC said reminded him of the 1935 film, 'The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo'. The film, inspired by a British music hall song based on the story of Charles Deville Wells, is a romantic comedy which tells the story of a former Russian aristocrat who wins 10million francs playing baccarat at a casino. The casino sends a beautiful woman to lure him back to the gambing tables and he is eventually left penniless. Pet shop worker, Mr Venturi - who had won only meager sums in his previous two years using the website - says he logged on from his home in Naples, Italy, on January 28, 2009, completely unaware of what was about to unfold. The company claims an error caused by a software upgrade meant Mr Venturi was charged for only one in six of the 6,670 wagers he placed, dramatically increasing his chances of winning the lottery-style game, which has since been removed from the internet. Patrick Lawrence QC, for Eurobet, said the bug meant it was 'mathematically inevitable' that Mr Venturi would keep hitting the jackpot. The court heard the Italian started . playing at 8.18pm, placing his usual 20 cent bet, but began increasing . the stakes as his apparent luck continued. He . had won 5,000 Euros by 9pm, and racked up winnings of 200,000 Euros by . 10.10pm, as he frantically placed as many multiple wagers as the website . would allow. Speaking through an interpreter, Mr . Venturi told the court: 'I had always lost previously...but when I . started to win I had a very good feeling. I'm a player and my instincts . told me to keep betting.' Mr Venturi played the 60 Seconds game for three-and-a-half hours . Comparison: High Court judge Simon Brown QC said case reminded him of the 1935 film The Man who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo, starring Ronald Colman . The 'original' man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo was Charles Deville Wells (1841–1922). His exploits were celebrated in the popular British music hall song of the same name, written in 1892 by Fred Gilbert. In . French, if a gambler wins more chips than are available at a table, . they are said to have 'faire sauter la banque', which literally means to . 'blow up the bank' but is usually translated as 'breaking the bank'. On the event all the chips were won a black shroud was placed over the table until replacement chips were brought in. In . July 1891 Wells went to Monte Carlo with £4,000 that he had defrauded . from investors with his bogus invention of a 'musical jump rope'. In an eleven-hour session Wells won a million francs as he 'broke the bank' twelve times. At . one stage he won 23 times out of 30 successive spins of the roulette . wheel. Wells returned to Monte Carlo in November of that year and won . again. During this session . he made another million francs in three days, including successful bets . on the roulette coming up on the number five for five consecutive turns. Wells . used a risky 'martingale system', where the gambler doubles his bet . after every loss, so a win recovers all previous losses plus win a . profit equal to the original stake, and he admitted his success was just . a lucky streak. The song . helped Wells to become a celebrity. But he died penniless after losing . all his money on failed inventions, having also defrauded his investors. Mr . Lawrence challenged him, saying he must have realised that something . was wrong, but Mr Venturi insisted: 'How could I realise there was an . error? 'There was no message, I was just drawing, I didn't have a clue....I thought I was very lucky.' The . Italian, who disputes that any error took place, stopped playing . shortly before midnight, having amassed a colossal 707,665 euros in 217 . heady minutes. When asked why he called it a day, Mr Venturi replied: 'I realised the amount that I was winning and I realised that I had to stop. I had been lucky enough...I am only human. I was taken by the emotions and there was a lot of euphoria.' He added: 'I've never had so much money...It's a very big win; it's not something that happens every day.' Mr Venturi, who offered to come to England to pick up his winnings in cash, said an operator told him 'this is incredible, but it does happen' as he transferred some of his winnings to a different online account. The company, based in Woking, is refusing to pay Mr Venturi, saying the bets breached the website's terms and conditions, and his winnings amounted to 'unjust enrichment'. Refuting those claims, Mr Venturi's barrister, John McLinden QC, said: 'Mr Venturi denies any software error as alleged by the defendant. 'The defendant has failed to establish that Mr Venturi broke any rules of the game whilst playing and obtaining the winnings.' He added: 'Mr Venturi performed his part of the game by completing various steps and screens presented to him by the defendant on the website, and paid for his bets on the game from the funds in his account. 'He did everything that was required of him to pay for the bets. 'If his account was not charged at any time for the repeat bets, which is not admitted, that omission was due to the defendant's failure to completely perform its obligations to him, and to comply with its regulatory requirements.' The hearing, taking place at the Royal Courts of Justice, continues.

'Horrific': Peter Lizon allegedly tortured his wife and made her kneel in front of him, claims he denies . A wife who was allegedly tortured by her husband for ten years today told a court that all her horrific burns and bruises were 'accidental'. Stephanie Lizon testified at a preliminary hearing today after she arrived at a domestic abuse centre last month with terrible wounds allegedly inflicted by her husband Peter - who is said to have kept her chained while he tortured her. Mrs Lizon, 43, arrived at the shelter in Leroy, West Virgina, with mutilated feet and burns on her back that appeared to have a come from a frying pan. But she today claimed that her feet were injured in a farming accident and the frying pan injuries were frrm accidental contact during an argument with her husband. She said: 'It was an accident. My husband and I were arguing. We collided with each other.' When she was shown a picture of her foot injury - allegedly caused when her husband intentionally ran over her - she said farming was dangerous and her husband did not know the tractor was close to her feet.She said she did not seek medical treatment. 'I didn't think it warranted it,' she testified. However prosecutor Katie Casto said the causes of the bruises were obvious. 'It is plain to a reasonable person that this was intentional,' Casto said. 'It's not an accident.' Miss Lizon, fled her husband while they returned farm tools to a rental shop. Staff at  Bosley Rental & Supply said she came into their office while her husband was in another part of the building and told the staff: 'I'm trying to get away from my husband. I just need to hide for a few minutes.' Mrs Lizon told the staff she didn't want . to involve police, but she accepted the number for the domestic . violence shelter and called it, the store employee said. She also called family to ask for . money, and the employees gave her cash and called a cab to take her to a . Western Union office and the shelter. The . woman was limping and had appeared to have some sort of injury, the . store employee said. And while her clothing was clean, she smelled bad. The employee also told investigators that . the victim's fingers looked crooked, and that Lizon's wife had told her . her husband had broken her fingers. Mr Lizon did not come inside looking for his wife and police didn't come until several days later, the employee said. Scroll down for video . Lizon's wife escaped the house of horrors on July 2 and hid in a Zumba dance facility while her husband was running an errand . At the shelter, however, Mrs Lizon told another woman about the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of her husband, a native of the Czech Republic, according to the criminal complaint. The wife said her family was from Alexandria, Virginia. Stephanie Lizon's father declined to discuss the case when contacted by the AP. Relatives of her husband didn't immediately return messages. Investigators said they have 45 photographs showing burns on her back and breasts from irons and frying pans, and scars on her wrists and ankles. Now her husband is in jail and authorities are investigating what Jackson County Chief Sheriff's Deputy Tony Boggs called one of the most terrible cases he's seen. 'This appears to go beyond abuse to what I would consider torture,' he said Wednesday. Shocked: Deputy sheriff Tony Boggs said the case appeared to amount to torture and that such things 'should never be allowed to happen' The criminal complaint said a witness at the Parkersburg shelter provided the following account: . She described Mrs Lizon as 'gaunt and filthy' and covered in scars, bruises and burns. She had 'mutilated and swollen' feet, a scar in the shape of a clothes iron on one breast, and burns on her back that the victim said came from a hot frying pan. She said her husband had smashed her foot with a piece of farm equipment, among other things. The wife said she was called a 'slave' and ordered to kneel before her husband every time she entered a room. The wife also said she had delivered a fully developed, stillborn child while in shackles, and her husband buried the corpse on their farm. Another child survived a similar delivery, but Mrs Lizon said the child had never received medical attention. She had scar tissue on her hands and ankles, which police believe is from chains tearing into her flesh. Boggs of the sheriff's office said state child-welfare authorities have been notified, but Peter Lizon's attorney said the child — a one-year-old boy — remains with his mother. The complaint says investigators confirmed that the wife was treated in the emergency room of St Joseph's Hospital in June and that photographs were taken at the shelter to document her injuries. A Sunbeam iron was among the items seized during a July 5 search of the couple's home. Lizon was arrested that day. Shawn Bayliss, attorney for Mr Lizon, compared the charges to the childhood game of 'telephone', where something whispered from one person to another ultimately bears no resemblance to reality. 'This is a situation where a person has taken a nugget of information, taken an acorn and tried to turn it into a tree,' he said. 'And the tree won't support this story.' Back in Leroy, only a handful of houses dot the side of the approximately two-mile road where the couple lives. In the front yard, signs read 'No Trespassing' and 'Guard Dog on Duty', although no dog could be seen. 'Mutilated': The Czechoslovakian allegedly ran over his wife's feet with a tractor and delivered the couple's baby himself while she remained chained up . One of two brightly colored barrels . was filled with dozens of empty bottles of imported beer near a black . van with no license plate. Nobody answered the door at a neighbor's home. Nearby, screen doors were open and music could be heard coming from inside. Cliff Boggess, 62, has lived in the . area since 2005 and rode his all-terrain vehicle past the home Wednesday . evening. He said he was shocked by the news and said he's never noticed . any human activity at the house. 'Nothing. And I guarantee, that's the . same answer you'll get from everybody around here,' Boggess said. 'This . guy, whoever he (is), I've never seen him.' Both Peter and Stephanie Lizon were . arrested in Maryland in 2004 and later performed community service for . cutting up Bush-Cheney campaign signs with a bayonet. Court records also show that Mrs . Lizon was arrested on drug charges a few months later in Baltimore . County. She pleaded guilty and got probation. The West Virginia Division of . Corrections said it had no history of criminal actions by either spouse, . and Boggs said the sheriff's department had no previous contact with . them, either. Lizon is being held in the South Central Regional Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail. Jackson County Deputy Sheriff Tony Boggs said: 'This is a case that is . tenfold of what our average domestic is and maybe more than that. It . comes down to what appears to be slavery and torture. 'It's amazing . what one human being can do to another, and that should not ever happen . or be allowed to happen.'

"By . Phil Vinter . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 17 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:47 EST, 18 June 2012 . A new football which captures the energy created when it is kicked and transforms it into electricity is set to help provide a power solution for developing countries. Called the Soccket, the revolutionary ball builds up enough energy to power a light for three hours from just 30 minutes of play. The clever invention is made from materials found in developing countries and costs only slightly more than a normal high end ball to produce. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Neat invention: The Soccket ball features a socket for an ac adaptor and it can be used to power lights and to charge mobile phones . Bill Clinton has described the concept, which was the brainchild of Harvard students Jessica Lin, Julia Silverman, Jessica Matthews, Hemali Thakkaras and Aviva Presser, as 'extraordinary'. He added: 'It’s an off-grid solution that gives us a way to bring power and improved quality of life, working capacity and learning capacity.' The idea combines football, the world's most popular sport, with the huge need for electricity in developing countries - a staggering one in five people around the globe are without power. The ball, which has been trialled in South Africa, is waterproof, durable and . doesn't need to be inflated. It uses inductive coil technology which . involves having a metal coil and magnetic slug that goes forwards and . backwards. Ms Silverman and Ms Matthews have gone on to develop the mass-produced version of the ball through their own not-for-profit company Unchartered Play. In many developing countries, reliance on kerosene lamps has led to numerous health problems. The World Bank estimates that breathing the fumes created from burning kerosene indoors equates to the harmful effect of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. Burning kerosene for lighting also generates some 190 million metric tons a year of carbon dioxide emissions, according to recent estimates — the equivalent emissions of about 38 million automobiles. Charging children: The ball not only gives youngsters in developing countries the opportunity to play football, it also provides them with a vital power source . Storing energy: Just kicking the specially-made ball around for 30 minutes can provide up to 3 hours worth of power for a small light . What's inside: Within the ball is an induction coil. A magnet rapidly oscillates when the ball is kicked. This movement powers a motor and the electricity is stored . The special ball can currently be used with an ac adaptor but the designers hope this will be expanded in the future to enable other products to be charged by it. The initial inspiration came from hi-tech dance floors which can capture energy from dancers’ movements. Ms Matthews added: 'The idea was come together and using art and science pick an issue and try to make it better. 'We started to think about the time we’d spent overseas and we’d all had this similar experience of seeing kids play. Solution: The ball is seen as a possible solution to the heavy reliance on kerosene lamps to provide light in Africa . 'These kids aren’t allowed to be children for very long. They have to deal with very serious issues in their lives every single day. 'Sometimes giving these kids the ball before we even show them the power generation part is such an amazing thing because they have a ball which doesn’t require inflation - you are telling them that the tooth fairy does exist.' Ms Silverman added: ‘Just as much as we noticed that there was so much universal love for soccer we also noticed there’s a huge market for safe, sustainable immediate power access.'","One in five people are without electricity, football is world's biggest game .

Everyone has their own ideas on how they would splash their new cash if they were lucky enough to win the lottery. But National Lottery operator Camelot have taken out a survey which shows that lottery winners have a surprising number of purchases in common. Around half of winners move within three months of a big win and a poll of new millionaires found almost a third (29 per cent) bought a hot tub and a similar number (28 per cent) had a walk-in wardrobe. Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) had electric gates at their new home, one in five (22 per cent) set up a games room and 17 per cent bought a snooker table. A fifth (22 per cent) bought a dog while one in 25 (4 per cent) got a cat. How would you spend yours? Camelot have revealed how winners spend their millions . Some 16% adopted a healthy lifestyle with a gym in their home and one in 10 (12 per cent) installed a bar to have drinks to celebrate their good fortune. One millionaire admitted having three pianos in their house and another said they bought a wishing well. Just under one in 10 (9 per cent) said their new house had a river or lake in the grounds. Surprisingly, less than a third (30 per cent) said they employed a cleaner to keep their new home spick and span.

A self-proclaimed 'psycho' killer jailed for blasting a student in the head at point-blank range has bragged in a letter to a friend that he could serve his 30-year term 'standing on my head'. Kiaran Stapleton, 21, said he had 'the best cell' on his wing and spent his time watching soaps. His letter - littered with misspellings - emerged just days after he launched an appeal against his sentence for the unprovoked shooting of 23-year-old Anuj Bidve, who had come to Britain from India to study micro-electronics. Caloous: Kiaran 'Psycho' Stapleton, left, 21, was sentenced to life in prison after he shot Indian Anuj Bidve, right, 23, in the head and stood laughing over his body in Salford, Manchester, on Boxing Day 2011 . Despite his sickening boast, the . 21-year-old has begged a judge to reduce his sentence, which he is . currently serving at York's tough Full Sutton Prison. Stapleton, who gave his name as 'Psycho' in court after the shooting in Salford on Boxing Day last year wrote In a letter, revealed by The Sun, that he 'knows loads of people' and 'never gets grief from enybody (sic)'. Instead, he says, he whiles away his days in 'the best cell on the wing' waiting for his favourite soaps to begin while feeding on sweets. '30 isent (sic) that long I don't think enyway I can do it standing on my head ""ha""', he wrote. 'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation Street and eating chocolate.' The letter emerged after its outraged recipient passed it to the tabloid newspaper yesterday. I've got the best cell on the wing': And despite his sickening boast, Stapleton has begged a judge to reduce his sentence, which he is currently serving at York's tough Full Sutton Prison . The source told the paper: 'It's . clear Stapleton doesn't care that he's in prison. He thinks he has a . cushy life there. It's disgusting.' Stapleton has appealed for his sentence to be reduced at the Court of Appeal. It is believed he has pleaded for his age and mental health problems to be taken into account. The judges have reserved judgement for a date yet to be fixed. Stapleton was found guilty of murder in July for killing Mr Bidve in 'a piece of cold-blooded controlled aggression'. 'I sit in my cell waiting for Emmerdale and Coronation St and Eastenders eating pure chocolate and other ****. 'Have got the best cell on the wing and nare 30 isent (sic) that long I dont think enyway. 'I can do it standing on my head ""ha""' Police have never established a motive . for the cold-blooded attack by Stapleton, then 19. Bidve had arrived in the UK to study . micro-electronics at Lancaster University and was visiting Manchester . with a group of friends last Christmas. They left their hotel in Salford to queue early for the sales when their paths crossed with Stapleton’s. He calmly walked across the road and repeatedly asked for the time. When someone finally answered he pulled a handgun out of his pocket and fired one shot to Mr Bidve’s left temple. Stapleton told one psychologist in prison that he picked out his victim because 'he had the biggest head', the court heard. The . day after the murder he booked into a hotel which overlooked the crime . scene in Ordsall Lane and then later went to a tattoo parlour and had a . teardrop design placed below his right eye - a symbol used by some gangs . to mark that the wearer has killed someone. Heart broken: Mr Bidve's parents Yogini, left, and Subhash, centre, arrive at the scene four days after their son's killing and are greeted by MP Kieth Vaz, right .

Nine months after Brittney Brashers met fellow Airman Robbie Walters while on duty in Iraq, she was dead - apparently killed as their car crashed after a late-night drinking session. But detectives arriving on the scene thought something didn't look quite right - and questioned whether Brittney was in fact already dead before the moment of impact. Now, 48 Hours has detailed the couple's violent relationship, the troublesome investigation into her death and the eventual murder conviction against Walters - which was granted after he admitted strangling her while his wife secretly recorded him. Her family has also revealed the heartbreaking moment they found out about her death - and how the life sentence for Walters will never be enough for taking Brittney from them. Scroll down for video . Murder: Young Iraq veteran, Brittney Brashers (left) was strangled to death by her on-off boyfriend Robbie Walters (right) who then covered up the killing by staging a car crash after a night of drinking . Brittney was found injured in her car's driver's seat on November 17, 2009, with her on-off boyfriend beside her. She was pronounced dead at the Denver Health Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. 'I know I couldn't cry,' her younger brother John told the CBS show. 'Like that night, I couldn't. I was just in so much shock. Like, there's no way it's actually happened.' The death came after Brittney had enjoyed a successful career with the Air Force. She had signed up aged 20, three years after her mother died of cancer and she fell in with a bad crowd. 'She really needed the discipline,' her father Barry said. 'The part of being a part of something.' Happier times: The couple met when they were both stationed in Iraq as working for the Air Force . Fun-loving: Walters, who maintains his innocence, said he remembers Brittney as 'a free spirit' And she immediately excelled as a technician at the Air Force dental lab in Colorado Springs, her boss, Master Sgt. Art Figeroa, said. 'She . was one of our top performers and that's how I looked at her,' he said. 'She loved what she did. I mean, she helped people out. She was easy to . like and everybody liked her.' In . February 2009, Brittney was deployed to Iraq and assigned to non-combat . security, and met an Airman from southern California named Robbie . Walters. 'She had so much . energy. She was such a free spirit and amazing girl,' Walters remembered . in the program. 'She was all smiles every time I talked to her.' As . their relationship blossomed, Brittney was stunned when she learned . Walters was married - but he assured her it was solely for the . separation pay and he was devoted to his new girlfriend. Outstanding: Colleagues said Brittney, 22, excelled in the forces and loved that she was helping other people . Kicked out: Walters was discharged because of discipline problems and they reunited in the U.S. But he was kicked out of the forces . due to his disciplinary problems and, when Brittney returned to the . Colorado lab after four months of service, Walters was there to meet . her. 'It was all good for probably a month,' her best friend Tiffany Peeples said. 'And . then Brittney went from being this vibrant girl and this superstar . Airman to showing up to work late. Just kinda pushing everybody out of . her life.' Peeples said it . was at that time that she started to dislike her friend's new boyfriend. The couple would break up and then get back together - and Walters . became increasingly violent, she said. 'He . would do crazy things like park her car in the middle of a four lane in . traffic with her in the passenger seat, take the keys out and run with . her sitting there in the car,' Peeples recounted. Then, . during an argument outside Brittney's home in October 2009, he hit her . and left her with bruises. She called the police and Robbie spent a few . days behind bars. Three weeks later, after she had started playing with a girls' football team, Walters said he wanted to see her again, and she relented. Secrets: Brittney found out that Walters was married - but he said it was a marriage of convenience . Evil: But when they returned to the U.S., he became violent and hit her, and they repeatedly broke up . He joined her at a photo shoot for her football team, where the girls stripped naked but used each other's body parts to maintain their modesty for the camera. Investigators believe seeing Brittney . remove her top with other people in the room pushed Walters over the . edge - and led to him killing her just hours later. Drunk, they left the photo shoot after midnight - but an hour later, the car slammed into a parked vehicle on a dead-end street, alerting neighbours to call authorities. Brittney was killed in the crash. Detective Troy Bisgard told 48 Hours that Walters' story that they had been falling asleep initially made sense, but something didn't look right - so they called in a homicide team. 'They're the ones telling me, ""Look, it was a car accident but it wasn't so significant that she should be dead from it"",' Bisgard said. A medical examiner found Brittney had alcohol in her body, but only just over the legal limit. There were no drugs in her system. Crash: A scene picture shows the wreckage after the crash on a dead-end road in November 2009 . Scene: Brittney's head hit the windshield - but investigators said she would not have died from the impact. Walters' wife later revealed she had recorded him admitting to strangling Brittney in the car . They also found that she didn't hit . windshield that hard and had been left with no significant injuries of . her organs, neck, spinal cord or brain. Yet, . strangely, she did have bruising around her temple and upper right . cheek. In further signs that she could have been strangled, there were . hemorrhages on her skin and around her eyes. But . medical examiners came against an odd problem when trying to find if . she had been strangled; because of her anatomy, she was missing a piece . of cartilage in her throat that is usually crushed if someone is . strangled. So the manner of death was ruled as 'undetermined'. Detectives were dedicated to finding out the truth about her death. Despite his earlier protestations that his marriage to his wife, Elena, was nothing, Walters returned to her in California. When detective Bisgard heard he had had a big fight with her, he gave her a call. Interrogation: Walters told detectives he did not kill her but evidence, such as bruising on Brittney's face and blood inside the vehicle that splattered before the crash, were against him . With barely a prompt, Elena told him Walters had confessed to punching and strangling Brittney and covering it up with the accident. As he confessed, Elena had pressed 'record' on her mobile phone. 'I look over at her and just took a shot in the dark where her head would be and bam!' he says on the recording. 'I punched the girl with all my might. She felt like a f***ing house dropped on her.' He added that he held down his forearm against her neck to kill her. Walters was arrested but said he had not been telling the truth in the recording. He insisted his wife had started the conversation and he 'just agreed with her to get the conversation to end'. In August 2011, the case went to court, where prosecutors said Brittney had been driving, they swapped seats and he began punching her, before moving her back into the driver's seat for the accident. They presented other evidence, including how 911 callers had seen the car erratically braking on the highway, suggesting times he had been hitting her. Killer: Speaking from prison, Walters told 48 Hours that he believes his wife was bitter for his affair and was out to get him . Missed: Brittney's father Barry said the conviction was no reason to celebrate - as he is still without his daughter . There was also blood in the car that had not splattered as she hit the windshield. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life without parole - and her family said they felt 'instant relief'. But Mr Brashers added: 'You know, you don't wanna say, 'Yeah!' and cheer because it doesn't really change anything. I mean, my daughter's not gonna come back.' Walters said he will appeal the conviction as his wife recorded him without her knowledge, which is illegal in their home state of California. He added that she schemed against him out of revenge. 'She thought we were gonna be together,' he told 48 Hours. 'I fell in love with someone else. And broke her heart, tore her to pieces. Sorry for breaking her heart, but I'm not a murderer.'

Kate Moss, left, makes a cameo on Little Britain as Kate Pollard, the sister of Vicky Pollard, played by Matt Lucas, right, in 2006 . If you’re a fan of the ‘Croydon facelift’, it might be time to take a ‘hair holiday’. Women who sport the look or use styling products such as heated rollers or straightening irons risk damaging their scalp and losing hair, say scientists. The Croydon facelift, adopted by women including Katy Perry, Cheryl Cole, Tulisa and Little Britain’s Vicky Pollard, involves pulling the hair into such a tight ponytail that the face is stretched like it would be with surgery. It is named after the hometown of supermodel Kate Moss, who popularised the style. In other parts of the country the look has different names: in Essex it is known as the 'Dagenham facelift', in Northern Ireland the 'Millie facelift', and in other areas simply the 'council house facelift'. But university researchers in America have warned that the style could be permanently damaging, and not only to the hair itself, but to the scalp too. And so too could other female styling accessories, including hot rollers, straightening irons and chemical relaxers, used to unwind tight curly hair. Dermatologists at the Southwestern Medical Center in the University of Texas have discovered that both the hairstyle and these modern hair accessories leads to hair loss from the root itself and chemical damage to the scalp. And while these problems can sometimes . be remedied with treatment, this specific type of hair loss - known as . traction alopecia' - is often permanent and can lead to bald patches. British supermodel Kate Moss, left, who comes from Croydon, the London borough which loaned its name to the hairstyle, and American actress Sarah Jessica Parker, right, who adopted the look across the Atlantic . The study recommends 'hair holidays' where women take a regular day off from styling their hair to let it recover naturally from all the hot irons and rough treatment of previous days. Tips to avoid damage include regular . washing - as a buildup of oil is bad for the roots - and using 'natural . hairstyles' that do not need heat treatment, because these place less . tension on roots. Research leader Dr Josephone . Quintanilla-Dieck said: 'Pulling hair into tight ponytails or braids; . using hot rollers, curling irons, or straightening irons; and applying . chemical relaxers can all lead to structural damage of the hair shaft as . well as thermal and chemical damage to the skin of the scalp. Singer Cheryl Cole, left, comes from Newcastle, while X-Factor judge Tulisa is from Camden in north London, but both have a soft spot for the Croydon facelift, which could be seriously damaging their scalps forever . 'Regular and sometimes even occasional use of these hair techniques may lead to hair breakage and hair loss from the root. 'Although usually reversible, hair loss occasionally can be permanent with longstanding or severe cases.' Scraping the hair back into a Croydon facelift puts too much 'structural' pressure on the root of the hair, said the study.","Term refers to tight hairdo beloved of Sarah Jessica Parker, Tulisa and Cheryl Cole .

Outside court: Sharne Tucker, 23, beat his 72-year-old grandmother up to 50 times with the walking stick iwhile she cooked breakfast . A man who brutally attacked his blind grandmother with her own walking stick while high on LSD has walked free from court - after she refused to give evidence against him. Sharne Tucker, 23, beat 72-year-old Jean Wheeler up to 50 times with the stick in the home they shared in Ferndown, Dorset, while she cooked breakfast. When police arrived after a frantic 999 call from the battered pensioner they found blood and broken furniture at the scene. The night before the vicious attack drug-crazed Tucker had taken two LSD tablets to celebrate his 23rd birthday. And when morning came he turned on his grandmother, yelling: 'I’ll kill you, you’re wicked.' Mrs Wheeler suffered cuts and bruises to her face and body in the horrifying attack but didn’t want Tucker to be prosecuted and refused to give evidence against him. A judge spared Tucker prison and let him off with a suspended jail sentence and 200 hours community service order. Campaign groups for blind people have slammed the sentence as too lenient. Jonathan Holyhead, chief executive of the Dorset Blind Association, said: 'I’m shocked and horrified at what appears to be a lenient sentence for a crime of this kind. 'It is frightening for anyone to be attacked but if you have sight loss you are even more vulnerable. 'Blind people have to put their trust and confidence in their immediate family. 'It is incredibly sad when someone abuses that trust.' Bournemouth Crown Court heard Tucker had been celebrating his 23rd birthday and took two LSD tablets the night before the attack on July 29 this year. Jennie Rickman, prosecuting, said: 'His grandmother was cooking breakfast when she heard shouting and vile language. 'He began to hit her with a stick 40 to 50 times saying ‘I’ll kill you, you’re wicked.’ 'He knocked her to the ground and she managed to get to the door, falling out on to the step. She managed to phone the police at 5.44am.' Scene: Mrs Wheeler suffered cuts and bruises to her face and body in the horrifying attack but didn't want Tucker to be prosecuted and refused to give evidence against him. Pictured is the road on which they shared a home in Ferndown, Dorset . During the 999 call, the terrified pensioner said: 'He’s gone absolutely mental, he’s normally a gentle person. 'I woke up this morning with him screaming, punching me and hitting me with a stick. 'He’s normally a wonderful person, I’ve got a big bump on my head; a tooth has been knocked out. 'This is so unexpected; not normal behaviour - he is really out of his mind, calling me a murderer.' Tucker told police he couldn’t remember the attack but pleaded guilty to assault, causing actual bodily harm. James Newton-Price, defending, said: 'It is out of character and inexplicable. He had a very close relationship with his grandmother and had lived with her for eight years. 'She referred to him as her son.' Judge Samuel Wiggs, who imposed a nine-month prison sentence suspended for two years, said: 'I see no public interest in sending you to jail.' Tucker was also ordered to pay £250 court costs.","Sharne Tucker, 23, beat 72-year-old Jean Wheeler with the stick shouting, 'I’ll kill you, you’re wicked'
