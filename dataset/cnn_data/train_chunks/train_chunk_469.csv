Apple is now worth more than Poland as its stock market value hit more than $500billion for the first time today. They become only the sixth company in history to soar past half a trillion dollars just days before the launch of the iPad 3 on March 7. Apple are now worth $506bn - in contrast Poland, with a population of 38 million people, has a GDP figure of just $497bn. The company, co-founded by Steve Jobs, is also worth more than Belgium, Sweden, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan. Apple's value only overtook Microsoft in May 2010 - but since then their ascent has been rapid. But with profits at $1billion per week, analysts have said the only way is down for the technological giants. However, despite five other companies being valued at half a trillion dollars, none have maintained their dominance for long. Exxon hit the magical $500bn valuation in 2007 for two short periods but has since seen its value fall to $411bn. Microsoft saw their value hit $600bn in 2000 - but after losing their dominance they are now worth just $267bn. Cisco Systems, Intel and General Electricity also peaked just above $500bn in early 2000. Cisco and Intel are now worth a bit more than $100bn each, while GE is worth $200bn. Last week CEO Tim Cook told . shareholders at the annual meeting that the company has more money than . it needs, and the board and management are thinking 'very deeply' about . ways to use the cash.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 9:08 PM on 28th February 2012 . Detectives at Scotland Yard lent Rebekah Brooks (pictured at the Newbury Races last year) a police horse which she acted as a 'foster carer' for . Officers at Scotland Yard lent Rebekah Brooks a police horse it has been revealed, sparking fresh questions about the relationship with the Metropolitan Police and the press. The former News International chief executive was given the retired horse in 2008, while Lord Blair was Met Commissioner, and rode it at her farm in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. Friends said the 43-year-old acted as a 'foster carer' for the horse before it was put out to pasture. Most of the Met's police horses are retired with The Horse Trust charity in Buckinghamshire. Brooks, a keen rider, is married to racehorse trainer and Old Etonian Charlie Brooks. A friend told the Evening Standard: 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse. Anybody can agree to do this with the Met if they have the land and facilities to pay for its upkeep.' The Leveson inquiry into press ethics has heard that the relationship between News International and the Met was 'at best inappropriately close and at worst corrupt'. The inquiry also heard yesterday how the Met tipped off Brooks in 2006 about the original phone-hacking investigation at the News of the World, where she was editor from 2000 to 2003. She was arrested on July . 15 last year as part of both Operation Weeting, which is investigating phone hacking, and Operation Elevden, . the investigation into police corruption. Brooks is bailed to return for questioning by police in March. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence.

Outbuildings or what appear to be stables are pictured in the foreground . Ironic: The frontpage of The Sun today was about a woman taking us for a ride - on the day it was revealed Rebekah Brooks was lent a horse by the Met Police . It has been claimed that Brooks, who . resigned from News International in the wake of the phone hacking . scandal, was a horse-riding companion of Prime Minister David Cameron . but she denies this. Lord Blair said he was not aware of the gift. Brooks's spokesman, David Wilson, from Bell Pottinger confirmed the deal took place. 'Rebekah acted as a foster carer for the horse.' A Scotland Yard spokeswoman added: 'When a police horse reaches the end of its working life, Mounted Branch officers find it a suitable retirement home. 'Whilst responsibility for feeding the animal and paying vet bills passes to the person entrusted with its care, the horse remains the property of the Metropolitan Police Service. 'Retired police horses are not sold . on and can be returned to the care of the MPS at any time. In 2008 a . retired horse was loaned to Rebekah Brooks. The horse was re-housed with . a police officer in 2010.' The . horse borrowed by Ms Brooks was one of 12 retired by the force in 2008. A further 29 had their duties ended between 2009 and 2011. Scotland Yard declined to give details or the name of the horse taken into Ms Brooks' care. A . spokesman added: 'When rehoming a retired MPS horse, the appropriate . welfare checks are carried out by mounted branch officers.'

Racing fan: Ms Brooks, right, is pictured with Rupert Murdoch's son-in-law Matthew Freud, left, at the Cheltenham Festival . The Brookses, who married in June 2009, live in a sprawling property in Chipping Norton, barely a mile from David Cameron’s £750,000 constituency home in Dean, near Charlbury. In one of the most scenic parts of England - the Cotswolds - it is at the heart of what has become known as the 'Chipping Norton Set'. Last year it was reported that the group, which also includes Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, often went  to the same house parties and dined together. Brooks became a mother to a baby girl born via surrogate earlier this month. One of Tony Blair’s closest allies today admitted that New Labour was 'too keen to curry favour' with Rupert Murdoch’s media empire. Former Cabinet minister Lord Falconer said the 'much-too-cosy relationship' may have been emulated by police chiefs and other public servants who were then drawn into the Murdoch net. He also confirmed that policies were adopted to suit the political bias of the Murdoch press. 'I do worry now that we were too keen to curry favour,' the former Lord Chancellor said on Radio 4. 'It’s not remotely inconceivable that because the politicians thought it was okay to court News International, other public officials followed. I don’t mean the explicit corruption that Deputy Assistant Commissioner [Sue] Akers described yesterday. I mean the much-too-cosy relationships that were formed where... what went onto the political agenda or what was reported about what the police did was determined by that relationship.' The peer said that the appointment of former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as David Cameron’s media adviser was another regrettable example of over-cosy relations. He said Labour began courting NI because it blamed hostile coverage in The Sun for its 1992 defeat. 'What followed was a too-determined attempt to get News International on-side.'",Mrs Brooks is a keen rider and acted as a 'foster carer' for the horse .

"Department of Health said there were 1,244 breaches of mixed sex rules in October . By . Jenny Hope . Last updated at 12:51 AM on 19th November 2011 . The number of NHS patients forced to share hospital accommodation with the opposite sex rose slightly last month. Data from the Department of Health reveals 1,244 breaches of mixed sex rules in England in October, up from a record low of 1,079 in September. The number of breaches had been falling after the Government introduced fines to tackle the problem. Stress and indignity: Life on a mixed sex ward in an NHS hospital. Hospitals are fined £250 a day if they do not stick to the rules . Hospitals are docked £250 per patient per day if they place people with members of the opposite sex without clinical justification. Of the 167 acute trusts that submitted data for October, 114 made no breaches of the rules. Hospitals in two strategic health authorities – London and South East Coast – accounted for almost two thirds of breaches across the country. One trust – East Sussex – accounted for 169 breaches due to a short-term problem. A statement from the trust said there were a few days in October when there was a ‘sudden surge in severely ill patients’ needing admission to the hospital. ‘This led to one of our day units being used to admit inpatients requiring an operation,’ it said. ‘The trust is committed to minimising cancelled operations and, for this short period of time, exceptional measures were introduced to ensure patients requiring an operation could be admitted. ‘Whilst from a quality perspective, patients were cared for well, some patients had to change behind closed curtains into theatre gowns in order to go to theatre. ‘This breached Department of  Health guidelines of same-sex accommodation.’ Single-sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping, bathroom and toilet facilities, either in single rooms or single-sex wards . Single-sex accommodation means patients of the same sex sharing sleeping, bathroom and toilet facilities, either in single rooms or single-sex wards. If men and women share a ward, then they must have separate bays or rooms. Intensive care and A&E are exempt from the policy. Almost 12,000 hospital patients stayed in mixed-sex accommodation last December, when monthly collection of data was first introduced. Since then the number of reported breaches – when a patient stayed overnight in shared accommodation – has fallen by 90 per cent. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said ‘Treating patients in mixed-sex accommodation compromises their dignity and causes additional stress at what is already a difficult and anxious time. For years, governments have said that clamping down on this is a priority, yet still it continues to happen. ‘Now the Department of Health’s figures show a marked increase in the number of people staying in mixed-sex accommodation. ‘It is clear that cuts are beginning to bite and hospitals are struggling to ensure that the care they provide is up to an acceptable standard. ‘It is not enough to spout rhetoric about mixed-sex accommodation being unacceptable, the Department of Health needs to provide practical support to the trusts who continue to breach mixed-sex accommodation guidelines to stamp out this problem once and for all.’ Health Minister Simon Burns said ‘The NHS has made significant improvement in tackling mixed-sex accommodation – down almost 90 per cent in under a year, thanks to improved transparency. ‘But despite this overall improvement, nobody should have to suffer the indignity of mixed-sex accommodation. ‘Every unjustified breach is one too many.’","Department of Health said there were 1,244 breaches of mixed sex rules in October ."

Killed: Jonathan Barnes (above) was mistakenly shot by his friend Daniel Tesfay as the pair tried to steal fake designer watches from a man in south London, the Old Bailey was told . A robber shot his friend dead by mistake as they tried to steal designer watches, the Old Bailey heard today. Daniel Tesfay, 26, and Jonathan Barnes, 20, had agreed to buy what they thought were Rolex watches for £6,500. But after they made the deal in a house in Croydon, south London, in August last year, Mr Barnes grabbed the watches and shouted 'let’s do it', jurors were told. Tesfay produced a semi-automatic pistol and threatened seller Jordaan Williams, said Roger Smart, prosecuting. But Mr Williams grabbed Mr Barnes as the men tried to flee and Tesfay again threatened him. Mr Smart said: 'Jordaan Williams again grabbed hold of Jonathan Barnes and on this occasion Daniel Tesfay then shot at him, but missed and instead shot and killed his fellow robber.' Barnes was shot in the head and died two days later. Tesfay allegedly fled, taking the gun with him. The watches were fakes and worth little, added Mr Smart. Tesfay, of no fixed address, denies murdering Mr Barnes, of Lewisham, south London. He has also pleaded not guilty to having a firearm with intent to endanger life. The trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:09 AM on 1st March 2012 . Labour was challenged to hand back donations from the Unite union yesterday after its leader called for civil disobedience during the Olympics. General secretary ‘Red Len’ McCluskey threatened illegal strikes and direct action to oppose changes to public sector pensions. Labour leader Ed Miliband joined the Trades Union Congress in denouncing Mr McCluskey’s outburst – but only after he had tweeted a mild rebuke earlier in the day. Clash: Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, was put on the defencive by David Cameron, right, over his party's links to Unite . Mr Miliband also faced calls to break the link with the union which remains Labour’s biggest donor. In the Commons, David Cameron said: . ‘Let us remember Unite is the single biggest donor to the party . opposite, providing around a third of their money, and had more role . than anybody else in putting the Right Honourable Gentleman (Mr . Miliband) in his place.’ Mr Cameron also attacked Mr Miliband for initially failing to condemn Mr McCluskey’s views in person. On Tuesday night when news of Mr . McCluskey’s views first surfaced, the Labour leader left it to his . spokesman to respond. Then yesterday morning he issued a tweet and sent . his deputy Harriet Harman to answer questions on radio and television. Disruption: 'Red Len' McCluskey threatened a year of industrial strife and said Unite would be prepared to break the law 'to defend our basic rights' But Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s not good . enough for them just to put out a tweet, they need to condemn this . utterly and start turning back the money.’ Downing Street earlier denounced the threat of strikes to disrupt the Olympics as ‘completely unacceptable and unpatriotic’. Rebuke: Nick Clegg said the public would be 'gobsmacked' and 'appalled' by Mr McCluskey's comments . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg urged Mr Miliband to ‘rein in’ the union boss. ‘I just think people will be . gobsmacked, appalled, that someone thinks that at a time when we are . finally hosting one of the greatest events in the world, he is calling . for civil disobedience,’ Mr Clegg said. ‘I know he is the sort of paymaster of the Labour party but I hope Ed Miliband will rein him in.’ Stung into action, the Labour leader eventually broke cover to speak out as he met French Socialist leader Francoise Hollande. Mr Miliband said: ‘It’s completely . wrong to make any threat to the Olympic Games – I do condemn it. We as . the Labour government fought for the Olympic Games to be brought to . Britain as part of a cross-party effort – it is a moment of national . celebration. ‘The focus of the world will be on . Britain and it is totally wrong to make a threat to the Games.’ Since . the general election Unite has given £5million to Labour, making it by . far the party’s biggest donor. 'Chaos': Mr McCluskey said action during the Olympics would bring his 'grievances to the attention of as many people as possible' Countdown: The Olympic rings mounted on a barge pass under Tower Bridge as London counts down to the games . Mr McCluskey said no precise plans had . been drawn up for action during the games, but added that they . ‘absolutely’ could include strikes. Pugh's take . ‘The attacks that are being launched . on public sector workers at the moment are so deep and ideological that . the idea the world should arrive in London and have these wonderful . Olympic Games as though everything is nice and rosy in the garden is . unthinkable. Our very way of life is being attacked,’ he said. Labour MPs were also furious last night with Mr McCluskey. ‘This is just posturing but it doesn’t do us any good,’ said one. ‘This sort of thing is unpopular with . the public and damages by association. Ed needs to take a stand and show . that he’s not Unite’s man.’ TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said: ‘The TUC and Britain’s unions have been strong supporters of the London Olympics. Unions have engaged constructively . with the Olympic authorities throughout the whole project to ensure the . good working conditions that are helping deliver the Games on time and . on budget.’ VIDEO: Shadow Olympics Minister Tessa Jowell gives her opinion on Len McCluskey's comments .","PM calls on Labour to return the million of pounds from its largest financial backer .

James Francis, 24, denies breaking into the £1.7m Warwickshire mansion of ex-England star Lee Hendrie and stealing clothes including Jimmy Choo shoes and a diamond earring. Mr Francis, who was today accompanied to court by his famous footballing father, allegedly broke into the sprawling property in the leafy Midlands village of Rowington.

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:51 PM on 1st March 2012 . President Obama left a pleasantly warm Washington this morning for a near blizzard in New Hampshire to drum up voter support as the presidential election loomed on the horizon. Wrapped in a long overcoat, the President smiled and shook hands in the snow on the runway in Manchester as the temperature hovered around 25F. Obama had set off from the capital where it was a bright and sunny day with the temperatures climbing to 66F. His convoy then moved off slowly in the slippery conditions to Nashua Community College where he toured the school's automotive lab before making a speech. Weathering the storm: President Obama arrives in snowy New Hampshire on Air Force One today . Obama has demanded that Congress . eliminate oil and gas company subsidies that he called an outrageous . government 'giveaway', an idea the White House believes resonates at a time of high gasoline prices. Obama said: 'Let's put every single member of . Congress on record: you can stand with oil companies or you can stand up . for the American people.' The President also said claims from the Republican camps . that his policies were hiking gas prices won't pass 'a political . bull-detector' test. His remarks came as retail gasoline prices . rose today to a national average of $3.74 per gallon. Warm reception: President Obama greets crowds who braved the snowstorm to shake his hand in Manchester, New Hampshire . Obama has repeatedly called for an end to $4 billion in annual tax breaks and subsidies for oil and gas companies. He told the college crowd: 'It's outrageous. It's inexcusable. I'm asking Congress - eliminate this oil industry giveaway right away.' Determined: Obama didn't let a little snowfall put him off the campaign trail in New Hampshire . It was Obama's latest and most direct appeal to Congress to act on the tax breaks, a move that was certain to get stiff Republican opposition. On the presidential campaign trail, GOP front-runner Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have decried Obama's energy policies. Anticipating the President's speech, Romney argued in Fargo, North Dakota, that the president has tried to slow oil, gas and coal production through his Environmental Protection Agency and changes in policies governing federal lands. Romney said: 'He's going to talk about how he's responsible for the increasing production of oil in this country, oil and gas in this country. 'Is he responsible for the increase? No, I didn't think so.' Gingrich, campaigning in Woodstock, Georgia, called on Obama to fire Energy Secretary Steven Chu, approve a Canada-Texas pipeline and open more of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska to oil drilling. Gingrich said: 'He ran in 2008 on the slogan, ''Yes we can''. He's running this year on the slogan ''Why we couldn't''.' New Hampshire is a small but strategically important general election battleground for the Democratic President. Though Obama easily carried New Hampshire in 2008, the President and his staff have paid particular political attention to the state in recent months. Chilled out: Obama shakes hands with a small boy who had wrapped up against the cold to meet the President . The trip marks the President's second . visit to the state in about three months. Vice President Joe Biden has . been a frequent visitor to New Hampshire, and First Lady Michelle held a . conference call with campaign volunteers in the state yesterday. Though New Hampshire offers only four electoral votes in the November election, Democrats have been watching the state warily following its sharp shift to the right in the 2010 mid-term elections. Further fueling concerns for Democrats are GOP front-runner Mitt Romney's personal ties to New Hampshire. Romney served as governor of neighboring Massachusetts, owns a vacation home in New Hampshire and scored an overwhelming victory in the state's Republican primary in January. Treading carefully: Obama and secret service agents make their way to the motorcade to drive to Nashua Community College where he made a speech . However, a poll conducted in New . Hampshire early last month showed Obama beating Romney by 10 percentage . points in a hypothetical match-up. Dante Scala, a political scientist at . the University of New Hampshire, said that with the state's economy on . solid footing compared with national trends and the President boosting . his presence in the state, some New Hampshire Democrats were starting to . feel more confident about their prospects in November. He said: 'There probably was concern . among Democrats that maybe New Hampshire is not part of the president's . re-election plan. Now things have kind of reverted back to form in a . hurry.' Following his remarks in New Hampshire, Obama travelled to New York for four campaign fundraisers.

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 7:38 AM on 1st March 2012 . Josh Wakeham, aged just 22 months, was killed in a freak accident when the cord from his bedroom window blind became wrapped around his neck . A toddler has become the latest child to die after getting tangled in window blind cords. Josh Wakeham, who was 22 months old, was killed after the string became wrapped round his neck as he looked out of the window. His death comes less than a week after an inquest heard how two-year-old Emily Warner died after becoming trapped in a cord in her bedroom. Shocking figures show there have been 22 deaths caused by blind cords since 1999 – with half of the cases  occurring since the start of 2010. Yesterday, as a campaign warning of the dangers posed by window blind cords was launched, Josh's parents spoke of their devastation. It is believed he may have struggled to free himself after getting tangled up in the string, which then became wrapped more tightly around his neck. His mother Tracey, 34, who discovered her son's body kneeling on his bed at the family home in Newport, South Wales, said: 'We don't want anyone else to go through this hell. 'When I found him I was just thinking this cannot be happening. He'd only been in his own bed for around two months. He had night lights and toys surrounding it. 'When I found him it just looked like he was looking out of the  window. His grandparents lived next door so he always used to be looking out and waving.' She added: 'He was a brilliant little guy – he loved to play. He really was a little angel, there was no other way to describe him. 'Some days I wake up and I don't want to get out of bed. We've got questions for which there will  never be any answers.' Josh's death on January 24 is the latest in a series of fatal accidents caused by blind cords. Warning: Josh's Mother Tracey Ford with her partner and Josh's Stepfather Tim Llewellin are warning other parents of the dangers of looped cords on window blinds . In October last year, 18-month-old . Rithik Chakrabarti died in his bedroom in Dorset. And in 2009 Gethin . Jones, 23 months, was found strangled at his home in Nefyn, North Wales. Last week, the parents of Emily Warner told how their family had been left 'broken' by her death. The little girl had been put to bed . but stood up on the end of her bed-frame and was climbing across her . window sill when the accident happened last August.

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 12:03 AM on 2nd March 2012 . 'Drill sergeant from hell': Joyce Hardin Garrad, 46, said is charged with capital murder in her granddaughter's death . A woman accused of running her 9-year-old granddaughter to death as punishment for eating chocolate was captured on a school bus videotape saying she planned to run the child ''til she can't run no more,' a prosecutor told a judge Thursday in announcing capital murder charges. Joyce Hardin Garrard, who faces a potential death penalty if convicted, made the threat as she yanked Savannah Hardin off a school bus that was equipped with a surveillance system, said Marcus Reid, an assistant district attorney in Etowah County. Angered by a supposed lie the child told, Garrard told the driver: '""I gonna run her `til she can't run no more,""' Reid said. 'That's exactly what she did,' said the prosecutor, calling Garrard a 'drill sergeant from hell.' Garrard, . 46, and Savannah's stepmother, 27-year-old Jessica Mae Hardin, are both . charged in the child's death last month. Authorities say the older . woman made the child run for three hours carrying 10 pounds of wood as punishment, and the younger . woman - who was nine months pregnant at the time and has since given . birth - did nothing to intervene. The defense contends neither woman did . anything intentional to cause the child's death, which they blame on an . unspecified medical problem. Court documents in an unrelated custody . case show the child had health issues and made frequent trips to . doctors. Reid said after taking the child off the bus, Garrard forced Savannah to run and carry firewood until she collapsed in exhaustion in her yard. Autopsy photos show marks on the girl's arms from where the logs dug into her skin, Reid said, and a debris pile of limbs and large logs was visible outside the house the day after charges were filed against the women. The child's father, Robert Hardin, sat behind the defense table during the hearing in apparent support of Garrard, his mother, and Hardin, his wife. Other relatives and friends sat around him, occasionally mouthing words to the two women. District Judge William D. Russell did not immediately rule on a defense request to lower the women's bonds, now set at $500,000 cash each. State law doesn't law bond for capital defendants, and prosecutors said he might also upgrade charges against Hardin by next week to capital murder. Tragic: Savannah Hardin (left) collapsed after being forced to run three hours carrying 10 pounds of firewood in her arms while her stepmother, Jessica Mae Hardin, 26, (right) stood by, prosecutors say . District Attorney Jimmie Harp said a grand jury that begins meeting Monday will likely consider the case. Authorities say medics responding to a 911 call found the child having seizures at the family's mobile home February 17. Her father, who was overseas working as a State Department contractor at the time, rushed home and made the decision to remove the girl from life support three days later. Terrible death: Savannah showed the same fatigue as if an adult had been forced to run a marathon without drinking water, doctors say . Authorities said an autopsy revealed the . girl was severely dehydrated and had extremely low sodium levels. They . compared her condition to that of an athlete who ran a marathon without . drinking any water. When Reid called Garrard the 'drill sergeant from hell' and pointed at her, Garrard's lawyer Dani Bone, who jumped up between Reid and Garrard, crossed his arms and yelled at Reid to quit pointing at the woman. 'That's inappropriate!' Bone said. 'Run to death': This is the house where Savannah collapsed after her forced run. She was being punished for lying about eating a candy bar . While Reid said Hardin spent time on her laptop and talking on a cellphone while her stepdaughter was forced to run, defense lawyers said the younger woman was busy caring for her 3-year-old son and didn't know what was happening. Defense attorney Morgan Cunningham said the woman went into labor while being questioned about Savannah's death and gave birth the day of her arrest. Asking for the bond reduction, Cunningham said the woman needs time to be a mother. 'She needs to be able to bond with the newborn,' he said. Authorities said Hardin called 911 after the child collapsed.","Prosecutors still considering capital murder charge for stepmother Jessica Hardin, who gave birth in police custody after arrest .

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 10:10 PM on 1st March 2012 . Failed: Anthony Lester, 26, committed suicide in a Tucson prison cell after the schizophrenic patient was mistakenly given a razor by guards . The family of a mentally ill man who committed suicide in his prison cell have seen horrific footage for the first time which shows the 26-year-old bleeding to death while guards stand around and watch. Anthony Lester took his own life after he was mistakenly given razors in a prisoner hygiene pack. He cut his wrists and jugular vein in a shared cell in Tucson, Arizona. The Lester family have battled with the state for almost two years to gain access to the footage, filmed by one of the guards Umberto Hernandez who went to Lester's cell after the alarm was raised in July 2010. Correction officers can allegedly be seen doing nothing for 23 minutes while the young man bled heavily from his wounds while lying on a top bunk bed. None of the officers attempted to save his life by staunching the bleeding, said Lester's family and their lawyer who have seen the tape, according to 12 News. Instead the guards wandered around the cell while one wondered if the prisoner, who was still alive, had left a 'suicide note'. His family filed a claim last January . against the state for $3million alleging that the Department of Correction's (DOC) substandard treatment of patients with mental illness led . to the 26-year-old's death. Anthony Lester had been diagnosed with schizophrenia when he was in high school and had struggled with his condition, self-harming as a teenager. He told family that the voices were 'getting worse'. In 2007, he stabbed two female friends at a party and was sentenced to 12 years for aggravated assault. After receiving medication he was deemed to be fit for trial but a judge and court-appointed psychiatrist advised Lester should be housed in a facility where he would receive the necessary mental health treatment. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Horror: The aftermath of the cell in the Arizona prison where Anthony Lester slit his throat and wrists . Emergency: A pool of blood can be seen on the floor. The prisoner was mistakenly given razor blades by prison guards despite the fact he had been on suicide watch . However he was placed in the general . population of inmates at the Arizona State Prison Complex in Tucson, . went off his medication and was sent to a unit for behavioral problems. In June 2010 he had tried to kill . himself in prison - but was taken off suicide watch two days prior to his . death and put into a shared cell. The mentally ill man cut into . his neck, wrists and legs and one image showed that in his disturbed state, he wrote 'voices' on . the wall in his own blood. After the alarm was raised, guards rushed to the cell. In a recording of the 911 call, one officer was heard saying that a prisoner has 'severely cut himself'. Vulnerable: Corrections officers said at an investigation that they didn't go to Lester's help because they thought he had a concealed weapon . Nightmare: Lester's aunt Patti Jones (right) and his mother (left) have both watched the footage where the young man can be seen bleeding to death in his prison cell while guards stand around talking . His aunt Patti Jones watched the distressing footage of her nephew's last moments along with the young man's mother. She told 12 News that on the film, guards wandered around the cell, wondering out loud whether there was a suicide note. She told the station: 'Someone then says: ''I think he's expired'' and Tony's breath gets shallower.' The four prison guards on duty that . night were later suspended and investigated including Hernandez and a guard with 13 years experience, Orlando Pope. They said they had not tried to save Lester because his hand was . concealed by a blanket and they believed he had a weapon. Failures: The family of Tony Lester are suing Arizona state claiming that their mentally ill relative was negligently treated in prison . His aunt Mrs Jones angrily denied this allegation, telling 12 News that her nephew was 'weak and vulnerable'. She added: 'No one knew his medical history... no one knew his name.' 'No one knew his medical history... no one knew his name.' Patti Jones, aunt . According to the family, in the footage  paramedics rusedh in and wheeled the seriously injured prisoner out on a stretcher. Officer Pope followed, carrying shackles and chains. The Arizona Department of Corrections did not   reply to a request for comment by MailOnline today. Distressing images of Lester's body after his death show wounds to his neck and wrist held together with staples. In tapes from the internal investigation, the most senior guard Orlando Pope was asked: 'So you guys just stood around for 23 minutes and watched this guy bleed to death?' Pope answered: 'No, we kept trying to call him, get his attention and get him to say something... but he was still breathing.' Pope also told the internal committee that he did not believe he had adequate first-aid training. Another unidentified officer told the investigation: '...and the amount of blood that was there, was really kind of hard to get close to him without literally wallowing in it, to be honest with you.' Anthony Lester's family was seeking $3 million in damages to compensate Lester’s mother and his young daughter.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:40 AM on 2nd March 2012 . A Kentucky woman has been jailed for life without parole for killing an expectant mother and ripping her unborn baby . from her womb. Kathy . Coy, 34, was handed the sentence after admitting to the brutal murder of Jamie Stice, 21, on the grounds of mental illness in a plea deal which allowed her to avoid the death sentence. Ms Stice's son, Isaiah Allen Stice Reynolds, survived the horrific attack although he was born five weeks premature and lives with his father. Guilty: Kathy Michelle Coy, seen here at an earlier hearing has been sentenced to life in prison for murdering Jamie Stice, 21, in a horrific plot to cut out her unborn baby from her body to claim as her own . Coy, dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit and shackled at the hands and feet, did not speak during the sentencing held today. She showed no reaction as deputies led her from the courtroom after the hearing. Warren Circuit Judge John Grise  said the word evil is used even for small disagreements or disputes, and is overused by attorneys and judges. 'Here, however, was evil at work,' Grise said. Remembered: Stice's baby was five weeks premature . Prosecutors said Coy had befriended . Stice on Facebook and used a stun gun to subdue the pregnant woman last . April after luring her out of the house by saying they were going . baby-supply shopping. Police said after Coy stunned Stice, . she slit her wrists, cut the baby from her body and took the baby, a . uterus, ovaries and a placenta to a local hospital. The umbilical cord was still attached, police said. Coy, who has children of her own . living with other relatives, initially told police she gave birth to the . boy, then said she bought him for $550. In statements to the court and after . the sentencing, Stice's family and friends were torn between condemning . Coy and celebrating a murdered woman they called the 'Little Angel Mom'. Her cousin, Carolyn Miracle, said Jamie Stice had been 'ready to be a mommy' when she was slain. Kathleen Smith, the paternal grandmother of Isaiah, looked directly at Coy as she read a statement saying, . 'If you knew Jamie, you couldn't help but love her.' Smith then lashed out at Coy, who closed her eyes. 'The death penalty would be too merciful for you,' Smith said. Miracle said her family was . devastated by Jamie Stice's death, with her uncle unable speak about it . and others still haunted by the loss of the expectant mother. Miracle said her aunt, Jeannie Stice, had 'her heart stomped on' by Coy. Miracle baby Isaiah, pictured here visiting his mother's grave with his father James Reynolds, survived being snatched from his Jamie Stice's womb . 'Kathy Coy decided she would play God . and took our Jamie from us,' Miracle said. 'There's no amount of time . you can give Kathy Coy that would be enough. There is a higher court that will judge Kathy. The victim's mutilated body was found off a dirt road in southern Kentucky on April 14, a day after she had been seen leaving her home with Coy. Police arrested Coy at a local hospital after she had arrived with the infant but showed no signs of having given birth. Psychologist Eric Drogin testified . briefly before the plea was entered last month. Mr Drogin said he met with Coy recently and that she suffers from a . mental illness. Left for dead: Jamie Stice, 21, was eight months . pregnant when she was attacked and her mutilated body was found in woodland.  James Reynolds, right, and Stice were no longer together when she was murdered . After . killing Stice and stealing the baby boy, Coy drove to the home of a . friend and said she had given birth to the baby. The . friend told troopers that Coy was in a car, wearing no pants and . sitting on the placenta while holding the baby, who had grass on him. The friend called for an ambulance . after helping to clean the baby and taking a picture of the newborn. Police searched Coy's home and . computer, finding links to two pregnant women on her Facebook page. Investigators found one of the women unharmed, but couldn't find Stice. Police would later find a stun gun and two knives believed to be used in the attack. 'I . then asked Ms Coy if that baby was Jamie Stice's,' Kentucky State . Police detective Chad Winn had said at an earlier hearing. 'She answered . ""I don't know,"" I was alarmed by this.' Heartbreak: Jamie's tearful sister Angie, left, and mother Jeannie, right, being hugged by their attorney, pictured at court last month, have been left devastated by the murder . Coy eventually led detectives to a wooded area off a dirt road, where the victim's remains were located. Jamie Stice's body was found face down on the ground, disemboweled with her hands tied behind her back the next day. Mr Winn told reporters last month that Coy, who has two children of her own, had faked pregnancies and was obsessed with the thought of having a baby. In . further testimony heard last spring, the detective said that Coy had asked her . teenage son to help her commit murder but when he refused she said she . was just joking. She had told people she was pregnant and had been hatching a plan for months, it was alleged. She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim. Mentally ill: The killer was previously married to Shannon Coy, pictured centre. She was already a mother of two when she killed Ms Stice, having a daughter and a son from previous relationships . She even stole a sonogram photo to help back her claim. ‘She was desperate to prove to everybody that she was pregnant, and I . guess nobody believed her,’ said Ms Stice's friend, Ashley Reeder. ‘So I think she did this to show everybody that she was going to have the baby when it really wasn't her baby,’ she told NBC. Her neighbours in Bowling Green were all taken in by Coy’s baby scam. ‘She has been telling everyone that she was pregnant and we had no reason not to believe otherwise,’ said Darla Mueller. 'The miracle in the whole thing is that the baby made it,' Winn said of Jamie Stice's baby. Jamie Stice's 29-year-old brother Eric Stice: 'It's . heartbreaking, heartbreaking. We'll just make sure Isaiah . has the best life we can offer him. We owe that to my sister.'","Kathy Coy, 34, pleaded guilty in a deal that spared her the death penalty .

"By . Mark Duell . Last updated at 4:45 PM on 1st March 2012 . Two nurses who were allegedly attacked by Douglas Kennedy as he tried to take out his three-day-old son from their hospital both revealed today they are still suffering emotionally and physically. Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman Luciano were involved in a vicious scuffle with the late Robert F. Kennedy’s son on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York. Douglas Kennedy, 44, tried to get in a lift with his son Bo to give the baby some fresh air - but he was not allowed to take the boy outside and the nurses blocked his path, they claimed on MSNBC. Scroll down for video . 'We were attacked': Anna Margaret Lane, left, and Cari Maleman Luciano, right, were involved in the vicious scuffle with Douglas Kennedy on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York . Hospital: Douglas Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk outside . ‘We kept saying to him: “We need to step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to you. It's my child.’ Mr Kennedy claims that as he was leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the nurse to protect his son. That nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to the maternity ward rather than go outside. ‘I still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’ 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy . Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way in January . Fox News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968. 'We kept saying to him: “We need to step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room""' Cari Maleman Luciano, nurse . ‘It is sickening to think that our simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a statement. Mr Kennedy, the 10th child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, still maintains he did nothing wrong and was arraigned last week in Mount Kisco, New York, on the charges, his defence lawyer Robert Gottlieb said. He is next due in court in April. But Mr Gottlieb claimed his client had already received permission from other nurses to leave the hospital and so it wasn’t right that his path was blocked. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas . Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7 . Family: Mr Kennedy is pictured as a baby with his parents Bobby and Ethel Kennedy, months before the assassination of the former Attorney General and presidential candidate . Dr Timothy Haydock, an emergency room . physician at the hospital and a close Kennedy family friend, claimed ‘unequivocally that the nurses were the only . aggressors’. 'I still have pain in my arm' Anna Margaret Lane, nurse . But Ms Luciano's husband Steve told . the New York Daily News his 5ft wife was simply trying to ensure that Mr . Kennedy followed hospital rules when he wanted to take his son Bo for a . walk. Ms Lane told MSNBC she was only doing her job and the whole experience was ‘traumatic’. Robert .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 9:53 AM on 1st March 2012 . North Korea has agreed to stop nuclear tests, uranium enrichment and long-range missile launches in return for food aid. The secretive communist state will also allow inspectors to visit a nuclear complex. In return, Washington is set to provide Pyongyang with 240,000 tons of food aid. North Korea has suffered persistent food shortages since a famine in the 1990s. Progress talks: The announcement from Kim Jong Un (right) followed sit-down negotiations between the U.S. and North Korea in Beijing, the first such meeting since the death of Kim Jong Il (left) New era: Kim Jong Un may pull the same poses as his father, but his political stance may be different . The announcement, which follows talks between U.S. and North Korean diplomats in Beijing last week, paves the way for the possible resumption of six-party disarmament negotiations with Pyongyang, which broke down in 2009. It marks a significant policy shift by the North Korean leadership after the death in December of leader Kim Jong Il, who was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said her country still had 'profound concerns', but welcomed the move as a 'first step'. A North Korean statement said the measures were 'aimed at building confidence for the improvement of relations'. Halt: Inspectors are to be allowed to visit North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear plant (pictured) A spokesman for the U.S. State Department said: 'To improve the atmosphere for dialogue and demonstrate its commitment to de-nuclearisation, the DPRK has agreed to implement a moratorium on long-range missile launches, nuclear tests, and nuclear activities at Yongbyon, including uranium enrichment activities. Israel's deputy foreign minister said North Korea's agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for food aid is not a blueprint for Iran. 'The two cases are entirely dissimilar,' Danny Ayalon told Israel Radio today. He added: 'As we know the Koreans already crossed the threshold of nuclear capability and this is not what we want to see in Iran.' Israel and the United States say that Iran is developing nuclear weapons. They disagree on how to react. Israeli leaders have hinted at striking Iran, while Washington advises waiting for sanctions to take effect. Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu flies to the United States today for talks that will likely focus on Iran. 'The DPRK has also agreed to the return of IAEA inspectors to verify and monitor the moratorium on uranium enrichment activities at Yongbyon and confirm the disablement of the 5-MW reactor and associated facilities.' The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Korea's official name. The State Department added that in return the United States was ready to finalise details of a proposed food aid package of 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance, and that more aid could be agreed based on continued need. The spokesman added: 'The United States still has profound concerns regarding North Korean behaviour across a wide range of areas, but today's announcement reflects important, if limited, progress in addressing some of these. The statement said Washington reaffirmed that it did not have hostile intentions toward North Korea and was prepared to take steps to improve bilateral ties and increase people-to-people exchanges. The U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Glyn Davies, told reporters those talks made some progress on issues including nuclear non-proliferation, North Korea's demands for food aid and other issues at the heart of regional tension. The talks are aimed at laying the groundwork for renewed six-party disarmament negotiations with North Korea, whose ties with South Korea have deteriorated, especially after deadly attacks on the South in 2010. Cautious: Hillary Clinton (left) welcomed the move as a 'first step', while Russia (whose Prime Minister is Vladimir Putin, right) said it had urged North Korea to take the same steps last spring . Russia welcomed the move, with its Foreign Ministry saying in a statement: 'We welcome North Korea's decision to impose a moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and launching long-range ballistic missiles, and enriching uranium.' The statement added that Moscow had urged North Korea to take the same steps last spring. It said: 'Such parallel efforts by the participants in the six-party talks ... are gradually bringing us closer to their resumption.' North Korea's top nuclear negotiator is now heading to New York. Ri Yong Ho, the North Korean vice foreign minister in charge of nuclear negotiations, will attend a forum at Syracuse University in New York state. The State Department has cleared his travel to the U.S., a source said. Ri is expected to meet U.S. officials on the sidelines of the forum, which is being co-hosted by Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung, a German non-governmental organisation. The U.S and North Korea have announced a nuclear-disarmament-for-aid deal after their first nuclear talks since the death of Kim Jong Il. Here's a timeline of some key developments of North-South tensions in Korean history: . - Sept. 9, 1948: Kim Il Sung establishes the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the northern half of the Korean peninsula. - June 25, 1950: North Korea invades the South, beginning the Korean War. United States backs South Korea, while China and the Soviet Union provide support to the North. - July 27, 1953: Korean War ends in armistice, not a peace treaty. Demilitarised Zone established along the border; U.S. military presence in South Korea remains. - July 8, 1994: Kim Il Sung dies of a heart attack at age 82. His son, Kim Jong Il, succeeds him as leader. - Mid-1990s: North Korea suffers a devastating famine that kills an estimated 5 to 10 per cent of its population. - Spring 2009: North Korea withdraws from talks with its neighbours and the U.S. over ending its nuclear program and conducts a second nuclear test. - September 2010: Kim Jong Il unveils his third son, the twenty-something Kim Jong Un, as his successor, and assigns him to high-ranking positions in the Workers' Party and military. - July 27, 2011: Senior North Korean diplomat visits New York to negotiate ways to restart six-nation nuclear disarmament talks. - Oct. 24, 2011: U.S. and North Korean diplomats open talks in Geneva on Pyongyang's nuclear program. - Nov. 30, 2011: North Korea says it is making rapid progress on work to enrich uranium and build a light-water nuclear power plant, increasing worries that the country is developing another way to make atomic weapons. - Dec. 19, 2011: North Korea announces that Kim Jong Il has died of a heart attack while riding on his personal train. South Korea puts its military on alert while people break into tears on the streets of Pyongyang as they learn the news. Kim Jong Un dubbed 'great successor'. - Dec. 30, 2011: North Korea warns the world there will be no softening on its position toward South Korea's government. - Feb. 23, 2012: Amid cautious optimism, U.S. and North Korean envoys meet in Beijing for their first talks on dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear programs since the death of Kim Jong Il. - Feb. 29, 2012: In concurrent announcements, the U.S. and North Korea say they have reached a deal for the U.S. to provide food aid to North Korea in exchange for the North's suspension of uranium enrichment and a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests.","Inspectors to be allowed access to Yongbyon nuclear plant .

But photos have now emerged of The Monkees star Davy Jones looking healthy and happy at an autographing session just over a fortnight ago. The lead singer of the 1960s group died at his home in Florida at the age of 66 on Wednesday morning. Scroll down for video... A picture of health: Davy Jones, who suddenly passed away on Wednesday morning, looked happy as he signed autographs at an event in California just two weeks ago . Stars including Eva Longoria, Boy George and Nancy Sinatra have all taken to Twitter to express their shock and sadness at his passing. And seen in pictures that have emerged of him just a fortnight ago, the singer looked tanned and full of life. The singer was appearing at the quarterly 'Hollywood show' autograph session in Burbank, California on 11 February alongside other star greeters including Harry Potter's Tom Felton and American Pie actress Shannon Elizabeth. And he was clearly enjoying himself as fans flocked to see him and receive their own special signature.

Stuart, where he was pronounced deceased.  At this time there do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.  Family has been notified.' His bandmate, drummer Micky . Dolenz, released a statement to TMZ saying he had 'bad dreams all night . long' before learning of his friend's death this morning. 'Can't believe it...Still in shock...had bad dreams all night long,' Dolenz said, adding: 'My love and prayers go out to Davy's girls and family right now.' Bassist Peter Tork released a statement saying: 'It is with great sadness that I reflect on the sudden passing of my long-time friend and fellow-adventurer, David Jones.' With his bandmats: From left, Peter Tork, Mickey Dolenz, Jones and Michael Nesmith, seen here in 1966 . 'His talent will be much missed; his gifts will be with us always.

Nesmith who didn't join the original members of the group, Davy, Micky . and Peter - in reuniting for a 45th anniversary tour last year - also . revealed he will 'miss' the pop icon. He . wrote: 'I will miss him, but I won’t abandon him to mortality. I will . think of him as existing within the animating life that insures . existence.' The 911 call that was made to call an ambulance to Davy's home can be heard below. The woman on the phone is heard telling the operator that she needs an ambulance and urged 'hurry'. She was then heard shouting at other people in the background. Davy leaves behind four daughters, . Talia Elizabeth, 43, and Sarah Lee, 40 from his marriage to Linda . Haines, and Jessica Lillian, 30, and 23-year-old Annabel Charlotte from . his marriage to Anita Pollinger. Monkee-ing around: Davy joined The Monkees in 1965 along with Micky, Peter and Michael Nesmith and became a television hit . The pop icon – who was born in . Manchester, North West England – married 33-year-old TV presenter . Jessica Pacheo, who he met in 2006, in August 2009. In May 2011, the singer said he was having some of the happiest times he's ever had in his life with Jessica. He explained: 'We have love. We have . friendship. She’s also aware of what I’ve done in music, and the fact . that I no longer really need to prove anything.' Davy joined The Monkees in 1965 along . with Micky, Peter and Michael Nesmith – who did not rejoin the group . for their shows last year – and they went on to record a number of hit . records including Daydream Believer, Last Train To Clarksville and I'm a .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 5:20 PM on 1st March 2012 . A furious Italian son has uploaded footage of his mother being violently mugged by two thugs and offered a 2,000 Euro reward for information. The shocking footage became an overnight sensation after it was posted on YouTube, and attracted more than 30,000 hits within 24 hours before being picked up by Italian news sites and broadcast on TV. In the dramatic scenes a woman is seen walking down a quiet street when a black car pulls up behind her. One yob jumps out and tries to grab her handbag, before being joined by an accomplice who makes a cowardly attempt to kick and slap her before jumping back into the passenger seat. Scroll down for video . Violent attack: The CCTV footage shows the woman walking down a suburban street, before being set upon by yobs who grab her handbag and try to kick and slap her . Fighting back: Having lost her handbag to the muggers, the woman kicks at their car, frantically grabbing at the open windscreen - but the thieves escape with her possessions . The woman eventually loses the struggle but does not give up and starts to kick and punch the car, frantically grabbing at the open windscreen before it drives off, leaving her distressed and upset in the street. The film was shot on a CCTV camera in a sidestreet of Frattamaggiore, a suburb of the crime-ridden southern Italian port city of Naples. It was posted by Giuseppe Munciguerra after he was sent it by his father - who went to help his wife when she called and told him of her ordeal. In the text below the film which he uploaded on You Tube, Giuseppe wrote: 'Here's a robbery that took place on 28 February 2012, in Frattamaggiore, Naples. 'If you know one of these two robbers (two idiots) please let me know so that I can teach them how to punch someone. That woman is my mother and it really angered me to see how they lashed out at a defenceless person. 'They actually risked getting a good thumping from her. How embarrassing. If anyone can give me the names of the two people there is 2,000 Euro in it. Thanks.' Hundreds of people posted comments on YouTube about the footage, with many praising Giuseppe for his actions while others suggested he should leave it to the police to track down the culprits. Helpless: The thieves speed away, while their victim is left alone and distressed in the street . One comment posted by a user called 'Purpietello' said: 'Forget about the 2,000 Euro, when you find out who they are let me know and I will come and give you a hand,' while another said: 'I hope you catch them before the police.' Giuseppe said: 'I live out of town but my dad sent me the footage after the owner of the shop let him have it. My mother has reported the incident to the police but I wanted to do something because I was just so shocked when I saw the film. 'I hope someone can identify them. It's just another embarrassment for the city of Naples, but that woman is my mother and I didn't like seeing her treated that way. I've posted it on Facebook as well and I just hope someone recognises them and contacts me. 'Sadly this sort of thing happens all the time in Naples but we should not let these people win - we should stand up and take action against them.' A police spokesman in Frattamaggiore said: 'We are aware of the incident and are investigating. We would advise against any sort of vigilante action but if anyone has any information they should contact us.' Street muggings are common in the Naples area, and many of the culprits are drug addicts looking for a quick fix. The region is in the control of the ruthless local Mafia, who are known as the Camorra.","YouTube footage of incident in Naples got more than 30,000 hits in 24 hours .

"By . David Williams . Last updated at 8:36 PM on 28th February 2012 . A British photographer was smuggled out of the besieged Syrian city of Homs on a stretcher in a 26-hour operation that is reported to have seen a dozen volunteers killed. The extraordinary escape of wounded Sunday Times cameraman and film-maker Paul Conroy into Lebanon along a 20-mile smuggling route came despite the continued withering bombardment of Homs. But it emerged that three other journalists, including the badly injured French correspondent Edith Bouvier, had been separated from the 47-year-old Briton by the intensity of Syrian Army fire and forced to turn back. Wounded: British photojournalist Paul Conroy has been smuggled out of the besieged Syrian city of Homs . This evening French President Nicolas . Sarkozy said 31-year-old Bouvier, who works for Le Figaro, had been . officially evacuated after 'tough negotiations.' He gave no details but . said she was suffering from 'multiple fractures.' News of the dramatic . escape came as the total death toll in Syria climbed past 7,500, according to U.N. estimates. The United Nations has reports that 'the death toll now often . exceeds 100 civilians a day, including women and children.' Mr Conroy, a former soldier and . father-of-three, was said to be in 'good shape and good spirits' as he . received treatment in Beirut for three leg wounds sustained last week . during the shelling of a makeshift press centre in Homs that killed . veteran correspondent Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. Speaking at the family home in Totnes, . Devon, Mr Conroy's wife, Kate, confirmed the release, adding : 'All I . can say is that we are delighted and overjoyed at the news.' Appeal: Rosemarie Colvin, the mother of journalist Marie Colvin, who was killed in Syria last week, today made an emotional appeal 'begging' for help as she told how she could not rest 'with my daughter's remains in that country' His father . Les described his son as being in 'very good spirits,' adding : 'We're . all very relieved and happy that Paul's out.' After several frustrated . attempts to rescue the injured and recover the two bodies, Mr Conroy and . his colleagues had taken the decision to try and escape with the help . of Syrian volunteers during a respite in the shelling of Homs on Sunday . night. They chose instead to take their . chances along the precarious smuggling route which had successfully . taken 40 wounded Syrians out of the country to neighbouring Lebanon in . the previous six days. The route, which is in nightly use to . ferry in medical supplies and food and to extract the wounded from Homs, . was established 10 months ago by Syrian activists with the help of . Avaaz, the human rights campaign group. 'That night all four decided to go for . it,' the Avaaz spokesman in Beirut said, 'They wanted to go together. So the activists that we co-ordinate got them all to the exit place from . the actual neighbourhood where they had been waiting. 'From that point the operation went . wrong. They were shelled. Three activists were killed, and Paul Conroy . was the only one to get out. The others got split up, and we believe . that they turned back to Homs.' Leg injuries: French photojournalist Edith Bouvier was also wounded in the deadly bombardment last week. Her whereabouts are today unclear . Tragic: Ms Colvin (left) died alongside French photojournalist Remi Ochlik (right) David Cameron chaired a meeting of the . Government’s National Security Council (NSC) today which focused on how . to increase the political and economic pressure on the Bashar Assad . regime. Although Syria has been discussed at . previously meetings of the NSC, it was the first to be devoted . exclusively to the escalating crisis in the Middle Eastern country. It was attended by senior ministers as . well as the Chief of Defence Staff General Sir David Richards, said the . Prime Minister’s spokesman. Further NSC meetings are expected in the . coming weeks. Asked if military options, such as the . supply of weapons to rebels, were also discussed, the spokesman said: . ‘The focus of our efforts is on how we can bring further political and . economic pressure to bear.’ He added: ‘The purpose of the meeting . was to take stock of the situation. Clearly there is a very challenging . situation in Syria. ‘The Prime Minister believes that . there is a moral imperative for the international community to do more . to stop the violence and support a political solution in Syria. ‘They were discussing different economic and political options to bring pressure on the regime.’ The possibility of seeking a UN . Security Council resolution narrowly focused on humanitarian issues in . the hope of gaining the support of Russia and China, who refused to back . a resolution condemning the violence, was ‘one option we would be . considering’, said the spokesman. However he stressed that there was as yet no international consensus on any of the issues surrounding Syria. Amid great secrecy, Mr Conroy continued . with his helpers towards the border. 'The route is very complex because . they are dodging the Syrian army, minefields and a huge military base,' the spokesman explained. 'They get to one position, they talk . to each other very quickly by satellite phone, decide whether it's safe, . then move again. Sometimes motorbikes are used. 'They were shelled again and more of . our activists were killed. We don't know exactly how many but we think . about 10. Paul went into hiding again and we finally got him out after . 26 hours from start to finish.' There is no news on whether the bodies . of Ms Colvin or Ochlik had been moved from Homs but her mother, . Rosemarie Colvin made an emotional appeal today 'begging' for help . as she told how she could not rest 'with my daughter's remains in that . country'. Speaking on the BBC, she said she . would not accept the award winning correspondent being buried in Syria, . insisting : 'No, I can't accept that...I want my daughter back. 'Sometime, somehow we will bring her . home. I can't rest myself, I can't have peace in my life with my . daughter's remains in that country. I think that mothers listening to me . would feel the same way and understand how a mother feels. 'Anyone who can help in any way, I . would just beg them to do it.' She added: 'I'm going to miss her. I . didn't want her to be the cause or the reason but I do wish that her . death does mean something and that perhaps it would help to end some of . these terrible, terrible things that are happening.' Meanwhile today U.S. Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton said Syrian President . Bashar al-Assad could be tried for war crimes, but has admitted . pursuing charges against him could make it more difficult to persuade . him to give up power. Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki said he is ready to . offer asylum to Syria's leader Bashar Assad and senior figures in his . regime as part of a negotiated solution to end the Syrian conflict. Tunisia would be a surprising choice . for Assad's retirement as it was the first Arab nation to topple a . longtime autocrat when its former president fled the country a year ago . in the face of protests. During a . stormy meeting today, the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva . called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said . she had received reports that 'massive campaigns of arrests' by Syrian . troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food, water and . medical supplies. Syria's representative to the UN, . Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, stormed out of the session, accusing countries of . ""inciting sectarianism and providing arms"". Smoke rising from shelling in the Baba Amr neighbourhood in the city of Homs . Homs was said to have come . under some of its heaviest bombardment yet, with the government sending . in units of an elite armoured division into rebel-held districts. The Syrian government appears to have . stepped up its offensive against rebels across the country this week - . sending forces into several towns in northern Syria for the first time. Up to 144 people died in Syria on Monday, many of them in a single . incident at a checkpoint in Homs, the opposition said.

"By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 2:36 PM on 21st February 2012 . Gay marriage was the topic of table conversation when Prime Minister Julia Gillard, an opponent of  same sex-marriage, hosted a dinner for three gay couples at her official residence. An Australian activist group won a charity auction and the guests used the three-course meal in the national capital of Canberra to lobby the prime minister to allow gay marriage. Although Gillard’s Labor Party lifted its long-standing opposition to same-sex marriage in December, she remains against changing the law. Lobbying: Gay couples Elaine Crump, Sharon Dane, Louise Bucke, Sandy Miller with sons Dylan (left) and Matthew, John Dini and Steve Russell, pose for photographs in Canberra after winning a charity auction to have dinner with the Australian prime minster . Prime Minister Julia Gillard, is an opponent of same sex-marriage . The activist group GetUp! paid 31,000 . Australian dollars ($33,270, £21,024) for the dinner when they won a bidding war . against a Christian lobby group at the Press Gallery of Australia annual . charity ball in June last year. The 12-year-old son of one of the women, Matthew Miller, presented Gillard with flowers and two letters explaining why he and his brother Dylan, aged 9, would like their biological mother Sandy Miller, 40, to marry her partner Louise Bucke, 36. 'Since they’re not allowed to get married, they’re basically being called not normal and we’re not known as a proper family,' Matthew Miller said at a function at Parliament House before the dinner. Other guests are Brisbane academic Sharon Dane, 54, who married her wife Elaine Crump, 53, in Canada in a ceremony that is not recognised in Australia. Gay couple Steve Russell, 51, and John Dini, 29, decided against marrying overseas because it would carry no weight in Australia. Auction winners: The three-course dinner was held at Prime Minister Julia Gillard's official residence, The Lodge in Canberra . While they could have a civil union . recognized under state law in their hometown of Melbourne, they do not . view that as an equivalent to marriage. Last . week GetUp! in partnership with the Australian Marriage Equality, asked . followers to send roses to their favourite MPs to remind them to review . same-sex marriage. 'What . better way to remind our political representatives of where we stand on . Valentine’s Day than to spread some love, and show them that in matters . of the heart, we’re united for equality?' The . group sent the roses as a 'reminder that Australians believe that two . people who want to make a lifelong commitment deserve full and equal . recognition before their family, friends and the law.' At . Parliament House, 3000 roses arrived in Canberra and Prime Minister . Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abott received 500 each. Just a week after she backed the the Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Finance Minister Penny Wong, announced that her partner Sophie Allouache had given birth to a baby girl. Gillard’s . Labor Party in December lifted its long-standing opposition to gay . marriage, and three separate bills have been introduced to Parliament . that would change the law which states that only a man and woman can . marry. The decision to change the party platform to support same-sex marriage has been hailed as a victory by gay rights campaigners. 'Never doubt how persistent the campaign for equality is,' said Finance Minister Penny Wong, who is in a same-sex relationship. Campaigning: A hand-made placard is held up as gay rights demonstrators gather for a rally at the Convention Centre in Sydney, in December 2011 . Just a week after she backed the the . Labour Party's stance on gay marriage, Ms Wong announced that her partner Sophie Allouache had given birth to a baby girl. She said that she had text Gillard and the Prime Minister had offered her congratulations. But Gillard remains opposed to gay marriage, and it is unclear whether any bill would attract sufficient support to enable same-sex couples to marry. No date has been set for a vote in Parliament on gay marriage. Polls show that most Australians support gay marriage, but the conservative opposition coalition and many government lawmakers remain opposed. The issue of gay rights led to the resignation from the party of former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's sister. Miss Loree Rudd said she could not work for a party that endorsed homosexuals marrying. While her brother had introduced laws when he was Prime Minister so gay people were not discriminated against, she said that 'to make that huge leap from their rights to breaking a commandment of Moses, to say homosexuals' relations is marriage, is utter nonsense.'","Hosted a dinner for three gay couples at her official residence in Canberra .

Last updated at 10:13 AM on 2nd March 2012 . The convert widow of a 7/7 bomber who is being hunted by the CIA is thought to be on the run with a British terror suspect who goes by the name 'Osama', it has been revealed. Fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite - once a . fresh-faced school girl in Aylesbury - is believed to be travelling with a . variety of aliases after apparently escaping capture following a raid by anti-terrorist police on an Al Qaeda gang plotting a bomb plot on a packed shopping mall in the coastal town of Mombasa in Kenya. The gang is believed to be . planning more '7/7'-style attacks in Britain, and police are urgently . trying to track the 28-year-old, who is believed to have links to al-Qaeda as . well as extremists in the UK. She is thought to be on the run with . Habib Salah Ghani, a 26-year-old from Hounslow, west London, and could be carrying more than 500 bomb fuses and . bundles of U.S. dollars. Muslim convert Samantha Lewthwaite pictured with King's Cross bomber Jermaine Lindsay . Last night, there were reports the pair, believed to be in a relationship, could have fled to Tanzania, south of Kenya with her children, the Sun said. Police described Ghani, who calls himself 'Osama', as 'very dangerous'. In December his name was released along with 14 others believed to hold key information that could help unravel the notorious al Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab militia. The newspaper said police want to speak to him about his alleged links to the Mombasa bomb plot. Lewthwaite was in an arranged marriage with Jermaine Lindsay, the King's Cross bomber who blew himself up in the 2005 terror attack near Russell Square, which cost 26 people their lives. Raid in Mombasa: The suspect managed to escape this property in Mombasa just before anti-terrorist police swooped in to stop a suspected terror attack . The international man-hunt is . focusing on the woman who escaped from an extraordinary raid in . December. Missing: Samantha Lewthwaite during her school days. Her family in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, say they have not seen her for several years . She is carrying a passport in the name of Samantha Lewthwaite, . and police in both Kenya and Britain 'strongly suspect' she is the 7/7 . terrorist's widow, rather than another woman using Lewthwaite's details. Police say their suspect has used a passport with a photo bearing a . striking resemblance to the 28-year-old Muslim convert but with the name . of an unwitting South African-born nurse, Natalie Faye Webb, 26, from Essex. There are fears that up to 50 British . Islamic militants are receiving terrorist training in Kenya and . neighbouring Somalia, described by experts as a 'destination of choice' for would-be terrorists. Following the 7/7 bombings, . Lewthwaite described her husband's actions as 'abhorrent', and her family . are adamant she is not involved in terrorist activities. Her father Andy, 56, a builder and . former soldier, has begged his daughter to come home, saying 'Samantha . would not be involved in anything to do with terrorism. 'She was badly affected by what happened before and would have nothing to do with it. I am sure of that.' However the CIA, Scotland Yard and . anti-terror forces around the world are treating her capture as a huge . priority. Sources say she is 'no small fish' in terrorist circles, describing her role as a 'financier'. Kenyan authorities believe the pair fled after another Londoner Jermaine Grant, was . captured during the Mombasa raid on December 19, but Lewthwaite apparently fled with a laptop and the bomb parts. Her escape was described as so extraordinary, that police are holding an internal probe to see if she had 'inside' help. Urgent hunt: The false passport of 'Natalie Faye Webb' - thought to be terror widow Samantha Lewthwaite - who has allegedly escaped from Mombasa with bomb fuses . Kenyan police say the woman they are hunting fled the gang’s hideout . before they raided the house, where more than 60 rounds of . AK47 ammunition and other weapons were discovered. Grant, 29, of Newham, East . London, was arrested. He has been charged with possessing bomb-making . equipment and conspiring to cause an explosion and is due to go on trial . in May over what sources call a ‘serious’ terrorist plot. The dramatic disclosure came after a briefing from officials in Nairobi. Police spokesman Erick . Kiraithe said: ‘We know quite a bit about her now. She had three . identities in the past and that [Samantha Lewthwaite] is one possible . identity. Our expectation is that our counter-terror team should be able . to locate her soon.’ Horrific: This was the carnage left onboard a train between King's Cross and Russell Square tube stations in London after a bomb blast during the July 7 attacks . Police say they will not confirm the woman they are searching for is . Miss Lewthwaite until she is captured because it is possible her . identity could have been stolen. Yesterday Miss Lewthwaite’s family, . in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said they have not seen her ‘for years’ but believed she was in South Africa. Her uncle Nigel Lewthwaite, 51, said he understood she had married again, to another Muslim man. He said: ‘Her father only found out . that she’d had another child when she left this country. He just isn’t . in contact with her. I don’t know anybody in her family who is. ‘Her father thought she was in South . Africa, but we don’t know. We don’t even know when she left the country. Apparently she’s married another Muslim man and her father thought she . was in South Africa.' Location: Lewthwaite fled before the raid in Mombasa, and police are hunding for her in Nairobi, located 200 miles away, as well as across the border . Miss Lewthwaite converted to Islam at the age of 15 and married . unemployed carpet fitter Lindsay in 2002. Three years later, while she . was seven months pregnant with their second child, Jamaican-born Lindsay . detonated his rucksack bomb on a Piccadilly Line train, killing 26 of . the 52 who died in the July 7 bombings. She later issued the statement . saying the attacks were ‘abhorrent’. The Metropolitan Police has sent a team to the Kenyan capital to assist . in the hunt, which comes amid mounting concern over the number of . British extremists going to Kenya and Somalia, which officials now . regard as the ‘destination of choice’ for would-be terrorists. There are fears some militants could return to carry out attacks in the . UK after receiving training in Somalia from the Al Qaeda-linked al . Shabaab rebel group. Convert: Mother-of-three Samantha Lewthwaite . As a teenage Home Counties schoolgirl, Samantha Lewthwaite wore make-up and pretty dresses and went to parties with her friends. But by the time she was 17, the soldier’s daughter had converted to Islam, was covering her hair in a hijab, changed her name to Asmantara, and was readying herself to marry the man who would go on to take part in the 7/7 attacks. The youngest of three children, Miss Lewthwaite was born in Banbridge, County Down, in 1983 to Christine and soldier Andrew, who was serving in Northern Ireland. Her parents moved to Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, but separated when she was 11. Friends say she sought comfort in Islam after being badly affected by the split. After learning about the Muslim faith in religious studies lessons at school, the teenager told friends she was converting. Within two years, she was wearing the jilbab, the long gown that covers everything but the hands and face. While studying for a degree in religion and politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London she met Jamaican-born Jermaine Lindsay, a fellow Muslim convert, through an Islamic chatroom. In October 2002 they married in an Islamic ceremony in Aylesbury. In 2004 their first son was born, which is when she says her husband first started to spend time at radical mosques in London, Luton and Yorkshire. She has said she believes his mind was poisoned by these visits because before this he had been a ‘peaceful man’.","CIA joins man-hunt to stop 'British extremist' Samantha Lewthwaite .

The issue was raised in the Commons by Tory Robert Halfon who urged Mr Bercow to 'look again at the decision' taken by the House of Commons Commission. The charges would cost a family of four up to £60, he said and asked: 'Are there not other ways of saving money?' Mr Halfon suggested that copies of Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, could be published online rather than printed every day as one measure to cut costs. The Harlow MP called on Mr Bercow to review the charge 'to ensure that we are a parliament for the many, not for the few'. Discord: Speaker John Bercow (left) said the move was merely to cover costs, but Tory MP Robert Halfon (right) said it would create a parliament 'for the few' Mr Bercow said: 'It would be unthinkable to charge members of the public for access to the proceedings of the House or its committees, or indeed to meet their Members of Parliament.' But, he continued: 'The Clock Tower tours are special tours, allowing access to an area of the Palace which realistically cannot be open to all. 'The charges agreed by the House of Commons Commission are set at a level which will cover the costs - I emphasise, which will cover the costs - of providing these tours. No profit will be made.' Mr Bercow said it was open to Mr Halfon to take up the matter with the Finance and Services Committee. Mr Halfon said the proposed changes were a 'disgraceful action' by the Commons Commission. 'The UK taxpayer is already paying for the House of Commons and for Big Ben,' he said.","Speaker insists its only to cover costs .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Last updated at 1:54 PM on 1st March 2012 . Daniel Morgan, 37, was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, in 1987 with an axe embedded in his head . Theresa May could launch a judicial inquiry into the unsolved axe murder of a private investigator 25 years ago after claims that the News of the World ‘intimidated’ detectives overseeing the case. Five inquiries failed to find Daniel Morgan’s murderer after he was killed in a Sydenham pub car park in 1987 amid claims he was preparing to expose police corruption. He was found with an axe embedded in his head while his watch had been stolen but his wallet had been left with a large . sum of money still in his jacket pocket. For two decades the case has been surrounded by allegations that Mr Morgan planned to reveal a circle of corrupt police officers selling information to News of the World and other newspapers through a private detective agency run by Mr Morgan’s business partner Jonathan Rees. Police Minister Nick Herbert yesterday admitted a judicial inquiry was under ‘consideration’ during a parliamentary debate yesterday. The move follows claims made earlier this week during the Leveson inquiry that the tabloid newspaper collaborated with suspects - at the detective agency previously hired by News of the World - by placing a senior detective investigating the Morgan murder case under surveillance on the pretense that he was having an affair. Mr Morgan’s family - who have always believed he was killed because he was . about to expose a network of police corruption involving his business . partner Jonathan Rees, his friend the ex-Met police detective Sid Fillery . and a string of corrupt police officers - have been pushing for a judicial inquiry into the handling of investigations into the murder. Daniel Morgan, left, with his brother Alistair Morgan, right, was thought to have found evidence of police corruption before he was killed . Daniel Morgan's brother Alistair Morgan and his sister Jane McCarthy have been campaigning for justice since his murder in 1987 . And Labour MP Tom Watson yesterday . accused the newspaper of trying to undermine previous murder investigations . during an adjournment debate ahead of the 25th anniversary of Mr . Morgan’s death in . Sydenham, south London, on March 10, 1987. Mr Watson said News of the World . crime journalist Alex Marunchak was a close associate of Mr Morgan's business partner Mr Rees - who became a main suspect in his murder - and . regularly paid his company Southern Investigators for information. Crimewatch presenter Jacqui Hames told the Leveson inquiry News of the World had put her and her then husband under surveillance to intimidate them . He . told fellow MPs: ‘Jonathan Rees and Sid Fillery were at the corrupt . nexus of private investigators, police officers and journalists at the . News of the World. ‘Southern . Investigations was the hub of police and media contacts involving the . illegal theft and disclosure of information obtained through Rees and . Fillery’s corrupt contacts.’ And when Detective Chief Inspector Dave Cook started to investigate the murder, at a time when Mr Rees was still a suspect, it is alleged Mr Marunchak placed the police officer under . surveillance. Mr Rees was accused of Mr Morgan's murder in 2008 but the case collapsed in 2010. West Bromwich East MP . Mr Watson told the adjournment debate: ‘The person who was . investigating a murder was put under close surveillance by a close . business associate of the man he was investigating. ‘A journalist tried to undermine a murder investigation.’ This latest claim follows Detective . Cook's then wife Jacqui Hames telling the Leveson inquiry that the suspects in the . Morgan murder had encouraged the tabloid to watch them to ‘intimidate . them’. Ms Hames said she believed the News of the World had put them under . surveillance because ‘suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were . using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to . intimidate us and try to attempt to subvert the investigation’. In response to a request by the Metropolitan police to explain the surveillance, the paper’s then editor, Rebekah Brooks, said it was investigating suspicions Ms Hames and Mr Cook were having an affair. But Ms Hames told the inquiry into press standards that Mrs Brooks’s explanation was ‘absolutely pathetic’, given that it was common knowledge the couple had been married for several years and had two children. She said in a statement to the inquiry: 'These events left me distressed, anxious and needing counselling, and contributed to the breakdown of my marriage to David in 2010. 'Given the impact of these events, I would like to know why the police did not investigate why we came to be placed under surveillance by a newspaper like this. 'I think any reasonable person would find it difficult not to put them together and feel that in some way there was some collusion between people at the News of the World and the people who were suspected of committing the murder of Daniel Morgan.' And a judicial review could now be in the pipeline after the new revelations this week. Speaking at a Westminster Hall . adjournment debate yesterday, Mr Herbert said: ‘It is important to . consider what options are now available to identify and address the . issue of police corruption and to bring those responsible for Daniel’s . murder to justice. ‘The Morgan family have called for a judicial inquiry and this call has been endorsed by the Metropolitan Police Authority.’ He added: ‘We are considering very carefully if this is the right way forward. The Home Secretary and I haven’t ruled out ordering a judicial inquiry at this stage.’ Labour MP Tom Watson made allegations about Daniel Morgan's murder case during a parliament debate yesterday . Jacqui Hames accused the News of the World of putting her under surveillance while speaking at the Leveson Inquiry . Labour MP Tom Watson, who spearheaded the . campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the Sunday . tabloid, yesterday claimed the NoW may have paid police officers’ relatives . for information about the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and . Jessica Chapman. He claims the newspaper's crime reporter Alex Marunchak bought details about the investigation into the 2002 . killings and urged the Home Office to study . secret reports relating to the probe in Cambridgeshire. Mr . Watson said: ‘I believe the Metropolitan Police are sitting on an . intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact . overheard Marunchak claim he was paying the relatives of police officers . in Cambridgeshire for information about the Soham murders. ‘These are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated. ‘I . don’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate, but I do know . Alex Marunchak was involved in writing stories about how the Manchester . United shirts of those young girls were found.’The . MP called on News International boss Rupert Murdoch to apologise for . the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the . Soham killings . Mr Herbert said it was ‘a horrific murder, exacerbated by the failure to see those responsible held to account’. He . revealed that the Morgan murder is now being overseen by the assistant . commissioner Cressida Dick and the Met will be carrying out a full . forensic review of the case – similar to the one undertaken in the . Stephen Lawrence murder which led to the successful conviction of two . men earlier this year. Mr Watson, who spearheaded the campaign to expose the phone hacking scandal at the now-defunct Sunday tabloid, made other allegations about the News of the World yesterday. He also claimed during the debate that the newspaper may have paid police officers’ relatives for information about the murders of Soham schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. He cited claims Mr Marunchak bought details about the investigation into the 2002 killings which shocked the country - and urged the Home Office to study secret reports relating to the probe in Cambridgeshire. Mr Watson said: ‘I believe the Metropolitan Police are sitting on an intelligence report from late 2002 that claims a police contact overheard Marunchak claim he was paying the relatives of police officers in Cambridgeshire for information about the Soham murders. ‘These are allegations that as far as we know have not been investigated. ‘I don’t whether these intelligence reports are accurate, but I do know Alex Marunchak was involved in writing stories about how the Manchester United shirts of those young girls were found.’ Mr Watson also claimed to MPs details on one of the girls’ parents were found in files belonging to convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire, who was previously jailed for illegally listening to voicemails. The MP called on News International boss Rupert Murdoch to apologise for the conduct of staff at his paper during the investigations into the Soham killings and Mr Morgan’s murder, as the media tycoon previously apologised to murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s family. The revelation Milly’s phone was hacked by NoW journalists forced the paper’s closure last summer. Mr Watson said today: ‘I think Rupert Murdoch owes the Morgan family an apology. I also don’t think he has made his last apology to the grieving parents of dead children.’ Mr Marunchak has previously denied having any contact with Daniel Morgan and all allegations of wrongdoing. News International had no comment.

"By . Emma Reynolds . Last updated at 9:21 PM on 1st March 2012 . A Scotland Yard chief bought champagne for a News of the World journalist and lunch for colleagues during a £600 one-day spree on his force credit card. Andy Hayman, a former assistant commissioner in charge of counter-terror duties, said he took his 'top team' for a £566 meal at London restaurant Shepherd’s in February 2007. The alcohol bill for the meal alone came to £188.50. Champagne socialite: Ex-assistant commissioner Andy Hayman wined and dined journalists on regular occasions, the inquiry heard . Later that same day he spent £47 on champagne during a drink with a female journalist at the Oriel wine bar, in Chelsea. Both bills were paid for on his American Express company card, the Leveson Inquiry into press standards heard. Mr Hayman said the restaurant payment was paid for on his expenses as a colleague was joining another force. He said he could not remember which NotW journalist he was drinking with at Oriel. The police officer also had dinner at Soho House a year earlier with editor NotW editor Andy Coulson and deputy editor Neil Wallis. Giving evidence, Mr Hayman said he would rather be facing questions over phone-hacking than terror atrocities. He said: 'I feel terrible for the victims of phone-hacking and I would not minimise that. Close relationships: Mr Hayman said he could not recall the purpose of a lunch with NoW journalists, but that it would have been related to the 'ongoing support that paper was giving to anti-terror' 'But at the same time, I’d rather be . facing questions around that than I would be about more loss of life . which, 7/7, was awful.' The Met chief quit his job a month after an investigation into his expenses was launched. But he became a columnist for News International paper The Times after retiring from Scotland Yard, for which he was paid a £10,000 per year retainer. Robert Jay, QC, said: 'When asked about it, you stated that you recall that this was a Crime Reporters' Association representative, possibly from the News of the World. It could have been a female whose name you did not know.' He was asked whether this might have been Lucy Panton or Rebekah, who took over from Panton, but said he could not recall. Mr Jay suggested the champagne incident was evidence that the police had gone 'too far' with socialising. He was criticised by MPs last July for . having dinners with News International journalists while inquiries were . ongoing - with one Tory MP on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee . suggesting he would have appeared a 'dodgy geezer'. Mr Hayman then dismissed as rubbish the suggestion they were 'cosy candlelit dinners'. The police watchdog cleared him and fellow police chiefs of misconduct over his roles in the original phone hacking investigation.","Andy Hayman quit job when bosses launched expenses probe .

Britain is undermining the rights of gipsies and travellers to housing which is ‘culturally acceptable’ to them, Europe’s human rights watchdog has warned. Thomas Hammarberg, Commissioner for Human Rights at the Council of Europe, also said the eviction of travellers from the illegal Dale Farm camp last year was a violation of their rights, ‘highly regrettable’ and must never happen again. Mr Hammarberg’s comments emerged yesterday after it was revealed he wrote to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, stating: ‘The continuing shortage of adequate permanent and transit sites for gipsies and travellers living in caravans is a priority area to address.’ European Human Rights Commissioner Thomas Hammarberg, left, demanded that the Government ease the shortage of caravan sites for travellers in Britain as a 'priority' in a letter to Eric Pickles, right . He said providing such housing was a . ‘pre-condition for the enjoyment of other human rights, including the . rights to education and health’. The Council of Europe also runs the . European Court of Human Rights, which David Cameron is currently trying . to reform following its repeated interference in decisions made by . British courts and Parliament. The court’s attempts to overrule . democratic institutions in this country have provoked widespread demands . from Tory backbenchers for Britain to pull out of the Council of . Europe. Mr Hammarberg’s comments prompted . criticism from Priti Patel, Tory MP for Witham, in Essex. She said: . ‘This is another disgraceful example of Europe using the facade of human . rights to meddle in our domestic affairs and attack laws passed by our . Parliament. The Commissioner should show respect for the work the . Government is doing rather than attack it.’ Human rights: A hooded protester stands behind a burning barricade as riot police and bailiffs advance to evict the Dale Farm travellers' site last October . Phalanx: Police stand behind their shields in riot formation as they move in to clear the site . She added: ‘Europe’s unaccountable . bureaucrats know nothing about planning matters in this country and . after the problems at Dale Farm, they are out of touch with the British . people.’ The latest statistics show that the number of caravans on unauthorised sites increased from 728 to 2,395 between 2000 and 2010. Around 80 families illegally camped at Dale Farm in Basildon, Essex, were evicted last October after ten years of legal battles. The process cost taxpayers more than . £6million as travellers exploited every last legal avenue to try to . stave off the bailiffs. Panic: A woman turns to flee as she is faced by baton-wielding police officers . 'Ethnic cleansing': Supporters of the travellers hang banners from a barricade before the eviction . Despite the intervention of a United Nations . human rights expert, appeals by actress Vanessa Redgrave and attempts by . protest groups to block the evictions from Europe’s largest illegal . traveller site, they went ahead. However, within weeks, some of the . evicted travellers were back with their caravans, either on nearby . pitches legally occupied by travellers or in nearby lanes. Referring to the evictions, Mr . Hammarberg said: ‘The rights to adequate housing of travellers in . Basildon have already been violated once. The authorities should ensure . that no further violations take place and should work responsibly . towards a solution that is acceptable for all.’ The Swedish-born Commissioner for .

These three tiny brothers are believed to be the most premature triplets ever to have survived in Britain - after they were born 15 weeks early. Max, Harvey and Lucas Udell each weighed under 2lbs when they were born at 24 weeks and five days. They were delivered by emergency caesarean section and whisked straight into intensive care, where they underwent 12 blood transfusions between them. Tiny bundles of joy: Max (left), Lucas (right) and Harvey in matching blue cardigans. They spent three months in hospital . They survived against the odds and . have now come home from hospital with mother Rachael, 31, and father . Ashley, 29, for the very first time - three months after they were born. Mrs Udell, said: 'It feels like they are our babies now. Before, we did not feel like parents. 'We . could not have much contact because they were in boxes. We could not . touch them much because they needed rest and had the risk of infection. Three of a kind: Harvey (left), Max (right) and Lucas. The brothers received 12 blood transfusions between them during their time in intensive care . 'We were only able to bring them out now and again for skin-to-skin contact. It was so hard with tubes down their throats and so many wires coming out of them.' The couple, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, who have been married for two years, decided to start a family and were overjoyed after conceiving triplets naturally. But they had not even had a chance to buy nappies, clothes or toys when Mrs Udell went into labour. Despite . regular weekly scans she was unaware there were any problems with . identical twins Lucas and Max, and brother Harvey, until she began . having pelvic pains. Our little fighters: Ashley and Rachael Udell with Max (left), Harvey (right) and Lucas. The three brothers received 12 blood transfusions during their time in intensive care . Mr . Udell took her to the Royal United Hospital, in Bath, Somerset, on . November 19 but they sent her home later that day. However her pain continued and she was taken back to the hospital in the early hours of the next day.

Snug as a bug in a rug: Harvey, Lucas and Max make an adorable bundle at their home in Trowbridge, Wiltshire . Quite a handful: Max, Harvey and Lucas now weigh between 4lbs 4oz and 5lbs 8oz. Their mother Rachael said: 'People say they look so tiny, but to us they are massive' Mrs Udell, who works as a medical . secretary for Wiltshire Primary Care Trust, said: 'We were having scans . every two weeks and everything was fine. 'They were growing exactly how they should - until I had pelvic pains. 'I was rushed to hospital in Bristol and my waters broke. I just went into panic and I was really scared. 'I didn't think they would survive - I knew the chances of premature triplets dying was high anyway - it was awful.' Time to go home: Rachael and Ashley Udell face the daunting task of taking their three sons home to Trowbridge after three months in hospital in Bath . Mrs . Udell's waters broke at 5pm on November 20 and at 7.55pm Max was born . weighing 1lb 4oz, followed by Lucas one minute later weighing 1lb 6oz. Harvey was the last to be born at 7.59pm, also weighing 1lb 6oz. The babies, who had been due to arrive on March 6, were taken straight to neo-natal intensive care units in incubators. Mrs Udell said: 'It was dreadful. Instead of being excited about my babies I was terrified that they would not survive. 'I was in the maternity ward for three days then we went straight by their bedside. They were so small and I knew they were in a lot of danger.' The brothers received 12 blood transfusions between them during their time in intensive care and doctors also performed a life-saving operation on a tear in Max's stomach. As each of the babies became stronger, he was taken back to the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Harvey was first to leave on December 15, followed by Lucas five days later. Their parents had to travel between . the two hospitals over Christmas before Max joined his brothers in Bath . in the second week of January. Finally all three were able to come home for the first time last Saturday - each weighing between 4lbs 4oz and 5lbs 8oz. The triplets still require a high . level of care and round-the-clock attention, but the delighted new . parents are relieved to have their healthy family all together. Mrs Udell said: 'It is fantastic to have them home - we finally feel like a proper family. 'Things like complaining because they are crying feels so trivial now, it is just great that they have survived. Extraordinary survival: The triplets all weighed under 2lbs when they were born 15 weeks early and spent three months in hospital . 'All our friends helped out with buying clothes and toys for us too. The . people at the hospital say they cannot believe they have come home with . no drugs or breathing apparatus because they were so early and . triplets. 'It is hard even for one baby to survive as early as they were. Even now, they are still not even supposed to be born yet. 'Their eyes are still developing and they are having checks all the time.

The couple estimate they will get through 560 nappies a month as their three survivors grow. Mr Udell, a gardener for English Landscapes, said: 'It was a very scary and daunting experience.

"Senior Tory sources said it is 'possible' the PM may . have ridden Raisa . Mr Cameron, who went to Eton with Mrs Brooks' husband . Charlie, confirmed he had gone riding with him . The PM tells Channel Five he has not ridden the horse since he entered Downing Street in 2010 - but does not deny doing so during 2008 and 2009 . By . Tim Shipman . Last updated at 10:58 PM on 1st March 2012 . David Cameron ‘probably’ rode a retired police horse loaned to Rebekah Brooks, it emerged last night. The revelation sparked fresh questions about the Prime Minister’s closeness to the former News of the World editor and to the Murdoch media empire. Mr Cameron confirmed yesterday that he had gone riding with the journalist’s husband Charlie Brooks, who is a racehorse trainer. Revelations: The controversy surrounding a . decision to lend a Met Police horse to Rebekah Brooks may now involve . the PM after senior Tory sources admitted he could have ridden Raisa . Both are members of the so-called Chipping Norton Set, which includes Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson, and which met socially until the phone hacking scandal erupted. Mrs Brooks, who also edited The Sun, is on police bail after being quizzed by detectives last July over hacking and claims that her reporters paid police officers for stories. Mr Cameron insisted he had not ridden Raisa, the animal at the heart of the ‘Horsegate’ affair, in his time in power. But senior Tory sources said it was likely he had done so before he won the keys to Number 10. Mrs Brooks's sprawling Chipping Norton home in the Cotswolds is not far from David Cameron's. Outbuildings or what appear to be stables are pictured in the foreground . Two police horses on patrol in Manchester. The Met has 120 horses in its Mounted Section which are used for public order events including football matches and demonstrations . Raisa, who has since died, has become the symbol of dubious links between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International. The horse was loaned to Mrs Brooks between 2008 and 2010, the year Mr Cameron became PM. In an interview with Five News last night, the Prime Minister said: ‘It’s a matter of record that I have been riding with Rebekah Brooks’s husband, Charlie Brooks. ‘He is a friend of mine of 30 years standing and a neighbour in my constituency so that’s a matter of record, but since I have been Prime Minister I think I have been on a horse once and it wasn’t that one.’ A Tory source said: ‘We don’t know if he has been on Raisa. Charlie has a lot of horses. It’s possible, probable even, that he has been on that one.’ Most of the Met's police horses are retired with The Horse Trust charity in Speen, Buckinghamshire, pictured . Racing fan: Mrs Brooks, right, is pictured with Rupert Murdoch's son-in-law Matthew Freud, left, at the Cheltenham Festival . Another source close to Mr Cameron insisted the Prime Minister had no recollection of riding with Mrs Brooks. That claim was dismissed by former News of the World features writer Paul McMullan. He said: ‘Cameron went horse riding regularly with Rebekah. I know, because as well as door-stepping celebrities, I’ve also door-stepped my ex-boss by hiding in the bushes, waiting for her to come past with Cameron on a horse.’ Vanity Fair magazine claimed earlier this year that Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he signed his letters to her ‘love David’. Mr Cameron attended the couple’s wedding in 2009 and went to Eton with Mr Brooks. And the trainer is chair of the Heythrop hunt in Oxfordshire, which Mr Cameron has ridden with. Defence: Rupert Murdoch stood by former News International boss Brooks following the news she was loaned a horse . Confirmation of Mr Cameron’s use of Mr Brooks’s horses came after three days in which officials refused to discuss the Prime Minister’s relationship with the trainer and his wife. His official spokesman had tried to laugh off the affair on Wednesday, saying: ‘The only horses I am interested in are the type you can put a bet on. He has never been in a race in which I can back a horse.’ It is not clear whether Mr Cameron’s meetings with Mr Brooks were disclosed as part of No 10’s policy of openness about the Prime Minister’s contacts. Private and personal meetings are seldom listed. ‘Most of the Prime Minister’s meetings take place at rooms or at tables, and not on horseback,’ the spokesman joked. The saga has also led to tensions between Mrs Brooks and the Metropolitan Police, who accused her of returning Raisa ‘in a poor but not serious condition’. Mr Murdoch also defended his protégée this week, attacking Mrs Brooks’ critics on the social networking site Twitter. ‘Now they are complaining about R Brooks saving an old horse from the glue factory,’ he said. A No 10 source admitted Downing Street accepted ‘that everyone got far too close’ – an admission that Mr Cameron should have done more to insulate himself from the Murdoch empire. But a source close to the PM pointed out that Gordon Brown’s wife Sarah went as far as attending pyjama parties with Mrs Brooks.

Their times of death are currently unclear. Authorities are also probing any potential motive.

"By . Jason Groves . Last updated at 3:18 AM on 2nd March 2012 . A senior Labour MP has claimed expenses from the taxpayer for attending Remembrance Day services in his constituency. Adrian Bailey, who earns more than £80,000, claimed £13 to attend three separate services in his West Bromwich constituency in November last year. Mr Bailey, chairman of the powerful Commons business, innovation and skills committee, also claimed £3.15 to attend the launch of a local poppy appeal in Tipton the previous month. In the wrong? Adrian Bailey's (pictured in dark shades) claims on expenses for attending a remembrance service at West Bromwich Town Hall is in poor taste . The claims are permitted under Parliament’s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). But Mr Bailey’s decision to claim mileage expenses for attending events that many consider a civic duty is likely to raise eyebrows. Figures published yesterday reveal that he claimed £2.70 in mileage for a six-mile round trip to attend the remembrance service at West Bromwich town hall. He then claimed £4.95 for an 11-mile round trip to the service at Wednesbury British Legion. Finally, he claimed a further £5.40 for a 12-mile round trip to a service at Wood Green cemetery. Mr Bailey is a senior figure on Labour’s backbenches and is paid £14,500 on top of his MPs’ salary in recognition of his role as a select committee chairman. Excessive? Ed Balls claimed over £155 for a taxi fare into London last year . Despite his generous salary, the new figures suggest he is scrupulous about claiming his expenses, however small. On two occasions in November he claimed £2.25 for ‘tea and cake’, while on another he charged the taxpayer £3.35 for ‘cake, apple, coffee and two plums’. Mr Bailey was invited to comment last night but did not respond. The figures were included in the latest batch of expenses data from Ipsa. In the two months of October and November last year Ipsa processed £3.5 million in expenses claims from MPs. Notable claims include a £155.65 taxi fare submitted by the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls when he returned to London for the recall of Parliament following the riots in August last year. Aides last night Mr Balls was forced to get a taxi from Gatwick Airport to his north London home after catching a late flight home from a foreign holiday. Transport Secretary Justine Greening submitted two 10p claims for bus fares, although an aide stressed that the claims related to travel expenses for an intern working in her office. The aide pointed that Miss Greening did not claim for her own travel around her constituency in Putney, London. In total, MPs claimed for more than £92,000 in mileage during the two-month period. Critics argue that the ability of MPs to claim 40p a mile in mileage cushions them from the pain caused to ordinary motorists by soaring fuel prices. MPs also claimed £11,352, for taxis, despite a supposed ban in all but exceptional circumstances.","Adrian Bailey earns more than £80,000 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:25 AM on 29th February 2012 . Israel said it will not warn the U.S. if it decides to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iranian nuclear facilities, American intelligence has revealed. Officials said they would keep America in the dark so that the U.S. would not be held responsible for failing to stop the attack. The pronouncement, delivered in a series of private, top-level conversations, sets a tense tone ahead of meetings in the coming days at the White House and Capitol Hill. No warning: U.S. President Barack Obama (left) will not be told if Israel decides to launch a strike on Iran, Israel PM Benjamin Netanhyhu (right) has said . Decision: Israel has said it will not tell the U.S. in order to decrease the chance Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will blame America for the strike . The U.S. has been working with the Israelis for months to persuade them that an attack would be only a temporary setback to Iran's nuclear programme. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak delivered the message to a series of top-level U.S. visitors to the country. They included the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the White House national security adviser, the director of national intelligence, and top U.S. lawmakers. All were trying to close the trust gap between Israel and the U.S. over how to deal with Iran's nuclear ambitions. Netanyahu delivered the same message to all the Americans who have travelled to Israel for talks, the U.S. official said in an off-the-record briefing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and the Pentagon and Office of Director of National Intelligence declined to comment, as did the Israeli Embassy. Secretive: Iran says it is developing nuclear technology for fuel reasons, but a lack of transparency has led Western powers to be suspicious . Iran claims its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has raised alarm that its uranium enrichment programme might be a precursor to building nuclear weapons. The U.S. has said it does not know whether the Iranian government has decided to 'weaponise' its nuclear material and put it on a missile or other delivery device. The Iranian government has hailed the success of a homegrown film at Sunday's Academy Awards as a victory over Israel. 'A Separation' by director Asghar Farhadi won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Picture beating Israeli director Joseph Cedar's 'Footnote'. In a state TV broadcast Javad Shamaghdari, head of the state Cinematic Agency, hailed the win as the 'beginning of the collapse' of Israeli influence that 'beats the drum of war' in the U.S. and elsewhere. He later claimed the Oscar meant 'American judgment was bowed to the Iranian culture'. The film explores troubles in Iranian society through the story of a collapsing marriage. It tells the story of a couple heading for divorce and dealing with domestic troubles, including a young child and an aging parent. Iranian conservatives were upset with the themes of domestic turmoil, gender inequality and the desire by many Iranians to leave the country. In his acceptance speech Mr Farhadi said he hoped the Oscar would raise awareness of Iran's sizable artistic achievements and rich culture that has been 'hidden under the heavy dust of politics'. Surprisingly the film has been a huge hit in Israel, where tens of thousands of movie-goers have flocked to see it since it opened earlier this month. The secret warning is likely to worry U.S. officials and begin the high level meetings with Israel and the U.S. far apart on how to handle Iran. But the apparent decision to keep the U.S. in the dark also stems from Israel's frustration with the White House. After a visit by National Security Adviser Tom Donilon in particular, they became convinced the Americans would neither take military action, nor go along with unilateral action by Israel against Iran. The Israelis concluded they would have to conduct a strike unilaterally - a point they are likely to hammer home in a series of meetings over the next two weeks in Washington, the official said. Barak will meet with top administration and congressional officials during his visit.  Netanyahu arrives in Washington for meetings with President Barack Obama next week. The behind-the-scenes warning belies the publicly united front the two sides have attempted to craft with the shuttle diplomacy to each other's capitals. 'It's unprecedented outreach to Israel to make sure we are working together to develop the plan to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and to keep them from exporting terrorism,' said Maryland Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee. He travelled there with the intelligence committee chairman, Republican Mike Rogers, to meet Israel's prime minister and defence minister, along with other officials. 'We talked about the fact that sanctions are working and they are going to get a lot more aggressive,' Ruppersberger added. They also discussed talked about presenting a unified front to Iran, to counter the media reports that the two countries are at odds over how and when to attack. Programme: The nuclear enrichment facility in the central Iranian city of Natanz . He said: 'We have to learn from North Korea. All those (peace) talks and stalling and they developed a nuclear weapon. 'We are going to send a message, enough is enough, the stalling is over. ... All options are on the table.' Rogers told CNN yesterday: 'I got the sense that Israel is incredibly serious about a strike on their nuclear weapons programme. 'It's their calculus that the administration ... is not serious about a real military consequence to Iran moving forward. 'They believe they're going to have to make a decision on their own, given the current posture of the United States.' U.S. intelligence and special operations officials have tried to keep a dialogue going with Israel, despite the high-level impasse. They have shared with them options such as allowing Israel to use U.S. bases in the region from which to launch such a strike, as a way to make sure the Israelis give the Americans a heads-up, according to the U.S. official. Co-operation has improved on sharing of intelligence in the region, according to one current and one former U.S. official. Israel is providing key information on Syria for instance, now that the U.S. has closed its embassy and pulled out both its diplomats and intelligence officials stationed there, the U.S. official said.","Mean U.S. would not be held responsible, says Israel ."
"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 8:22 AM on 2nd December 2011 . Oops: Presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann said she wanted to shut the non-existent U.S Embassy in Iran, but later moved to say she was speaking hypothetically . Iran is proving a real thorn in the side of American politicians in recent days. But this time it's less to do with the provocative muscle-flexing of the Middle Eastern country's top brass and more to do with some rather embarrassing gaps in the foreign policy knowledge of their U.S. counterparts. First it was President Barack Obama who slipped up when he spoke out to denounce the attack on the 'English' Embassy in Tehran when it's actually British. Now one of the candidates looking to oust him from power next year, Michele Bachmann, has revealed her plans to close the U.S. Embassy in the Middle Eastern country despite America not having one there since 1980. Bachmann's own 'oops' moment came while applauding Britain's decision to pull its nationals out of its embassy after students stormed the building in protest earlier this week. According to reports, the GOP presidential candidate told a crowd in Waverly, Iowa, yesterday: 'That’s exactly what I would do [if I were  president]. We wouldn’t have an embassy in Iran. I wouldn’t allow that to be there.' The U.S. cut all diplomatic ties with the country during a crisis in which 52 Americans were held hostage for 444 days between November 4, 1979 and January 20, 1981. Her gaffe quickly did the rounds online. Matthew Smith tweeted: 'Michele Bachmann, who is on the House Intelligence Committee, says she will close our Iranian Embassy if elected. #WeDontHaveOne.' It wasn't long before her campaign went into damage-limitation mode by saying her comments were 'hypothetical'. Gaffe: President Barack Obama speaking in New York yesterday. The previous day he wrongly referred to the 'English' Embassy in Tehran. He then blundered again when calling it 'the embassy of the United Kingdom' when it is British . A statement said: 'She is fully aware that we do not have an embassy in Iran and have not had one since 1980. 'She . was agreeing with the actions taken by the British to secure their . embassy personnel and was speaking in the hypothetical, that if she was . President of the United States and if we had an embassy in Iran, she . would have taken the same actions as the British.' Ms Bachmann's comments follow a number of outspoken attacks on Iran in recent weeks - one time making the false claim that the Middle Eastern country had threatened to launch nuclear warheads at the U.S. and Israel. Ms Bachmann has previously boasted how she had not made a 'gaffe or something that I've done that has caused me to fall in the polls' and has been defiant in claiming that voters were more concerned about jobs and the economy than an occasional blunder by a candidate. Word play: Both Mr Obama and Ms Bachmann slipped up while denouncing the violence in Tehran when students stormed the British Embassy earlier this week . Those comments came after she once told a crowd in Spartanburg, South Carolina, that it was Elvis Presley's birthday when it was actually the anniversary of his death. And when she kicked off her presidential campaign in June in Waterloo, Iowa, she called it the home of American actor John Wayne when the town was actually home for a time to serial killer John Wayne Gacy. In opposing Mr Obama's foreign policy in October, she also said: 'He put us in Libya. He is now putting us in Africa. 'We already were stretched too thin, and he put our special operations forces in Africa.' Libya is, in fact, a country in Africa. She is not the only presidential hopeful to get her tongue tied, however.Earlier this month, Herman Cain was left squirming as he struggled with a question about his stance on Libya. Tongue-tied: Republican presidential hopefuls Herman Cain (left) and Rick Perry (right) have made their own high-profile gaffes during their campaign trails . He firstly had to clarify whether Mr Obama had actually supported the uprising before stumbling through an answer. It came just days after Rick Perry goofed in a Republican debate after being asked to name three departments he would cut. The federal departments that would be gone if he was president, Perry started on live TV were Commerce and Education - but then he couldn’t get the third. 'Commerce and, let’s see,' he said. 'I can’t. The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops.'","Presidential hopeful makes gaffe while outlining her policy on Middle Eastern country .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 11:50 PM on 2nd March 2012 . Free: Former-handyman Edward Lee Elmore was found guilty of killing a woman in 1982 but was released on Friday . Edward Lee Elmore glanced at the ceiling when a judge asked him if he was sure he wanted to plead guilty to the murder he has spent decades denying. He whispered to his lawyer, who had told him 'freedom is justice,' and then looked toward the heavens again. 'Yes sir,' he said quietly. With those words, he ended a 30-year stint in prison that saw 30 of his friends on death row die. Elmore was convicted three times of killing of Dorothy Edwards, with appeal courts overturning each verdict. Elmore lived nearby and did odd jobs for the 75-year-old widow, who was found in the closet of her Greenwood home in January 1982. She had been savagely beaten and stabbed more than 50 times, dying from a loss of blood and blows that caved in her chest, prosecutor Jerry Peace said. Prosecutors agreed his punishment should be the 11,000 days Elmore spent behind bars, much of it on death row. He got off death row in 2010 when his attorneys argued he was mentally disabled and had a low IQ. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled states can't execute the mentally disabled, and his punishment was reduced to life in prison. On Friday, prosecutors dropped rape and burglary charges, and an hour after the hearing, Elmore walked out of the Greenwood County courthouse a free man to the cheers of those brothers and sisters. 'What a great day,' Elmore said in the parking lot. Peace said he still thinks Elmore killed Edwards. He said Elmore confessed, telling investigators he may have blacked out as he attacked her. Small spots of the victim's blood were found on Elmore's jeans, Peace said, but he decided to make the deal for two reasons. Relief: Family members hugged Elmore after his hearing on Friday, when he was released in exchange for a plea deal in which he pleaded guilty and was released on time served . First, Edwards' sister asked him to end three decades of uncertainty and phone calls from reporters and other people she doesn't want to talk to. 'I want peace, I need peace. Can you get me peace?' the prosecutor recalled her saying. Second, even if he was convicted and sentenced to life again, Elmore would have been immediately eligible for a parole hearing, Peace said. And with a spotless prison record, his chances could good. 'He didn't even cuss a guard,' Peace said. Elmore's lawyers first asked the judge to throw out the charges. Defense lawyer Diana Holt has pointed out before that investigators found evidence at the crime scene that indicated Edwards fought for her life, but Elmore was uninjured when he was arrested hours later. A single blond hair was found on Edwards' body. Elmore has black hair, and none of that was found at the scene. In the courtroom was former New York Times reporter Raymond Bonner, who has followed the case for more than a decade and recently wrote a book about it. He said police were anxious to make an arrest to allay a community's fears that a rapist and murderer was among them and the little evidence that links Elmore to the crime was planted. Plea deal: Elmore, accompanied at the hearing by his lead counsel and previous counsel, whispered 'freedom is justice' as he agreed to plead guilty to murder even though he maintains his innocence . New evidence: Elmore walked out of the Greenwood County General Sessions courtroom a free man on Friday after a single blonde hair found on the victim was discovered at the scene . 'Don't dare call it justice,' he said after the hearing. 'A man served 30 years for a crime he did not commit.' Elmore's lawyer wanted to see him exonerated. But she told him he could be convicted again in a trial and talking an Alford plea, where he maintains his innocence but admits there is a lot of evidence against him, was the best thing he could do. 'Freedom is justice and that's why he is doing it today,' Holt said. Holt has done this before. In May 2002, she helped Sterling Spann get a similar deal after decades on South Carolina's death row. 'It's so bittersweet,' Holt said. 'But at least right now, the sweet outweighs the bitter.' Edwards smile rarely faded after his release. When Holt reminded reporters he saw at least 30 of his fellow inmates executed during his 28 years on death row, he dropped his head. 'Great guys in there, some of them,' he said. Overjoyed family: Elmore's sister helped get his release by asking the judge to end her misery and decades of uncertainty and phone calls . Author Raymond Bonner, left, was with Elmore at the hearing on Friday. Elmore holds a copy of the book Anatomy of Injustice, written by Bonner about his case . He also frowned when a reporter asked if he had anything to say to Edwards' family. Holt stepped in and said they would request the family's wishes to not talk about the case. 'It was 30 years for them too,' she said. Then the topic turned to lunch, and Elmore's family was taking him to a buffet restaurant where he would have dozens of dishes, many of them greasy and flavorful, to choose from. Elmore said prison was day after day of bland meals like liver or a chicken and gravy mixture. 'That stuff was roadkill,' Elmore said. Elmore's older sister Henrietta Grant smiled. She remembered one of her brother's chief complaints every time she would pile in a van with several of her siblings for the 150-mile trip to see him on death row. 'They ain't got no onions,' she recalled him saying. Grant was one of a half-dozen family members headed for the restaurant. Just before she left, she was asked her plans now that her brother was going to be back in Greenwood. She flashed a big smile. 'We're going to take him home and love him,' she said. 'And I do the cooking, so I am going to fatten him up.' Elmore stood in the parking lot and took a deep breath. This wasn't the way he thought this case should end, but for him, it was justice.

A British press relations firm made the ultimate faux pas by highlighting crass and offensive stereotypes about the U.S. South while trying to promote the state of Kentucky to English tourists. The company, hired by Kentucky’s Tourism commissioner to promote the state abroad, dedicated whole web pages to the good looks of the state’s residents and the thrill of playing ‘roadkill bingo’. This was a game where roadtrippers count the number of dead carcases on the side of the highway. Outrageous: The site, which has now been removed, encouraged visitors to play a game by counting points that they earn by spotting different animal carcasses . After telling of the scenic drives . through national parks, the website dedicated to the morbid game of . spotting the various roadkill seen in the state. ‘Some drives can drag a bit, even with the jingle jangle of the banjo on the bluegrass-playing radio stations, so it's good to spice them up with some fun car games,’ it read before being removed. ‘OK, it seems a bit sick, spotting dead animals, but you will never see so much roadkill in your life, and so varied. ‘Sadly, roadkill is a fact of life in Kenducky; the locals are used to it and as they say, When in Rome... So, if you can get over the sadness, and the blood, give it a whirl.’ The site went on to attribute points to the different animals one may spot - giving one point for a dead racoon, two for squirrels, three for rabbits, four for possums, five for coyotes, and six for deer. Scenic: The website highlights the prospect of roadkill alongside Kentucky's roads, such as this one cutting through the state's Cumberland Gap National Historic Park . Mistake: The PR firm urged British tourists to vist 'Hazzard County - home of Boss Hogg and the Duke boys' in Kentucky - although this was a fictional county in Georgia. Catherine Bach is pictured as Daisy Duke . The PR firm also urged British tourists to visit 'Hazzard County - inspirational home of Boss Hogg and the Duke boys' - although this was in fact a fictional place for The Dukes of Hazzard in Georgia. The site, published by British firm Gosh P.R., had been up since December and it was only this week that . the Kentucky Tourism Commissioner, Mike Cooper, resigned because of the . scandal. 'OK, it seems a bit sick, spotting dead animals, but you will never see so much roadkill in your life, and so varied' Kentucky tourism website . The day before . his resignation, a local newspaper said that Gosh P.R. paid for $735 of . meals and event tickets for Mr Cooper on trip he took to London in June . of last year which is a violation of state ethics laws. The company had been given $647,769 by the . state of Kentucky since they were given the contract to promote the . state in 2008. That came to a quick halt when the website - which cost . $20,000 annually - was taken down on Tuesday and the $179,900-a-year contract disbanded . on Wednesday. Ladies and liquor: The Gosh P.R. site also boasted about the lovely ladies of Kentucky and famous celebs who call the state their home . ‘Gosh P.R. has performed excellently for us in the past,’ Mr Cooper said in a statement. ‘However, in the case of the website, . they made serious errors. It was my responsibility to catch those . errors. I did not and believe at this time that the best course of . action is for me to resign.’ Resigned: Kentucky tourism commissioner Mike Cooper resigned after a website he was in charge of promoted crass stereotypes of the state . Over the course of their professional relationship, Mr Cooper made one logistical correction to the website, and even commended them for their tongue-in-cheek manner. ‘I really like the site, especially the edginess of it. I wish we could get away with that over here!’ he wrote in a 2010 email to Gosh P.R. Clearly, that ‘edginess’ is not accepted in Kentucky, and the state’s Republican leader spoke out about the great expense that the ordeal cost them. ‘The fact that the state of Kentucky has spent close to $700,000 with a company that wants to bill us as the Roadkill Grill is just a ridiculous example of how we waste taxpayer dollars in Frankfort,’ said Steve Robertson, chairman of the state’s GOP group. Drusilla Bryan, managing director of Gosh P.R., has now apologised to Kentucky and said the firm 'fully appreciates that this article may have caused offence' 'We love the state of Kentucky,' she told the Lexington Herald-Leader.

Campaigning mothers are calling for a boycott of children's toy chain Toys 'R' Us for selling a comic in which an openly gay character gets married. Conservative 'family values' group One Million Moms wants to bring down the firm for carrying the latest issue of the controversial Archie comic - where Kevin Keller walks down the aisle. It comes weeks after the division of the American Family Association targeted retailer JC Penney for appointing gay talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as its spokeswoman. Controversial: One Million Moms wants to boycott Toys 'R' Us because it sold this issue of Life with Archie where its openly gay character Kevin Keller gets married to a man . OMM said on its website: 'These comic books are sold at the front checkout counters so they are highly visible to employees, managers, customers and children. 'Unfortunately, children are now being exposed to same-sex marriage in a toy store. 'This is the last place a parent would expect to be confronted with questions from their children on topics that are too complicated for them to understand. 'Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, which is becoming extremely common and unnecessary.' Protest: One Million Moms wants a boycott of Toys 'R' Us stores because it sold a comic where a gay man gets married . 'The trip to the toy store turns into a premature discussion on sexual orientation and is completely uncalled for. Toys 'R' Us should be more responsible in the products they carry.' The series of Archie comics trace the adventures of teenagers Archie, Betty and Veronica in the small town of Riverdale. It has been running for 70 years, is one of America's most popular comic series, and regularly sells out. Loved up: Ellen Degeneres (right), pictured with wife Portia de Rossi (left) Toys 'R' Us has not commented on the threat, but Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater defended his product. He told the Huffington Post: 'As I've said before, Riverdale is a safe, welcoming place that does not judge anyone. It's an idealised version of America that will hopefully become reality someday. 'We're sorry the American Family Association/OneMillionMoms.com feels so negatively about our product. But they have every right to their opinion, just like we have the right to stand by ours. 'Kevin Keller will forever be a part of Riverdale, and he will live a happy, long life free of prejudice, hate and narrow-minded people.' The protest comes hot on the heels of OMM's threat to Texas-based retail chain JCPenney. They told its supporters to petition against Ellen being named the new spokesmodel for the chain store and demand that she be replaced by someone not openly gay. It said, at the start of February: 'Funny that JC Penney thinks hiring an open homosexual spokesperson will help their business when most of their customers are traditional families. 'Degeneres is not a true representation of the type of families that shop at their store. The majority of JC Penney shoppers will be offended and choose to no longer shop there.'","One Million Moms protest against sale of comic .

The weekly 90-minute sessions have been running for five years for children aged 18 months and under and no toddler has ever been injured in that time. But last week Warwickshire County Council introduced the ban after it ruled hot drinks were a hazard to toddlers. Parents have now branded the ban 'health and safety madness'.

Controversial: Biscuits at the weekly event at Stratford Children's Centre have also been replaced by healthy snacks including fruit and bread sticks . 'They were served in what I regard as a ""no spill plastic safety cup"" with a lid. 'There were almost like flasks, with a very small opening. Everyone is just a bit disappointed.

'Does this mean I shouldn’t be drinking a cup of coffee in the comfort of my home? 'To me the ban is yet another example of health and safety madness.' Children’s centres across Warwickshire can now only serve hot drinks if they are in a separate area from the toddlers. Mum-of-two Sue Turner, 30, said: 'What the council are saying is if a parent wants a cuppa they must turn their back on their child and walk across to another area of the children’s centre to make it and drink it. 'Surely it is more dangerous to leave your child unattended than it is to have a cup of tea on a table next to you while you watch them.' Vicky Kersey, children’s centre officer at the council, defended the ban. She said: 'To minimise any risk of scalding a child we have introduced a hot drinks policy at all of the county’s children’s centres. 'Hot drinks can now only be served at children and baby sessions if the layout of the centre provides a separate area to consume hot drinks away from children playing.' Caroline Loveridge, spokeswoman for the Stratford Children’s Centre added: . 'All families using the centre were informed about this change of arrangements and we invited their feedback. 'The majority of responses we have received have been positive and supportive as parents understand we want to minimise the chance of any harm being caused to their child.'","Mothers forced to change 'Coffee and Play' sessions to 'Baby Play'

"Bolton star Chris Eagles already has seven points on his licence . Last year he was caught driving without insurance . By . David Gerges . Last updated at 7:50 PM on 29th February 2012 . A Premier League footballer is facing a driving ban after he was caught speeding and using his mobile while driving his Bentley. Bolton Wanderers midfielder Chris Eagles, was clocked travelling at 60mph in a 40mph zone on Princess Parkway in Manchester by a police officer with a hand-held video camera. The former Manchester United starlet has already racked up seven points on his licence, and last year he was caught driving without insurance. Eagle eyed: The Bolton Wanderers star was caught doing 60mph in a 40mph zone . Eagles pleaded guilty via his solicitor Rachael Walsh to both offences at Manchester magistrates’ court. Speaking in court, prosecutor Ben Collinson said: 'There are two . offences. A speeding on the northbound section of Princess Parkway on . June 9 where the defendant was travelling at 60mph in a 40mph area at . 1.20pm. He was also seen to be using his mobile phone.' The offences could see Eagles handed an additional five points that would result in a six-month ban. Recurring offender: Last year Eagles was caught driving without insurance . Miss Walsh said her client had temporarily borrowed the car from his sick sister. She added: 'He has a sister who suffers . from a life-threatening illness and the call was from her so he took it . fearing for her well-being. The car had a Bluetooth (hands-free) system . but this was not working.' Miss Walsh urged magistrates to impose . four points upon Eagles licence, saying he travelled 20,000 miles every . year, carried out charity work and spent time caring for his younger . siblings and nephew who live near London.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:56 AM on 3rd March 2012 . A great grandfather has made a claim as Britain's longest-serving church chorister, after singing in the same choir for 83 years. Richard Henry, 90, joined the St Mary’s Roman Catholic Church Male Voice Choir in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, as a boy soprano at the age of just seven in 1928. When his voice broke he developed a fine tenor voice and has spent the last eight decades performing a variety of music including church pieces, classical masterpieces and his favourite Gilbert and Sullivan numbers. Long-serving: Mr Henry, who joined the choir aged seven, pictured with members of the Saint ary's Male Voice Choir on the 80th anniversary of his membership in 2009 . Early days: The Saint Mary's Male Voice Choir in 1948, with Mr Henry pictured in the middle row, third from the left . Now as the 99-year old choir celebrates its centenary year, colleagues have hailed Mr Henry as 'the father of the choir'. Former engineer Richard, a widower, said: 'When I was at school, the choirmaster back then was the music teacher. I was pressed to join and I’ve been in it ever since. 'Some people think it’s wonderful but it is just something I have always enjoyed doing. 'I never think about how long it has been because it’s something I have always been used to doing - although I can’t sing like I used to. They are putting up with me now. 'The members of the choir have become my friends and we always socialise together. My family of two daughters, five grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren all come to listen to me sing, which is nice.' 'We find it difficult to recruit young men so it’s good to see this renewed interest in choirs. Hopefully that will help.' Striking up a tune: Mr Henry, pictured here on the far left of the front row, is known as the 'father of the choice' for the length of his service . One of the boys: Richard Henry in the Saint Mary's Male Voice Choir in 1974. The group are celebrating their 100th anniversary this year . The choir was formed in 1912 after the priest at the time felt it would it would be in keeping with the wish of Pope Pius X to reintroduce Latin plain chant into the liturgy. Richard followed his Uncle Tom into the line up and sung alongside his brothers John and Tom. Richard and his brothers formed The Henry Brothers singing group and were featured on Opportunity Knocks with Hughie Green in the 1960s. Richard was also a founder member of St Mary’s Operatic Society. He was married to his late wife Gertrude for 62 years and has two daughters, five grandchildren, 13 great grandchildren and even one great, great grandchild. His favourite song to sing is So Deep Is The Night, which uses the melody from Fridiric Chopin’s Tristesse. Starting out: The Saint Mary's Male Voice Choir pictured in 1928. Richard Henry is not pictured here as he joined the choir the year after . Evergreen: The Saint Mary's Concert Choir performing at a local pub in 1994 . He also lists the Latin masses, operatic numbers and hits from musicals by Gilbert and Sullivan as his favourite pieces of music . Les Rushton, 71, the current deputy choirmaster said: 'We call Richard the father of the choir. 'He is loved by all the other members, many of whom have also been in the choir for 60 or 70 years. We threw the party for Richard because he has been so dedicated. 'It is a great example of commitment and devotion to the choir which he’s always held in great esteem. It’s a major part of his life. 'Richard is a shining example to anybody who likes choral singing. He is the epitome of what a dedicated chorister should be in this country. 'We believe we are the only Catholic male voice church choir in existence, because most churches of Christian religions have choirs but they are usually mixed . The combined age of all existing 23 members of the choir totals around 930, of which Richard is the oldest and the youngest is 18.","Richard Henry joined Saint Mary's Male Voice Choir aged just seven .

If you venture into New York, Washington D.C. or Los Angeles you’ll find that house prices are a full 50 per cent above the levels they were 12 years ago - but that’s far from representative of the U.S. The Housing Misery Index, which looks at changes in home prices from their peak and proportions of houses with seriously-troubled mortgages or foreclosure, is showing where the market is at its worst. Nevada has the worst misery by some distance - in front of Florida, Arizona and California, which are well above Michigan in fifth. It’s no surprise some experts fear that the U.S. is already in a ‘triple dip’. Map: The Housing Misery Index, which looks at changes in home prices from their peak and proportions of houses with seriously-troubled mortgages or foreclosed, is showing where the market is at its worst . ‘Big price drops lead to more underwater borrowers and less household wealth, which hurt the housing market and hold back economic recovery,’ said analyst Jed Kolko, who created the index. ‘Second, defaults and foreclosures damage consumer confidence in the housing recovery - and foreclosures cause pain not only for people who lose their homes but also for their neighbours.’ Mr Kolko, chief economist for real estate firm Trulia, added that he only expects the housing crisis to be a major issue on the presidential campaign trail in the states where the index is at its worst. Republican candidates went to Florida in January and Nevada and Arizona in February, but there is a long gap until California in June - which may cause their debating on housing to die down for now. Struggling: The index comes as it was revealed earlier this week that U.S. home prices fell for the fourth straight month in December, closing the year at a new low and erasing gains seen in the summer . Despair: Mary Trody stands in front of her home in Miami, foreclosed after what she said was predatory lending . Idaho and Georgia have the worst housing misery index figures for states voting on Super Tuesday next week - and of those voting in April the worst measure is in Rhode Island and Maryland, he said. The index comes as it was revealed earlier this week that U.S. home prices fell for the fourth straight month in December, closing the year at a new low and erasing gains seen in the summer. The S&P Case-Shiller home price index fell 1.1 per cent in December across the 20 major U.S. cities surveyed, a 4 per cent decline from a year earlier. Only Miami and Phoenix saw gains in December. In the Portland area, the index showed a decline of 0.4 per cent, leaving prices 4 per cent lower than the same month in 2010. Prices are lower than a year earlier in all of the cities except Detroit. Wednesday's news deflated hopes for a robust recovery in prices, but brokers and observers said it belies strong sales activity and doesn't necessarily mean the bottom is falling out again.

"Sunday set to usher in cold spell as weather is drawn in from the wintery east . By . Tom Gardner . Last updated at 9:34 AM on 3rd March 2012 . Wild flowers burst into vivid colour as Spring arrived in its full glory across much of the UK. The unusually balmy temperatures also brought sun worshipers flocking to the UK's beaches and parks to make the most of the mini heatwave. And as March brings yet more sunshine and clear sky, data collected by the Met Office looks set to put February as one of the driest on record. Spring has sprung: The clear warm sunshine helped bring out a stunning floral show of crocuses in Sheffield Botanical Gardens today as the early spring weather continues across the UK . Inspiring: Daffodils bloom in front of 14th century St Oswald's Parish Church in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. Its 212 ft spire was referred to by George Eliot as the 'finest single spire in England' Season of mist: Dawn breaks over St Oswald's Parish Church as the rising sun heralds the beginning of March . But forecasters have delivered bad news for . anyone hoping our extraordinary run of unseasonable warmth is set to last. It . looks like the Britain will return to more average weather over the weekend.The sunshine will be replaced by the more usual colder, wetter conditions drawn in from the chilly east. Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: 'This month's weather has really been a tale of two halves. 'Statistically, the UK has seen a remarkably average overall month. 'That's more due to the fact we had a . very cold first half, followed by an unseasonably warm period. The two . extremes balanced each other out. 'During . the first half of February, the weather was dominated by a high . pressure system sitting over the country. This drew in cold, dry weather . from northern Europe. 'The second half was very mild. Most . of the weather was drawn in from the south west, bringing with it warm . and damp conditions. But most of the rain fell on high ground and in more northern areas, which has left large parts of the country very dry.' Joys of spring: Three-year-old Beatrice Ryan plays among the blooming crocuses in Waterlow Park in North London . People were out enjoying the crocus fields and the hot weather at Savill Gardens in Ascot today . Daffodils in full bloom at St.James's Park as Londoners enjoy spring temperatures in the capital . Spring lambs in Bocketts Farm, Leatherhead, Surrey, enjoy the warm weather gamboling among the Daffodils on on St David's Day . TODAY: . Dry for most, with cloudy periods and some sunny spells. However, far . western parts will remain cloudier with occasional drizzle, whilst parts . of Northern Ireland and Scotland should see occasional rain, easing . later. Remaining generally mild, with light winds. OVERNIGHT: . Mainly dry, with clear spells perhaps leading to a slight rural grass . frost. Northern and far western parts will remain rather cloudy, with . occasional light rain and drizzle. Friday: . FRIDAY: . Morning rain in Scotland will clear to brighter conditions later. Elsewhere it should stay dry with some sunny spells, although southern . parts will become increasingly cloudy. Breezy in western areas. SATURDAY TO MONDAY: . Wet and windy conditions will move eastwards over the weekend, . gradually introducing colder, more unsettled weather, with some wintry . showers and frosts returning. He . added: 'But It looks like March will be back to what we'd expect for this . time of year - cooler temperatures, changeable conditions with rainy . spells across the entire country. Much more like what we'd expect for the UK in March.' But the freak weather fluctuations have had a devastating affect on some parts of the country. Not a single daffodil has bloomed for . Britain's biggest Daffodil Festival after the big freeze killed off more . than £1 million worth of the flowers across the country. More . than 10,000 people from all over the UK visit the tiny village of . Thriplow in Cambridgeshire each year to admire its hosts of golden . daffodils. But this year . there are no brilliant yellow blooms after a winter of topsy-turvy . weather, which saw temperatures dip as low as minus 12C. Disappointed visitors, who come by the coach load from across the country, will be greeted by green stems instead of glorious swathes of daffodils. ""The village is normally full of blooming daffodils by St David's Day and the lanes are bright yellow,"" said David Egleton, 65, from Thriplow. ""But this year the stems are not very high and none have flowered. It's a real shame."" The village of Thriplow, eight miles south of Cambridge, started its famous Daffodil Weekend in April 1969 to raise money to repair its church, St George's. A number of parishioners opened their gardens to the public and the first event attracted more than 1,500 visitors . In 1976 the villagers planted a massive three tons of daffodil bulbs along the lanes in Thriplow and the incredible sea of yellow began attracting thousands of people. The tradition has since continued every year except for 2001 because of the foot and mouth outbreak. A bee goes about its business as the sun shines on Waterlow Park in London . Bocketts Farm in Surrey was bathed in sunshine as the newborn lambs played among the daffodils . It was even held in 1994 when the . daffodils were buried in an inch of snow. But this year millions of . daffodils across the UK have been killed off after they bloomed too . early in January because of mild temperatures, then died in February's . cold snap. With frosts . forecast again for next week there is a worry the world-famous festival . could still be flower-free on March 17 and 18. ""There . are some in bud ready to go, so we’re keeping our fingers crossed the . weather stays warm over the next few days. It's always a tense time."" said Dan Murton, a member of the village's daffodil committee. Daffodils, . which come in 2,500 varieties, stop growing when temperatures are below . 6C. The UK produces half the world's daffodil bulbs, exporting 10,000 . tons a year. Lincolnshire and Cornwall are England's main daffodil . growing areas. In . Cornwall the season can sometimes start in early January, while growers . in Lincolnshire usually start to pick their flowers at the beginning of . February. It is hoped that . the recent lack of rainfall does not spell disaster for other plant . growers around the UK. Preliminary data collected by the Met Office . shows the past month was with the top 15 driest since records began. All of the UK experienced well below . average rainfall. Just 62 per cent of the usual precipitation fell . compared with normal levels. A squirrel pauses for a moment in St James' Park in London today as temperatures reached 14 degrees in the capital . That was only 53.4mm of the 86.8mm rain . expected. But regionally there were even more pronounced dry spots with southern and eastern . England seeing just a third of usual levels. Rainfall was nearer normal across north-west England and Northern Ireland, . and above normal across parts of western Scotland. Even . the snowy and freezing weather from the first half of February did not . bring with it much water - despite huge dumps of snow. The lowest temperature reported was a bone-chilling minus 15.6C on February 11, at Holbeach, Lincolnshire. But . from mid February the freezing cold started to loosen its grip as . westerly conditions, with an air-stream originating from further south . in the Atlantic drew in warm air. Last . Thursday was exceptionally mild - with 18.7C at Coleshill, in . Warwickshire, making this the warmest February day since 1998. Durham experienced a record-breaking warm day of 17.4C on Tuesday - the highest temperature since data was collected in 1880. The month's temperatures overall have been near average for the UK - but with a . pronounced north-west and south-east divide. February has been a . sunny month in the south-east, but dull in the north-west and notably . Northern Ireland. The UK got 96 per cent of overall average expected for this time of year, with East Anglia the brightest region and western Scotland, Northern Ireland, the dullest, with less than 50 per cent.

Grieving Kelly Jones, 26, went into labour at the graveside of her fiancé killed in a car crash just days earlier. Miss Jones was eight months pregnant when her childhood sweetheart Ricky Norman, 27, died in the country road accident. Tragic: Grieving Kelly Jones went into labour at the graveside of her fiance killed in a car crash just days earlier. She is pictured here with baby Ava . She was determined to go to his funeral - but her midwife insisted on being at her side. Miss Jones managed to get through the service but strong labour pains began as she knelt to lay roses on Mr Norman's grave. She was rushed to hospital from the cemetery - and gave birth to baby Ava five hours later. Miss Jones said: 'It was a tragic day - we said goodbye to Ricky on the same day that Ava said hello to the world. 'Giving birth should have been one of the happiest days of our lives together and Ricky would have been at my side. 'My family and friends are saying Ava is Ricky's parting gift to me and that's the way I will always think of her.' One in a million: Ricky Norman was on his way to work when his car was in a head-on crash with a lorry on an icy mountain road . Mr Norman, a railway maintenance engineer, was on his way to work when his car was in a head-on crash with a lorry on an icy mountain road. He had chosen his unborn baby girl's name just the day before - Ava Rikki Leigh Norman-Jones. Miss Jones said: 'When I heard the news I was crying all day - it didn't feel real to me. 'I felt like I was dreaming and all I wanted to do was wake up from a nightmare. 'If it wasn't for me expecting Ava, I don't think I would have been able to cope.' Healthy Ava arrived three weeks early at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, just a mile from the cemetery where her father was buried that day. Holding baby Ava close, Miss Jones said: 'It's as if it was meant to be, as if he wanted to see her there that day. 'Ricky would have loved Ava so much. I can't believe he is gone. 'He was a one-in-a-million, everything a woman would want in a man. He was kind, caring and changed my life forever.' The family will now never forget February 22 - the day Mr Norman was buried and his daughter was born. Miss Jones, of Merthyr Tydfil, said: 'I don't know how I will feel on her birthday - part of me will be celebrating for Ava, but part of me will be grieving for Ricky.' The couple have another son, one-year-old Jackson, and were planning to marry next year. Mr Norman's mother Sylvia Norman, 47, also told how her world has been 'turned upside down' following the loss of her son. She said: 'I cannot explain it myself. I had just laid my son to rest and hours later his daughter was born. 'It will never be the same without our son. We loved him dearly, he was our life. 'The children are the only thing keeping me going. We've got to be there for Ava. That's what Ricky would've wanted. 'He knew how hard it was going to be for us. That's why Ava was born on that day. It was his present to us.' Police are still investigating the crash in which Mr Norman and work colleague Robert McGovern, 35, were killed at Storey Arms in the Brecon Beacons.","Kelly Jones, 26, went into labour as she knelt to lay flowers at the grave of Ricky Norman, 27 .

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 6:05 PM on 2nd March 2012 . Tiny: Ms Greening made the claims for an intern working for her last summer . Transport Secretary Justine Greening has made two expenses claims for 10 pence on bus fares. The Conservative MP for Putney claimed for the miniscule amounts of behalf of an intern who was working for her last summer while she was Economic Secretary to the Treasury. The minister put in for the claims which were charged to an Oyster card on two mile-long journeys between Tooting and Balham, south London. A spokesperson for the MP stressed that Ms Greening did not claim for travel expenses herself. The spokesperson added that Ms Greening, who became Transport Secretary four months ago, always cover expenses for her interns. A standard bus fare using an Oyster card currently costs £1.35, but would have cost £1.30 last summer when the claim was made. Ms Greening spokesperson said the intern in question had a daily spending limit on their Oyster card, which is where the two 10p discrepancies came from. The spokesperson added that Ms Greening was 'following Parliamentary guidelines' in reimbursing the intern's travel expenses, which they are entitled to claim. Ms Greening's claim was revealed as the latest round of expenses claims were made public. It total, the Transport Secretary claimed £76.20 on bus and Tube fares for the intern between last July and September. In October and November, £3.5m of claims on office costs, travel and rent were processed. When the expenses scandal erupted in 2009, some truly penny-pinching claims were revealed. Here are some of the best: . 1p - Jeremy Hunt's phone bill for a 12-second mobile call . 25p - A carrier bag for Labour's Anne Snelgrove . 38p - Crunch Corner yoghurt from Asda for the wealthiest MP, millionaire Shaun Woodward . 39p - Bob Blizzard bought a single paperclip . 61p - Dominic Grieve claimed for 'cheese things' 67p - Ginger crinkle biscuits for Austin Mitchell . 79p - Superglue for Keith Vaz . 82p - A flapjack claimed by Garry Streeter . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, Ms . Greening's predecessor, claimed £103.20 for new business cards and . another £72 for headed paper. Mr Hammond was also criticised in 2009 when it . emerged during the MPs’ expenses row that he claimed just £8 short of . the maximum allowance for a second home in London from 2007 to 2008 even . though he lived in the commuter belt town of Woking. The latest round of expenses revealed a typically bizarre selection of items which ministers charged to the taxpayer. They include senior Labour MP Adrian . Bailey's £13 claim for attending three Remembrance Day services in West . Bromwich, as well as twice claiming £2.25 for 'tea and cake'. The £80,000 a year minister also charged the taxpayer £3.35 for ‘cake, apple, coffee and two plums’ last November. The Transport Secretary made the two 10 pence claims for two journeys from Tooting to Balham, south London (file picture) The claims are permitted under Parliament’s supposedly tough new expenses rules and were approved by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa). However, the Ipsa could not explain the discrepancy in Ms Greening's two 10 claims. When the expenses scandal was unearthed in 2009, the cheapest claims ranged from 1p phone calls to carrier bags, paperclips, and even a 38p Crunch Corner yoghurt claimed by millionaire MP Shaun Woodward.",Miss Greening claimed for two journeys across south London on behalf of an intern who worked for her last summer when she was in a junior ministerial position .
"Hock’s lawyer warned she has opened 'herself up to defamation and libel' By . Jill Reilly . Last updated at 1:31 PM on 22nd February 2012 . Swimwear model Jessica Hart has accused nightclub owner Adam Hock of starting a fight with her boyfriend and Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco . Swimwear model Jessica Hart has accused nightclub owner Adam Hock of starting a fight with her boyfriend and Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco. Adam Hock, has been accused of leaving the 24-year-old prince with a broken jaw and needing hospital treatment after he punched him at Double Seven, a Meatpacking District bar. But he has since insisted the prince and his friends, including Hart's boyfriend Stavros Niarchos began the brawl and that he 'acted 100% in self-defence.' But Sports Illustrated model, Hart, 25,whose boyfriend is heir to a Greek shipping fortune took to her Twitter page to rubbish his claims. 'Ha!' Hart tweeted. 'It’s going to be so pleasurable when the truth does come out and he’s exposed as the freaky liar he is.' Hart made clear she thought his accusations of being an innocent party were rubbish . 'Although, . I have to say, I am getting a little pleasure watching him run to the . press, squirming and lying in desperation,' Hart tweeted. Mr Hock’s lawyer Sal Strazzullo was not amused and told New York Daily News he may take the Australian model to court: . 'I . expect her to come in and tell the truth and then, if she’s going to . resort to name calling like calling my client a liar, she will open . herself up to defamation and libel.' Other side of the the story: Hart accused Adam Hock,left, seen with a sling on his arm after the brawl of starting the fight with Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco, right, at the New York nightclub . Accusations: Sports Illustrated model, Hart, 25, whose boyfriend is heir to a Greek shipping fortune took to her Twitter page to rubbish Adam Hock's claims . Witness: Hart, was in the nightclub with her boyfriend Stavros Niarchos, right, heir to a Greek shipping fortune who was said to have tried to help the prince during the scuffle . A witness told the New York Post that Ms Hart screamed at Natasha Poly, the wife wealthy Dutch businessman Peter Bakker who was seated at Mr Hock's table. They said that Ms Hart shouted at her: 'Your husband’s a loser! F*** you!' on the street outside the nightclub after the incident. Mr Hock has been vocal in putting his side of the story across to the media. 'I acted 100% in self-defence. I felt I . had to defend the honor of the women I was with,' said Hock, 47 who was . pictured leaving a clinic wearing a sling on his left arm, he told the New . York Daily News. 'They expected to be treated like the royalty they are. They didn’t get what they wanted, and it pissed them off,' he added. But the prince's camp insists the one-time . football jock went berserk, swinging round-house punches at anyone in . sight in the early Saturday brawl. 'The facts are very clear,' said Nadine Johnson, a spokeswoman for Casiraghi, the son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, reported New York Daily News. 'There was only one person arrested, Mr. Hock, who spent two days in jail as a result of his actions. Mr Hock said he is deciding whether he will press charges against the four. Mr Hock was . sitting with two friends and three catwalk models when the prince, the third . in line to Monaco’s throne, allegedly approached him and started a . confrontation after trying to drink a $500 bottle of vodka from their table. 'I thought they were being childish, . because they then sent over another bottle of vodka, saying, ""If you . don’t want us to drink your vodka, here’s another bottle,"" ' Hock said . to the New York Post. After a confrontation Hock is said to have punched the prince . and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he . landed with blood pouring from his face. One of the prince's friend allegedly grabbed a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and tried to hit Hock . with it. Models: Natasha Poly, left, and Anja Rubik, right, were with Adam Hock in the Double Seven club when he allegedly started a vicious brawl with Prince Pierre of Monaco . Confrontation: The brawl broke out at the trendy Double Seven nightclub in Manhattan. This is an image from inside the club . Among those with the prince was . Jessica Hart, a supermodel, Stavros Niarchos III, a shipping heir and . ex-boyfriend of Paris Hilton, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, a New York art . dealer and godson to photographer Mario Testino, and Diego Marroquin, a . Manhattan socialite . The prince was taken to hospital for treatment and released a short time later. ‘Pierre’s face looked broken, . with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like . he needed plastic surgery.’ But Hock‘s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, insisted that Casiraghi started the fight and threw the first punch. He accused the prince and his friends of being 'wealthy barons from Europe' with an inflated sense of ownership. 'They . think New York is their honeycomb. They think they can come here and do . whatever they want,' Strazzullo said to the New York Daily News. The 47-year-old was arrested and . later appeared in court, charged with four counts of assault against . Prince Pierre and three of his friends. Hock’s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said: . ‘My client was with some very very nice women and Mr Casiraghi became . jealous of who he was with. They wanted some recognition [from the . women] and it happened because of that. My client acted in self- . defence, it was an unprovoked attack. ‘I don’t know why Mr Casiraghi got . jealous about my client – he is from a humble background.’ He added: ‘My . client is not Bruce Lee… These four guys are trust-fund babies who . think the world is owed to them. They are like spoiled brats.’ But one of the prince’s friends said he was ‘slammed for no reason’, and that another was punched when he tried to intervene. Richard Golub, who is representing the prince and his friends, said the incident was ‘entirely unprovoked’. Pierre’s family have a long history . of  scandal and intrigue, and the latest episode seems to suggest he is . following in their footsteps.

"By . Tim Shipman and Gerard Couzens . Last updated at 8:58 AM on 1st March 2012 . Britain has given £27million in aid to Argentina in schemes attacked as ‘potty’ yesterday by a furious MEP. The cash is being handed to Buenos Aires at a time when the regime there is menacing Britain over the Falklands and yesterday urged its firms to boycott British goods. Tory MEP Nirj Deva said EU documents revealed an aid programme to Argentina worth 65million euros between 2007 and 2013. He said Britain’s share of that would be nearly £7million at current exchange rates. One-way street: Britain is giving Argentina millions of pounds in aid under EU and IMF schemes at a time when President Cristina Kirchner is menacing Britain over the Falklands and yesterday urged its firms to boycott British goods . The UK has also been obliged to contribute through the International Monetary Fund to a support scheme of loans for Argentina which has funnelled an astonishing £450million to Buenos Aires over the last 12 years. Britain’s share of that cash is £20million. Mr Deva asked EU foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton in Brussels: ‘Why is EU aid being sent at the same time Argentina is sabre-rattling and threatening the UK over the Falklands? Can you please have a look at this. 'Potty': Tory MEP Nirj Deva said EU documents revealed an aid programme to Argentina worth 65million euros between 2007 and 2013 . ‘Why are we giving money to the Argentines that they may use to attack the Falkland Islands? It is potty, dotty and mad.’ As the threat of a trade war emerged the UK summoned the Argentine chargé d’affaires in London to the Foreign Office for a dressing down.Downing Street issued a thinly-veiled threat to retaliate unless the regime backs off. Debora Giorgi, the industry minister in Buenos Aires, had earlier telephoned the bosses of around 20 Argentine companies to urge them to replace imports from Britain with goods produced elsewhere. President Cristina Kirchner has been ramping up the rhetoric over the Falklands ahead of the 30th anniversary next month of the conflict in which Argentina invaded the islands and they were retaken by British forces. Buenos Aires is furious that the UK . has refused to negotiate over sovereignty, in part because oil . exploration is taking place around the islands. A . spokesman for the industry minister said: ‘The government is sending a . signal to those who still use colonialism as a means of accessing . foreign natural resources.’ Argentinean anger: A former soldier from the 1982 conflict carries a flag during a protest as they demand to be recognised as war veterans . EU Parliament in Brussels. EU documents have revealed an aid programme to Argentina worth 65million euros between 2007 and 2013 - Britain's share of that would be nearly £7million . The . Prime Minister’s spokesman hit back, saying: ‘The UK is the sixth . largest investor in Argentina and we import from Argentina significantly . more than we export to them.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 6:58 PM on 28th February 2012 . The HIV epidemic was driven by the colonisation of Africa a century ago, a new book claims. Tinderbox: How the West Sparked the AIDS Epidemic . and How the World Can Finally Overcome It, attempts to pinpoint the birth and early life of HIV and AIDS. Considering a wealth of evidence, the authors suggest that the European Scramble for Africa during the late 19th and early 20th century helped turn localised outbreaks of the infection into a global epidemic. Craig Timberg and Daniel Halperin's book supports a wealth of research that suggests that the colonisation of Africa helped spark the HIV epidemic . Co-authors Craig Timberg and Daniel Halperin told the Washington Post: 'It’s clear that colonial commerce created massive new networks of sexual interactions - and massive new transmissions of infections. 'In later decades, transmission through the reuse of hypodermic needles in medical care probably had some role in HIV’s spread as well.' Looking at previous studies Timberg and Halperin trace the journey of HIV from chimpanzee-to-human transmission in southeastern Cameroon to widespread infection in the trading capital of Kinshasa. HIV is a virus most commonly caught by having unprotected sex or by sharing infected needles to inject drugs. It stands for human immunodeficiency virus and weakens the ability to fight infections and disease, such as cancer. AIDS is the final stage of HIV infection, when the body can no longer fight life-threatening infections. There is no cure for HIV, but there are treatments to enable most people with the virus to live a long and healthy life. Many people newly infected with HIV have no signs or symptoms at all. The only way to find out if you have HIV is to have a blood test. At the end of 2008, an estimated 83,000 adults aged over 15 were living with HIV in the UK. Of these, nearly 30 per cent did not know they were infected. They highlight that as European powers sought to dominate Africa and Asia from the 1880s to the 1920s the HIV virus gradually spread through trade and disease routes. 'To fulfill its grim destiny, HIV needed a kind of place never before seen in Central Africa but one that now was rising in the heart of the region: a big, thriving, hectic place jammed with people and energy, where old rules were cast aside amid the tumult of new commerce.' At the end of 2008, an estimated 83,000 adults aged over 15 were living with HIV in the UK. Meanwhile The World Health Organization estimates that more than 33 million people around the world are living with HIV. The virus is particularly widespread in African countries, such as South Africa, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Timberg and Halperin add: 'Without 'The Scramble for Africa,' it’s hard to . see how HIV could have made it out of southeastern Cameroon to . eventually kill tens of millions of people. 'Even a delay might have . caused the killer strain of HIV to die a lonely death deep in the . forest.' Timberg, a former foreign correspondent in Africa, is acting national security editor of The Washington Post. Halperin was a senior HIV prevention adviser in the U.S. government’s global AIDS program and is now an epidemiologist, studying patterns of disease at the University of North Carolina.","Book links colonialism to spread of HIV .

They are billed as the perfect way to exercise and have fun, all without having to leave the comfort of your own living room. But playing active video games won't help you stay fit, a study has found. Researchers who tracked dozens of overweight children for three months found those who mimicked the movements of boxing, tennis and other sports using a Nintendo Wii were no more active over all than those who played video games while sitting on the couch. The results of the study, published in Pediatrics (CORR), a major medical journal, will be a blow to Nintendo, which claims that playing with its latest gadget, the Wii Fit Plus, 'a little every day' will help people become fitter and healthier. Nintendo is also an official partner of Change4Life, the Government's high profile anti-obesity drive. Unlike traditional sit-down video games, the Wii is played by waving a wireless, motion-sensitive box through the air to control the movement of bats, racquets and boxing gloves. Gamers can also dance, do yoga, practise their skiing and hone their hula hoop skills without ever stepping outside. A study suggests playing active video games won't help people to stay fit . Some previous studies have shown it to . boost exercise levels. But these were done under tightly-controlled . laboratory conditions and real world studies have produced conflicting . results. So,Tom Baranowski, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston Texas, set out to resolve the issue. Seventy eight overweight boys and girls were given Wii consoles and a supply of active or inactive games and fitted with a gadget that recorded how much they moved. The news will be a blow to Nintendo, which claims playing with its Wii Fit Plus will help people become fitter . This revealed those who played the active games to not do any more exercise overall than those who played the more traditional inactive games. Dr Baranowki said: 'We expected that playing the video games would in fact lead to a substantial increase in physical activity in the children. 'Frankly we were shocked by the complete lack of difference.' He said it was possible that the children put the minimum of effort into playing the active games. Another possibility is that they compensated for their exertion by doing less exercise later on. Dr Baranowski cautioned that his study wasn't definitive but said that it 'indicates that there's no public health benefit from having those active video games'. He added: 'These findings suggest that simply acquiring a new video games does not automatically lead to increased physical activity, thereby minimising the public health value of simply having active video games available for children to play.' Other experts said that it was still possible that the children burned extra calories during their gaming sessions that the movement device didn't pick up on - for instance, if they were moving their arms a lot in a boxing game. Over time, this could add up. But Dr Baranowski said that such small amounts of movement would be of little benefit to health.","Users of Nintendo Wii no more active than those playing video games sat down .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 4:30 PM on 1st March 2012 . Facebook announced yesterday that adverts will appear on the 425m mobile devices used to access the social network. The move follows the roll-out of adverts on users' news feeds, which began in early January. This means that brands you’ve endorsed by hitting the ‘like’ button will now be able to push deals and other updates right into the news feeds that show your friends' updates, photos and links. The changes come ahead of Facebook's . initial public offering of stock, expected this spring. The IPO could . value the company at as much as $100 billion (£62billion). That means Facebook has to prove it can bring in real advertising revenue from massive brands. Like? Adverts will appear on the mobile version of Facebook . Sea-ing is believing: Adverts will now appear on log-out screens . ‘Facebook is making serious money from ads right now, but they are not making serious money from major brand advertisers. That's where the ad money is,’ said Rebecca Lieb, an analyst with the Altimeter Group. ‘They currently have rather low-rent, shoddy ads on Facebook.’ That could change as Facebook starts integrating brands' messages into the news feeds of its 845 million users as part of a long-term vision of moving from ads to stories about brands. However industry analysts have reservations about the move. Ken Wisnefski, a social-media expert . and Web entrepreneur, warned the social network could end up ‘irritating . their user base by inundating them with ads’. BBC 5 Live's internet expert Olly Mann, meanwhile, told MailOnline: 'Mobile . is the fastest growing area for Facebook, along with gaming, so it's . not at all surprising they're introducing mobile ads. Now's the time to . experiment, before it becomes a fully public company. It just has to be . careful.' He added that the timing of the announcement couldn't be better for the social network giant. 'While . Mobile World Congress is distracting the relevant consumer technology . journalists, Google's privacy is under the spotlight and Apple are . combatting the controversy around their app policy relating to mobile . Contacts - they've made a play to advertisers whilst trying to keep this . under wraps to their users,' he said. Dave Bird, Managing Director at Derby-based Webtistic, a company that provides internet marketing services, said: 'I can understand that Facebook is doing what it can to stay profitable in the highly competitive social media space, especially with the IPO just around the corner. There is an atmosphere of uncertainty around Facebook’s revenue model and this will go some way to satisfy potential investors. 'The downside of course is that Facebook users may see this as being ""spammy"" and negatively impact on Facebook’s biggest asset – user experience. Risking the ""stickiness"" of the site could be a dangerous game, especially with the likes of Google Plus and Pinterest challenging for market share.' Facebook made the announcement at the American Museum of Natural History in New York in a rare East Coast appearance for a Silicon Valley company. Rather than bombarding people with flashy ads, Facebook is urging companies to integrate themselves into what people are already doing on the site - talking to their friends and family, commenting on photos or posting news links. Cashing in: Mark Zuckerberg's social media network is thought to be worth over £60billion . ‘The definition of the word “advertise” is to draw attention to,’ said Chris Cox, Facebook's vice president of product. ‘The definition of a story is narration, which you'd think is what people prefer.’ Facebook has a vast trove of information about its users' lives, hobbies, likes and dislikes, yet the company has kept advertising fairly unobtrusive to date. Ads for teeth-whitening, wineries and laundry detergent and the like are relegated to the right side of users' Facebook pages. Over time, Web-savvy users have grown used to ads and many are tuning them out. Those ads are not going away, but brands will now be able to push updates - or as Facebook likes to call, ‘stories’ - right into the news feeds. Facebook's challenge will be to keep these ads as unobtrusive as possible so that users are not alienated or driven to ‘unlike’ brands. ‘I think they understand that people value authenticity,’ said Clara Shih, CEO of Hearsay Social, a marketing software company for businesses. ‘The new page format and the new ad format encourage authenticity and storytelling.’ Companies can continue to set up Facebook pages on their brands for free. They'd pay to insert updates into news feeds and elsewhere based on the number of fans they have. In other words, posting the message will remain free, but getting more people to see it will cost money. Facebook will collect feedback and test how users respond as it rolls out the changes gradually. At first, users may see just one message a day from a brand inside their news feed, or even less. And they won't see messages from random companies they are not connected to in some way - directly or through a friend. ‘Facebook has certainly backed down on things,’ Lieb said. ‘But they are not just going on what people say. They are going on what they do.’ Beyond the updates within news feeds, Facebook will also start showing ads when people log out of the site.","Potentially unpopular move is rolled out while spotlight is on Google's privacy policy, says tech expert ."
"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 4:45 PM on 2nd March 2012 . A pair of 'despicable' muggers who stole from a Malaysian student with a broken jaw during last summer's riots have both been found guilty of robbery. Images of Ashraf Rossli being attacked by thugs pretending to be Good Samaritans became symbolic of the lawlessness of the widespread rioting last August. Today the pair who stole Mr Rossli's belongings as he stood bleeding and helpless in Barking, east London, were convicted of robbery, violent disorder and theft. Scroll down for video . Video evidence: Ashraf Rossli is helped to his feet, but then has his . possessions stolen by Kafunda (in grey hoodie) and Donovan (in cap). The pair were today both convicted of robbery and violent disorder at Wood Green Crown Court, despite denying the offences throughout their trial . Guilty: Reece Donovan, 24 (left) and John . Kafunda, 22 were both convicted of robbery and violent disorder . In footage which shocked the nation, John Kafunda robbed Mr Rossli minutes after he had been attacked by another rioter Beau Isagba, who had earlier stolen his bike after punching him in the face shattering his jaw. The 22-year-old youth worker was caught on film pretending to help the 21-year-old accountancy student as blood poured from his mouth. Ashraf Rossli, 21, suffered a broken jaw when he was punched and knocked from his bike as looting spread across the country last August . Kafunda's friend Reece Donovan, 24 was convicted of robbery and theft after being caught rifling through the student's bag while the victim’s back was to him. Donovan, who was also found guilty of violent disorder and later burgling a Tesco store, stole a portable Sony Playstation and games worth £500 from Mr Rossli. The footage of the attack on Mr Rossli was viewed by millions after it was uploaded to Youtube the day after his ordeal, and the public donated thousands to him following outcry over the clip. The student from Kuala Lumpur, who had only been in the country a month, underwent surgery on his broken jaw and had to have metal pins and plates inserted in his face which will remain for life. Mr Rossli had previously a jury at Wood Green Crown Court he knew what was happened to him but was powerless to stop it. He said: 'As I sat on the pavement with blood pouring from my mouth I remember being approached by a male who asked if I was okay. 'I remember being pulled to my feet . then I felt someone again tugging at my rucksack. I was not in a . position to defend myself as I was still suffering from the effects of . being hit. 'I knew they were stealing from me but I could do nothing. Once they had taken what they wanted they left.' Donovan, of Romford, Essex, and Kafunda, of Ilford, Essex, were arrested after two independent witnesses, who have been granted anonymity, came forward to identify them. Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, Ashraf Rossli is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London . From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement . Lowest of the low: The teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack . Discarded: The thief, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away . The pair, both from Essex, denied it was them in the clip and despite already giving false alibis Donovan said he was out buying cannabis at the time while Kafunda claims he was at a neighbour’s house. However, cell site mobile phone evidence put both of them in the area around the time Mr Rossli was mugged on the Queen’s Road flyover. It took a jury at Wood Green Crown Court four hours to find the pair guilty of violent disorder, while Kafunda was found guilty of robbery and Donovan was convicted of theft and burgling a Tesco’s. Christopher Hehir, prosecuting, said Mr Rossli, was set upon by gangs of hoodies 'intent on crime' as he cycled with his friend Sheikh Azhar. As he entered a second group of yobs he turned to see who was putting his hand in his pocket to steal his mobile and was punched in the face by Isagba who stole his bike after he fell to the ground. Mr Hehir said: 'What these defendants did was to take advantage of Mr Rossli in the aftermath of the attack, in a way that can only be described as despicable. 'Kafunda approached Mr Rossli and lifted him up to his feet. He gave every impression at that point that he was helping Mr Rossli, having realised that he was injured. 'If his initial impulse was to help it was quickly superceeded by a decision to steal from the helpless victim.' Mr Rossli was set upon by another group, which included Beau Isagba, 17, pictured, who was convicted by a court earlier this month of punching him . As he got to his feet Donovan 'took the lead' in rummaging through his bag and was then joined by Kafunda who pushes the student back when he turns to see what is happening. A dazed Mr Rossli, whose friend escaped the attack, is then seen stumbling up the road where he was spotted by members of the public and taken to hospital. Beau Isagba, 17, has already been convicted of punching Mr Rossli, breaking his jaw, and stealing his bike and will be sentenced later this moth. Following the guilty verdicts, the detective who led the investigation into the attack on Mr Rossli said the footage of the incident 'captured the heart of the public'. Det Supt John Healy, from the Met Police, said: 'The victim was a visitor to this country for a very short period of time prior to the initial attack and robbery committed by Beau Isagba, who was convicted two weeks ago at this court. 'This incident being captured on video footage came to be iconic and captured the hearts of the public seeing a vulnerable person being taking advantage of. 'At the time of this incident he was suffering the effects of a broken jaw and was unable to defend himself. 'The defendants have denied the offences throughout forcing witnesses to give evidence anonymously to prove the case. 'It is a good result for the Met police and Operation Withern, the riot enquiry.'","John Kafunda, pretended to help Ashraf Rossli before robbing him in riots .

Garda officials have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Konias . 'There's a time lapse from when the truck was parked' until it was found, . Stangrecki said. 'He must have gone to the company parking lot where his car, . his Ford Explorer, was parked, and got there and left the area.' Homicide detectives went to the address where Konias lived with his parents in Dravosburg and found his bloody uniform jacket in his bedroom. Stangrecki said Konias' family is cooperating with the investigation and had not been aware of the robbery. 'We know that he returned to his family's home, left the jacket and left the . house,' Stangrecki said. 'He may have come home normally from work like he . always does. And he hasn't been seen since.' Homicide detectives went to the house where Konias lived with his parents in Dravosburg, pictured, and found his bloody uniform jacket in his bedroom .

The police report shows that Konias called a friend after the alleged shooting, reports Wpxi.com. He said, 'I f***ked up. My life is over.' His friend replied: 'Are you having a bad day at work? Did you get a girl pregnant.' Konias said, 'Worse than that,' and his friend asked: 'Did you kill someone?' The suspect then confessed that he had, and claimed he had enough money to last the rest of his life. Man-hunt: Police said he is driving a tan Ford Explorer with Pennsylvania license plate number GZW-4572 .

Josh Powell's mother yesterday spoke out and said that her son would not be buried with her grandsons, whom he killed in an explosive house fire. Terri Powell had bought a burial plot for Josh in the same Washington cemetery as his sons Charlie, seven, and five-year-old Braden - a decision which her son-in-law said was 'clueless'. But this news provoked outrage from the relatives of Powell's missing wife Susan - and members of the public, including police officers, bought plots surrounding the boys' graves to ensure that their father could not be buried there. Happier times: Josh Powell blew up the property when he found out he was not getting custody of his two sons . Now Terri Powell has confirmed that . the family has given up a plot at Woodbine Cemetery, overlooking the . boys' graves, which was tentatively reserved for their father. 'We have tried so hard to be loving . and considerate and respectful in making Josh's burial arrangements,' she said in a written statement. 'We love our little Charlie and Braden and want their resting place to be a place of peace and comfort.' Powell's grave had already been dug . earlier this week, and a city official said at the time that the . cemetery had no policy on blocking individual burials. Preventative measure: Crimestoppers has purchased the plots on either side of the gravesite of Charlie and Braden Powell (shown still covered by a cemetery canopy) Empty plot: A cement cover is placed on top of an empty grave that has been reserved for Josh Powell up the hill, but not alongside the boys' grave, shown left under the canopy . Powell killed his sons and himself in a gas-fueled blaze two weeks ago at a home he was renting in Graham, Washington. More than 1,000 mourners attended the . boys' funeral on Saturday. They were later buried in a single casket at . Woodbine, a municipal cemetery in Puyallup. Terri Powell, wracked by grief, . realized early this week that no one else was planning for what to do . with Josh Powell's remains, said her son-in-law, Kirk Graves. She visited a funeral home and a few . cemeteries, he added, and she 'cluelessly' picked a gravesite just up . the hill from where the boys are buried. Loss: Susan Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox remember their grandsons, seven-year-old Charlie and five-year-old Braden, during their funeral service on February 11 . Senseless: The casket bearing the bodies of Charlie and Braden Powell is shown during a funeral service for the boys in Tacoma, Washington on Saturday . The decision prompted a public . firestorm. The parents of Susan Powell threatened legal action to keep . Josh Powell from being buried so close, and the anti-crime organisation . Crime Stoppers of Tacoma-Pierce County purchased the plots on either . side of the boys to ensure that he didn't wind up next to them. Crime Stoppers raised about $20,000 in donations for the effort in less than a day. 'We felt very strongly that it wasn't . appropriate to put him anywhere near the boys, and we did our best over . the last 48 hours to convince her to do something different,' Mr Graves . said. 'It wasn't that hard to convince her - she just got started off on the wrong path.' Attorney Steve Downing, who represents Susan Powell's parents, Charles and Judy Cox, said they were immensely relieved. Sham: The house that Josh Powell blew up to kill himself and his two sons was used as a ruse for social workers. He did not live there but placed photographs around to give the impression he did . Inferno: At a meeting for residents, police said Powell slashed the boys with a hatchet before lighting gasoline . Destroyed: The house, which neighbours thought was empty and abandoned, exploded within seconds . Questions: Powell was the sole person of interest in the case of his missing wife Susan . Josh Powell was a suspect in Susan . Powell's 2009 disappearance from their home in West Valley City, Utah. He had always claimed that he didn't know what happened to his wife. He took the boys - then 2 and 4 - on a . midnight camping trip in freezing weather in the Utah desert, he said, . and when he returned home the next day authorities were at the house . looking for her. Weeks later, he moved the boys to his . father's home in Puyallup. After Steve Powell's arrest on voyeurism and . child pornography charges last fall, the boys were removed from the . house and turned over to the Coxes. A social worker brought them to Josh Powell's rental home for what was supposed to be a court-sanctioned supervised visit. Josh Powell let the boys inside, . locked the social worker out, hit them with a hatchet and set fire to . gasoline, authorities said. A judge had recently ordered that . Josh Powell undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation if he hoped to regain . custody, and in a last-minute message to his sister he said he couldn't . live without his boys. Steve Powell remains in custody, and authorities are interested in knowing whether he has information about Susan Powell's fate. On Tuesday, he filed a written notice . in Pierce County Superior Court asserting his constitutional right to . remain silent and not discuss any matters with Utah, Washington or . federal law enforcement.","Terri Powell says grandsons' grave should be 'a place of peace and comfort'

A doctor who fraudulently claimed more than £100,000 in benefits while secretly owning a Spanish holiday home and receiving an NHS pension has walked free from court. Dr Barbara Longley, 60, made repeated claims for benefits over six years from Brighton and Hove City Council but failed to declare her three-bedroom property in Alicante. The mother-of-two, from Hove, Sussex, also hid an NHS pension and a bank account containing several thousand pounds. Longley admitted ten counts of fraudulently claiming housing and council tax benefit and income support totalling £103,645 at Hove Crown Court. But she walked free from court yesterday after being given a suspended sentence. The court heard she had already paid back more than £70,000 by selling her Spanish property and will have to repay the remaining £31,849 owed to the council and the Department of Work and Pensions. Rowan Jenkins, prosecuting, said: ‘Dr Longley made a series of applications for benefits, the first in May 2003, when she completed an application for housing and council tax benefit. ‘She stated her only income was child benefit and that she held no other property. ‘She didn’t declare she had a £6,500 a year pension from the National Health Service.’ The court heard Longley then continued to make benefit claims until 2009. Mr Jenkins added: ‘She stated she was finding it hard to pay her bills for rent and other bills as well. ‘She said her only income was from benefits and didn’t mention her pension income at all.’ Longley trained as a doctor and held several posts within the medical profession before being diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Nick Hamlin, defending the single mother-of-two, asked the court to show ‘mercy’ because of her mental health problems. Dr Longley was forced to sell her three-bedroom property in Alicante, Spain (stock photo above), to pay back the money she claimed in benefits . He said: ‘Through most of her adult life she has either been depressed or in a manic mood. ‘Having obtained her qualifications she was struck by this illness and that, on many occasions, leaves her unable to express herself and leads her to errors of judgement.’ Judge Richard Hayward handed Longley a 12 month sentence suspended for two years. Judge Hayward said: ‘Clearly you are an intelligent woman. You qualified and practised as a doctor for some years but your life has been blighted by mental health illness.’ She was ordered to repay £2,500 court costs.","Dr Barbara Longley, 60, walked free from Hove Crown Court with a suspended 12-month sentence .

"By . Jason Groves, Political Correspondent . Last updated at 8:59 AM on 2nd March 2012 . 'Historic step': David Cameron says the reforms 'will change lives for the better' David Cameron today hailed an 'historic step' in ending Britain's benefits culture as the Government's flagship Welfare Reform Bill finally became law. The Prime Minister said the measures to curb welfare dependency would help get people back to work and start to turn around the something-for-nothing culture encouraged by Labour. The Welfare Reform Bill cleared its final hurdle in the Lords last night despite bitter opposition from Labour and some Church of England bishops. The legislation brings in a £26,000-a-year cap on the total amount of benefits any family can claim and introduces new curbs to a number of long-term benefits. The Prime Minister said: 'Today marks an historic step in the biggest welfare revolution in over 60 years. 'These reforms will change lives for the better, giving people the help they need, while backing individual responsibility so that they can escape poverty, not be trapped in it. 'Past governments have talked about reform, while watching the benefits bill sky-rocket and generations languish on the dole and dependency. This Government is delivering it. 'Our new law will mark the end of the culture that said a life on benefits was an acceptable alternative to work.' The Prime Minister paid tribute to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who faced fierce criticism from charities and pressure groups to water down the legislation. He added: 'We've stood up against the abuse that left taxpayers footing the bills for people on £30,000 or even £50,000 a year in benefits. 'It's a fair principle: a family out of work on benefits shouldn't be paid more than the average family in work. 'This is a core part of the Government's task of turning around the legacy of debt, overspending and waste we inherited. 'We want money to go to people who need it, not subsidising the consequences of our broken society. By reforming welfare we will get people into fulfilling jobs - not abandon them to poverty and dependency - save billions of pounds of taxpayers' money and make sure those who really need help get it.' Clampdown: More than 75 per cent of people of working age in the Falinge area of Rochdale claim benefits . The Bill had a stormy passage through the Lords, with peers inflicting seven defeats on the Government when the legislation was first considered and a further one after MPs had overturned all the setbacks. The most prominent came when the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds John Packer led a move to exempt child benefit from the £26,000 cap. Tory MP David Davies today pointed out that the Church of England pays its bishops' chauffeurs significantly less than the £26,000 still on offer to some benefits claimants. MPs were told that the Church's 19 drivers are employed at a total cost of £352,719 - an average of £18,500. Mr Davies said the clergy were morally obliged to pay their drivers at least as much as a household can receive in benefits. The Monmouth MP said: 'The Welfare Reform Bill has just become an Act.'Those bishops who voted against this, who voted to ensure people who are not working should earn more than £26,000, should now feel a moral imperative to pay their chauffeurs accordingly.' Conservative Tony Baldry, representing the Church Commissioners, said being driven around 'helps ensure the best use of bishops' time'.",David Cameron says a family out of work on benefits shouldn't be paid more than the average family in work .

Promising football player Amy, captain . of West Bromwich Albion’s ladies team, urged the congregation to . remember her dad in the happy way he would have wanted. 'It’s so hard to try and sum dad up as he simply had too many qualities,' she said. 'Kind, thoughtful, caring, loving and generous are some of the words that spring to mind but one that sticks out is ""selfless"".

In his address to the congregation, the rector of the village, the Reverend David Martin, said: ‘Some people live just for their own family, but Peter was not of that ilk. ‘His family embraced the 3,000 children whom he had taught over the years, the young people he had refereed and umpired on the sports field, and the enormous number of friends he had.’ 'Mr Rippington had truly lived for . others.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:03 AM on 3rd March 2012 . Vladamir Putin has said he is confident he will win tomorrow’s presidential election, claiming yesterday that his 12 years in power have been good for Russia. Recent allegations of vote-rigging led to mass demonstrations in Moscow in the largest show of anti-government discontent since the Soviet collapse two decades ago. But the prime minister insisted that although he has less support in big cities, he is favoured by a majority of Russians. Russia's hard man: Vladimir Putin says he expects to win the presidential election when his country goes to the polls on Sunday . He said: ‘Yes, there is a smaller number of my supporters there, but they are still a majority.’ That claim is in line with recent . opinion polls that show he is backed by about 60  per cent of voters, . paving the way for an easy victory against his four Kremlin-approved . contenders. Mr Putin said his 12-year rule had been a ‘good experience for Russia’. He said: ‘That situation has helped . make government structures more capable, has raised the need for them to . think, search for solutions and communicate with society.’ Mr Putin also reaffirmed his promise, . if he wins tomorrow’s vote, to name his protege, current president . Dmitry Medvedev, as prime minister. Putin insisted Friday that he and Medvedev made their decision because Putin is the more popular of the two. Putin reaffirmed his promise to name Medvedev as the prime minister, if he wins Sunday’s vote, saying the premiership would allow Medvedev to implement reforms he has announced. Vote winner? Activists from the Network of Putin Supporters group and pro-Kremlin youth movements carry flowers to give them out to subway passengers at the Pushkinskaya metro station in Moscow . Icon: Portraits of Vladimir Putin, which cost on display at a book store in St Petersburg . Some observers said, however, that appointing Medvedev could help Putin avoid a wave of discontent that will likely be fueled by planned painful economic and social reforms. Putin’s popularity has been dented by opposition protests, but he has managed to recoup the losses thanks to massive daily coverage by state television that cast him as the defender of nationalist interests against foreign expansion and the protector of economic and social stability. He has accused the U.S. of instigating the opposition protests to weaken Russia and strongly criticized plans for the U.S.-led NATO missile defense around Europe. Putin insisted Friday that the planned shield would target Russia’s nuclear deterrent and undermine global stability, adding that Washington’s refusal to offer Moscow written guarantees that its missile defense system will not be aimed against Russia deepened its concerns. 'When one party gets an illusion that it’s invulnerable for a retaliatory strike by another, that stokes up conflicts and aggressive behavior,' Putin said. 'We consider that extremely dangerous.' He said President Barack Obama’s policy of “resetting” ties with Russia has helped reach the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty and successfully negotiate Russia’s access into the World Trade Organization, but has brought 'practically nothing' on the divisive missile defense issue. At the same time, he praised Obama as 'absolutely sincere' in his course of improving ties with Russia.

The iconic black bull that looms over roads across Spain - and is now its unofficial national symbol - could soon be coming to a street near you. The brandy firm behind the legendary advert is planning to let its Toro Osborne out of the corral to roam main roads across Europe, Asia and the U.S. It means the 14 metre high billboard - . seen by millions of tourists to the Iberian peninsula each year - could . soon be popping up on the streets of New York, London or Tokyo. Dallas, in the U.S., and the Danish capital of Copenhagen have already stated a firm interest. Scroll down for video... Looming: The Toro Osborne can be seen on roads across Spain, and could soon be coming to a city near you . Champions: Spanish tennis player Rafael Nadal, pictured here with goalkeeper Iker Casillas, turned up to watch the World Cup Final in South Africa wearing a flag with the Toro Osborne on it . A herd of 94 are currently dotted . around the Iberian peninsula, the Canary Islands and most recently the . Spanish North African enclave of Melilla. Osborne PR director Iván Llanza spoke of the company's dream at the opening of its fourth Toro by Osborne shop in Salamanca. He said he saw 'no reason' why the Toro could not stretch its legs across the world. He said he had already received requests from Dallas, in the U.S. and the Danish capital of Copenhagen. But introduction of the bulls to England may spark protest, however, with many animal rights activists associating it with bullfighting. But this, Llanza has previously protested, is not the case. He argues that the hoardings, which stand prominently on hillsides across Spain, are simply an advert for the company. The Toro Osborne sprang up in the 1950s as Spain, recovering from the Civil War, started the rough and rocky road from poverty to the developed world. While the classic rectangle boards were shooting up, Osborne, the Jerez based brandy firm, decided they wanted something a bit different. Neighbours? This Toro Osborne, near Puerto de Somosierra, is one of 94 billboards placed by the brandy firm . Loved: The Toros are frequently defaced (left) but the firm always restores them to their original state, which is now a . huge brand, selling t-shirts (right), keyrings and other merchandise . And that was certainly what they got when marketing genius Manolo Prieto came up with the idea of a silhouetted billboard depicting one of the 'toros bravos' or 'brave bulls' used in bullfights - with the company's name emblazoned across its side. In 1957 more than 50 were placed on hill tops across the country, alongside adverts for soap powders, American fizzy colas and kitchen appliances. Location: There are 94 bulls in Spanish territories . The shadow they cast shortly became synonymous with Spain. It was ironic that Prieto, a  staunch communist, created a symbol which was taken up and used by the fascist right- wing Franco government. The first batch of bulls were wooden, had white horns and stood four metres high. But the weather soon took its toll and four years later, in 1961, they were replaced with seven metre high sheet iron versions. The Toros' first brush with the law came just a year later when two Francoist dictats ordered billboards be located at least 125 metres from main roads. It seemed the Toros were being returned to their corrals, but to make sure they could be seen Osborne gave them some feeding pills and grew them to 14 metres tall. By this time there were 90 toros across the country – all the way from Cantabria to Murcia – with the most in the Alicante province. But their freedom was short-lived. Come the 1980s and Spain was embarking on a crash course to democracy - and the newly empowered Socialist government declared war on hoardings blotting the landscape. As the eyesores started to be torn down, thousands launched a campaign to save the silhouettes from destruction. They argued they were a tourist attraction, despite the fact many had had their gonads and/or heads smashed off by vandals and anti-bullfight protestors. Remarkably, in those pre-Facebook pressure days, President Felipe Gonzalez relented and decided the Toros Osborne, as they affectionately came to be known, could stay. The one condition was the name of the company had to be removed from the bull‟s stomach. The firm agreed as its brand name was already associated with the Toros and the campaign had given them more inches of newspaper print across the world than they could ever have dreamt of. Now, it is the symbol of the country across the world, donned proudly by Spaniards on their holidays - and even worn by tennis star Rafael Nadal when the football team won the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. The company was founded in 1772 by an Englishman, the Exeter wine importer . Thomas Osborne.","U.S. city of Dallas and Copenhagen in Denmark are keen for bull to arrive .

"By . Polly Dunbar . Last updated at 8:18 AM on 26th February 2012 . It has been impossible to miss them over the past few weeks. Three words emblazoned across vast billboards, printed over images of teenage girls in tiaras and extravagantly frothy wedding dresses. Three words that reveal everything about the subtlety of the programme they are advertising: Bigger, Fatter, Gypsier. The arrival of the second series of the Channel 4 documentary Big Fat Gypsy Weddings has been  accompanied by the sort of fanfare reserved for guaranteed smash-hits. The confidence is well-placed. The reality show exploring the lavish nuptials of young gypsy couples – in particular, the enormous, glitter-encrusted gowns worn by the brides – has become an unexpected phenomenon. Extravagant: Sam, a barmaid, marries traveller Pat in the first series . The first series, broadcast early in 2011, became the channel’s highest rating documentary of all time, peaking at 9.7 million viewers – equivalent to the last episode of Friends. But the programme isn’t such a hit with many of the travellers, who feel  it only fuels prejudice against them. ‘The production company has shamelessly cashed in on the success of the show – and having seen it happen, many of the gypsies have become angry that they are opening their lives to ridicule without seeing any of the rewards,’ says a source. There are also disturbing allegations about what really goes on behind the scenes. According to sources close to the production, the company behind  it, Firecracker Films, has made secret cash payments to gypsies to persuade them to appear. There has also been speculation as to why some of the male gypsies in recent programmes have had their faces pixelated. And it is claimed the producers have rehearsed and reshot scenes and have egged on teenage girls to wear provocative clothing in a process described by insiders as ‘nurtured reality’. Young bride Dolores will be seen in a pineapple dress in series two . But Firecracker is unabashed and determined to cash in on the phenomenon it has created. The company is lining up a series of specials to follow on from its festive money-spinner,  My Big Fat Gypsy Christmas. One will focus on Thelma Madine, the woman who makes the extraordinary wedding dresses. A second will be a My Big Fat Moonie Wedding version, which will follow British members of the cult as they prepare for a mass wedding ceremony. And there will be a series about American gypsies. Remarkably, Firecracker is even  trying to produce a version focusing on the weddings of criminals, entitled, predictably, Big Fat Criminal Weddings. Big Fat Gypsy Weddings began life as just a one-off Cutting Edge programme in 2010. Unexpectedly, it was a massive hit for Channel 4, attracting 5.3 million viewers, five times the  normal total for Cutting Edge. A full five-part series followed, ordered by Channel 4 commissioning editor Alistair Pegg, who claimed it would ‘answer some of the more probing questions raised by the first film’. It was made by Firecracker, which was established by Mark Soldinger  in one room in London’s Soho in 2003. The company had previously been known for so-called ‘shock docs’ with titles such as The Man Whose Arms Exploded!, The World’s Strongest Boy and Mermaid Girl. Billed as a fascinating insight into the secretive world of the traveller community, the programme revealed the eye-popping extravagance of gypsy nuptials, in which the brides – average age 17 – don dresses so vast and bedecked with ornaments that they are often left with scars around their waists from the boning. It also highlighted the dichotomy between the strict moral code obeyed by young traveller girls – no dating, premarital sex or drinking – and their provocative way of dressing up. But according to a source, finding enough gypsies to fill a series in just ten months of production was very difficult for its makers, led by Jes Wilkins, Firecracker’s head of programmes and the executive producer of the series. ‘It is well known that payments were made to the gypsies who appeared in the first series,’ claims the source. ‘It’s understood Firecracker paid cash for photographs and other expenses.’ But the series failed to answer many pertinent questions, such as where  the gypsies found the six-figure sums often spent on the weddings. And while it claimed to show the traveller way of life without judgment, members of the community were unhappy about the portrayal of gypsy girls as uneducated drudges, obsessed with outlandish clothing. Wedded to fantasy: Thelma Madine puts the finishing touches to bride Bridget's lavish dress . All dressed up: Critics say the girls' clothing is far too provocative . They also argued that the use of  circus music and subtitles for gypsies speaking English exploited the  participants and invited viewers to mock them. Nonetheless, the programme made stars of some of its subjects, particularly Paddy Doherty, an Irish traveller and former bare-knuckle boxer who went on to win Celebrity Big Brother last month. The show also transformed the fortunes of Firecracker. The once tiny outfit is now 60-strong and operates from smart offices in Chelsea Harbour, with a second branch in Santa Monica, California, where Soldinger is based. Its turnover last year was £11 million and it is thought new figures will be much higher. Shortly after Big Fat Gypsy  Weddings was shown in Britain,  the company secured a deal with  American cable network TLC worth  £2.6 million. The original British series was a surprise ratings hit  in the US, and TLC commissioned Firecracker to produce an eight-part series called My Big Fat American Gypsy Wedding. It will be aired later this year and will explore the lives of travellers – mostly Roma – living in the US. Although the US broadcasters were eager to own the rights to the programme, Firecracker has held on to them. The first British series of BFGW has also been bought by other broadcasters around the world. To date, it has generated sales revenues of £3.5 million from deals in 81 territories, including countries in Africa, Central Europe and Latin America. Firecracker is thrilled with its success. ‘Jes Wilkins has become known as the Gypsy King of TV since he hit the jackpot with the show,’ says a source. ‘They’re making a fortune, but they’re incredibly tight when it comes to production budgets. The extravagant lifestyles of the community has meant it has a keen following . Members of the community have been unhappy with the way hey have been portrayed . ‘They’ve become known in the industry as being very ruthless.’ Firecracker is now experiencing  a backlash from the gypsies who, despite the payments for the first series, do not feel they have made their fair share of the profits. A source says the gypsies are aware of the way they were portrayed in the first series and the money it made. For the second series, the gypsies demanded more money, but it was then decided not to pay any of them. The argument was that fame should be enough – but it meant Firecracker struggled to get enough gypsies to co-operate. ‘Some of the people shown in the new series had their faces obscured – they are the ones who refused to sign the consent forms because of disagreements with the programme’s makers,’ a source says. It is also claimed some scenes in the latest series are rehearsed prior to filming to ensure they meet the makers’ requirements. For instance, last week’s show  featured a 15-year-old girl planning her wedding, which will take place when she turns 16. She and her  teenage friends were seen clad in provocative outfits – but the show source says: ‘They were encouraged by the producers to wear those skimpy outfits.’ Firecracker’s latest and most audacious idea, My Big Fat Criminal Wedding, is intended to give an insight into another secretive section of society – this time, people known and feared for their illegal activities. It is perhaps unsurprising that the project has proved more difficult than the company anticipated. It has been suggested that some of scenes were recreated so that they met the requirements of the programme-makers . Piled up: The travellers take over the road during one of the shows . Many infamous criminals have been approached by the production company, but it is understood to  be struggling to convince them  to appear and has been reduced to trawling lapdancing clubs in London and Essex to find potential subjects. Firecracker cannot pay contributors due to Ofcom rules stating criminals cannot benefit financially from their crimes. One of those approached was Freddie Foreman, who served 16 years in prison for his involvement in the disposal of the body of Jack ‘the Hat’ McVitie, one of Reggie Kray’s victims. He declined to take part. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Weddings are a very personal thing and I turned Firecracker down because I thought they were really pushing their luck with a series about criminals’ weddings. The gypsy series was bad enough. I mean, why would any self-respecting “face” want to allow cameras into such an event?’ Speaking on behalf of Channel 4 and Firecracker Films, a spokesman said: ‘The programme is an observational documentary series and we absolutely refute any allegations that any elements are staged. Everything  featured is a fair and accurate reflection of what we experienced during filming. The producers of the show do not pay for the weddings and contributors are not paid. ‘In a few instances, a small facilitation fee may be given to cover any arrangements the participants have had to make to fit in with the filming schedule – for example covering loss of earnings or childcare arrangements, which is common practice in the industry.’","Newly rich company behind TV series now has swanky offices in Chelsea and LA .

Tornadoes destroyed houses, tore up the roof of a maximum-security prison and injured people in northern Alabama as bad weather threatened more twisters across the region today - two days after a storm system killed 13 people in the Midwest and South. Anxiety mounted from Georgia to southern Ohio across a wide swath where forecasters said severe weather could hit later in the day. Thousands of schoolchildren in several states were sent home as a precaution. Meanwhile, residents in parts of Illinois hit hard by storms earlier in the week salvaged what they could from damaged homes. In the Huntsville area, five people were taken to hospitals, and several houses were leveled by what authorities believed were tornadoes this morning. The extent of the people's injuries was not immediately known, and emergency crews were continuing to survey damage. No deaths were reported. Scroll down for videos . Damage: Several homes in the Canebrake region in Athens, Alabama, had their roofs blown off today leaving the neighbourhood in ruin . Overturned: A 18-wheeler is flipped on its side in Harvest, Alabama because of the violent storm . At least 10 homes were damaged in a subdivision in Athens. Homeowner Bill Adams watched as two men ripped shingles off the roof of a house he rents out, and he fretted about predictions that more storms would pass through. 'Hopefully they can at least get a tarp on it before it starts again,' he said. An apparent tornado also damaged a state maximum-security prison about 10 miles from Huntsville, but none of the facility's approximately 2,100 inmates escaped. Alabama Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Corbette said there were no reports of injuries, but the roof was damaged on two large prison dormitories that each hold about 250 men. Part of the perimeter fence was knocked down, but the prison was secure. 'It was reported you could see the sky through the roof of one of them,' Mr Corbette said. Authorities are confident that storms that hit Limestone and Madison counties were tornadoes, but it will be up to the National Weather Service to confirm the twisters, said Alabama State Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Yasamie August. 'We're still getting reports of damage pretty much as we speak,' she said at midday. Forecasters warned of severe . thunderstorms with the threat of tornadoes crossing a region from . southern Ohio through much of Kentucky and Tennessee. By early Friday . afternoon, tornado watches covered parts of those states along with . Missouri, Illinois and Indiana. Ruined: Greg Cook rescues his dog Coco from inside his destroyed home in Limestone, Alabama and hands her to a friend . Devastated: Greg Cook hugs his dog Coco after finding her inside his destroyed home in East Limestone, Alabama today . In Norman, Oklahoma, forecasters at the Storm Prediction Center said they were bracing for what could be a potent tornado outbreak. 'Maybe five times a year we issue what is kind of the highest risk level for us at the Storm Prediction Center,' forecaster Corey Mead said. 'This is one of those days.' Mead said a powerful storm system was interacting with humid, unstable air that was streaming north from the Gulf of Mexico. 'The environment just becomes more unstable and provides the fuel for the thunderstorms,' Mr Mead said. Schools sent students home early or cancelled classes entirely in states including Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky. In Alabama alone, more than 20 school systems say they are dismissing classes early Friday because of the possibility of severe storms. The bad weather could hit around the time schools normally dismiss for the day, based on predictions from the National Weather Service. Violent: Downed power lines and debris caused by a tornado lie along Yarbrough Road in Harvest, Alabama . News report: Thousands of schoolchildren in several states were sent home as a precaution as the tornado moving at about 50mph threatened further disruption . Residents were picking through debris in parts of Illinois that were devastated by the previous round of severe weather on Wednesday. The 9,000-resident town of Harrisburg was sacked by a twister about 5 a.m. on Wednesday that killed six people. Forecasters weren't expecting the area to be hit hard by the newest storms, though. The forecast in Harrisburg didn't much matter to Amanda Patrick, who lost her home on Wednesday, in the same twister that killed her neighbours in the area where most of the fatalities occurred. 'I don't know what to tell you other than I take it one moment, one day at a time,' Ms Patrick, 31, said a day after riding out the storm in the bathtub she barely was able to crawl into for shelter before the twister hit. She considers herself blessed, having thought the sirens that wailed as the tornado barreled down on her neighborhood was actually part of her dream. She awakened just minutes before the tornado hit and hours later couldn't stop sobbing over the neighbors she lost. 'I'm not crying as much now. I'm here right now, standing,' she said Thursday. 'Now, I will get up every time I hear a siren.' Watch videos here .","Violent weather comes two days after a storm killed 13 people in the Midwest and South .

The school district lists 'physical contact' as a minor offence. But during a February 9 school assembly, Bond threatened gay students showing affection with 60-day suspensions, transfer to an different school or expulsion, students told the ACLU, according to the Tennessean. Student Amber Whittiemore says she took a call from her gay friend, who was at the meeting, afterwards. The gay student was devastated, she said.

"By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 11:57 AM on 3rd March 2012 . Decline: Britain will have Europe's fifth lowest percentage of people over 65 by 2035, estimates have suggested . A surge in babies born to immigrant parents has moved Britain from having one of Europe's most rapidly ageing populations to one of the youngest, official figures show. In contrast to the previously high numbers of people over 65 in the UK, an increased birth rate in the past decade has reversed the trend thanks in part to the numbers of immigrant babies. The figures mean Britain is now predicted to go from having the second highest proportion of retired people to the fifth lowest in Europe, according to the Office for National Statistics. Estimates show that the number of people aged 65 or over in the UK increased by 1.7m between 1985 and 2010. In 1985 the UK was second only to Sweden for the number of people aged 65 in its population. Britain ranks 15th out of the 27 EU countries, according to official estimates. But . by 2035, forecasts show that the percentage will have climbed at such a . slow rate that Britain will have the fifth lowest number in Europe, . higher than only Slovakia, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Ireland. The . Office for National Statistics has forecast that Britain will have . nearly 17 million people over 65 in its population by 2035, which . equates to 23 per cent of the predicted population. By . then it is predicted that Germany will have the highest percentage of . retired people, with nearly one in three people being over 65. Experts believe the arrival of immigrant workers, many of whom are at the age where they could start families, is set to significantly change the population statistics in Britain. Between 2004 and 2010 more than 1.4 million Eastern Europeans came to work in Britain. It emerged in 2010 that one in four babies born the previous year were born to foreign-born mothers. In a commentary on the statistics, an ONS spokesperson said: 'Over the period 1990 to 2010, the UK aged less rapidly than the EU-27 average. 1985: Nearly three decades ago Britain was second in the EU only to Sweden for the percentage of retired people in its population . 2010: Two years ago around 17 per cent of the UK's population was made up of elderly people . 2035: In the next two decades the ageing of Britain's population is set to be reversed, thanks to increased numbers of immigrant babies . 'One of the contributing factors for this was the relatively high fertility rate in the UK over the last decade compared with countries in central, southern and Eastern Europe. 'There is a greater proportion of women of child-bearing age within the immigrant section of the population, there is a bulge in terms of the child-bearing age and the optimum working age community.' Nick Sanderson, chairman of the Association of Retirement Villages, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The latest ONS Focus on Older People report shows that Britain is ageing. 'This rise in life expectancy highlights that many of us could spend 40 years or more in retirement.

"Anita Grinham, 37, wants to be named to show up police and help other victims of sex attacks . Suffolk Police has admitted that their investigation was flawed . By . Emily Andrews . Last updated at 11:22 PM on 1st March 2012 . Hurt: Distraught Anita Grinham, 37, says her life had been wrecked after she was attacked when her drink was spiked on a night out . A mother has told how her life was left in ruins after police made her feel like a liar when she reported being raped. Anita Grinham told officers she was sexually assaulted in her own home by a man who had spiked her drink in a nightclub. But she says the detectives did not take her allegations seriously and sided with her attacker. Her claims were backed up by an internal inquiry that found key witnesses were not interviewed and the suspect’s house and car were left unsearched. Although a suspect was arrested, the case did not reach court through lack of forensic evidence – another failing in the police investigation. Miss Grinham, who has waived her anonymity to detail her ordeal, said her life was in ruins despite being vindicated by an apology from Suffolk police. ‘I know what happened to me – I was violated in the most horrendous way,’ said the 37-year-old mother of four. ‘Someone raped me and no one’s been punished. But I was made to feel like a liar. My whole life has changed. I went from being bubbly and outgoing to being paranoid and scared. ‘Because of this horrendous experience I lost my business. ‘I now suffer from panic attacks, depression and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Sorry is not good enough. My life stopped when I was raped. I have spent all my time since then trying to get justice. ‘I just hope what I have been through helps change things for other victims.’ Miss Grinham was attacked on a night out with friends in her home town of Ipswich in July 2008 to celebrate the opening of a beauty salon she had set up. Because she was driving, she bought only one glass of wine, which she asked a doorman to look after while she went to the lavatory. ‘I vaguely knew this guy, as I had seen him in my local gym and I thought as a doorman he would be responsible,’ she said. ‘After I finished my drink I started to feel very peculiar – my legs felt funny and my friends said we should go home. ‘Apparently this doorman offered to drive my car home, as I felt awful and my friends had had too much to drink. The next thing I remember is waking up and he was on top of me. ‘I wanted to scream and scream but nothing would come out of my mouth – it was as if I was paralysed. My young children were asleep next door and I was just terrified. Apology: Det Ch Supt Andy Henwood, of Suffolk Police, has said a new structure was now in place for 'allegations of rape are always taken seriously.' ‘I must have passed out as when I woke up again my head really hurt, I was totally naked and he had gone. ‘I was so terrified and distraught I went straight to the bathroom and started scrubbing myself with a nail brush.’ Miss Grinham said her attacker had warned her ‘not to do anything stupid’ after the incident. She defied this harassment and  reported the crime to the police five weeks later. However, the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with charges due to lack of evidence. After making a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, Miss Grinham was told in May 2010 that Suffolk police’s professional standards department would review the investigation. Her complaint was upheld last June when the force apologised. Officers reopened the investigation but could not re-interview the suspect as there was no new DNA evidence. Miss Grinham said the force’s response had made her feel she was being branded a liar. The investigation stated: ‘Forensic opportunities were not considered, telephone evidence not sought, key witnesses not interviewed regarding the connected harassment incident, or re-interviewed in the case of the female acquaintances who had been with the complainant. ‘Equally, searches of the suspect’s home or the car used were not carried out, neither was he re-interviewed after conflicting accounts were obtained from the witnesses.’ While revealing that the officer who interviewed Miss Grinham was trained to deal with rape inquiries, the report states the officer in charge of the inquiry had no specialist training in sexual offences. Detective Chief Superintendent Andy Hendwood of Suffolk Constabulary said: ‘Anita Grinham made a complaint to Suffolk Police via the IPCC in relation to how her case was investigated, which was reviewed by our Professional Standards Department. ‘As a result the PSD made a number of recommendations, which assisted with the new structure for rape investigations. Suffolk Constabulary has created a countywide Gemini Team with specialist rape-trained officers who work with the victim from the outset to ensure they receive the best possible support, advice and guidance. They follow national protocol and best practice compiled from forces throughout the country.’ Earlier this week a criminal justice joint inspection study criticised police in England and Wales for dismissing more than one in ten rape allegations to secure a higher conviction rate and meet targets. It warned that target cultures have put forces under pressure to keep recorded crime to a ‘minimum’ and that foreign rapists could be escaping justice because police are failing to check the background of suspects.","Anita Grinham, 37, wants to be named to show up police and help other victims of sex attacks .

The relatives of those involved in the horrific Ohio car crash that killed three sorority sisters have spoken out about the accident and how students in another vehicle narrowly avoided being killed. Winifred Lein, 69, of Perrysburg, Ohio, was travelling the wrong way on a road for at least seven miles when she crashed head-on into a car carrying five students going away for spring break - killing herself, three of the students and leaving two others in a critical condition. The Ohio Highway Patrol today revealed that the first of two cars, each carrying five Alpha Xi Delta members, swerved to miss the car on Interstate 75 south of Toledo, Ohio, just miles from their Bowling Green State University campus. The second car was not so fortunate. It happened at a crest in the highway and the student who was driving the second car, Christina Goyett, had no warning, police said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:35 PM on 3rd March 2012 . A park official's attempts to calm outcry after he shot and killed a mountain lion by reasoning he ate the cat instead of letting it go to waste, has led to further cries for his resignation. A photo of California's Fish and Game Commission President Daniel Richards posed holding the dead cat shocked many in his home state but Mr Richards claiming to have eaten the cat as well, threw many more over the edge. 'It doesn't taste like chicken,' Mr Richards, 59, recently told conservative talk radio hosts John . and Ken in Los Angeles. 'The closest thing is pork loin. It's a white meat. It's . really good, and actually in frontier times it was a delicacy because it's tough . to bag one of them.' Scroll down for video . Big appetite: Daniel Richards, president of the Californian Fish and Wildlife Commission, killed a mountain lion in Idaho where it's legal but faces outcry in his home state, especially after reporting he ate his catch . Hunting mountain lions in the state of California has been banned for the last two decades while in other states, like Idaho, it's legal. The picture first was posted on the website of Western Outdoor News, the largest hunting and fishing newspaper in California, following his hunting trip in January. It came with his alleged quote: 'I'm glad it's legal in Idaho.' Criticism: Politicians and environmental groups have banded together to call for Mr Richards' resignation from his chair saying he sets a poor example for the rest of the state where the cat's hunting is banned . According to his interview with that paper, he shot the animal to fulfill a long-time goal of his that, in his words, entailed 'the most physically exhausting hunt of my lifetime.' Some in California now question whether Mr Richards is best to serve on the state's commission with the photo adding to a reputation accused by some as being trigger happy and long opposed to certain marine wildlife protection rules and policies to increase nontoxic ammunition. After calls for resignation by the Humane Society, Sierra Club as well as Lt Gov Gavin Newsom and 40 other legislators, Mr Richards bit back accusing Lt Gov Newsom of lobbying for his removal so his own father can receive place within the commission. In attacks against the environmental groups, Mr Richards accused them of trying to ban hunting all together. 'It's . shameful that Mr. Richards has compounded his problems by lying,' said . Chris Garland, the Lt Governor's chief of staff told the San Francisco . Chronicle. 'If . he were smart he'd stop shooting himself in the foot, do the right thing . and . resign.' Biting back: Mr Richards vows to not resign from his position instead describing his meal to a local radio station as tasting similar to pork with his catch not wasted on him . Legislation in California also makes it illegal to bring the corpses of mountain lions into the state - although it was unclear if Mr Richards had done this. Mr Richards, who is a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, assumed the presidency of the Fish and Game Commission in 2008. His term ends next year. Within the legislation that banned the animal's hunting in the state, it also set aside $30 million of state funding until . 2020 to buy up habitat to protect mountain lions and other species. The non-profit Mountain Lion Foundation, which fought for the law to be passed, has also called for Mr Richards to give up his role. 'While technically no laws were broken, California residents are disgusted and calling for Richards' immediate removal from the Commission,' the MLF stated on their website. 'Since Richards proudly and openly defies the priorities of the people he was appointed to represent, clearly he can't be trusted and he needs to go.' Mr Richard has responded by writing a letter that states there is 'zero' chance he will resign.

The rustic zozulica will be a stark contrast to the brightly coloured 3ft long plastic trumpets that blighted the South African football World Cup two years ago.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:56 PM on 1st March 2012 . Two American soldiers were shot dead today by two Afghans including a man believed to be a soldier. The attack was likely to raise further questions about the future of Afghanistan's struggling security forces. NATO said a man in Afghan army uniform and another in civilian clothes opened fire. Under fire: Attacks on NATO soldiers in Afghanistan have become more frequent since the burning of the Koran at a NATO base last month . The killings in the southern Kandahar . province came after two senior U.S. officers were gunned down in the . Afghan Interior Ministry on Saturday, allegedly by a police intelligence . official. Five NATO soldiers have been killed by Afghan security forces since copies of the Koran were burned at a NATO base last month, triggering widespread anger and protests. The killing of the American officers in the Interior Ministry stunned NATO and cast doubt on its strategy of replacing large combat units with advisers, as the alliance tries to wind down the war now in its 11th year. Outrage: There have been scenes of furious protest across the Middle East following the burning of copies of the Koran at a NATO base in Afghanistan . The alliance immediately moved to withdraw all its advisers from Afghan ministries in Kabul. Britain, Germany and Canada then withdrew their officials. The Obama administration would not swerve from plans to move into an advisory role in Afghanistan, said U.S. officials. However Afghan officials were concerned that further attacks by home forces on Western troops could damage ties with NATO. Constant threat: Bloodstains and the remaining clothes of a suicide bomber are seen at the site where he hit a convoy of foreign troops in Helmand province yesterday . According to the Pentagon, some 70 members of the NATO force have been killed in 42 insider attacks between May 2007 and January 2012. Such incidents became more frequent after the U.S. sent tens of thousands more soldiers to Afghanistan to tackle Taliban strongholds. 'There are Taliban sympathizers in uniform inside Afghan security forces who are not in fact sent or recruited by the Taliban,' said an Afghan government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'There are Taliban sympathizers in uniform inside Afghan security forces who are not in fact sent or recruited by the Taliban.' Afghan official . 'Despite tighter vetting procedures, such unfortunate incidents do occur. 'This problem will not go away. We need more time, more resources and manpower.' Some of Washington's partners have shown even greater sensitivity to insider attacks. In January, French President Nicolas Sarkozy suspended training and support operations and announced that France would withdraw entirely by the end of 2013 after four French troops were killed by a rogue Afghan soldier. Dangerous terrain: The U.S. soldiers were gunned down in Kandahar by two men, one wearing an Afghan army uniform . The U.S. hopes Afghan forces will be able to confront the Taliban and handle security on their own before NATO combat troops' scheduled departure at the end of 2014. Insider attacks on NATO troops have deepened concerns about the commitment and effectiveness of Afghan forces.

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Last updated at 1:46 PM on 1st March 2012 . A joke about the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America was cut from Jean Dujardin's new film so that he could win an Oscar, it emerged today. The 39-year-old French star of the silent comedy The Artist scooped the Best Actor statue at the Academy Awards in Hollywood on Sunday. But what many of the Americans voting for him did not know was that he produced and acted in a potentially devastating sketch in Les Infideles (The Players), which he is currently promoting in France. Graphic: The French advertising authorities banned this poster of Les Infideles after complaints that it was degrading to women, but Dujardin apparently feared the deleted 9/11 scene would do most damage to his Oscar hopes. A source close to the makers of Les Infideles confirmed that Dujardin played a cheating French businessman in one of the scenes cut out of the film, which went on show in Paris this week. In the removed extract, the Frenchman had travelled to New York to conduct an affair, while telling his wife that he was working hard in an office in Manhattan. As he is about to seduce his lover in a hotel room, the businessman receives a phone call from his wife and tells her: ‘Yes, yes, my darling, everything is fine!’ Triumph: Jean Dujardin (right) pictured with his wife Alexandra Lamy at the 2012 Vanity Fair Oscar Party . Starring role: Dujardin (left), with Argentine-French actress Berenice Bejo, danced into the Academy's hearts in The Artist. The silent film won three Oscars, including Best Actor for Dujardin, Best Director for Michel Hazanavicius and Best Picture . Meanwhile, the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 can be seen starting outside the window behind him, as a passenger plane flies in to the World Trade Centre. Original news footage was used in the sketch. The source said: ‘Yes, the scene was considered too much for America. It would have been provocative, especially in the run up to the Oscars and other awards.’ Neither Dujardin, nor the official publicists of his film, were immediately available for comment. Les Infideles has already been attacked in France for being shockingly sexist. In a publicity photo for the film, Dujardin grips a pair of naked women's legs open, under the caption: 'I'm going into another meeting'. On the promo trail: Co-stars Jean Dujardin (L) and Gilles Lellouche share a laugh on TV show 'Le Grand Journal' while promoting their new film Les Infideles . Le Parisien newspaper warned before . the Oscars that America 'doesn't joke about this kind of saucy picture' and The Artist could suffer 'collateral damage' from the controversy. What is certain is that Americans never joke about September 11th 2001 - one of the darkest days in the history of the USA. Nearly 3000 people died in the four coordinated attacks by suicide bombers on New York and Washington DC. One of The Artist's competitors for the Best Picture Oscar - which it won - was the 9/11 drama 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close', which many believe had solely been nominated because it was considered a 'patriotic' film. Controversial: Marion Cotillard faced demands that she should return her Best Actress Oscar after saying she doubted the official account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks . It is not the first time that a French Oscar winner has been involved in a 9/11 controversy following an Oscar win. In 2008 it emerged that Marion Cotillard, who had just won Best Actress for her portrayal of Edith Piaf in La Vie en Rose, doubted the official account of the terrorist attacks. Footage from a Paris talk show showed her questioning both the New York attacks, and the 1969 moon landing.'I think we're lied to about a number of things,' said Ms Cotillard. Referring to the destruction of the two World Trade Centre buildings, Ms Cotillard said: 'We see other towers of the same kind being hit by planes, are they burned? There was a tower, I believe it was in Spain, which burned for 24 hours. 'It never collapsed. None of these towers collapsed. And there [New York], in a few minutes, the whole thing collapsed.' Ms Cotillard suggested that the towers, planned in the early 1960s, were an outdated 'money sucker' which would have cost so much to modernise that it was easier to destroy them. Her words - which she later claimed were taken out of context - led to calls for her to give her Oscar back. Franco-American relations over diplomatic matters have been fraught in recent years, mainly because of Paris's refusal to support the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.","Actor seen conducting affair in hotel as he tells wife he is working hard...

"By . Laura Cox . Last updated at 7:59 AM on 2nd March 2012 . It is any family man's worst nightmare. His two daughters are dead. His wife is in jail charged with their murder. But Jose Humberto Taque, of Los Angeles, said he doesn't want the mother of his girls to go to jail, nor does he blame her for the tragedy. One week after taking five-year-old Marian off life support, Mr Taque told the LA Times that he wants Lorna Valle to be given psychiatric help for the anxiety she suffers rather than be locked up. 'She felt like she was going to die,' he said. 'Nobody listened to her'. He claimed his wife had been denied the treatment she needed, citing one instance when she waited for eight hours at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Centre but was not seen by a mental health worker. Tragic: Marian (left) and Lindsay died in hospital after their mom allegedly tried to drown them in a bathtub . Mr Tarque's attourney, Luis Carrillo added that he is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against the county. He said: 'She fell into a profound abyss and didn't return, and that ended in the tragedy with the girls.' Lindsay and Marian’s funeral was held on Wednesday afternoon at Funeraria Latino Americana in East Los Angeles. They lay in small caskets wearing matching white dresses and flower headbands, with their hair in curls. Their bodies had been sprayed with the scent of baby powder. Children's lullabies played as Mr Taque approached the caskets. Over and over, he repeated their names as he wept. 'Mi Lindsay, mi Marian.' Relatives and friends watched a slide . show of the sisters: dressed as princesses, driving a play car, swimming . in a plastic pool. They will be buried in Guatemala. Distraught: Dad Jose Humberto Taque said he doesn't blame his wife or want her to go to jail . Mr Taque said he is still trying to get his head around how Valle could have become so desperate that she killed Marian, five, and her one-year-old sister Lindsay. ‘It's inexplicable,"" he told the LA Times. ‘I don't understand what happened. She always took care of them.’ On Valentine's Day, Valle bought her daughters stuffed teddy bears and balloons. The next morning she allegedly tried to drown them in an infant tub. She was interrupted by Mr Taque who returned to their south Los Angeles home from the grocery store around 7.30am Wednesday morning after going to pick up juice and milk for his daughters. When he arrived in the house, neighbours heard screams of ‘My babies! My babies!’ and police were called.Officers found the scene so distressing that the first responders have been offered counselling to help deal with what they saw. Lindsay was declared dead at the scene. Marian died last week when Mr Taque made the heart-wrenching decision to turn off her . life-support machine. He said he had 'made a humanitarian decision to donate . my daughter’s organs so another person can live.’ Shock: Police suspect that Valle 'snapped' when she allegedly decided to try to drown her daughters Marian, five, and Lindsay, one . Psychiatric: The girls' dad believes their mom suffers from mental health issues and needs help, not locking up . Valle, was charged with their murder and is being held on $1.5million bail. If convicted, she could get 50 years to life in prison. Valle and Mr Tarque met and fell in love in Guatamala as teenagers. The family emigrated to California about ten years ago where Valle worked in a perfume shop and Mr Taque as a gardener. Neighbours described them as hard working and friendly. Now questions are being raised about Lorna Valle’s mental state, and some say that she had appeared depressed in recent weeks. Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health spokeswoman Kathleen Piche told the LA Times the incident was ‘a great tragedy’  but said there was no record of Valle seeking services from the county mental health department. Deputy Public Defender Shelan Joseph, who is representing Valle, said she is looking into whether Valle suffers from mental illness and what services she has received. 'My heart goes out to the family,' she said. Tragic: When police arrived on the scene, both girls were unconscious, and now the officers are being offered counselling to deal with the traumatic experience .","Jose Humberto Taque told of his wife's mental health issues.

A three-year-old girl from America's northernmost community has died after being locked in a freezing bedroom as punishment for wetting the bed. Her younger sister suffered hypothermia after their mother and the mother's boyfriend left them in the room with a window open to a temperature of minus 30 degrees to air out the area. The mother, 28-year-old elementary teacher Esther G. Edwards-Gust, was apparently on the run on Saturday, a day after she and 29-year-old Richard Tilden Jr. were indicted in the child's death. Tilden was in custody. The couple shared a home with Edwards-Gust's 1- and 3-year-old daughters in the Inupiat Eskimo community of Barrow. Imprisoned: Sisters Miley, left, and Macey were confined to a freezing room, leading to Miley's death and Macy's hospitalisation . Fled: The mother, elementary teacher Esther G. Edwards-Gust, was apparently on the run on Saturday . The three-year-old who died is believed to be called Miley, while her younger sister is Macy. They also have an older sister, Sasha, whose whereabouts is currently unknown. Police say the two girls last month were trapped overnight in their bedroom with a window open to temperatures that dropped to 30 degrees below zero. Both children were diagnosed with extreme hypothermia and flown to an Anchorage hospital, where the three-year-old died. Tilden later told authorities he'd been drinking the night before and opened the bedroom window to air out the room because the girls wet their beds, according to court documents. He also said the door's latch was broken, making it impossible for anyone inside the room to open it. Family: Edwards-Gust with her three daughters Macy, Miley and Sasha . Sisters: Miley, Macy and Sasha pose happily for the camera . Punished: Miley was locked in her bedroom by her mother after she apparently wet the bed . A grand jury on Friday indicted Tilden and Edwards-Gust on charges including manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. Tilden also faces second-degree murder and assault charges. He was arrested last month. A warrant has been issued for Edwards-Gust's arrest. Police didn't immediately return a message Saturday, and a home listing for Barrow's police chief was disconnected. A person who answered the phone at the borough jail said Edwards-Gust was not in custody there. Tilden called 911 when he discovered the three-year-old was unresponsive and not breathing February 2. Officers said Tilden smelled of . alcohol when they were at the apartment, court documents said. The news . was first reported by the Anchorage Daily News. Tilden . later said he bought two bottles of whiskey from a bootlegger and began . drinking the night before the children were found in the bedroom with . the open window and broken door latch, authorities said. Two empty bottles were found in the apartment. Freezing: Two young sisters, aged one and three, were locked in a room in Barrow, Alaska. The three-year-old later died, and the one-year-old is suffering from extreme hypothermia . Far north: Barrow, Alaska, is the northernmost town . Tilden also told officers he opened the bedroom window because the girls wet their beds, and he didn't close it before going to bed. In earlier interviews, Edwards-Gust told officers the girls were sleeping in their beds when she went to work that morning. According to the documents, Tilden woke up about 12:30pm on February 2 and noticed both girls needed to be changed after soiling themselves. It was during the changing process that he noticed the older girl was unresponsive. He was arrested the same day on assault charges. After being in police custody for hours, officers said his blood-alcohol level was 0.164, more than twice the legal driving limit. Edwards-Gust, who teaches in Barrow, was briefly in custody after traveling to Anchorage to be with her surviving daughter. Anchorage Police spokesman Lt. Dave Parker said Saturday that Edwards-Gust was initially arrested on assault charges, then set free at the request of the Barrow district attorney. Parker said he believed Edwards-Gust returned to Barrow.","Sisters, aged 1 and 3, trapped in northern Alaska bedroom after mother's boyfriend 'locked them in for wetting their beds'

Kieron-Scott Woodhouse, from Shepherds Bush in London, plans to release his product in the UK and throughout Europe later this year. The 23-year-old, who studies product design at Middlesex University, was frustrated with the lack of variety in the mobile phone market so designed the bamboo handset in his own time. Kieron-Scott Woodhouse, from Shepherds Bush in London, plans to release his product in the UK and throughout Europe later this year . Made from four-year-old organically-grown bamboo, which has been specially treated to ensure durability, the ADzero runs on the Android operating system and is about half the size of an iPhone. Like many phones it will include a camera, but ADzero features . technology called a ‘ring flash’ not available on any current mobile . phone.

Mr Woodhouse was frustrated with the lack of variety in the mobile phone market so designed the bamboo handset in his own time . 'The whole experience so far has been incredible and . completely unexpected. I can’t wait to see my mobile phone in shops this . year.' Mr Woodhouse designed the phone initially just for the Chinese market. He picked bamboo, which must be four-years-old, as it is a sustainable material that can be sourced locally. However, he was surprised to discover many people were fans of his design at London Design Week last year and he decided to publicise his work on the internet. This led to him being contacted by technology entrepreneur Adzero and it will now be sold in the UK. As well as being food for pandas, bamboo is used in Asia for furniture and grows quickly.

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 10:53 AM on 2nd March 2012 . A toddler born with a rare form of dwarfism has been fitted with titanium ribs to stop her body from suffocating her. Jessie Plumpton, two, has Jeunes Thoracic Dystrophy, which has stopped her rib cage from developing properly and puts pressure on her lungs. The youngster underwent two gruelling seven-hour operations at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London to increase the size of her chest. She was then transferred to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Jessie Plumpton who her mother Jane described as 'unstoppable' During the operation a titanium bar was fitted vertically down the middle of both halves of Jessie's rib cage to pry the ribs apart in both directions. Surgeons have performed the pioneering surgery on around 200 children in the U.S. Her mother Jane, 27, said: 'The chest expansion was very traumatic because it was a life or death operation. 'She could have died in surgery. As she gets older, she faces further surgery. Her life expectancy is unpredictable. 'We live every day like it could be our last. She is brilliant. She’s just plodded on and fought. 'Jessie has astonished doctors with her strength and resilience.' Ms Plumpton, from Runcorn in Cheshire, said her daughter was diagnosed with Jeunes in January 2010, when she was two months old. Her older half-sister Jennie Leigh, 9, is not affected. The genetic condition, which affects around one in 130,000 children, puts Jessie at risk from developing life-threatening respiratory infections and possible kidney failure. Jessie is still attached to a ventilator to assist her breathing. 'She needs ventilation wherever she goes because her lungs are under-sized, but developmentally she's bright as a button,' said Jane. Jessie has a form of dwarfism, which stops her rib cage from developing properly . Ms Plumpton currently makes a three-hour round . trip by bus every day to visit Jessie at Alder Hey. 'She has been to hell and back and she’s got through it,' the mother-of-two said. 'She is a little fighter. It’s a dream . come true having Jessie. Doctors are surprised she has made it this far . but I’ve always had faith in her. She is a miracle. 'Nurses say Jessie is a different baby when I walk in the door. Her face lights up. It’s brilliant.' The toddler faces regular operations in the future to expand her chest further as she grows. Ms Plumpton recently moved to a bungalow to make it easier to care for her daughter and Jessie should be home shortly after Easter. The mother said: 'She hasn't been stable enough to come home, but now we've got everything in place for her. 'She is learning to walk and doing brilliantly. 'I am really proud of her. She is unstoppable. It’s the best feeling in the world to have her in your life.' Nagarajan Muthialu, Consultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon, Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: 'This surgery involves expanding the chest wall to provide space for the lungs to grow. This can be done in infancy, or whenever the lungs start to struggle for space. 'Worldwide experience in this surgery is very limited.  Traditionally this procedure was carried out, at intervals, on both sides of the chest. However, having built up experience and expertise at Great Ormond Street Hospital we can now do a single procedure called ‘bilateral surgery’ in which we expand both sides of the ribs and fix them with a metal plate. The child then needs further surgery as they grow. 'This type of surgery has only been carried out at Great Ormond Street Hospital in the UK. It has been shown to offer very good clinical results in the short-term, it reduces the time the child has to spend in intensive care, and leads to faster recovery.  Nevertheless, it is of course a major surgical procedure.'","We live each day like it could be our last, says mother .

Two trains running on the same track collided head-on in southern Poland last night, killing 16 people and leaving 56 injured. The accident, which is the worst train disaster in Poland in more than 20 years, happened late last night on the Warsaw-Krakow mainline in the small town of Szczekociny. President Bronislaw Komorowski said he would announce a period of national mourning for those killed. Tragic: Fifteen people were killed and up to 50 injured when the two trains collided head-on late last night on the Warsaw-Krakow mainline in the small town of Szczekociny . Head-on collision: The crash happened after one of the trains ended up on the wrong side of the tracks and army helicopters were deployed to the scene to race the most seriously injured to hospital . Mangled wreck: Three coaches are reported to be especially damaged, and the rescue operation focused on finding passengers there, although rescue workers ended their search for the wounded early this morning . Investigation: Officials have said it is too early to say what had caused the crash and Polish prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the head-on collision happened . One of the dead was reported to be an American woman. As the severity of the crash became known . army helicopters were deployed to the scene to race the most seriously . injured to hospital while a fleet of 450 emergency vehicles, 100 . policemen and dozens of volunteer firemen clawed at the wreckage. Officials have said it is too early to say what had caused the crash and Polish prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the head-on collision happened. The two mangled trains, comprising 10 carriages in total, were carrying an estimated 350 passengers at the time of the crash. Several of the passengers were foreigners, including people from Ukraine, Spain and France, but none of them appeared to be among the dead or badly injured. A doctor in one of the hospitals, Szymon Nowak, said many of the injured were in a serious condition, with some in artificially induced comas. Officials said they could not rule out finding more bodies as heavy machinery began the task of pulling apart the wreckage. 'After the rescue operation is over, I will take a decision about national mourning because it took place at the border of three provinces and the victims were from all over Poland,' said Mr Komorowski, who visited the scene today. Rescue effort: The two mangled trains, comprising 10 carriages in total, were carrying an estimated 350 passengers at the time of the crash .

Surveying the damage: A fleet of 450 emergency vehicles, 100 policemen and dozens of volunteer firemen clawed at the wreckage . Three coaches are reported to be especially damaged, and the rescue operation focused on finding passengers there. Rescue workers ended their search for the wounded and prosecutors opened their investigation early Sunday. One passenger estimated that his train was travelling about 120km/h (75 mph), when it started braking very sharply. 'Then we felt a powerful impact, and we were thrown about the compartment,' the passenger told TVN24. Andrzej Pawlowski, a member of the board of the state railway company PKP, said in an interview that one of the trains, which was traveling south from Warsaw to Krakow, should not have been on the track. The other train, headed from the eastern city of Przemysl to Warsaw, was on the correct track, Mr Pawlowski said. It wasn't immediately clear how the southbound train ended up on the wrong track. Prime Minister Donald Tusk called the . accident the most tragic train catastrophe in Poland in recent years . after visiting the site in the early hours of today. 'Even more dramatic than the pictures are the facts,' Mr Tusk said. 'This is our most tragic train disaster in many, many years.' David Cameron said tonight he was 'shocked and saddened' by the horrific crash and wrote to his counterpart Mr Tusk to express his sympathy over the horror smash. In a letter to the Polish premier, Mr Cameron wrote: 'I was shocked and saddened by the news of last night's tragic train crash in Szczekociny. 'I have been following events closely, and wanted to send you and the families and friends of those killed my heartfelt sympathy and support at this very sad time. My thoughts are also with those who were injured in the crash and their loved ones. 'I also wanted to express my respect and support for the emergency workers who are involved in the difficult and complicated rescue efforts, and to you for your leadership of the national response. 'The British Government's thoughts and sympathies are with all who have been affected by this terrible tragedy.' Mr Tusk arrived at the scene early this morning, with three other cabinet ministers and said it was too early to rule out human error. Maintenance work was being carried out on one of the tracks where the collision occurred.

Thousands of Syrians are stranded in a district overrun by regime troops, with a Red Cross aid convoy blocked from the area due to booby traps and mines. Syrian government forces took control of the western Homs neighbourhood of Baba Amr, where conditions are said to be 'catastrophic' due to food, water and medical care shortages.

The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it had received reports people had been killed in front of the Co-op, which was also reportedly being used as a prison. Butcher: Syrian President Bashar Assad . The latest reported slayings come as activists claim President Bashar Assad’s troops have been going from house to house in a scorched-earth campaign, backed by relentless shelling. The Red Cross said it had received permission from President Bashar Assad's government to enter Baba Amr. A convoy of seven trucks with 15 tons of humanitarian aid including food, medical supplies and blankets left Damascus on Friday, taking several hours in heavy snowfall to reach Homs. But once they neared Baba Amr, the government prevented them from entering. The Syrian government has not offered its explanation for revoking the permission. The Local Coordination Committees activist network said mortars slammed into the districts of Khaldiyeh, Bab Sbaa and Khader. Abu .

A massive sperm whale carcass is causing a stink after washing up on a Lincolnshire beach. Crowds of interested people gathered to see the 35ft (10.7m) whale today, which was first spotted near the bottom of Skegness Pier yesterday. But they were repelled by the repugnant smell of the animal, which has large gashes across its back and may have been dead for several days.

Emma Burgess, from the council, said: 'Obviously as it is decomposing, the smell is getting worse. 'So we have covered it with sand until we can remove it from the beach, which should be early next week.' Experts believe the whale collided with a boat and could have been dead for several days before finally washing ashore. Naturalist Tony Burgess, who visited Skegness to witness the spectacle, said: ""If they get into shallow waters the weight of their bodies on their lungs makes it difficult for them to breathe. 'It's always so sad when you see a great creature like that dead.' Whales were last spotted on Skegness Beach in 2006, when two bottled nosed whales washed ashore. Male sperm whales are abundant in nearly all of the earth's oceans and undertake vast migratory journeys. But they prefer deep waters to hunt their predominate prey - the deep sea squid. Julie Hamilton, who was visiting Butlins from Leicester, said: ""We came down to have a look because it's a once in a lifetime experience to see such a rare thing but it's really sad. 'I love animals and it's always awful when you see any wildlife destroyed.' Skegness resident Ivan Frost said: 'It's unbelievable - I've never seen anything so large washed up on the beach before.'

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 10:21 AM on 3rd March 2012 . Annemarie Allport says the £3.7 million package she got is 'wholly inadequate' to meet her needs . The widow of a successful racehorse owner and trainer who died after jumping in front of a train is fighting her stepson for a bigger slice of her husband's multi-million pound fortune. Annemarie Allport, 50, says the £3.7 million package she got - including the couple's £2.5 million farmhouse home - is 'wholly inadequate' to meet her needs. Mrs Allport, of Penn, near High Wycombe, says she and her husband, David, had an 'extremely high' standard of living and she had devoted herself to him over 13-and-a-half years of marriage. However, he was a manic depressive and heavy drinker, talked often of suicide and eventually killed himself under a train at Seer Green Station, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, in 2006. He left behind his wife and a son from a previous marriage, Darren, as well as assets worth many millions of pounds, including his successful company, HOH Oilfield Services Ltd. Although he had written a will leaving all but £25,000 of his estate to his wife shortly before his death, the document had not been properly witnessed and was invalid. It meant that his assets were divided up based on an earlier will which Mrs Allport said did not make 'reasonable financial provision' for her. The case reached the High Court last year, when Judge Judith Hughes awarded her a lump sum and property worth about £1.2 million, on top of the £2.5m Penbury Farm home. But now she is challenging the decision, arguing that the judge took a wrong valuation of her husband's oilfield supply company and did not award her enough to keep her financially secure. Kuldip Singh QC, for Mrs Allport, told Court of Appeal judges, Lord Justice Thorpe, Lord Justice Gross and Mr Justice Ryder, that the award was still not fair to the widow. He argued that Judge Hughes had wrongly based her decision on the value of the company being £8.3m, when in fact it also had dispersible cash reserves of £5.5m. It was also important that the judge take into account the lifestyle Mrs Allport had enjoyed before her husband's death when deciding how much she needed in future. 'As the authorities make clear, in the case of the widow of a wealthy man, which is the case here, where the estate can finance it, which it can in this case, reasonable financial provision means the provision of financial security for her throughout her remaining lifetime,' he said. In effect, the judge had decided that - on top of the home, which no one disputed Mrs Allport should have - another £1.2m was reasonable for her, he told the court. 'The award made by the judge is wholly inadequate and, in any event, much or most of it will be required to pay Mrs Allport's liabilities and will not provide any, or any sufficient, security for her. 'The judge wrongly failed to understand that the lifestyle or standard of living enjoyed by Mrs Allport before David's death is something the court must have regard to when determining what amounts to reasonable financial provision for Mrs Allport.'

Mr Allport was a manic depressive and heavy drinker, talked often of suicide and eventually killed himself under a train at Seer Green Station, near Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, pictured, in 2006 . Judge Hughes herself had found their standard of living was 'extremely high', while Mrs Allport had been cross-examined on the basis that it was 'luxurious', the QC said. Mrs Allport had also been a 'battered wife', who had given up her chance of a successful career of her own to be at her husband's side, he continued. It meant she had sacrificed the chance to have her own children, since Mr Allport did not want any more. 'This was a case where David had serious problems,' the barrister continued. Hoh Mike, one of the most successful horses in the string of the late David Allport. Many of Mr Allport's racehorses' names were given the 'Hoh' prefix associated with his company . 'He was not an easy man to live with. He was a manic depressive, who was suicidal for many years. Throughout the marriage, he was a manic depressive, violent, almost an alcoholic, who drank heavily. 'Mrs Allport clearly looked after him and clearly she had contributed to a certain extent, because he himself in the 2006 will decided to leave her all but £25,000. 'The judge simply ignores her contribution.' The appeal judges rejected some of Mrs Allport's grounds of appeal, but adjourned the question of whether the company was undervalued by £5.5 million. No date was set for the next hearing. Mrs Allport's step-son, Darren, who is married with children and lives in the United States, was not formally represented at the Appeal Court hearing.

"By . Beth Stebner . Last updated at 2:29 PM on 5th March 2012 . Postpartum depression is a serious condition affecting women who have recently given birth. But New York theatre scion Eric Nederlander claimed he, too, suffered the baby blues after the birth of his daughter Mira, with his then-wife Lindsey Kupferman, court documents show. After the birth, he demonstrated a string of violent, erratic behaviour, allegedly threatening to smash his wife’s face in and ripping up their baby’s birth announcements after a lengthy fight over credit card bills. Baby blues: Eric Nederlander wrote in an email to then-wife Lindsey Kupferman that he thought he was going through male postpartum depression after the birth of their daughter Mira . Court documents obtained by Page Six magazine detailed Nederlander’s post-baby blues, noting that the couple fought constantly. After ripping up the baby announcements, Nederlander, 46, wrote an email to Ms Kupferman explaining his actions, adding ‘male postpartum depression is probably something I’m going through,’ Page Six reports. He and Ms Kupferman divorced just seven weeks after she gave birth to their daughter. The string of alleged violence doesn’t stop there. Nederlander – better known as the first Mr Jessica Seinfeld - was arrested in January for allegedly smashing his current girlfriend Nancy Okun’s face into the Plexiglas divider of a taxi cab, the magazine notes. However, the idea that postpartum depression affects fathers too has taken root in some parts of the medical community. Violation: Nederlander accused Nancy Okun (left) of cheating on him and proceeded to yank her hair agressively . Dr Will Courtenay, known as ‘The Men’s Doc,’ is a psychotherapist who claims that as many as one in four new fathers suffer from the condition. He told USA Today that signs of the disease don’t manifest in men the same way as they do in mothers. Instead of becoming weepy or lethargic, Dr Courtenay noted that ‘it can look more like irritability, anger, working constantly, or drinking and gambling too much.’ And there is medical information to back him up. In a 2010 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to 14.1 per cent of new dads in the U.S. were diagnosed with the disease. Nederlander’s infamous marriage to Jessica Seinfeld (nee Sklar) ended in only three weeks, after she met Jerry Seinfeld at the gym. The newlyweds had just returned from their honeymoon in Italy. First marriage: Nederlander was famously married to Jessica Sklar for just three weeks. She left him for comedian Jerry Seinfeld after they met at the gym . Seinfeld, star of the popular NBC sitcom of the same name, married Sklar on Christmas Day in 1999, and the two are still together. Ms Okun, 31, told police in January that Nederlander yanked her hair while she was sleeping and said: ‘You’re cheating on me,’ after allegedly looking at her cell phone. A police source told the Post that the 31-year-old felt in 'fear for her own safety'. Nederlander's lawyer Evan Lipton said there was no claim the woman was physically injured and there were 'serious issues undermining the complainant’s credibility'. The most recent incident has the 46-year-old charged with criminal contempt, a felony that carries up to four years in prison. He will next appear in court on April 6.","Broadway scion Eric Nederlander allegedly threatened second wife after birth of their daughter .

A mother who had underage sex with two schoolboys as a reward for them vandalising her love-rival’s car is today facing jail. Davina Travi, 42, broke down in tears as she was ordered by a judge to sign on the sex offenders’ register after being found guilty of having illegal sex with the boys. The mother-of-five had ‘groomed’ the schoolboys aged 13 and 14 before she ‘struck a deal’ with them after she was dumped by her boyfriend for another woman. Travi told the pair that if they smashed-up Stacey Allright’s Peugeot 306 car she would have sex with both of them. And she was ‘as good as her word’ when they returned to her home holding the car number plate as proof they had kept up their end of the deal. Travi first took the elder boy into her bedroom and started having sex with him on her king-size bed before he asked her to stop. The teenager said he stopped after five minutes because it was 'disgusting'. As the 14-year-old walked out of the room he met his friend in the doorway who asked him ‘how was she?’ before sleeping with her. Travi, from Bournemouth, Dorset, denied . charges of having sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 but . was found guilty after a two week trial. In a pre-recorded video interview . played to Bournemouth Crown Court earlier in the trial, the older boy said: 'We kicked one of . the mirrors off and we took the number plate to take back to Davina and . prove that we did it. 'She pulled my trousers down and we had sex. She just had her vest top on, she wasn’t wearing anything else. 'She started leaning forwards and backwards, she kept making sexual noises. 'I started liking it, then I just thought it’s a 40-year-old woman, it’s disgusting, so I told her to get off me and she did. 'She put her clothes back on and went to the toilet.' The boy said the sex lasted five minutes before he asked Travi to stop and that his younger friend entered the bedroom moments later. The . 16-year-old said: 'We saw each other in the doorway. He said ""how was . she?"", I said she was good, in a sarcastic sort of way. He said ""it’s my . turn now"" and walked in.' The jury had heard that Travi and the 13-year-old then began to have sex. The older boy said: 'I could hear them so I walked up to the door, . kicked it open just for a laugh, and I saw him on top of her. 'I could hear them breathing heavily. They were in there probably for a bit longer than me - longer than five minutes.' It was only when the girlfriend of one of the teenagers discovered what had happened that they were encouraged to tell a school social worker what had happened. The court heard in the months leading up to the offences Travi regularly held parties for children, including the two boys, who drank alcohol and smoked cigarettes. Judge Samuel Wiggs told her the ‘overwhelming’ likelihood was that she would go to prison. Detective Inspector Becky Riggs, of Dorset police, said outside Bournemouth Crown Court: 'Travi groomed the boys for her own sexual pleasure. 'She is a dangerous offender who preyed on vulnerable boys. 'This case has had a significant impact on the victims and their families and it is my hope they can now move on with their lives.' The court heard Travi had been in a three month relationship with Daniel Burgiss before he dumped her for Miss Allright. Then in April 2010 Travi arranged for the two boys, who are now aged 15 and 16, to vandalise Miss Allright’s car in revenge. Stephen Dent, prosecuting, said: 'Davina Travi used them to get back at her former boyfriend by bribing them to damage his girlfriend’s car for the reward of having sex with her; a reward that she gave them. 'Davina was as good as her word and had sex with one boy then the other. 'At the age of 13 a lot of boys have hormones coursing through their veins and are perfectly capable and willing to have sex but they are mentally immature. 'They are not able to properly decide whether they should have sex and they are unable to deal with the potential consequences.' Travi denied doing anything wrong and said that due to a medical condition she was not able to have sex. But a jury rejected her version of events. A verdict on a third charge of Travi having sexual activity with a child could not be reached and that is to be left on file. Travi was given conditional bail and will be sentenced at the end of the month.","Davina Travi ordered to sign sex offenders' register .

But, of 40,000 workers who will be allowed to live and work in Europe, Britain has been told it must take 12,000, according to leaked EU documents. Soaring unemployment: 12,000 Indian workers will be allowed into Britain under trade plan - despite the number of people out of work rising . This is far more than any other EU nation - and three times the number which will be permitted France. Even Germany, which has one of the world’s largest economies, will admit only 8,000 workers. The Indian migrants, who can live and work in Britain for six months, will be in addition to people given visas under Britain’s supposedly strict immigration cap. This is despite the EU not normally being allowed to meddle in Britain’s border controls. It comes at a time when UK unemployment is close to a 17-year high, at 2.67million. The negotiations on the India deal - which have been led by Vince Cable’s Business Department - have been going on in the shadows for years. Trade deal: Secret diktat for Indian workers to come to Britain was drawn up when Peter Mandelson was an EU Commissioner . A large number of the beneficiaries will be IT workers, who already arrive in large numbers from India. Sir Andrew Green, Chairman of Migration Watch, said: ‘The (negotiations) are quite clearly against the interests of British workers at a time of very high unemployment. ‘That, presumably, is why the government has been keeping quiet about them. ‘The six month limit, although completely unenforceable, keeps them out of the official immigration figures. However, in practice, this agreement, if signed, would open the door for thousands of new migrants. ‘Of particular concern is our IT workforce - already being undercut by Indian IT companies - which will be put under further pressure.’ The details emerged in a leaked copy of the EU/India Free Trade Agreement, which is due to be signed later this year. It was first initiated by Former Trade Commissioner Lord Mandelson in 2007. The aim is to encourage greater export trade between the EU and India. Central to the agreement is the EU’s offer on what is known as ‘Mode 4’, which will allow Indian companies to bring temporary workers into the EU. The EU has proposed that, overall, 40,000 Indian workers will be admitted without any labour market test as to their impact on the resident workforce. The proposal is for each member state to take a proportion of the EU commitment. The UK allocation of 12,000 is 30 per cent of the total - despite the UK making up only 12 per cent of the EU’s population. Bound for Britain: Under the controversial deal at least 12,000 Indian workers will head to the UK - more than for any other state within the EU . Critics points out that, although the proposed stay in the UK is limited to six months, there are currently no checks on departure nor obligations on employers to ensure that migrants return home. A six month period means no tax or National Insurance will be paid in the UK. The 12,000 is only a minimum commitment, rather than a ceiling. The worker are in addition to the current cap of 20,700 work permits given to non-EU skilled migrants. Instead, the visas would be issued under the -so-called ‘International Agreements’ category of the immigration system. Last year only 453 visas were issued under this route. Ministers are desperately struggling to hit the Prime Minister’s target of reducing net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving in the UK, and those leaving - to the ‘tens of thousands’. Currently, net migration stands close to a record high at 250,000. However, only migrants who move to Britain for 12 months or more are included in this total. This means the Indian workers will never register in the figures. Earlier this week, government advisers said the immigration cap was failing to ‘bite’. The Migration Advisory Committee said only 10,000 migrants have entered the under the cap in the past year. But, at the same time, almost 30,000 non-EU workers have moved to the UK using so-called ‘intra-company transfers’. These allow firms to bring in their own workers who they already employ overseas - effectively by-passing the cap policy. Originally, it was envisaged the transfers - long criticised as a back-door into Britain by campaign groups - would be included in the cap. But, after a turf war between the Home Office and Lib Dem business secretary Mr Cable, they were excluded. Mr Cable protested during a trip to India - where many intra-company transfers (ICTs) originate - and the Prime Minister caved-in. The EU India Free Trade Agreement was initiated by Former Trade Commissioner Lord Mandelson in 2007. It is hoped that improved relations between the EU and India will help countries such as Britain to land lucrative export deals. Last night, a spokesman for the business department said: 'We want to see an ambitious agreement concluded in 2012. This has the potential to be a game-changing deal delivering significant benefits for the UK across a wide range of trade interests. Increasing our trade with emerging economies such as India will be central to the UK's future long term growth - a good agreement will benefit the UK by £2 billion by 2020. 'Negotiations are still underway, and there is no question of us agreeing to anything that undermines the UK Government’s immigration cap. These are highly-skilled short-term service providers, for example engineers, architects or other professionals, who would be admitted temporarily to the UK and other EU countries to provide a specific service on a short-term basis. We have been very clear about these parameters in the negotiation.'","Britain must take more Indian workers than any other nation - and TWICE as many as France .

Millions of pounds in bonuses are expected to be handed out to top bankers at Barclays this week as part of performance-related pay deals agreed up to two years ago. In a move which could spark fresh controversy over City pay, Barclays is thought to be preparing to release millions of pounds of shares to its highest-ranking staff. It comes just a week after the bank was forced to admit two of its schemes, designed to avoid £500million in tax, were shut down by HM Revenue and Customs. Million-pound pay deal: The news has emerged just a week after Barclays (pictured) was forced to admit two of its schemes were shut down by HM Revenue and Customs . The Guardian reported that those in line for a pay deal include Jerry del Missier and Rich Ricci, who run the Barclays capital Investment bank, as well as Robert Le Blanc, head of risk, Antony Jenkins, head of the retail bank, and Tom Kalaris, head of wealth management. They stand to receive up to £7.5million from pay deals that were agreed in 2010, according to disclosures made to the stock exchange. Last year the five became the highest-paid Barclays executives when they shared in a £110million payout, which came from when deals from previous years paid out. Contentious: The move could spark fresh controversy over pay in the City (pictured) Last week, Barclays was prevented from using two ‘highly abusive’  loopholes to dodge paying £500million of tax. The British banking giant - which recently signed a pledge not to engage in tax avoidance - was ordered to cough up the cash by the Government. Barclays, which last month unveiled £6billion of profits, has faced questions for years about the amount of tax it pays. The bank is also disputing the amount of tax it should pay, saying the real figure should be £200m. The Government has now outlawed both loopholes. This is expected to earn it a further £2billion in tax in future years that would otherwise have gone unpaid.","Move could spark fresh controversy over City pay .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 4:33 PM on 5th March 2012 . Quota call: European justice commissioner Viviane Reding . The EU will today unveil plans to force companies to put more women in their boardrooms. European justice commissioner Viviane Reding will announce the first step toward legal targets for the minimum number of females in top jobs. The attempt by Brussels to press for legal quotas on British businesses will prove highly controversial. But, speaking ahead of the publication of her report, Miss Reding warned equality would take another 40 years without radical action. She added that women were running out of patience at being kept from the top table. But Conservative MEP Marina Yannakoudakis condemned the quota as patronising and said women had to get top jobs on merit alone. 'In the UK 100 women were appointed to FTSE-100 and FTSE-250 boards last year and FTSE-100 boards currently have 15.2% female representation,' she said. 'I agree that there is still a long way to go, but these women were selected because they were the best people for the job. Had they made it to the top by virtue of quotas it would have been nothing short of patronising.' EU figures show that only 12 per cent of board members at large listed companies are women, well below the 40 per cent threshold targeted by Brussels. Miss Reding said: ‘It’s no secret that in countries where there are legal quotas [for representation on boards], the figures have grown substantially. ‘In countries without obligatory quotas, progress is slow. I think we’re slowly running out of patience everywhere in Europe. I am not a fanatic about quotas ... but I like the results quotas bring out.’ The justice commissioner has previously called for voluntary targets of women making 30 per cent of board members by 2015, and 40 per cent by 2020. But her report is expected to reveal that progress has been slow in many EU countries. A public consultation will now seek views on the level, timing and scope of quotas, and sanctions for failing to meet them. Legislation proposed by Brussels requires the support of governments representing two thirds of the bloc’s population. Last month, David Cameron refused to rule out the introduction of quotas if business leaders fail to meet Government demands for more females in top jobs. European Commission headquarters: The attempt by Brussels to press for legal quotas on British businesses will prove highly controversial . The Prime Minister said the promotion of women into senior jobs needed to be accelerated and that the case was overwhelming. However, ministers have been reluctant to enforce legally binding targets. Following a review by Lord Davies, the Government has instead set voluntary quotas for business leaders to more than double the number of women in boardrooms by 2015. Ministers have said that firms should employ a minimum 25 per cent of women executives. But Mr Cameron has said that this figure should be 30 per cent. Norman Lamb, Liberal Democrat coalition minister for employment relations, consumer and postal affairs, said: ‘We think getting more women on corporate board is important. ‘But for now, we do not support quotas, nor do we think it’s appropriate for Europe to seek to impose them.’ Business leaders have warned that compulsory quotas would backfire against women. City superwoman Helena Morrissey, chief executive of Newton Investment Management, last month warned that women would not feel equal in boardrooms if their bosses were forced to put them there. Women currently make up just 15 per cent of FTSE 100 directors. Mr Cameron has faced criticism for not appointing enough women. In the current cabinet, which has 23 members including the Prime Minister, there are just five women. Lord Davies last night warned that legal quotas would be a mistake and would ‘raise the temperature’. He told the Financial Times: ‘The reality is that we have insufficient number of women of the executive committees of all British listed companies. ‘That’s something that will take a bit longer to fix, but I think you have to fix the board and then get the CEOs to realise that this is quite an issue.’ Miss Reding, from Luxembourg, is the Brussels commissioner in charge of justice, fundamental rights and citizenship.","European justice commissioner reveals first step towards legal targets .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:38 PM on 29th February 2012 . The mother of a six-year-old boy with meningitis has been criticised after being left to fund a £20,000 pair of artificial legs for her meningitis-struck son following an admin blunder. Archie Barton, six, was due to pick up his latest set of high-tech limbs from a clinic in Dorset this week after growing out of his old ones. But his family were shocked to discover the NHS will no longer pay for the private clinic because the same prosthetics are available closer to their home in Plymouth, Devon. Furious: Nicky Barton said her son could not afford to wait two weeks for alternative NHS limbs as his legs and pelvis will tighten. The NHS funded his first pair of legs from a private centre since 2009 (right) Archie’s mother Nicky, 45, said they have no choice but to pay the £20,000 bill themselves because any delay could harm his progress. She said: 'It’s just a mess, a complete shambles. There’s been a lack of communication and I can’t cancel this now. 'Archie is desperate for new limbs as he has grown so much. The old ones hurt him. 'The new legs have been made and he’s expecting them. He’s been doing so wonderfully. 'Even waiting two weeks and his legs and pelvis will tighten. It’s a lot of money but we will have to find it.' Archie lost his legs due to severe septicaemia after being struck down with meningitis B at 18 months old, and now needs new artificial limbs each year. He also has a severe visual impairment. Struggle: Archie lost his legs to severe septicaemia when he was just 18 months old (pictured) NHS Plymouth has funded Archie’s care at the private specialist centre in Dorset since 2009, after his parents mounted a campaign. They apologised that a letter informing the Bartons of the changes had not reached them before the private clinic told them. NHS Plymouth says Archie can receive an alternative set of limbs from the city’s Disablement Services Centre within two weeks of assessment. Mrs Barton said that was 'too long' to wait for her son, whose prosthetics are hurting him because they are too small. Fiona Phelps, NHS Plymouth assistant director of commissioning, said: 'I’m sorry that Mr and Mrs Barton didn’t receive our letter before they had the phone call from the private provider in Dorset.' She said a letter explaining the decision and inviting the family to discuss Archie’s needs has been sent. Little Archie, pictured here aged 18 months, has fundraised for meningitis charities and met diver Tom Daley . Ms Phelps said: 'Our funding comes from the public purse and so it is good practice to review and check how we make best use of NHS money while continuing to provide a quality service for local people.' Mrs Barton said that she intends to appeal the decision to move her son’s care, adding that the family will have paid for the limbs by the time a letter arrives.

"By . Sam Greenhill and Keith Gladdis . Last updated at 11:05 AM on 5th March 2012 . Families of July 7 bombing victims and soldiers killed by ‘friendly fire’ have condemned the Government’s secret justice plans as a ‘dictator’s charter’. They said proposals to hold inquests and civil cases behind closed doors could rob families of the right to see justice done. They join a chorus of concern expressed by politicians of all parties about Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke’s plan to allow ‘sensitive’ cases to be heard in private. Devastation: The aftermath of after the bomb blast . on a bus in Tavistock Square, London, on July 7, 2005. In future inquests into such terror attacks could be held in private, stopping details being revealed to the public . The reforms, detailed in a Green Paper on justice and security, would grant the state ‘dictator’ powers and allow the security services to hush up their mistakes, said Graham Foulkes, whose 22-year-old son David was killed in the Edgware Road blast on July 7, 2005. Many of the failings by MI5 and the police over the London bomb atrocities could still be shrouded in secrecy were it not for the public inquest. Both organisations had been previously cleared of blame for the bombings by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee. Mr Foulkes said: ‘The Green Paper doesn’t contain adequate safeguards to prevent the state abusing the powers it would have. Killed on 7/7: The father of David Foulkes said . the bill would grant the state 'dictator' powers and allow the security . services to hush up their mistakes . ‘Our experience of MI5 gave us some insight into the ability of MI5 to cry “national security” and the politicians to roll over and play dead. ‘The Intelligence and Security Committee was misled by MI5, so MI5 got away with attempts to hide their errors. ‘Giving agents of the state the powers of a dictator and dressing it up as being in the interests of the state is not right.’ Helen Perry, whose Royal Military Policeman son Michael Pritchard was accidentally shot by a British Army sniper, said: ‘The plans for secret court cases are appalling, the public needs to hear what is said. Many things have come to light that have led to changes such as the lack of body armour for soldiers.’ The inquest into the death of 22-year-old Lance Corporal Pritchard in December 2009 is due to be held in May, before the Government’s plans would come into effect. But Mrs Perry, 49, from East Sussex, is angered that cases like her son’s could be held in secret. She said: ‘I would be devastated if I was denied access to the inquest into my son’s death. It’s essential to me that we get to the truth. I don’t think they have the right to keep this information from me. These new rules aren’t needed. I understand there are certain parts of Michael’s inquest that need to be kept secret because of the nature of his job. ‘But the current rules mean that people can give evidence behind screens or that certain things are heard in private, there is no need for change.’ Adamant: Ken Clarke's Justice Ministry has . defended its proposals on the grounds that security services have been . hamstrung in defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing in open court . Mistakes: Three of the four 7/7 bombers - Shahzad Tanweer, left, Germaine Lindsay, centre, and Mohammed Sidique Khan, right. It emerged at an inquest that some of them were already known to intelligence . Clifford Tibber, the lawyer . representing many 7/7 survivors and families of the victims, said of the . Government’s proposals: ‘It is a shocking idea for so many reasons. ‘The unprecedented openness of the evidence in the 7/7 inquests has improved, rather than harmed, national security. ‘The coroner was able to make recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of the security service. ‘The . Government’s proposals are a cynical, self-serving attempt to defeat . legitimate claims and stifle the revelation of facts to which the public . are entitled. ‘The . Government says that the proposals are the only way there can be a fair . trial when evidence involving issues of national security is involved. While that may be true for the Government, it means that other parties . who are denied access to that evidence cannot possibly have a fair . trial. They will not see or hear the evidence and will not have an . opportunity of testing it.’ Destruction: A Circle Line tube train after the explosion. The 7/7 attack was one of the worst ever terror attacks on British soil, and the worst to hit London . The conduct of the security services was also exposed in the case of Binyam Mohamed, the British resident tortured at Guantanamo Bay. The Government fought and lost a lengthy legal battle to keep secret what a judge eventually called Mr Mohamed’s ‘cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment’. 'Degrading treatment': The Government fought and . lost a lengthy legal battle to keep secret UK security services' role in the torture . of Binyam Mohamed . Clare Algar of the campaigning legal charity Reprieve, which represented Mr Mohamed, said: ‘The real driver for the Government’s plans is not national security, but political embarrassment. ‘They are seeking to abolish the very legal method by which we first found out that Britain had become mixed up in some of the worst excesses of the “war on terror”. ‘The proposals would leave ministers in effect immune from having to answer for their mistakes, so long as they made the claim that “sensitive information” was involved.’ The Justice Ministry has defended its proposals on the grounds that the security services have been hamstrung in defending themselves against allegations of wrongdoing, because they cannot reveal secret intelligence material in open court. But lawyers and human rights groups have countered that there already mechanisms in courts by which ‘sensitive’ evidence can be heard in secret.","Justice Ministry plan would allow 'sensitive' cases to be heard in private .

Sombre welcome: the French ambassador to Syria, Eric Chevallier watches as the coffin of French photographer Remi Ochlik is carried onto an ambulance . Colvin, 56, a veteran foreign correspondent, and Ochlik, 28, a photojournalist, had sneaked into Syria illegally to get an eyewitness view of the government crackdown in the country, where thousands have been killed since a popular uprising began a year ago. But they were trapped inside the besieged Baba Amr district of Homs, a target of heavy Syrian military shelling, and died on 22 February. The attack also wounded journalist Edith Bouvier of the daily Le Figaro and British photographer Paul Conroy, who had been working with Ms Colvin. Yesterday Bouvier and French . photographer William Daniels, who was not injured but also had been . trapped in Homs, arrived in France on Friday after being smuggled . through tunnels and snow from Syria into Lebanon.

Nicholas Frank Prugo spoke softly as he entered the plea under a deal that includes two years in state prison and requires him to testify against the three remaining defendants charged with breaking into the homes of Paris Hilton and Lohan. Prugo and other member of the so-called 'Bling Ring' gang were accused of break-ins that netted more than $3million in jewellery, high-end clothes, art and other goods. Most of the property has never been recovered. Prugo, 21, was initially charged with burgling the homes of Hilton, Orlando Bloom and Rachel Bilson, but those counts were dropped in exchange for his plea. He will be responsible for restitution awards stemming from the break-ins, prosecutor Christine Kee said. 'Nick is doing the right thing,' his attorney Markus Mueller-Dombois said after the hearing.

The plea deals have spared the stars from testifying at trials about the break-ins. However, several appeared before a grand jury in 2010.

A boy of ten who choked on a gobstopper died because an ambulance crew couldn’t  pinpoint his house on their satellite navigation system. Kane Wade was playing in his garden when the sweet became lodged in his windpipe. His parents dialled 999 and, with Kane’s 13-year-old sister watching on, desperately tried to clear the youngster’s throat while they waited for help to arrive. Despite arriving in the road within eight minutes, paramedics couldn’t find the family home on the in-built satnav and lost several vital minutes. Eventually, the ambulance crew found the address but by then Kane had turned blue and stopped breathing. Paramedics spent 20 minutes trying to revive him but, although they managed to restart his heart, he was pronounced dead in hospital several hours later. Last night it emerged that although the road where Kane lived, in Norris Green, Liverpool, was built in 2007, his house had been completed only three months before last June’s tragedy. This meant it was not on the North West Ambulance Service’s satnav system, which is updated annually each September. Kane’s mother, Lindsey Wade, 38, and father, Barry Ismail, 52, a nightclub entertainer, are now taking legal action against NWAS for failing their son, who was autistic and was unable to speak. Miss Wade, who has three other children with Mr Ismail – Nadine, 20, Olivia, 13, and one-year-old Romy – said yesterday: . ‘We were relying on that ambulance. The woman on the phone kept saying “It should be with you”, but there was no sign. ‘We’ve had no other problems. We get post, takeaways, everything – but not an ambulance to save my little boy’s life.’ Anger: Lindsey Wade and Barry Ismail by their street sign. The Ambulance Service couldn't find their home on their computer, despite the address being in the A-Z . Sources at NWAS said a fast-response paramedic and ambulance crew were dispatched at 6.39pm on June 26 last year and arrived at Pennycress Drive, where the family lived, at 6.47pm and 6.48pm respectively. Despite there being just 44 houses in the street, paramedics could not find the home, which is at the far end of a cul-de-sac, until 6.52pm. The delay meant the ambulance missed the target response time of eight minutes by five minutes. Miss Wade said: ‘So many new estates are being built all the time – is the ambulance service saying this risk is there for all those houses across the country?’ She said children playing in the street later reported the ambulance crew parked on a nearby road for several minutes beforehand. Clearly marked: Lindsey points to her street in the 2010 Liverpool A-Z . ‘They could have asked the children where our street was, but instead they just sat there and let Kane die,’ Miss Wade said. The family’s MP, Stephen Twigg, said he would be contacting Health Secretary Andrew Lansley to highlight the problem. ‘Everybody loved Kane, he was such an amazing boy,’ said Miss Wade. ‘He was autistic and could not speak, but he had such personality. ‘My daughters are distraught. It was terrible for Olivia, who he was so close to. She is 13 and watched her brother die in front of her. I’m afraid it’s a trauma that she will never get over.’ An inquest in June last year gave a verdict of accidental death. A spokesman for NWAS said: ‘We offer our sincere condolences to the family for their tragic loss.‘We have investigated this incident fully and shared the findings with representatives of the family.’","Street is on 2010 Liverpool A-Z but didn't come up on ambulance sat nav .

This is a reference to the number of Jews exterminated by the Nazis during World War II. 'Together with the president we want to underline that the DFB will not tolerate such actions and we must act decisively,' said Wolfgang Niersbach, who is due to become the new DFB boss next month. The Israeli embassy in Berlin made a complaint about the abuse suffered by one of its citizens. Seeing red: Kaiserslautern fans light flares during the match against Mainz which they lost 4-0 . 'Racism and anti-Semitism have no place in football. We must defend ourselves against this and we wish that the authorities chase up this incident,' added Niersbach. Police have launched an investigation to identify those involved while the club, which has called on fans to help identify the people involved, condemned the incident saying those responsible were not football fans. 'The players understood the feelings, views and fears of the fans,' Kaiserslautern chairman Stefan Kuntz said on Tuesday on the meeting with the Kaiserslautern fans. Basement boys: Mainz's Nicolai Muller (right) scores past keeper Kevin Trapp (left) to leave Kaiserslautern near the foot of the Bundesliga . 'As a conclusion, it is this meeting with 300 club fans that should be in focus and not the inexcusable behaviour of a handful of radicals.' The display of Nazi symbols, greetings and slogans is banned in Germany and there have been growing concerns since the revelations last November that an extremist right-wing cell calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground lay behind the killings of 10 people, eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman ovder a 13 year period. The German government's own survey revealed earlier this month that anti-Smitism is on the rise, particularly among the young. Last Thursday, on the day that Germany held a day of mourning for the victims of the NSU death squad, a photograph emerged of a masked Berlin policeman giving the Hitler salute on the Facebook social networking site.",Supporters shouted a vile chant about Itay Shechter' joining 'the six million' Jews killed during WWII .

The Spanish matador who lost his left eye in a horrific goring will make a remarkable return to the ring this weekend - wearing an eye patch. Juan José Padilla, now dubbed 'The Pirate', will risk life and limb just five months after he was seen hobbling from a Zaragoza ring covered in blood screaming 'I can't see'. Although he says he is 'fully prepared', he has admitted there will be an added element of danger - as he will not see the bull whenever it brushes past him on his blind left side. Scroll down to see the goring... Back in business: Juan Jose Padilla returns to the ring on Sunday, just five months after he lost his left eye in a horrific goring . Now and then: Juan Jose Padilla pictured (left) in November, and before the goring (right) in 2009 . Padilla, 38, was wounded in October after he slipped on the sand, a bull's horn pierced his jaw and it came out through his eye. The crowds at the Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar bullfight at the Misericordia ring were left stunned. He then underwent a life-saving five-hour operation to repair severe damage to his eye, bone, muscle and skin - his face reconstructed with titanium plates and mesh. On Sunday he will take on his first professional fight, since the goring, in the western town of Olivenza on Sunday. Gored: The bull's horn pierced Padilla's jaw and emerged through his left eye socket after his fight went horribly wrong in the northeastern city of Zaragoza's Fiestas Del Pilar . Risky business: There will be an added element of danger for Juan Jose Padilla as he will not see the bull each time it passes on his blind left side . He said: 'Sunday will feel like a dream come true, after some very hard months, and I’m fully aware that nobody thought I would be back now.' His wife Lidia and two children are said to be behind his lucrative return, but he added: 'My parents couldn't understand why I would want to.' He also revealed he felt 'fully prepared' for the fight and had killed 10 bulls as practice on private farms. It is not the first time Padilla, a popular matador who has won many fans for his courage and willingness to face the toughest bulls, has been gored. Fateful fall: Mr Padilla slips as he turns around from the ball and falls to the floor, giving the bull the chance to strike . Pierced: The bull takes its revenge on Mr Padilla by goring him through his jaw as he lies helplessly on the ground . After: With blood gushing from his face, and his assistants distracting the bull, Mr Padilla is helped from the ring . In 2001 the Jerez native suffered serious injuries to his neck during a fight in Pamplona. His return to the ring comes as the intense debate over bullfighting in Spain continues - with supporters saying it is a key part of its culture and critics claiming it is animal cruelty. The 'spectacle' has come under pressure since the 2007 start of the economic crisis, as public funds to promote fights are cut, and the region of Catalonia banned it in 2011. But Spain's new conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is an avid fan and recently inspired the national television networks to start showing fights again. Coverage had been abandoned in 2006 under the previous Socialist administration.","Matador Juan José Padilla lost left eye in horrific goring in October .

A small group of 'made men' with mob ties are raking in more than $400,000 a year as humble dockworkers at ports in New York and New Jersey, a new report reveals. These longshoremen are being paid for working 24 hour a day, seven days a week -- even though they only show up at work as little as 30 hours a week for their cushy gigs. These huge, inexplicable salaries come as the Port Authority shells out hundreds of millions of dollars in public money to upgrade the ports so goods can continue to flow into and out of the New York area. Mob ties: Two of the high-paid dockworkers are related to crime kingpin Vincent 'the Chin' Gigante (left) The New York Post has named three men with ties to known mobsters who have raked in huge sums of money for working so-called 'low-show' jobs that continue to weigh down New York's ports with unnecessary labor costs. For more than 60 years, organized crime has had a presence in the shady underbelly of the ports. The Waterfront Commission, which issued the report naming the three men, was established in the 1950s because the Gambino crime family controlled the ports in New York and the Genovese family looked after the New Jersey ports. Ralph Gigante is a union shop steward who was paid $406,659 last year, despite having base wages of $36 an hour. He testified that he works as few as 30 hours a week, but get paid whenever any of the dockworkers he oversees are on the job. That's 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Public investment: Terminal operators at Port Newark have received hundreds of millions of dollars in public money for upgrades . Gigante doesn't have to be working and doesn't even have to be in the state to be paid. His sole job duty is safeguarding the . union rights of the workers under him. Despite this, he testified under . oath that he has never read the union's contract in its entirety. And in . 17 years on the job, he's only filed one union grievance, the Post . reported. Gigante inherited the job, which includes unlimited vacation and guaranteed overtime pay every day, from his cousin. Gigante is the nephew of Vincent 'the . Chin' Gigante, a Genovese boss who was once the most powerful mobster in . the country before he was sent to prison on murder and racketeering . charges. Vincent Gingante was the father-in-law of Joseph Colonna, another high-paid dockworker. Last year, Colonna was paid $401,105 for working as a mechanics foreman at APM Terminals at Port Newark. And . Paul Buglioli, whose dockworker father was a friend of Genovese mobster . Nicholas Purina, was paid $474,947 last year to simply manage the time . cards of employees at a Ports of America terminal in Newark, the Post . reported. It requires no special education or training and includes little manual labor. Ralph Gigante, for one, defended his wages. '(His) compensation is determined contractually, and the Waterfront Commission . only brings up his name in this context so they can talk about his . family and other issues that have absolutely nothing to do with him,” his lawyer Gerald Krovatin told the Post. According to the Waterfront Commission, up to 40 percent of dockworkers are being paid without actually doing any work at any given time. Meanwhile, Ralph Gigante's employer, Port Newark Container Terminal, received $150 million in capital improvement money from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey -- the agency that regulates and oversee ports, airports, bridges, tunnels and trains between the two states. APM Terminals, the Dutch company that pays Colonna, received $30 million in public money from the Port Authority and a $144 million loan in 2000. 'At a time the container terminal industry says it is struggling and asking for substantial Port Authority subsidy in our harbor, the industry must help itself by eliminating ""low- show jobs,""' Pat Foye, the Port Authority's new executive director told the Post.","Two of the men are relatives of Vincent 'the Chin' Gigante, a former Genovese crime boss .

A mother has lost parts of both of her legs after she saved the lives of her two children by laying on top of them as a deadly tornado swept through their home. Stephanie Decker, 36, lost one leg above the knee and the other above the ankle, yet her son and daughter escaped without a single scratch after the tornado flattened their Henryville, Indiana home. Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless. Heroine: Stephanie Decker, left, pictured with her husband Joe, has lost parts of both of her legs after protecting their children as a tornado swept through their home, leaving it flattened . But while the Decker family lost their 'dream home' to the severe weather, they are celebrating their safety.

'What I told her was: ""You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up,""' Joe Decker told the Louisville Courier Journal, adding: 'There's no way anybody should've lived.' Decker told the paper that he had texted his wife from his workplace to tell her a tornado was heading for their three-story home. She rushed their eight-year-old son Dominic and five-year-old daughter Reese into the basement, where she lay across them to protect them from the storm. Speaking to the Courier Journal . outside his destroyed home, Mr Decker said his wife, who is using a . ventilator tube, typed out what had happened by using an iPad in the . hospital.

The home, which was partly built by Mr . Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a . bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported.

The lives of NHS patients are being put at risk because vital prescription medicines are being sold abroad by wholesalers and pharmacists for bigger profits. In at least one instance a patient is reported to have died after not getting his drugs in time. Wholesalers and pharmacies can exploit EU rules and sell medicines intended for the UK abroad as long as they have the correct licence. Drugs shortage: Wholesalers and pharmacists are selling medicines overseas for large profits - and not leaving enough available in the UK . Drugs made in this country are produced almost exclusively for the UK market and selling them abroad has created major shortages. But it is possible to exploit the fluctuating exchange rate to make big profits when selling medicines in Europe. New research shows almost half of pharmacists say patients have suffered because of medicinal shortages and over 40 per cent say they have seen a patient hospitalised because of the problem. More than 85 per cent of 322 . pharmacists surveyed by Chemist and Druggist magazine said they were . 'very concerned' that patients were being adversely affected by . shortages. One patient in Staffordshire after he took a week to get the medication he needed for an immune system disorder. Medicine: At least one NHS patient died because they couldn't get drugs on time (file photo) A pharmacist said: 'The patient was very ill . with an immune disorder disease, and it took about a week to get his . medication. By the time we got the drug, he had died.' Another patient from Surrey who had recently had a kidney transplant waited days for here vital anti-rejection medicine. And a schizophrenic ended up self-harming because his drugs took days to arrive. According to IMS Health, a health . consultancy, 11 percent of the 12,600 pharmacies in the UK are now . engaging in the practice of selling drugs for the UK market abroad. A Parliamentary inquiry uncovered evidence that pharmacists and suppliers are taking advantage currency fluctuations and selling drugs abroad for profit. Manufacturers claim they are making 'more than enough' drugs to meet the demands of high street pharmacies. In one example a wholesaler was able to buy enough of one particular drug to supply the whole UK for five years. Until a Government crackdown even NHS hospitals were wholesaling drugs for profit. The Royal Surrey Hospital at Guildford made £300,000 on sales of £4million in one year. A recent independent study showed that a significant number of companies supplying drugs to the NHS are also involved in selling drugs meant for UK patients abroad. Marian Wilkes, a breast cancer patient who has been on the drug Armidex since cancer treatment in 2007, said she had struggled previously to get a continuous supply of her drug which needs to takes regularly to prevent the recurrence of her disease. A teaching and education consultant from Thame, Oxfordshire, she has at times had to tour pharmacies in her area to scrap together the drugs she needs. She said: 'It puts a huge amount of stress on you and one of the worst things for anyone with cancer is stress. 'I don't want to get a recurrence of my cancer - but if you miss out on your drugs, that leaves an opening for it to come back.' Graham Phillips, owner of the Manor Pharmacy in Wheathampstead, Herts, said that a schizophrenic patient harmed himself after being unable to get hold of his medication for four or five days. He said: 'The drug was unobtainable and no other pharmacy had it. By the time we got it, the patient had self-harmed.' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said access to prescribed medicines was 'a basic right that all patients should be able to expect'. The Department of Health insisted it couldn't stop the trade. A spokesman said: 'It is vital organisations in the supply chain stick to the best practice guidance that was agreed in February last year. 'The Government monitors medicines supply closely and continues to work to ensure that NHS patients receive the medicines they need, when they need them.' The All-Party Pharmacy Group announced in November that it was holding a full-scale inquiry into the scandal.","85% of pharmacists were 'concerned' about drugs shortages .

The Syrian regime today vowed to 'cleanse' a rebel-held district in the besieged central city of Homs after nearly four weeks of shelling. Government troops amassed outside the embattled neighbourhood of Baba Amr, raising fears among activists of an imminent ground invasion that could endanger thousands of residents, as well as two trapped Western journalists, who have been under heavy bombardment. The latest advance comes after helicopter gunships yesterday opened fire on civilians, activists claimed, as the brutal crackdown on Homs rebels continued for a 25th day. In response to the latest developments, Britain has withdrawn its diplomatic staff in the country and closed its embassy in Damascus.

Foreign Secretary William Hague made the decision last night after it was decided the 'deterioration in the security situation' had put their safety at risk. Mr Hague urged those fighting for President Bashar Assad's regime to lay down their arms. In a written statement to Parliament, . Mr Hague stressed the decision to withdraw embassy staff 'in no way . reduces the UK's commitment to active diplomacy to maintain pressure on . the Assad regime to end the violence'. In Homs, snow blanketed the city, slowing a ground assault that began yesterday and is nearing Baba Amr, but also worsening the misery of residents short of food, fuel, power, water and telephone links, activists said. It today emerged that a Spanish . journalist who had been stuck in Homs has escaped to Lebanon, the second . foreign reporter to do so - following Sunday Times photographer Paul . Conroy - since a government rocket attack last week killed Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik and wounded Edith Bouvier and Conroy. The fate of the foreign journalists . has drawn attention to Homs, which has emerged as a key battleground . between government forces and those seeking to end the regime of the . authoritarian President Bashar Assad. The government's increasingly bloody attempts to put down the 11-month uprising have fuelled mounting international criticism. President Barack Obama summoned Syria's senior envoy in the U.S., Zuheir Jabbour, over the Homs offensive. The . State Department's top diplomat for the Middle-East, Jeffrey Feltman, . expressed his 'outrage over the month-long campaign of brutality and . indiscriminate shelling' in Homs. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told members of Congress on Tuesday that Assad could be considered a war criminal.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:09 PM on 5th March 2012 . A 13-year-old boy charged with robbing and assaulting an 11-year-old who later committed suicide has been found not guilty. The accused boy, who has been unnamed because of his age, was acquitted today in Oshawa, Ont., on charges of assault causing bodily harm and robbery. Police . had alleged the suspect slammed Mitchell Wilson's face and teeth into the . sidewalk while stealing his iPhone in Pickering in November of 2010. Scroll down for video . Acquitted: A teen accused of beating up and stealing from 11-year-old Mitchell Wilson (pictured) leading to his suicide in 2011, was acquitted from his charges today . Mitchell, who suffered from muscular dystrophy, killed himself last September, the day he was subpoenaed to testify in the case. The Crown could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused boy - who was sent to another school following the attack - was the one who had attacked Mitchell that day. Mitchell had produced oral and written statements identifying his attacker prior to his death, but how reliable they were was under question. 'The case law on eyewitness evidence . consistently states that even when an eyewitness is honest and credible, . as I’m sure Mitchell Wilson would have been, these witnesses are often . mistaken because of how the brain functions,' Justice Mary Teresa Devlin told the court Monday, according to the Toronto Star. Bullied: Mitchell suffered from muscular dystrophy provoking attacks from local bullies who made him fearful to go to school or take the walks encouraged regularly by his doctor to get better . 'I hope that one day, the youths responsible for these crimes will have . the courage to come forward and take responsibility for their . wrongdoing,' she said as part of her final statement before the room. Outside the courthouse, Mitchell's family expressed their disappointment in the verdict. 'The law is the law,' said Craig Wilson, the boy's father to the Star. 'I know Mitchell was 100 per cent sure in his mind. I like to think that is the truth.' Evidence: Written and oral testimony by Mitchell prior to his suicide was found not reliable enough by the court though the boy's father Craig Wilson says he is keeping his son's side of the story as the truth . Mitchell's grandmother Pam Wilson had earlier said that . his family 'don't want to be a lynch squad' and are only trying to help . the attacker have a better life. 'He's a child, just like Mitchell,' family friend Anne Oakes told the Star Monday. Family had hoped, however, that through a guilty verdict the accused teen would have received some help or community service, making him more understanding of those with disabilities. His father had said that it was because of his son's disability, diagnosed a year ago and three years after his mother's death from cancer, that led to his bulling at school. Disappointment: Family of Mitchell expressed disappointment after the verdict today while his grandmother Pam Wilson earlier said they 'don't want to be a lynch squad' but hope the alleged attacker is helped for a better life . Conclusion: Concluding the trial, the court's judge said she hopes one day the boy's attackers will one day come forward and take responsibility for their crime . Realizing his inabilities to defend himself against his attacker, his father says the boy once apologized to him in embarrassment. 'He realized how weak he really was and how he was unable to defend himself. Being a young man, he was a very proud kid and the fact he couldn’t defend himself in that situation hurt his self-esteem, irreparably,' Mr Wilson said. Doctors had told Mitchell his muscular . dystrophy could be helped by walking outside, but he was scared of doing . this after the attack. Mitchell was found by his father after committing suicide in his bedroom on the day he was to start at a new school.

In November last year he announced he and his wife Kath were to separate after 20-years of marriage. The officer was discovered dead inside his home in Blyth, Northumberland in a suspected suicide on Wednesday night. The father-of-two had struggled to come to terms with his blindness and had posted a series of worrying tweets about his own death just days before he was found.

The body of missing Wisconsin college student Eric Duffey has been found in the Wisconsin River after an exhaustive search involving 150 volunteers. Duffey, 21, disappeared early on Saturday morning having been out celebrating his birthday with friends at Joe's Bar. He was last seen at about 1.15 am leaving the bar and is thought to have been heading for his residence or that of his girlfriend. Scroll down for video . Birthday: Eric Duffey, a student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, was last seen Saturday morning leaving a bar after a night celebrating his 21st birthday . Stevens Point Sgt. Dan Wheeler said officials removed Duffey’s body at around 1.10 pm this afternoon from the river, which goes through the city about 110 miles north of Madison. The coroner's office made a positive identification after meeting with Duffey's family. Firefighters on boat and a diving team had been searching for any sign of Duffey in the river. Stevens Point assistant police chief Brian Kudronowicz said emergency personnel including the Civil Air Patrol had been scouring a part of the river where the ice becomes open water. He said it's not far from where Duffey was last seen. Celebration: Duffey and his friends had been in Joe's Bar having a night out to celebrate his 21st birthday . Kudronowicz said the department had received new information that led officials to believe Duffey walked into the Wisconsin River, adding ‘I think alcohol had something to do with his actions.’ But Duffey’s father Darren told WISC-TV: ‘I know that they were drinking, but it doesn't sound like they were drinking heavily. It wasn't like they were doing 21 shots or anything like that.' Sgt Wheeler said that information included a witness who came forward and said he heard someone yelling for help at about 1.30 am Saturday near the Clark Street bridge. But Wheeler said the witness didn't see anyone when he checked. Exhaustive: 150 volunteers joined in the search for Duffey after he went missing in the early hours of Saturday morning . Police sent a Code Red Alert out Saturday evening and again on Sunday morning. With the alert, police asked residents between downtown Stevens Point and Duffey's residence to check their property for signs of him. The official search was suspended Sunday evening, but police, family and friends continued to search neighborhoods near the campus. Several college-age men around Wisconsin have disappeared after drinking heavily at taverns only to turn up dead in local rivers over the last decade. Tragic: Police said they do not suspect foul play. Duffey's body was found in the Wisconsin River on Monday .

"By . Jack Doyle . Last updated at 1:11 PM on 5th March 2012 . Nearly 850 registered sex offenders are on the run from the police, it emerged yesterday. Nearly 700 of them have been missing for more than a year,  and one has been at large for nearly a decade. The total means the number of  perverts who have vanished from the radar has more than doubled in just two years. Slipped through the net: Serial rapist Peter Chapman, left, had been off the police radar when he went on to rape and murder trainee nurse Ashleigh Hall, 17 . The figures raise serious concerns about the extent of police checks on criminals placed on the official Sex Offenders’ Register, and efforts to find them once they have absconded. Victims’ groups said the register was ‘out of control’ and warned that sex offenders were getting away with staying ‘underground and undetected’. Anyone given a jail sentence of 30 months or more for a sex crime, ranging from repeated indecent exposure to rape, is automatically placed on the register for life. There are now more than 37,000 names on it. Those on the register are required to tell the police if they change  their address and can be subject to regular checks. But figures show that on September 1 last year a total of 843 had  disappeared. Of those, some 690 had been untraceable for more than 12 months. On the same day in 2009 there were just 356 registered sex offenders at large, fewer than half the 2011 number. The numbers at large for more than a year have also more than doubled. Two years ago the total stood at 260. Now the figures released following a Freedom of Information request to the National Policing Improvement Agency show more than one in 50 of all those on the register are missing. Separate figures reveal that 57 registered sex offenders were charged with a further offence last year. An example of an offender who disappeared was serial rapist Peter Chapman, who was off the police radar for seven months after his monitoring level was downgraded by the authorities. He went on to rape and murder 17-year-old Ashleigh Hall after contacting her on Facebook. Chapman posed as a teenager on the internet to lure the trainee nurse to her death. He was jailed for life in 2010. Lynn Costello, of Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, said: ‘The figures don’t surprise me because nobody has really had a control of the sex offenders register since it was brought in. ‘These people are offenders who want to move around and remain underground and undetected. ‘But all the blame for this cannot be put at the doors of the police. How many paedophiles can be tracked down when the police are being asked to do so much paperwork?’ Despite the huge numbers of criminals at large, barely a handful of sex offenders are listed on police wanted websites. The ‘Most Wanted’ page of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) website shows the details of just two missing child sex offenders. Wanted: Jason Waller, left, and Stephen Clare, right, are the only two missing child sex offenders listed by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre . Jason Waller, 35, has been missing for four years. He was sentenced to three years for assaulting three children, but disappeared in 2008. Stephen Clare, 40, has been off the radar for nine years. He was jailed for sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl and taking indecent photographs in the 1990s. He served 18 months and was released from jail in 1998, when he moved to Brighton. Police said decisions on whether to publicise individual offenders would depend on the circumstances in each case, and work was being done behind the scenes to hunt offenders down. Cumbria Assistant Chief Constable Michelle Skeer, spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers on the management of sexual offenders, said monitoring was working and fewer serious offences were being committed by dangerous offenders. She said: ‘The UK has some of the most effective techniques in the world to manage registered sex offenders.’ From next year sex offenders put on the register for life will be able to appeal to have their name removed, following a human rights ruling. At the same time, ministers have pledged to impose closer checks and close loopholes in the law. In future sex offenders will have to inform officers if they begin living with a child under the age of 18, and if they change their name by deed poll. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Home Secretary Theresa May has made clear her priority is protecting the public from predatory sex offenders and the Government is doing everything it can to tighten the law. ‘We have consulted on strengthening notification requirements for registered sex offenders. ‘We will be making an announcement on these measures shortly.’","Nearly 700 sex offenders missing for more than a year .

A young couple and their four-month-old baby have disappeared from their home in a small town leaving their belongings behind, authorities said. Timothy Medsker, 33, wife Sabrina, 34, and baby son Joshua have not been seen since February 12 in Petoskey, Michigan. Mr Medsker runs a successful cleaning business in the town and was known to work 70 to 80 hours a week. He had failed to show up for client meetings on February 16. Mystery: Timothy Medsker, wife Sabrina and four-month-old son Joshua haven't been seen in their home town of Petoskey, Michigan since February 12 . Such behavior was extremely out of character for Mr Medsker as he was never late and did not miss work appointments. Petoskey Director of Public Safety John Calabrese told MailOnline that the case 'is very frustrating and the family is obviously very concerned'. Director Calabrese said it appeared that the family had left home in a hurry when their residence was investigated for clues of their disappearance. Although the new parents have not been in contact with anyone they know, there was no evidence of foul play and their silver Ford pick-up truck was also missing. 'There's not a whole lot we can do because as far as we know at this point, there has been no crime committed,' he told MailOnline. Relatives reported the family missing on February 23 after being contacted by concerned customers. The Medskers, who were described as 'very private', reportedly have family in Orlando, Florida.

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 5:12 PM on 28th February 2012 . Nick Clegg was accused of 'working . against' his Coalition partners last night after he demanded yet more . changes to the Government's troubled NHS reforms. The Deputy Prime Minister has got . David Cameron's agreement to a string of amendments after first signing . off the legislation when it was originally introduced and then obtaining . a series of changes last spring. Mr Clegg said that if the latest . changes, which will limit competition and the role of the private . sector, are approved by Parliament the reforms should be 'allowed to . proceed'. NHS treatment transformation? Nick Clegg (right) is trying to placate his party for supporting the controversial NHS Bill . The concessions agreed by the Prime . Minister will help the Lib Dem leader survive his party's spring . conference next month which is likely to be dominated by angry demands . from anti-privatisation activists. But Mr Clegg's behaviour was called . 'outrageous' by Tory backbenchers who said he should be bound by . collective Cabinet responsibility. The changes were announced in a letter . from Mr Clegg and Lib Dem peer Shirley Williams. It was sent to all Lib . Dem peers and MPs as the House of Lords reconvened to debate the Health . and Social Care Bill. The controversial legislation will . give GPs control of most of the NHS budget and open up the Health . Service to greater competition from the private and voluntary sector. Mr Clegg and Baroness Williams said . competition in the NHS must be in the 'interests of patients and not . profits', adding: 'Given how precious the NHS is, we want to rule out . beyond doubt any threat of a U.S.-style market in the NHS. Prime Minister David Cameron speaks, as Mr Lansley looks on, during a round table discussion on the proposed NHS reorganisation at Downing Street last week . 'That is why we want to see changes . made to this Bill that have been put forward by our Liberal Democrat . team in the House of Lords to make sure that the NHS can never be . treated like the gas, electricity and water industry.' Mr Clegg said the . five changes he wants are his party's 'final' demands. They will reduce the remit of the . Competition Commission, require foundation trusts to put patients' interests first and get permission from their governors before carrying . out extra private work, and force members of clinical commissioning . groups to declare all financial interests. Deputy PM evokes Arab Spring in his drive for Lords shake up . Another amendment is designed to . insulate the NHS from the full force of European competition law to . prevent private takeovers of hospitals. Mr Clegg's language in the letter is . in stark contrast to the way he talked about the health reforms at the . start of the Coalition. Increasing competition in the health service brings benefits for patients and boosts productivity, according to a new report. The centre-right think-tank Reform published 10 case studies from around the world showing how a 'radical change in the delivery of healthcare can result in improved quality and productivity'. It said competition allows new organisations to run services better, more efficiently and often at a lower cost. And it argued the Government must defend competition clauses in the Health and Social Care Bill as it passes through Parliament. In examples from the US, the study says competition can cut hospital admissions and costs. 'In Rhode Island, a private company, Beacon Health Strategies, has created an integrated care pathway for mental healthcare services, which were previously highly fragmented,' it said. 'In one year the cost of mental healthcare hospitalisations for children was cut by 20 per cent.' In summer 2010 he signed the foreword . to the White Paper outlining the original reforms. And when the Bill was . introduced to Parliament he described them as a 'fusion' of the best of . Lib Dem and Tory principles. But when Lib Dem activists rebelled at . their spring conference last March he changed his tune, demanding a . 'pause' in the progress of the Bill and a 'listening exercise' with NHS . staff. This led to a raft of changes, after which Lady Williams and other Lib Dems declared themselves satisfied. However, rumblings from party . activists and peers in advance of this year's spring conference appear . to have forced Mr Clegg to demand more concessions. A Whitehall source said Health . Secretary Andrew Lansley was happy with the changes. It has yet to be . decided whether Tory peers will be pressured to vote for the new . amendments. It appears Mr Clegg's letter came as a . surprise to many of his Coalition partners. Some observers say, . however, it was a stage-managed enterprise to put him in a better light . with his grassroots. In the morning, the Prime Minister's . spokesman said they did not see the need for any 'significant changes' to the Bill, while at lunchtime Tory health minister Simon Burns . insisted the whole Government backed the Bill 'as amended now'. But in the afternoon, Mr Cameron's spokesman revealed he had agreed to the changes the Lib Dems wanted. Tory backbencher Priti Patel said: 'It . is outrageous that Nick Clegg is being allowed to do this. He is a . member of the Cabinet and he should be signed up to collective . responsibility. 'He should be putting the case to his . Lib Dem colleagues as to why we need this Bill. He should not be . actively working against the Government. It is not good enough that . David Cameron is going along with this.'","Lib Dems are opposed to both increasing competition and giving 'favours' to the private sector .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:00 PM on 5th March 2012 . Handyman Joseph Gentz was arrested today, more than a month after he walked into a Detroit police station and admitted to killing marketing executive Jane Bashara. He was released last month after police claimed they not find enough evidence against him. His release was yet another bizarre twist in the murder mystery of Ms Bashara, who was found dead in January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home. Gentz, who was ushered into the Macomb County Circuit Court Friday afternoon, was charged with First Degree Murder as well as Conspiracy to Commit murder, and will be held without bond. Arrested and charged: Joe Gentz, right, stood with his attorney Don Aubrey last month. He was arrested last Friday and charged with the murder of Jane Bashara . Not free anymore: Joseph Gentz was arrested and charged with murder a month after he admitted to . murdering Jane Bashara. He claimed he was hired as a hitman by Mrs . Bashara's husband Bob . Gentz was already wearing blue prison . attire at the time of his arraignment Monday afternoon. CBS Detroit’s . legal analyst speculated that Gentz’s arrest would by no means be the . last in this case. ‘Conspiracy means by definition, some . other person. I cannot conspire with myself to commit murder. I need . somebody else. And the big question of the day: Who is that person?’ Ms Bashara’s husband Bob, 54, has . been in the public eye for his place in the murder, for one because . police discovered a secret S&M dungeon in one of Mr Bashara’s . properties, and more significantly because Gentz told officers that Mr . Barshara requested the hit on his wife. Mr Bashara, who remains a person of . interest, maintains his innocence. Last month, he told ABC News . exclusively: ‘I did nothing wrong. I didn’t commit murder. I didn’t pay . to have my wife killed. I’m going to see this through to the end. And . I’m innocent.’ Meanwhile, Gentz remains in jail, and pending a competency evaluation, will appear in court March 16 for a preliminary exam. Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair . Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . When police first began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported. Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder. Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible. Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death. Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family. 'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press. Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t . around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Mr Bashara told 7 Action News. 'As . 9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more . people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard . from her and they hadn’t. 'I . had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I . involved the police because I was concerned there might be something . wrong.' After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing. 'Accomplice': Joe Gentz told police he was paid less than $2,000 to murder Jane by her husband . Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to a run-down version of Detroit . Speaking to the Detroit Free Press last week, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and . did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere. 'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through . in the last moments of her life.' Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company. The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities. 'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'

Michael Strange was a respected scout for Durham County Cricket Club, tasked to seek out and train talented young players. He was also employed as a club captain and coach at Bill Quay Cricket Club in Gateshead. Michael Strange was jailed for six years and the court said he had been leading a 'double life' while being 'admired and respected' for his cricket career . Newcastle Crown Court heard the 52-year-old, who was regarded as an expert by many, used his position as a trusted mentor to subject three boys to sickening sex attacks. He was convicted of seven charges of indecent assault and one of indecency with a child after a trial, during which his victims had to re-live their experiences in court, earlier this year. Judge Roger Thorn said Strange had been leading a 'double life' while being 'admired and respected' for his cricket career. He gave Strange a lifelong sexual offences prevention order which bans him from attending cricket matches involving male youths. Strange must sign the sex offenders register for life and will be banned from working with children for life. Michael Strange was a respected scout for Durham County Cricket Club, (pictured) tasked to seek out and train talented young players . The judge said: 'The jury clearly found that you had lied and lied and lied.' The court heard Strange, of Wardley, Gateshead, had been well liked and respected by those who knew him and continues to deny any wrongdoing. Prosecutor Julian Smith told the court: 'He was a mentor and guide to all three complainants and he was a man with some influence and would have been seen as important by these young men. 'With each complainant Strange befriended them, complimenting then on their cricketing prowess. The judge at Newcastle Crown Court said: 'The jury clearly found that you had lied and lied and lied.' 'He would, when they were alone, show them pornography and would give them alcohol. 'He would get them on their own, either in his car after offering them a lift . home, or stopping at his own home as he was taking them home. Once they were on their own he would sexually assault them.' The court heard the three victims were aged around 12 and 13 when they were abused by Strange in the 1990s.

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 1:06 AM on 28th February 2012 . Given that some own an iPhone before they have even left primary school, you would have thought today’s little girls would dismiss dolls as rather old-fashioned. Not so. Doll sales have soared by 23 per cent in the past year – way ahead of the general toy market – and are now worth £120million. Girls aged eight to 11 have fuelled the resurgence, with Barbie in particular enjoying something of a revival after several years of decline. Barbie is back: Doll sales soared 23% in the last 12 months and are now worth £120million as girls aged eight to 11 fuelled the resurgence . Just five years ago Mattel’s classic doll, introduced in 1959, was being hugely outsold by rivals such as the controversial Bratz dolls. But today Barbie’s various incarnations occupy six of the top ten slots in sales of fashion dolls – as opposed to baby dolls, such as Tiny Tears – while Bratz have fallen out altogether. In 2009, Barbie’s makers prompted criticism when they tried to update her by giving her tattoos. But her latest incarnations have been rather more innocent, often with a puppy or fashion theme, and enormously successful. Figures from analysts NPD put sales of fashion dolls at £120million last year, up 23 per cent on the year before. That’s the equivalent of 15million dolls. Their popularity was confirmed by Sainsbury’s, which reported a 36.6 per cent increase in fashion doll sales last year. Through the ages: A Barbie doll from 2009 sports a tattoo on her right arm in an attempt to revive the brand (left). A superstar barbie from 1977 (right) as she celebrated her 50th anniversary . Despite Barbie’s success, the biggest sellers are a range of dolls called Monster High, which are hugely popular in the U.S. They tap into the popularity of vampire books and films, such as the Twilight series, with characters called Draculaura, Clawdeen Wolf and Frankie Stein. Frederique Tutt, of NPD, said: ‘The fashion-themed dolls category has always been an all-time favourite for little girls. Some 47 per cent of sales are directly requested by the recipient. ‘Growth came from all age groups in 2011, but even more so from the fickle eight to 11 [age range]. This age group is usually attracted by other categories such as fashion, accessories [and] video games and toys can be perceived as “babyish”.’ She added: ‘Barbie struggled to reinvent herself a few years ago, when Bratz became popular, however she is now seeing a resurgence across all age groups.’",Five years ago Barbie was being massively outsold by rivals .
"By . Lauren Paxman . Last updated at 12:54 PM on 2nd March 2012 . A couple who tragically lost a baby daughter when their twins both got killer meningitis are overjoyed after having twins again. Julie and Brian Backhouse are thrilled after giving their three-year-old son Lukas a new little brother and sister, Jamie and Amber. Julie, 39, said last night: 'We are very lucky - and very happy.' 'Over the moon': Lukas, 3, left, with his parents Julie and Brian and twins Jamie and Amber . The family's lives were torn apart in January last year when 23-month-old Lili and her twin Lukas were struck down by deadly brain bug meningitis. Courageous Lukas fought the disease and survived, but Lili sadly died, leaving the family devastated. Now Julie and Brian, of Rainham, Essex, are battling to raise awareness of the lethal illness so others might not have to suffer the same heartbreak. Housewife Julie said: 'We went back to the clinic and were lucky enough to have twins again. Lukas was diagnosed with meningitis just hours after his twin sister, Lili, was in January last year . 'We are very fortunate. 'We hadn't planned to have kids again but losing our daughter meant that we lost our perfect family.' The mum-of-four added: 'Our son wasn't born an only child and we thought that he shouldn't have to live as an only child.' The Backhouses rushed stricken Lili to Queen's Hospital, Romford, in January 2011. The critically ill baby had refused her milk for the first time ever and had been making strange moaning sounds in the night. She also had a soaring temperature and looked grey. But hospital medics failed to diagnose meningitis and told BT engineer Brian, 48, and Julie to return in a few hours if the toddler had not improved. The frantic couple dashed back with Lili after a rash broke out all over her tiny body. But it was too late as deadly septicaemia had already set in. Later that nightmare day, Lukas was diagnosed with meningitis too. The seriously ill little boy was kept in hospital for a week as he fought the disease, before eventually being cured with antibiotics. 'He's really over the moon about having a new brother and sister,' Julie said, before adding: 'He really misses his twin. 'We have pictures of her which he looks at whenever he likes. 'I think that's helped him cope in the last year.' The couple - whose sets of twins are both a result of IVF treatment - are backing a campaign by Meningitis UK to encourage parents to trust their instincts and to keep pushing doctors if they think their child has the terrifying disease. Sorely missed: Lili, front left with her twin, Lukas, and her parents before disaster struck . They have also launched a fundraising drive for the charity in Lili's memory. 'I knew something was seriously wrong with Lili that day but I was told to come back later if she still wasn't well - so I thought there was time,' stressed Julie. 'The campaign is about encouraging parents to not feel afraid to ask for a second opinion.'

Further vicious allegations in the public Christie Brinkley-Peter Cook divorce saga have emerged, with Cook accusing the supermodel of 'throwing her family under a bus' to raise her profile. In a TV interview he hit out at the former Sports Illustrated model, saying that by broadcasting her ongoing child custody battles in the media, she is harming their children. Cook told ABC News he believed she was throwing her family 'under the bus' to drum up publicity for her return to Broadway.

Glamorous: Model Christie Brinkley pictured at a fashion show last month in New York . Cook accused Brinkley of making their latest court battle public 'to coincide with her return to the stage in Chicago. 'I don't know how you can ever . rationalize your way out of fighting to have this private family matter . become so public. And children will live with it forever,' he said. 'I . mean, it used to be 40 years ago, it was in the newspaper and it ended . up under a bird somewhere. But now it's Google eternity. This will never . go away for my children,' he  said. In response to the comments Cook made . during the interview,  Brinkley's attorney, Tom Campagna, released the . following statement: . 'Peter Cook has repeatedly broken the . confidentiality agreement that Christie has continued to uphold. Peter . is the only one to go on national television spewing sexist, . disgraceful, demonstrably false lies, which gives a taste of what . Christie has had to endure since Peter betrayed his marriage vows. Peter . embarrassed himself and hurt his family by having an affair with a . teenage girl and admitting to an extensive pornography habit.' The supermodel recently claimed that she is being bullied by him in a string of nasty emails. Last weekend it was revealed that Ms . Brinkley, 58, wants Mr Cook to cough up $140,000 in fines over the . emails, in addition to $32,000 in expenses for their two children, . including school tuition and summer camp fees. A source told the New York Daily News: . 'Peter keeps trying to control Christie, and he can’t deal with the . fact that he can’t control her'. Mr Campagna told . the paper that a judge smacked Mr Cook with an order after their . divorce that he be fined $5,000 for each time he got out of hand with Ms . Brinkley. She claims he has violated that order 28 times, but is not out for financial gain. Happier times: Christie Brinkley and Peter Cook, pictured together in 2006, reached a divorce settlement in 2008 after months of very public court disputes . Christie Brinkley, right, has a daughter with first husband, Billy Joel, left, seen together in 1994 . Mr Campagna told the Daily News: 'This is not about the money. This is about what we're calling bullying'. Last week, Mr Cook lashed out at the supermodel in an explosive court document countering claims he owes her child support. Mr Cook, 53, reignited their bitter . custody dispute, claiming in a 91-page document at Suffolk County . Supreme Court in New York that she owes him money - calling her a . 'narcissistic egomaniac'. The architect claims he is owed . $25,000 from Ms Brinkley for caring for their children while she . performed in Chicago on New York’s Broadway and London's West End, the . New York Post reported. He also claims Ms Brinkley is dragging . their two children into their disputes, claiming she has called him . 'truly narcissistic', and once wrote an email to their son that Mr Cook . 'is jealous of my success'. Ms Brinkley met Mr Cook in 1998 and had her third child, Sailor, with him. Mr Cook legally adopted her son with ex-husband Richard Taubman, Jack. She also has a daughter, Alexa Ray, with second husband, musician Billy Joel. Ms Brinkley appeared in several of his music videos, including the 1983 hit Uptown Girl. They were married for nine years. But Ms Brinkley, who has been married four times, has been trading jabs with Mr Cook since their acrimonious split in 2008. Bitter divorce proceedings revealed Mr Cook spent thousands of dollars a month accessing internet porn. He was also romantically involved with a neighbour’s daughter, Diana Bianchi, who was 18 at the time. During their 2008 divorce, the court was told that he had paid Ms Bianchi $300,000 in the hope of her keeping the liaison quiet. Ms Brinkley meanwhile charged that Mr . Cook was a bad father who used 'overwhelming' physical force when . disciplining the children. The court psychiatrist said both parties needed therapy. Blue-eyed and blonde-haired Ms . Brinkley was born in Monroe, Michigan, but grew up in Malibu, . California, before moving to Paris, France, for art school at age 18.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:05 AM on 28th February 2012 . Backing: Angela Merkel addresses the Bundestag today before politicians backed the Greek bailout package . The German parliament today approved the £108billion Greek bailout package despite fierce public opposition. Chancellor Angela Merkel said it would be irresponsible to abandon the country to bankruptcy. The Bundestag voted 496 to 90 in favour of the new package - despite 80 per cent of Germans being opposed to the rescue. Five members abstained. The result of the vote was never in doubt as two opposition parties backed the measures. The bailout is Greece's second in . less than two years and Angela Merkel told lawmakers before the vote . that 'no one can give a 100 per cent guarantee' that the programme would . be a success. She said: 'The road that lies in front of . Greece is long and truly not without risk.' The world’s 20 leading economies, the . G20, at the weekend demanded Germany drop its opposition to a bigger . European bailout fund, telling Europe it must put up extra money if it . wanted more help from other countries. One member of Merkel’s cabinet, . Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich, has openly called on Greece to . leave the eur zone, saying its chances of recovery would be greater . outside. 'Quite clearly the mood in Germany is turning against further rescues for Greece,' he said yesterday. 'But that’s not surprising. This is . all deja vu for the public. We’ve been promised all kinds of things that . aren’t fulfilled and then a few months later there’s the need for . another rescue package. The public’s faith is fading fast.' Hours before today's crunch vote Germany's biggest newspaper urged politicians to reject the proposals. Bild, the German tabloid, ran with . the frontpage headline 'Stop!' after a weekend poll showed the public . firmly opposed the bailout. Germany is desperate to keep the euro project alive at all costs - but the public are opposed to the size of the rescue package. Backing: the Bundestag today voted overwhelmingly in favour of the rescue package despite fierce public opposition . While Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks . of the need for solidarity with Athens, Bild has become the voice of a . long suffering people bitter and frustrated at their taxes underwriting . Greece. The paper said today: 'Enough is enough. 'Bild appeals to all MPs – don’t go down this crazy path any longer.' The paper went on to print the opinions of ten leading economic experts who agree with them. One of them, Professor Gert Wagner, of . the German Institute for Economic Research, said: 'This latest aid . package solves nothing and will only serve to increase Greek misery. 'The exit of Greece from the eurozone should no longer be a taboo subject.' Mood: Protesters gather outside the Bundestag in Berlin to demonstrate against the rescue package . Now it longer seems it is. Hans-Peter Friedrich, the government interior minster, also questioned the value of Greece remaining a euro partner – to the anger of Mrs Merkel. He said that Greece should be allowed . to leave - the first time a member of the German government has openly . called for such a radical step. 'Greece's . chances to regenerate itself and become competitive are surely greater . outside the monetary union than if it remains in the euro area,' Friedrich told news magazine Der Spiegel. 'I'm not talking about throwing Greece out, but rather about creating incentives for an exit that they can't pass up.' Norbert . Barthle, the ruling CDU's budgetary policy spokesman in the Bundestag, . also expressed skepticism about whether the expectations reflected in . the rescue package are realistic, even though he supports the deal in . general. 'I have some . doubts about whether the package's stated goal of reducing Greece's debt . to 120.5 percent of gross domestic product by the year 2020 can be . achieved,' he said. Nein! Germany's biggest newspaper Bild urged politicians to vote against a second bailout for Greece . Meanwhile uncertainty over Greece's position within the Euro has continued to stifle market expectations. Germany's Dax and France's CAC 40 were both down more than 1 per cent following falls on Asian markets overnight. Simon Denham of Capital Spreads said the G20 meeting over the weekend had disappointed investors. 'The non-European members of the G20 said to the European members in no uncertain terms, put up or shut up. 'We still have the political stalemate in Europe whereby Germany’s current leader will not get its bazooka out for fear of giving up further political ground to her opponents when she is already reliant on a coalition to pass votes on European bailouts. 'By giving in and saying that Germany will stump up could easily cost Merkel the next German election in the autumn of next year. 'But other nations around the world will simply not inject any more funds into the IMF in order to prop up the eurozone when large parts of the region remain woefully uncompetitive and profligate.'","80% of Germans opposed to second rescue package .

"By . Lee Moran . Last updated at 7:07 PM on 29th February 2012 . A futuristic supersonic weapon which fires ammunition up to 100 miles is another step closer to being deployed by the U.S. Navy. Officials have revealed an industry-built prototype of the electromagnetic railgun is now being tested at its Naval Surface Warfare Centre Dahlgren Division in northern Virginia. The weapon, which it is hoped will be fitted on ships from 2017, uses a magnetic field and electric current, instead of chemicals, to generate energy to fire the rounds. Scroll down to see video of testing... Sonic boom: An industry-built prototype of the electromagnetic railgun, seen here firing a projectile, is now being tested by the U.S. Navy . Explosive: The railgun can be seen flying through the air (centre of left image) and milliseconds after it was fired from the cannon (right) It will ultimately be used to target enemy ships, provide self-defence against cruise and ballistic missiles and offer support for Marines storming a beach. Five-inch guns on destroyers currently have a range of just 15 miles. Navy officials said that they were currently focusing on making sure it can safely fire the rounds, which will reach seven times the speed of sound - a staggering 5,600mph. They added that more research and development would be needed over the next five years to ensure the weapon can cool down, handle repetitive fire and ensure the 40lb metal projectiles do not disintegrate. Roger Ellis, the Office of Naval Research's electromagnetic railgun program manager, said: 'As you can see, it represents a significant increase in range.' Loading up: The weapon, which it is hoped will be fitted on ships from 2017, uses a magnetic field and electric current, instead of chemicals, to generate energy to fire the rounds . Charged: It will ultimately be used to target enemy ships, provide self-defence against cruise and ballistic missiles and offer support for Marines storming a beach . He added that, because the gun can fire at such high speeds, it would not necessarily have to shoot an explosive to inflict damage. He would only say that it would carry a 'lethal mechanism'. The Navy has been developing the weapon since 2005 at a cost of about $240 million. Similar funding is expected to keep the programme until 2017, when the Navy anticipates the weapon will be ready.  But it could still take several more years before the gun is put on all ships. Monitor: Navy officials said that they were currently focusing on making sure it can safely fire the rounds, which will reach seven times the speed of sound - a staggering 5,600mph . The 40ft-long gun being tested more closely mirrors a final product than previous versions. It has been test fired six times since last week. A second industry-built prototype will be delivered to the Navy for testing in April. General Atomics, one of the companies providing a prototype, has also invested $20 million. Tom Hurn, director of the firm's railgun programme said: 'We believe this is definitely a game changing capability that'll enable our forward presence and freedom of the seas.'","Futuristic weapon is another step closer to being deployed .

So what does one judge have to say about the skaters? 'Across the ice and the Samaritans and speedo you.' Or how about, 'Right is affecting their partnership. Pulled your ball up.' These are just some of the strange subtitles that have appeared on the show. And now, the National Deaf . Children's Society has slammed ITV for its 'bizarre and confusing' captioning on the hit celebrity figure skating contest. The National Deaf Children's Society has slammed ITV for its 'bizarre and confusing' subtitles on the hit celebrity figure skating contest . An interesting appraisal of Chemmy Allcott's skating . Presenter Phillip Schofield tells it like it isn't, to contestants such as Jennifer Ellison and Jorgie Porter . The programme has . attracted an audience of more than 7million but deaf viewers are outraged by . nonsensical wording claiming 'blasphemous' routines 'walk . straight in the fridge'. Leading . campaigners who want a good quality of life for deaf adults and children said incoherent subtitles makes second-class citizens out of disability sufferers. Campaigns officer . Ian Noon at the NDCS said: 'Shoddy subtitling shows that broadcasters are . not making access for deaf viewers a priority.' Presenters . Christine Bleakley and Phillip Schofield usually give a polished turn but appeared . to fluff their lines when talking about contestants including Jennifer Ellison and . Jorgie Porter. 'They will . be toasted to the limits,' claimed This Morning presenter Phillip. See, skaters? That's where you're going wrong. Good job you pulled your ball up . Muscle-bound Chico Slimani reveals the secret to his success on the ice with partner Katarina Witt . Could you say that one more time please, Phillip...? At one point, Louie Spence - judge and dance teacher to . the stars - admitted he does 'do occulta diagrams'. Meanwhile, muscle-bound . Chico Slimani has said on the show that the secret to his success on the ice with partner . Katarina Witt is an 'ageing achievement'. Skating legend .

Presenter Christine Bleakley gives judge Louie Spence (seated left) a cryptic grilling . Mr Noon added: 'Deaf young people all too frequently find that the subtitles for their . favourite shows are riddled with mistakes and hugely out of sync with speech. 'There's no . excuse for poor subtitles like this - even on live programmes. But ITV is not . the only channel guilty of bizarre and confusing subtitles.' 'Through . basic planning such as involving the subtitler in rehearsals and sharing . scripts and plans in advance, broadcasters could dramatically improve live . television for deaf viewers.' Mr Noon also . revealed that ITV have been caught out before for their poor subtitling and he . secured a commitment to improve them on X Factor in 2010. Explanation? An ITV spokesman said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster' 'After a . series of emails highlighting complaints from young people, ITV agreed that the . subtitles on X Factor were not of a good standard,' added Mr Noon. 'Now I . believe the production team send off a near-final edit of the programme the day . before which should improve the quality of the subtitles. 'ITV also . claimed they had committed to making sure that the repeats of the programme . have high-quality subtitles.' Despite being a . heavily scripted live programme, the popular talent show - which puts celebrity . amateur skaters with professionals - has bizarre and out-of-context wording. An ITV spokesman . said: 'Dancing On Ice is a live programme and therefore has live . subtitling which is a challenge for any broadcaster. 'We are now . also subtitling 70 per cent of the programmes on ITV Player, our on-demand . catch-up service.' The drive to . improve the quality of subtitles for deaf viewers has been led by Action on Aid . who were formerly called the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. An Action on . Hearing Loss spokesman said: 'We urge all broadcasters to monitor the . quality of their subtitling to ensure high standards and invest in technology . to reduce mistakes. 'We would . also like Ofcom to play a greater role in monitoring subtitling complaints and . we have called for new laws to ensure the provision of subtitles on all . programmes, regardless of whether it is traditional or catch-up TV.' Meanwhile, at the blundering BBC... The . BBC came under fire last October from groups for the hard of hearing for its . increasing number of bizarre gaffes, which have included calling the . Labour leader 'Ed Miller Band' and the Church of England leader the 'arch . bitch' of Canterbury. The . blunders are understood to be caused during live events where either a . stenographer types words phonetically or by speech recognition. This sees a person talking into a . microphone as they observe the broadcast and a computer then changes . what they are saying to subtitles. Error: This subtitle 'willies/wellies' mistake on BBC Breakfast became an internet sensation when an eagle-eyed viewer posted the shot, describing pigs, online last year . During the Queen Mother’s funeral, a solemn call for silence became ‘we will now have a moment’s violence’. When . a BBC announcer revealed the Government was ‘making helpful decisions’, . deaf viewers would have been left wondering why politicians were . ‘making holes for surgeons’. A report that mentioned pigs on a farm nibbling on ‘wellies’ became something much ruder. One politician talking to the Daily . Politics told presenter Andrew Neil was subtitled as saying he did not . believe in ‘soliciting’ himself when what he actually said was . ‘shortlisting’. Other gaffes have seen the Ireland rugby team renamed as Island and the sale of millions of . puppies in Britain was not about the trade in live dogs but actually a . story about people wearing poppies for Remembrance Day. The errors have become so common they have spawned their own dedicated website. The BBC is the only broadcaster in the world that subtitles all of its programmes. Groups for the deaf and hard of hearing . have admitted they receive regular complaints about the issue and called . on broadcasters to monitor the ‘quality of their subtitling’ and reduce . mistakes'. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We recognise . that  subtitling it a hugely important service, and we endeavour to . ensure it is as accurate as possible. ‘There are occasions, particularly . during live broadcasts, when mistakes will happen but we do all we can . to keep this to a minimum and are constantly striving to improve . accuracy.’","'Across the ice and the Samaritans and speedo you'

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 5:47 PM on 5th March 2012 . Campaign leader: Army officer Jessica Scott, 35, is responsible for starting the 'I am not a slut' hashtag on Twitter following Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments about contraception . When Rush Limbaugh called a college student a 'slut' over a heated debate on contraception it sparked a national outcry. The controversial radio host found himself abandoned by advertisers and was even criticised by Barack Obama. But it was an online campaign through Twitter which really helped to galvanize women's outrage over his comments. The hashtag 'I am not a slut' went viral and resulted in hundreds of tweets in an enormous national reaction against Mr Limbaugh. And it has now emerged that the woman responsible for starting the online campaign is a 35-year-old Army officer from Fort Hood, Texas. Jessica Scott, who is a company commander and romance novelist, told BuzzFeed that she had been following the heated debates on contraception and religious liberty for a month. But when Mr Limbaugh called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' after she argued that employers should pay for their workers' contraception, she decided it was time to act. The second lieutenant, who has served in Iraq, wrote on Twitter that she 'used birth control while deployed with my husband so I *wouldn't* get pregnant & sent home.' She then finished the tweet with the hashtag #iamnotaslut which proved hugely popular and sparked a flurry of tweets expressing anger at Mr Limbaugh's comments. Speaking to BuzzFeed, Mrs Scott, who has two children, said: 'The entire thing is absolutely appalling because her testimony wasn't even about sex. 'It was about a woman who'd lost an ovary because her insurance would not cover birth control pills she needed to control the ovarian cysts.' Mr Limbaugh had faced repeated calls for an apology after claiming that the student must be sexually promiscuous because she supported a contentious measure which would have forced religious institutions to fund birth control for their employees. But instead he dialed up the rhetoric, first saying that Ms Fluke, from Catholic College Georgetown University in Washington D.C, should film herself having sex and then claiming that she 'had boyfriends lined up around the block'. Anger: Rush Limbaugh, left, sparked a national outrage when he called Sandra Fluke, right, a 'slut' following a heated debate on contraception . However, after a number of firms pulled their advertisements from his show and the President called Ms Fluke to express his support Mr Limbaugh finally backed down on Saturday afternoon, three days after his initial remarks. Today, AOL became the eighth advertiser to drop their adverts from Mr Limbaugh's show. The company posted on Twitter today: 'At AOL one of our core values is that we act with integrity. We have monitored the unfolding events and have determined that Mr. Limbaugh’s comments are not in line with our values. As a result we have made the decision to suspend advertising on The Rush Limbaugh Radio show'. His apology read: 'For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity, three hours a day, five days a week. In this instance, I chose the wrong words in my analogy of the situation. I did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke.' Mrs Scott, who has served in the army for 17 years, was left stunned by the reaction her hashtag created . When she is not working as a soldier, she writes romance novels with covers featuring near-naked male soldiers. Campaign: These tweets from Jessica Scott with the hashtag 'I am not a slut' resulted in an online campaign against Rush Limbaugh's controversial comments .

Mr Limbaugh concluded: 'In my monologue, I posited that it is not our business whatsoever to know what is going on in anyone's bedroom nor do I think it is a topic that should reach a Presidential level.

"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 6:13 PM on 5th March 2012 . The former high school teacher who quit his job and left his family to move in with a student 23 years his junior has been branded a sexual predator by a therapist who interviewed the controversial couple. James Hooker, 41, and Jordan Powers, 18, made their relationship public last week as it was revealed the pair were moving in together after meeting when Hooker was Jordan's business teacher at James Enochs High School in Modesto, California. A therapist told ABC that the couple are experiencing a common syndrome called 'shared paranoia'  where they think the whole world is against them. Scroll down for video . Forbidden love: Teacher James Hooker, 41, left, with his young love Jordan Powers, 18, for who he left his job and family . Expert opinion: Therapist Bethany Marshall says of James Hooker, 'He is pathologically immature. These teachers imagine themselves to be age mates or peers with the students' Bethany Marshall said: 'James is pathologically immature. And this is what we see with teachers who . have inappropriate relationships with their students. They imagine . themselves to be age mates or peers with the students. 'Like most sex predators, he is identified age-wise with the victim. This is what you see with pedophilia, with offending patterns, with . teachers who have sex with students. 'They always talk about the student . as if they and the student are the exact same age. James . does what sex offenders often do. He disavows culpability while doing . the same actions he's saying he's not responsible for.' The couple insist that nothing inappropriate took place before Jordan turned 18 and a police investigation is currently underway to discern whether or not this is the case. Meanwhile, Jordan's mother has waged a public . campaign on Facebook . alleging Hooker actively pursued her daughter when she was underage . and said his actions are tantamount to abuse. Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where his daughter, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan . Intimate: The couple share a kiss as they are interviewed by ABC and insist their love is real and for life . Hooker's wife and children - including a 17-year-old who goes to the same school the couple met - are now trying to move on with their lives in the wake of the scandal. When Ms Marshall asked Hooker how he felt about abandoning his family, he accused her of being judgemental saying: 'Love will overcome everything. I love my . children. I love Jordan. I think that you're making … judgment calls. And I think that we'll prove you wrong.' Both insist their love for each other is real and their relationship will succeed. Ms Marshall told ABC that though it will likely last for a while, eventually one of them will realise the reality of what they are doing. 'They're both dropouts at this point. She's a dropout from school and . he's a dropout from society. We used to have a diagnosis … called shared . paranoia,' she told the news channel. 'And that's when one person makes another . person believe that the world is against them. 'When you make another . person believe that the world is against both of you, you create a very . powerful bond. This is what we see in cults. And this is what he's . created with her.' Concern: Jordan's mother Tammy, right, is accusing Hooker of pursuing her daughter, left, and said what he is doing is tantamount to abuse . Jordan's mother Tammie Powers is blaming Hooker for pursuing her daughter and taking advantage of her. She claims her daughter's grades fell this year and she started to have panic attacks 'from the stress'. She told The Bee: 'I was really, really careful. I wanted her to be safe. In hindsight, in retrospect, I should have looked at things differently. 'She looked up to him. He was in the position of an educator, you don’t . abuse your student. Period. 'She’s still in high school. She still lives . at home. She has a curfew. That’s not OK.' Publically naming and shaming Hooker on her Facebook page, Tammie Powers believes Hooker is just like a pedophile and should spent the rest of his life behind bars. Love nest: Hooker left his wife and children to move into one of these apartments with Jordan - 23 years his junior . On Tannie Powers' Facebook account, she posts a picture of James Hooker with this message: . 'This is a picture of JAMES HOOKER from . Enochs High School....a perverted man in his forties, who has taken . advantage of a little girl. 'Now, James if you're reading this while you . have my daughter, you better believe everyone will know you're a sick . child molester. 'Don't . think for one second you will win. I'm smarter, stronger, and . way more determined. I WILL NEVER give up. 'I'll be getting my daughter back you . sicko.' Jordan has now stopped attending classes at the school and is doing independent study. She insists that they did nothing wrong until she became an adult and that feelings gradually developed. Mrs Powers does not believe these claims. She discovered up to 8,000 text messages exchanged between them, emails and late night phone calls. She has now even started a Facebook campaign against Hooker, calling him a 'sicko' and a 'pervert' Mr Hooker said, though he is being investigated, he is confident that he will be cleared of any inappropriate behaviour, but said he can see why people would be alarmed. He told ABC: 'I think the stigma of the teacher-student relationship just makes it messy, makes it really hard for people to get through to the point that we really do like each other.

"By . Katherine Faulkner, Deborah Arthurs and Nadia Mendoza . Last updated at 10:01 AM on 7th March 2012 . Kate Moss is said to be so famous because she created an air of mystery by remaining silent. And Pippa Middleton was fast re-creating a devoted army of fans based on enchanting looks alone. However, the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge has finally spoken on camera after completing one of the toughest cross-country skiing events in the world yesterday. Scroll down for video. 'I'm average': Pippa Middleton spoke to the cameras after completing a cross-country ski race . Beginner: Cross-country novice Pippa arrived in Sweden a week ahead of the race to get in some practice . The 28-year-old – who had never done . any cross-country skiing before – braved sub-zero temperatures during . the 56-mile challenge in Western Sweden. When she was quizzed over her efforts, Pippa told the reporter she found the race 'tiring'. Ms Middleton, who . engaged in a series of last-minute training sessions to brush up on her . technique said she simply prepared 'over a couple of weekends'. A voice to match the face: Pippa said she found the race 'tiring' Infectious smile: Pippa still found time to flash her pearly whites after the gruelling seven hour race . She also refused to rate herself out of 10, saying she was an 'average' skier. When she was asked what time she had planned to complete the race in, she rather sarcastically replied: 'To get round in time'. Oops! Pippa takes a tumble as she gets to grips with the demanding sport . Nervous? With no cross-country ski experience, Pippa revealed she had been working on her general fitness . At ease: A natural on skis, Pippa soon picks up the cross-country technique . Arriving in Sweden a week before the race, Pippa and her brother James got kitted out with skis and poles and hit the snow to get to grips with the discipline. Already a keen skier, Pippa was at ease with the equipment - but nonetheless struggled to keep her balance on some of the course's more challenging parts. She looked determined to master the art, spending her time ahead of the race practising the rhythmic swinging of the arms and smooth leg movements necessary for the kind of efficient and high-speed skiing style needed to earn her a decent place in the pecking order. Envy: Pippa with a local admirer after crossing the finish line . Raring to go: Pippa Middleton arrives at the start of the Vasaloppet Cross Country Ski Race in Salen to raise money for charity . The arduous training more than paid off . in the end, as Pippa managed to secure an impressive 412th place out of . 15,800 racers when the race went ahead on the weekend. After the race, one local who hands the winner a wreath, proved . the envy of many men when he planted a kiss on her cheek at the end of the . course. Kate's younger . sister joined 15,800 other skiers for the race between Salen and Mora, . including her brother James. But sweating it out on skis did not mean her exacting sartorial standards had to slip. Helping hand: James Middleton, who was competing alongside Pippa, zips up his sister at the start of race while she chats to a fellow racer . Pippa, wrote on her charity page: 'My brother and I are raising money for Magic Breakfast, a small registered charity that fights child hunger through breakfast clubs' Miss Middleton, who turned up with immaculate hair and make-up, started . the race with a white hat but ended it in a fetching orange one, which she co-ordinated with her sunglasses and shoes. She crossed the finish line after seven hours, 13 minutes and 36 seconds – described by veterans as a ‘very impressive’ time. When asked if she minded finishing 26 minutes behind her brother, she replied: ‘No, that was probably fair.’ Despite being a beginner at cross country skiing, Pippa marched powerfully along the tough course . Pippa was a natural on the course, onlookers said . Pippa joined 15,800 other skiiers for the gruelling race . Pippa was inundated with requests for interviews after completing the race . The party planner explained she had ‘never really skied cross-country . before’, but said she and James, 23, had done ‘lots of fitness training’ in the UK to prepare for the race, as well as two weekends spent skiing . in Switzerland. During the race – much of which was uphill – Miss Middleton stopped to . drink the local blabarsoppa, or blueberry soup, a drink handed out to . racers which is said to boost energy. Per Strid, a spokesman for the Vasaloppet race, one of the oldest events . of its kind in the world, said: ‘I must congratulate Pippa – she had a . fantastic performance. What she achieved was really impressive for a . first timer. She was obviously very fit and in very good shape.’ The Middletons were raising money for the Magic Breakfast charity, which . provides a pre-school meal to poor inner-city children in the UK. So . far they have raised nearly £7,500 for the cause. Up to the start line: Pippa Middleton has a chat with a fellow racer before setting off on the challenge . Gaining speed: She proved to be an accomplished ski and looked at home on the slopes . Pippa stopped for a drink during the race and looked in good spirits when she took off again . Success!

A Dutch prince struck by an avalanche while skiing off-trail in Austria last week suffered massive brain damage and may never regain consciousness, doctors said today. Johan Friso, 43, is the second son of the Netherlands' monarch Queen Beatrix. Dr Wolfgang Koller, head of trauma at the Innsbruck hospital where Friso is being treated, said at a news conference broadcast live on Dutch national television that it took nearly 50 minutes to reanimate the prince after he was pulled from the snow. Family: (From left) Prince Johan Friso's younger brother Prince Constantijn, mother Queen Beatrix, wife Princess Mabel and older brother Prince Willem Alexander arrive at the Innsbruck hospital when he is being treated today . Accident: Prince Friso, pictured with his wife Mabel and their daughters Luana and Zaria, in the Austrian village of Lech in February 2011. He may never regain consciousness after he was buried in an avalanche last week . He said: 'It is clear that the oxygen starvation has caused massive brain damage to the patient. 'At the moment, it cannot be predicted if he will ever regain consciousness.' Friso, . who is married and has two young daughters, will be moved at a later . date to a private rehabilitation clinic for further treatment. But Dr Koller cautioned that it may take years before he awakens from his coma, if he ever does. The . prince was skiing with one companion away from marked ski runs on February 17 when the . mass of snow, 30metres wide and 40 meters long . He . was pulled unconscious from the drift about 20 minutes after the . incident and resuscitated at the scene. He was then airlifted to the . university clinic in Innsbruck.

Press conference: Dr Wolfgang Koller, head of trauma at the Innsbruck hospital where Friso is being treated, today tells a news conference that it took nearly 50 minutes to reanimate the prince . Father-of-two: It is thought the prince was buried under snow for 20 minutes before he was rescued . Stefan . Jochum, a spokesman for the . Lech ski area where the accident occurred, last week said the incident . took place as the prince and other skiers were on slopes away from . the marked Lech ski runs. The trails were laden with snow after weeks of record . falls. Mr Jochum said: 'A snow slide came down and the . prince was buried as the only member of the group.' Members of the royal family were . skiing in the mountain village of Lech, which had been hit by heavy . snowfall in the run-up to last Friday. The second of Beatrix's three sons, Friso gave up any claim to the . Dutch throne in order to marry Dutch commoner Mabel Wisse Smit, in 2004. The pair have two daughters, Emma and Joanna.

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 3:40 PM on 1st February 2012 . Billionaire R Allen Stanford wasted tens of millions of dollars developing property and businesses on the Caribbean island of Antigua, according to a former employee. The financier spared no expense on projects including a private airport hangar, cricket grounds, an athletic club, two airlines and a dock facility for his boat, his fraud trial heard yesterday. Arnold Knoche, who worked for 16 years at Stanford's real estate development company, told the hearing in Houston, Texas, that Stanford was so extravagant he even replaced the hardwood floors at his bank because they weren't the right colour. Extravagant: Allen Stanford, pictured at a hearing last month, wasted tens of millions of dollars developing property and businesses on Antigua, according to a former employee . Stanford is accused of masterminding a . fraud in which he bilked investors out of more than $7billion in a . massive Ponzi scheme centred on the sales of certificates of deposit . from his bank in Antigua. Authorities . allege he used depositors' money to fund his businesses, many of which . failed, as well as his lavish billionaire lifestyle. Stanford's attorneys contend the financier was a savvy businessman whose financial empire was legitimate. They . have suggested James Davis, the ex-chief financial officer for the . financier's company, is the real culprit behind the fraud. Davis has pleaded guilty in the case and is expected to be called by prosecutors this week. Mr . Knoche said Stanford was partial to granite and marble finishes and . that one time the financier replaced the hardwood floors in his bank in . Antigua because he thought 'they were too light a shade' as he had . wanted all of his buildings in Antigua to have the same colour hardwood . floors. The former employee said: 'He was very upset. He said, ""This shouldn't have happened.""' Mr . Knoche, who eventually became president of Stanford's real estate . development company, said he grew concerned about where the money came . from for these construction projects, which were very expensive because . they were built quickly and most of the materials for them had to be . brought from outside the island. Facing 20 years: Stanford is accused of masterminding a fraud in which he bilked investors out of more than $7billion . He said he stopped asking Stanford about the source of the money because he 'refused to provide information'. 'It seemed there had to be some limit to how much money he had,' Mr Knoche said. But . when questioned by Robert Scardino, one of Stanford's attorneys, Mr . Knoche said any concerns he had about the source of Stanford's funding . did not prompt him to quit. He said he left Stanford's company in 2003 because he was travelling too much for work. 'What he built there improved the island considerably?' Scardino asked. 'Yes,' Mr Knoche responded. In . a video shown to jurors, Stanford could be seen talking to staffers . about how he was willing to 'spend millions and millions of dollars' to . develop Antigua so he could create an environment that would 'literally . blow away' potential investors his company flew on corporate jets to the . island nation. Stanford . said in the video: 'We are growing our business with high net worth . people and high net worth people are not easily impressed.' Prosecutors did not say when the video was filmed. Stanford is on trial for 14 counts, including mail and wire fraud, and faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He . was once considered one of the wealthiest people in the U.S., with an . estimated net worth of more than $2billion. He has been in jail without . bond since being indicted in 2009. The trial continues.","Employee of 16 years reveals extravagant billionaire spared no expense on luxury lifestyle projects .

"By . Jo Macfarlane . Last updated at 9:36 AM on 5th March 2012 . The ex-wife of Rolling Stone guitarist Ronnie Wood has been enjoying a passionate relationship with the builder she employed to carry out renovation work on her £3 million London townhouse. Former model Jo Wood, 56, who has previously spoken of her delight that there were ‘hunky builders’ working on the property, began dating divorced father-of-four Paul Scarborough after a Christmas party in December. He has spent several nights sleeping at the house, and was seen last week on the front steps in an affectionate embrace with Jo. Dismay: Samantha Whittaker, left, has told of her devastation after her fiance, Paul Scarborough, began a relationship with Jo Wood, ex-wife of Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood, after working on her London home . But the news has been met with dismay by his devastated fiancee. A spokesman for Jo has insisted she did not know that Mr Scarborough already had a girlfriend. But Samantha Whittaker says his affair with Jo has ended her 22-year relationship with the man she describes as the love of her life. Miss Whittaker has watched as Mr Scarborough was gradually seduced by the high life. Glamorous Jo spent 23 years married to one of the world’s most famous rock stars and bought the mansion in the celebrity enclave of Primrose Hill with the proceeds from her £6.5 million divorce last summer. In stark contrast, Mr Scarborough, 48, from Bromley, South-East London, runs his own building company with his son, rides a Honda motorbike and enjoys nights in front of the television watching American dramas Boardwalk Empire and Spartacus. But after he began working at the Primrose Hill property in July 2011, Miss Whittaker says he began jogging, bought new clothes and cut out bread from his diet in order to make an impression on Jo. He even started buying organic crackers. It was only after he failed to return home after attending the Christmas party Jo held for her organic beauty range that he confessed to their affair. Recently he has been using Miss Whittaker as a shoulder to cry on, having grown tired of Jo’s habit of name-dropping and insistence on attending London Fashion Week. Split: Mr Scarborough with Miss Whittaker last year. The pair had been together for 22 years and engaged for the past 2 years . Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Miss Whittaker said: ‘That life isn’t us. We’re ordinary people – we’re not rock stars. If you don’t like name-droppers don’t go out with a rock star’s ex-wife. He’s tried it with Jo but he doesn’t like it. ‘What we had was a real love story throughout my grown-up life and I’m very sad that it’s over.’ Miss Whittaker, a mother of two, and Mr Scarborough had dated on and off for more than 20 years and when he proposed on Christmas Day 2010, she was happy to accept. But the affair with Jo has brought the relationship to a sorry end. Speaking of the time Mr Scarborough began work for Jo last July, Miss Whittaker said: ‘When he met her, he said, “She’s an old woman. Mad. Batty”. We laughed about it.’ But Jo obviously thought differently. She told a newspaper she was enjoying having ‘hunky builders’ around and confessed: ‘One day I just climbed up on the roof to hang out, I felt like I was having a Mary Poppins Chim Chim Cheree moment.’ Jo was having £20,000 chandeliers installed, a dressing room built and a polished concrete floor fitted in the designer kitchen. Wallpaper with a skull and crossbones pattern was hung, and a new balcony in wrought iron was put up. ‘An £8,000 bath got chipped when they installed it but she told them not to worry about it,’ said Miss Whittaker. ‘There was also a mirror she’d designed which got chipped. She seemed really laid back. ‘Everything was antique, gothic and black, the skirting boards and window frames.’ Flirty: A photo of Jo reclining in her new bath which she texted to Mr Scarborough . Jo frequently called or texted Mr Scarborough with further instructions and personal messages – sometimes late at night. Miss Whittaker discovered them by checking his phone. ‘They would say, “You’re so fabulous Paul x”. I thought, “You’re the builder. She’s not supposed to be talking to you like that”.’ Mr Scarborough began shopping for clothes in Camden Market, where the stalls cater to a younger, fashionable crowd. He began cutting out bread and jogging before work. ‘The biggest shock came when he started bringing organic crackers home. It rang alarm bells, because I knew Jo was into all that stuff,’ said Miss Whittaker. However, the relationship began in the most cliched way – at the Christmas party for Jo’s organic beauty range, held at her son Jamie’s art gallery Whispers in Whitechapel. Mr Scarborough did not return home that night. Miss Whittaker said: ‘I was so gutted. I texted Jo. I wrote, “I hope you don’t mind but I’m Paul’s girlfriend. I know you were with him last night but he didn’t come home and I’m worried”. He rang me back a couple of minutes later.’ Rough around the edges: Mr Scarborough pictured hard at work outside Jo's luxury home in the upmarket district of Primrose Hill . Mr Scarborough confessed to sleeping with Jo, but called it a ‘fling’. ‘He asked me to hang around to see what happened,’ said Miss Whittaker. ‘Because we’ve always had this easy relationship over the years that’s what he expected. But I’d reached this stage of my life where I didn’t want that any more. I wanted to be with him.’ Jo spent Christmas in Australia but sent Mr Scarborough regular affectionate text messages. When she returned during the last weekend in January, he disappeared off to see her – and Miss Whittaker packed his bag. ‘It was so painful,’ she said. ‘He was telling everyone she wanted him to move in permanently.’ Such was Miss Whittaker’s affection for Mr Scarborough that she allowed him to sleep at the house a couple of nights a week. But when they spoke it was so he could grumble. Miss Whittaker said: ‘They’d be watching telly and Ralph Fiennes would come on and Paul would say, “I like him”, and she’d say, “I’ve had lunch with him”. ‘When he said he was missing his friends, she said, “So am I. Keith and Patti [Stones guitarist Keith Richards and his wife]. And [rock guitarist] Slash is a good friend too”. He said that was what he had to put up with. ‘It was London Fashion Week and he said, “She’s gone to every single show. I’m not into all that”. He said she’d go to the opening of an email. ‘He said, “What am I going to do? Spend a months’ wages on one meal?” ’ Mr Scarborough told Miss Whittaker he had spent Valentine’s Day with Jo but later confessed: ‘I don’t think it’s going to last.’ Miss Whittaker said: ‘I don’t want them to split up. I don’t want him to have ruined everything we had for something stupid.’ Mr Scarborough confided that Jo’s children were wary of him being around. Jo has one son, Jamie, from her first marriage and two children, Leah, 32, and Tyrone, 27, from her relationship with Ronnie. ‘He told me Jo had been on the phone to one of her sons and he’d asked her who paid for dinner when they went out together,’ said Miss Whittaker. Mr Scarborough was seen arriving at the property on Thursday on his motorbike. Shortly after 5pm, a team of builders left in a van. He appeared at the door 20 minutes later, and Jo draped her arms around his shoulders in a loose embrace as they said goodbye. When asked about the affair, Mr Scarborough said: ‘I have nothing to say about that, that’s nothing to do with me.’ Last night, Jo said: ‘S***. I didn’t really want this to come out. This is really going to b***** everything up. I don’t know if it’s going to last. I wanted to keep it all quite secret until I knew where it was going. ‘I was in my marriage for a long time so I don’t want to get really serious. It’s too early. I’ve only really been going out on a couple of dates with him, it’s nothing concrete.’ A representative for Jo added: ‘Jo didn’t know Paul had a girlfriend. He said it was over. ‘She’s just been having fun post-Ronnie. She’s been on dates with other guys and it was a bit of fun. ‘Paul’s finished work on the house and is no longer in contact with Jo. They’re not seeing each other any more. She’s focusing on doing up the house and her family.’","Builder's partner reveals he fell for Ronnie's ex while renovating her home .

"By . Louise Boyle . Last updated at 11:30 AM on 6th March 2012 . A businessman was told yesterday he will spend the rest of his life in prison after being found guilty of the murder of his expectant wife in 2006. Jason Young, 37, was retried for the crime after his first trial ended in a hung jury last June. Young was found guilty of the first-degree murder of wife Michelle Young. The . 29-year-old was five months pregnant with their second child, . when she was found face-down in a pool of blood at their North Carolina . home. Scroll down for video . Quick decision: Jason Young was sentenced to life in prison without parole by a jury in North Carolina today at the retrial for the murder of his pregnant wife in 2006 . The couple's two-year-old daughter, Cassidy, now . seven, was in the house and found hiding in her parents' bed the . next day, her bloody footprints surrounding the body. Michelle Young's . sister, Meredith Fischer, found them. Young had claimed that the . night his wife was murdered he was 160 miles from home staying at a . hotel in Hillsville, Virginia, while on a business trip. The jury in Wake County, North Carolina deliberated for only six hours today before returning a guilty verdict at 3.48pm. Young will serve a life sentence without parole. According to ABC, during final deliberations this morning, the jury . requested a list of items entered into evidence to examine, including clothes worn by the family, . crime scene photos and Young's luggage from his business trip. The salesman was jailed in 2009, but released on bond of $900,000 in July last year, after a jury failed to reach a verdict in his first trial. Murdered: Michelle Young was five months pregnant with her second child when she was found face-down in a pool of blood after being beaten to death by her husband Jason . Horrific scene: Toddler Cassidy's bloody footprints were found around her mother Michelle's body after the 29-year-old was beaten to death at her home in 2006 . In a civil lawsuit in 2009 a judge . declared that Jason killed his wife Michelle, awarding her mother $15.6 million . in compensation and punitive damages. Young was barred from receiving any . life insurance payout or assets as a result of his wife's death. Prosecutors described the attack, in . which they say Michelle Young was hit at least thirty times on the head with blunt . force, as 'brutal and personal'. During the retrial, Chief Assistant District Attorney Howard Cummings said Jason Young was inconsistent when he recounted the night of his wife's death. The jury also heard dramatic testimony from Michelle's sister Meredith who revealed that the couple's toddler spoke of her father . during the 911 call. Prosecutors pointed out that in the tape of the call, Cassidy could be heard in the background. During the call, Meredith Fisher asked the toddler what happened to her mother and if anyone had been in the house. On the original call, Ms Fisher can be heard telling the dispatcher she didn't think the child understood what was happening. 'There on that day, when we were in . the fire truck, she continued to talk about her father,' Ms Fischer said. 'And . later when we got back to my house, a child psychologist was there, but . she had just shut down.' In happier times: Jason Young, shown with wife Michelle, said in his first trial that although he was not a exemplary husband he loved his wife and had nothing to do with her death . In his first criminal trial, in 2011, . prosecutors said that the businessman killed his wife because they were having . marital problems, ABC News reported. Two women took the stand to say . they'd had extra-marital sex with Young in the months leading up to his . wife's murder. In his original trial Young made the unusual move of . testifying in his own defence. Speaking though tears, he said that, . although he was not a exemplary husband, he loved his wife and had no . hand in her death. But . in his first trial the prosecution argued that Young drove through . the night to kill his wife Michelle, and then interfered with the hotel . security devices to conceal his actions. Mother and child: Michelle's two-year-old daughter Cassidy, now 7, was found hiding in a bed near the crime scene . Jason . Young allegedly left the hotel through an emergency exit, wedging the . door open so as to avoid using his key card to get back inside, . prosecutors say. 'The defendant had a plan. His plan . was to murder his wife, and his plan was to get away with it,' Holt told . jurors in the first trial. This time around, the prosecution’s opening . statement portrayed Young as an juvenile man who didn't want another . baby, ABC News reported. But the defence’s . opening statement argued that the state’s case was mainly circumstantial, and . without direct evidence linking Young to the crime scene. Attorney Mike Klinkosum conceded that the Youngs were having problems in their marriage, but argued that . did not make Jason Young a killer. Gruesome scene: A photo of Cassidy Young's footprints in her mother's blood was shown to the court during the retrial . Klinkosum said. 'I am not here to tell you that he was a good husband. He was far from it. He's acted like an . obnoxious, juvenile jerk. But what you've got to remember ladies and . gentlemen, is that we don't convict people of murder, just because they . act like jerks.' Meredith Fisher discovered her sister's lifeless body after getting a voicemail from Jason . Young asking her to go to the house to look for some papers about an anniversary present for Michelle. She told the court last month of the heartbreaking moment of finding her dead . sister, with her small child nearby. She told the court: 'That's the . small of her back, that I touched her and felt that she was cold.' When . Fisher arrived at the Young house 'the dog was freaking out,' she said . in the 911 call played back in court. Lights were on in the . porch and the gate was open. When she got upstairs there was blood . everywhere. Holt described the horrific scene that greeted Meredith: 'She . found little footprints in blood. She found them around Michelle’s . head. She saw them as she was coming up the stairs in Cassidy’s . bathroom. She found baby dolls. A baby doll by Michelle’s head. And she heard Cassidy say, ‘Mommy’s got boo boos.' Wedding day: During the retrial witnesses told the court in North Carolina that Jason and Michelle Young did not have a happy marriage . Crime scene: Meredith Fisher found her sister dead after receiving a voice mail from Jason Young asking her to go to the house to look for some papers . Shelly Schaad, a former . sorority sister of Michelle Young and the last person to see Michelle . alive, also took the stand last month and painted an unflattering picture of the software salesman. The couple's marriage was troubled and they fought openly, Ms Schaad told the court. Following Schaad's testimony Elmer Goad, . the maintenance man from the Hampton Inn in Hillsville, where Young . said he was staying, gave evidence about the night of the murder. The hotel worker said he noticed a camera was unplugged at an emergency exit. He . and Keith Hicks, the night clerk, got a ladder and reconnected it, the . court heard. 'I’d say within an hour after that, we looked and it was . pointing up at the ceiling and the wall,' he said. 'So I went back and . checked it and somebody had hit it hard enough to knock it up toward the . ceiling.' Goad said, in the nine years he had worked there, he'd 'never seen a camera messed with.' Following . Goad's testimony, the court heard from a convenience store worker who . said she saw Young at her gas station on the night of the murder. Gracie . Dahms Calhoun gave crucial evidence that placed Jason . Young, not at his hotel, but between Hillsville and his home in . Raleigh, on the night of the murder. The store clerk remembered Young because he was angry that he had to come in to pay for his gas, the court heard. 'He kept hitting the buzzer,' she said. 'He kept trying and trying and I kept hitting ''ignore''. 'When . he came in to pay he started cussing and raising Cain and threw a 20 at . me and told me he would get 20 and walked out,' she said. After . pumping in just $15 in gas he left. The store clerk identified Young and his car- a white SUV. Jason Young was driving a . white Ford Explorer on the night of the murder. In . the initial trial the jury deliberated for three days before reaching . deadlock. Eight jurors voted in favor of acquittal and four for . conviction.","Jason Young, 37, claimed to be away on business when wife was murdered ."
"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 9:31 AM on 5th March 2012 . Newt Gingrich was the latest Republican presidential candidate to distance himself from the controversial radio commentator Rush Limbaugh following his tirade against a law student whom he deemed a 'slut.' Appearing on a Sunday morning news program, Mr Gingrich said that it was 'silly' to suggest that Mr Limbaugh speaks on behalf of the entire Republican party, and that he is glad that Mr Limbaugh issued an apology to Sandra Fluke, the woman at the heart of the debate. Following her appearance at a hearing in support of President Obama's quest to have all employers pay for birth control through health insurance policies, Mr Limbaugh called the 30-year-old Ms Fluke a 'prostitute' and suggested that she could make enough money to pay for her birth control by posting videos of herself having sex online. The row is beginning to overshadow the Republican presidential race -- forcing the candidates to distance themselves from Limbaugh and discuss social issues -- as voters in nine states head to the polls for Super Tuesday. SCROLL DOWN TO LISTEN TO THE AUDIO . Rant: Rush Limbaugh, 61, left called Sandra Fluke, right, a student at Catholic college Georgetown University, a 'slut' for saying religious institutions should cover birth control under health insurance . Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Archbishop of . New York and a fierce opponent of Mr Obama's policy, criticised Mr . Limbaugh's pugnacious comments and said: 'Whatever we do, and however . strongly we feel, we do it charitably, we do it civilly.' Mr Gingrich's fellow candidates already responded, with each varying in their severity. Rick Santorum said that the comments were 'absurd' and Ron Paul said that they were 'crude'. Mitt Romney tried to tactfully avoid the issue at several campaign events before finally saying Mr Limbaugh's remarks were 'not the language I would have used'. After refusing to retract his name calling from Wednesday, Mr Limbaugh decided to double down on Thursday and dig himself deeper into the issue. Only after a number of advertisers announced that they would be withdrawing their ads from his show did the radio host apologize, saying that he 'did not mean a personal attack on Ms Fluke' but was simply trying to make a point. 'For over 20 years, I have illustrated the absurd with absurdity,' he said in his statement that he released on Saturday. Condemnations: GOP Presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich said that he was glad Mr Limbaugh apologized, and distanced himself from the controversial host by saying it was 'silly' to think that Mr Limbaugh speaks for the party . That was not enough to calm the nerves of at least one advertiser, however, as the CEO of Carbonite - a former sponsor of Mr Limbaugh's show - said that they would not reverse their decision. 'No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke, and I have two, could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady,' wrote the company's CEO David Friend on their website. 'Mr. Limbaugh, with his highly personal attacks on Miss Fluke, overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency. Even though Mr. Limbaugh has now issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising from his show. 'If we are going to pay for your contraceptives and thus pay for you to have sex... we want you to post the videos online so we can all watch' Rush Limbaugh . 'We hope that our action, along with the other advertisers who have already withdrawn their ads, will ultimately contribute to a more civilized public discourse.' In addition to the online security firm Carbonite, six other advertisers withdrew their support following Mr Limbaugh's first comments. Mattress companies Sleep Train Mattress and Sleep Number, as well as Quicken Loans all immediately announced that they suspended their advertisements on the program. On Sunday, ProFlowers announced via Facebook that the host 'went beyond political discourse to a personal attack and do not reflect our values as a company'. Earlier in the week, eHarmony said that they would be 're-evaluating their ad buys with the network' but did not formally say that they were pulling their ads from his program. Angry: Mattress retailer Sleep Train, based in Rocklin, California, has bowed to pressure on Twitter and said it will no longer advertise on the show . Also angry: Another mattress company in Sleep Number also announced through a spokesman that they were 'immediately suspending' all advertising on the Rush Limbaugh show . Out: Quicken Loans also decided to pull advertising from the show after the 'inflammatory comments' Ms Fluke is a third year law student at Georgetown University- a well-regarded Jesuit school -- and the ex-president of the university's group called Students for Reproductive Justice. She spoke on Capitol Hill about a friend who had to take birth control to treat a disorder that caused ovarian cysts. The friend subsequently lost her ovary. She also spoke of classmates who can’t afford contraception, which was what really riled Mr Limbaugh. Spokesman: Ms Fluke was due to testify at a hearing on Capitol Hill last month about Barack Obama's mandate that health insurers provide contraception - but she wasn't allowed to do so . Ms Fluke claimed a female student spends $3,000 on protected sex during a three-year course at university, reported ABC News. ‘Three thousand dollars for birth control in three years? That’s $1,000 a year of sex - and, she wants us to pay for it,’ Mr Limbaugh said. 'She's having so much sex she can't afford her own birth control pills and she agrees that Obama should provide them, or the Pope.’ Listen to the audio clip here: .","Conservative radio host slammed Georgetown University's Sandra Fluke .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:11 AM on 3rd March 2012 . Former NFL player Perrish Cox today walked free after being acquitted of sexual assault charges, a verdict that was met with disbelief by the alleged victim. A jury found ex-Denver Broncos cornerback Cox not guilty of sexually assaulting a woman at his apartment in September 2010 despite DNA evidence and eyewitness testimony. The woman fell pregnant after the alleged attack following a night out at a Denver nightclub, and DNA tests showed that Cox was the father of the baby. Scroll down for video . Not guilty: Former Denver Broncos cornerback Perrish Cox rests his head before he is acquitted in sexual assault trial . When the verdict was read out Cox hugged . his attorney, while the alleged victim cried out in disbelief. As she was leaving the courtroom, she said, 'Oh my God, what's . happening?' Cox expressed appreciation for his attorney, Harvey Steinberg, and others who supported him during the trial. 'I love my lawyer and everybody else who's been,' with me, he said. Steinberg had disputed the DNA test results and suggested they may have been contaminated. During the cross-examination of witnesses, he tried to paint a picture of drunkenness and of the alleged victim being able to interact with people without remembering. 'We always felt there were substantial holes in the case,' he said after the verdict. 'We had hoped they (the jury) would see those same holes.' Jurors left the courthouse without commenting. Cox denied having sex with the woman, who testified that she believed she was drugged because she remembers little about what happened. Cox was charged with one count of sexual assault while the victim was physically helpless and one count of sexual assault while the victim was incapable of determining the nature of the conduct. He faced two years to life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors had laid out what they believed was a straightforward case. They cited the DNA evidence, as well as testimony from Cox's teammate, Demaryius Thomas, who said he saw Cox carry her onto his bed and say, 'she's ready.' Prosecutor Chris Gallo said Cox's statement showed what state of mind he was in. Gallo told jurors that Cox expected to have sex with another woman at the apartment, Carthy Che, who testified she was sick. And there was the alleged victim, lying on his bed and 'ready.' Shock verdict: Cox's acquittal was met with disbelief by the alleged victim . Relief: Cox, right, with his attorney Harvey Steinberg, who he embraced after the verdict was read out . Jurors heard from the alleged victim . on Wednesday. Cox did not testify, but jurors on Friday saw a portion of . an interview with detectives conducted the night he was arrested.

'I . never raped nobody,' Cox told the detective as both spoke in loud . voices. 'I'm losing it because, seriously, I never touched this girl.' The interview ends with Cox asking: 'I'm going to jail? You're kidding me. What am I supposed to do? I didn't.' Cox . also told the detectives that Che, who he was dating at the time, was . also at the apartment. He said he could have had sex with her if he . wanted sex. Young player: Cox, 25, was a rookie out of Oklahoma State who had played eight games for the Broncos when he was arrested . Cox, 25, was a rookie out of Oklahoma State who had played eight games for the Broncos when he was arrested. His legal troubles capped a tumultuous time for the Broncos, who had dealt with the drive-by slaying of cornerback Darrent Williams on New Year's Day 2007, running back Damien Nash's fatal heart attack in March 2007 and receiver Kenny McKinley's suicide in September 2010. The Broncos said they had no comment on the verdict since Cox no longer is with the organization. Prosecutors said they wouldn't immediately comment on the verdict. The accuser's attorney, Craig Silverman, didn't respond to a request for comment. Steinberg said he realised the trial was a terrible ordeal for the woman.

They also said King had made jokes about Lane and said he was going to beat him up. Prosecutor David Joyce alleged at Lane's first court appearance that . Lane 'did not know the students, but chose them randomly'. 'This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs. This is someone who is not well,' he said. The students said they did not believe . this and they had heard the alleged shooter had been doing weights in recent weeks to . bulk up so he could fight his love rival. Nate Mueller, who was sitting at the table with the victims the day of . the shooting, told ABC News that he watched Lane take his second shot.

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 03:05 EST, 5 March 2012 . Around seven million adults in the UK take statins . Taking statins can raise blood sugar levels and increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has revealed. The FDA said they will add a warning to statin labels that they  may raise levels of blood sugar. FDA spokeswoman Amy Egan, said: 'Their benefit is indisputable, but they need to be . taken with care and knowledge of their side effects.' Seven million people in the UK now take the drugs to lower their cholesterol - the fatty substance in the blood that clogs up arteries. They are proven to prevent heart attacks and strokes  and are taken by  as many as one in three adults over the age of 40. The pills cost around 40p a day and make up nearly a fifth of all medicines prescribed for heart and circulatory disease. However, in the UK the labels are still 'in the process of being updated to include these warnings.' So while popular brands including Pfizer Inc's . Lipitor and AstraZeneca's Crestor will need . to include a new warning on their labels in the U.S., they will not have to on the same products in the UK. This is despite the Medicines and healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) publishing a safety alert on its website in January, saying there is 'sufficient evidence' to support a link between statin use and diabetes. The MHRA points out that the risk appears to be mainly in patients already at increased risk of developing diabetes. It added in a statement that the 'benefits of statins strongly outweigh any risks.' However, it's not the first time that statin labeling has hit controversy. In February 2008, the MHRA found that memory loss was another rare side effect of taking statins. The regulator said product information would be updated to reflect this, however labels were not updated until November 2009. High doses of cholesterol-lowering pills can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes, researchers warn . According to a commentary piece in the Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin, published in the British Medical Journal, the delay was caused by a drug company who stalled the process by quibbling over the precise 'wording' on the labels. 'A drug company has been . able to stall the . inclusion of key safety warnings. In our . view, this situation is unacceptable and should be rectified quickly,' it said. In the U.S, the FDA said that statins labels will also hold a warning about the increased risk of confusion and memory loss. It also announced it is removing the requirement that doctors should monitor a patient's liver enzymes for organ damage, saying 'such serious damage is rare, and regular testing for all users isn't necessary.' However, regular liver enzyme tests are still advised by the NHS and are set to continue. The Cochrane Library recently said there . was little evidence statins had a protective effect unless a person’s risk of a heart . attack was already high. Warnings . about side effects such as fatigue, muscle pain, sexual dysfunction and . weakness, continue to emerge, with estimates ranging from one to 20 per . cent of patients affected. However, a daily dose of statins has also been linked with preventing cancer. It could slash the risk of breast cancer recurring, according to a study from Harvard Medical School published in December 2011. They found that women who had . developed a breast tumour were nearly 30 per cent less likely to suffer a . relapse if they took a type of statin called simvastatin. Meanwhile a team at the Cleveland Clinic, in . Ohio, found it cut the risk of prostate cancer. They looked at tissue samples from more than 4,000 men who underwent . biopsies because doctors suspected they had prostate cancer. Those . taking statins for high cholesterol were nearly 10 per cent less likely . to be diagnosed with a tumour and 24 per cent less likely to have an . aggressive cancer than men who were not.","Statin benefit it indisputable but need to be taken with 'knowledge of side effects', says FDA ."
"By . Keith Gladdis . UPDATED: . 03:22 EST, 5 March 2012 . Overjoyed: John and Chenphen Powell with Jasmine . The news could hardly have been more devastating for policeman John Powell. Diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 32, he was given only six months to live and told that aggressive chemotherapy would leave him infertile. That was 21 years ago – and now he and his wife are celebrating the arrival of  a daughter.Mr Powell had a sperm sample frozen before he began the treatment and, when he was finally given the all-clear after two decades, it was used to create baby Jasmine. ‘We couldn’t be happier – she is a wonder of medical science,’ said Mr Powell at home with wife Chenphen in Orpington, Kent. ‘I look at little Jasmine and think she is nothing less than miraculous. I honestly didn’t believe she was real until the moment she was born and I saw her face. Now I hold her and think she is part of me from 20 years ago, before I had chemotherapy. ‘It’s astonishing that something as beautiful and perfect as Jasmine could come out of a time that was so painful and difficult.’ For Mr and Mrs Powell, the birth of their daughter on February 20 is even more of a wonder because they had enough money to fund only one cycle of IVF. They were  also fighting against the clock because strict rules meant Mr Powell’s sperm would have had to be destroyed when he reached the age of 55. Medical staff at the Bridge Centre in London, where they underwent the treatment, believe it is a British record for 20-year-old sperm to be successful in its first cycle. Trevor White, an engineer from Manchester, became a father in 2004 after his sperm had been frozen for 21 years. However baby Daniel was conceived after four separate rounds of IVF. ‘I never thought we would be lucky enough for it to work,’ said 53-year-old Mr Powell, a former superintendent with the Metropolitan force. ‘I didn’t allow myself to believe it had been a success until the moment Jasmine was born.’ Mr Powell already had a daughter, now 23, with his first wife when he was diagnosed with cancer in 1990. They split a few years later and after a period alone he visited Thailand, where friends introduced him to Chenphen. Diagnosed with testicular cancer at the age of 32, Mr Powell¿s sperm would have had to be destroyed when he reached the age of 55 making the birth even more remarkable . They married in March 2008 but only after he warned her that they could probably not have a family. Mrs Powell, 36, said: ‘John explained to me that his cancer meant we were probably not going to be able to have a baby. ‘Obviously I was upset but I loved John so much that all I could think about was our future life together, if that was without children then that was okay. ‘But we knew there was a chance of having a baby with the frozen sperm. I knew we only really had one chance of it working so I didn’t really believe it would. ‘It was so unexpected when we found out I was pregnant, John had a huge smile on his face and it was obvious how happy he was.’ Mr Powell, a keen runner who has coached athletes to world championship level, had the sperm sample frozen in April 1991 and it was exactly 20 years later when his wife found she was pregnant. He is the first Briton to survive a pioneering treatment. Bone marrow was drained from four holes drilled into his pelvis at Guy’s Hospital in London before he was given extremely high doses of chemotherapy. Months later the bone marrow – which had been frozen – was transplanted back into his body and his long road to recovery began. Mr Powell kept a diary throughout the whole traumatic period of his treatment. He said: ‘I was confronted with the prospect of having just six months to live or having a chance of survival if I took the new treatment. I was determined to fight. It was a terrible time and it has only been since we were expecting Jasmine that I have been able to look at the diary again.’ The couple plan to fly to Thailand in September to show their daughter off to Mrs Powell’s mother. ‘She was crying down the phone when I told her Jasmine had been born,’ said Mrs Powell. ‘It is her first grandchild. I don’t know how she is going to wait until September.’","Mr Powell had a sperm sample frozen in 1991 before undergoing chemotherapy .

"By . Ian Drury . UPDATED: . 18:56 EST, 3 February 2012 . Fifty British troops have been killed in Afghanistan without  taking out life insurance. They could not afford premiums of up to £74 a month to cover their loved ones in the event of their death or serious injury. Jim Murphy, Labour’s defence spokesman, said the figures, which he obtained through parliamentary questions, were very worrying. Risking life and limb: British troops in action in Afghanistan are failing to buy life insurance which costs up to £74 per month . He suggested that young soldiers earning a basic private’s salary of just over £17,000 a year would be reluctant to spend the equivalent of 5 per cent of their annual income on an insurance policy. Mr Murphy also discovered that as many as 35,600 troops have served in Afghanistan – braving Taliban bombs, mortars and ambushes – without life insurance. Another 26,400 took out less than the maximum cover. ‘It is a real concern that there are so many service personnel without life insurance,’ he said. ‘The Government must do more to ensure it is affordable and available for those making huge sacrifices and taking enormous risks. ‘Forces families understand the importance of this issue and will expect their loved ones to receive the highest levels of information, support and care.’ Most of Britain’s armed forces take out Pax life insurance, a specially tailored voluntary scheme run for the Ministry of Defence by finance giant Aon. The scheme was set up in 1989 to provide cover for military personnel. Many high street insurance companies are reluctant to sell life insurance to servicemen and women, especially if they are about to deploy to a warzone. Since April 2007, 55,900 troops have served in Afghanistan covered by Pax. Under the scheme, soldiers can buy one unit of cover for £4.94 a month, or the maximum of 15 units for £74.10. A basic policy pays out from £10,000 if a soldier is killed and £20,000 for loss of limbs or vision. Action: 35,600 troops who have been sent to Afghanistan don't have life insurance. A further 26,400 had less than maximum cover . If a finger or toe is lost in battle, the scheme offers compensation starting from £7,000. Sources at the MoD said soldiers got an operational allowance of £5,400 for a six-month tour of duty in a warzone. ‘You could suggest that £74 a month is a wise investment for a private soldier to make,’ said one. An MoD spokesman said: ‘This is just opportunism from Labour. It is rich for Jim Murphy to criticise the Pax scheme when it’s the same one that existed when Labour were in power. ‘All service personnel injured as a result of services will benefit from the increased amounts of money provided through the armed forces compensation scheme which is completely taxpayer-funded. ‘Insurance is voluntary. Pax is just one of a number of insurance schemes available which are well publicised to all service personnel.’ Defence minister Andrew Robathan said: ‘Information on the personal insurance cover available is specifically provided to personnel during initial training and on pre-deployment briefings, including information on schemes specifically designed with the needs of service personnel in mind.’ The Government provides lump sum compensation payments of up to £570,000 for wounded troops. A total of 397 British troops have died since the military mission started in Afghanistan in 2001.","£74 per month premium equivalent of 5% of a young soldier's salary .

"By . Emily Allen . CREATED: . 04:39 EST, 2 November 2011 . WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange has lost his High Court bid to block extradition to Sweden where he faces sex crime allegations. Two judges rejected claims that extraditing the 40-year-old Australian would be 'unfair and unlawful'. The Swedish authorities want Assange, a 40-year-old Australian, to answer accusations of 'raping' one woman and 'sexually molesting and coercing' another in Stockholm in August last year. Lost: WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange has lost his High Court bid to block extradition to Sweden where he faces sex crime allegations. He is pictured arriving at the High Court this morning . The founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, centre, arrives for his extradition hearing at the High Court in London . Today, the High Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Howard Riddle . at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south London, in February that the . computer expert should be extradited to face investigation. Assange, whose WikiLeaks website . published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several . governments and international businesses, denies the allegations and . says they are politically motivated. Assange's supporters, including journalist John Pilger, gathered outside the High Court in London today awaiting his arrival. But, there was no sign of the celebrity circus that supported him earlier this year, including socialite Jemima Khan, Tony Benn, Bianca Jagger, and film-maker Ken Loach. Ms Khan publicly contributed £20,000 towards Assange's £200,000 bail when he was arrested in December last year. Celebrity support: Jemima Khan contributed to Mr Assange's £200,000 bail and was photographed supporting him in February . Celebrity supporters who turned up to support Assange in February including left, Jemima Khan and Tony Benn  and right, Bianca Jagger, a social and human rights advocate, but they did not show up today . A supporter of the WikiLeaks founder holds a placard outside The High Court. Supporters were not hopeful for good news but pledged to continue to back the Australian . Dressed in a sharp, navy blue suit and wearing a Remembrance Day poppy, . the world's most famous whistleblower was mobbed as he approached the . court building and police had to redirect him away from the crowd. Assange nodded and smiled at his supporters, who broke into a round of applause as he passed. Fixed to the iron railings of the court were banners reading 'Free Assange! Free Manning! End the wars'. Memoir: An unauthorised autobiography published against Mr Assange's wishes sold less than 700 copies in its first three days on release last month . However, moments later the judges ruled that the issuing of the European arrest warrant . (EAW) that led to Assange's arrest and all subsequent proceedings to . achieve extradition were 'proportionate'. They dismissed Assange's argument that the warrant was invalid . because it had been issued by a prosecutor, and not a 'judicial . authority'. The judges held the action of the prosecutor was subject to the . independent scrutiny of Swedish judges, 'which, as judges of another . (EU) member state, we must respect'. The court also rejected Assange's assertion that the descriptions of . the offences were not a fair and accurate description of the conduct . alleged against him. Bradley Manning is the detained American soldier alleged to have . leaked hundreds of thousands of US diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. The judges said that any application by Assange to appeal to the Supreme Court would be decided at a further hearing at a date to be fixed. Assange showed no emotion and made notes while President of the Queen's Bench Division, Sir John Thomas, read out a summary of the court's reasons for its ruling. The Assange legal challenge, which has attracted worldwide attention, centred on a European arrest warrant (EAW) issued by a Swedish prosecutor which led to Assange's arrest in December last year. His QC, Ben Emmerson, argued at a two-day hearing in July that the prosecutor was not a 'judicial authority' entitled to issue the EAW. The warrant had also contained 'fundamental misstatements' of what occurred in Stockholm last August while Assange was in Sweden to give a lecture, said the QC. One of Assange's supporters who did turn up was journalist John Pilger who is pictured talking to reporters outside the High Court . Ellingham Hall in Bungay, Norfolk where Assange has been staying as part of his bail conditions. He has denied any wrongdoing . Assange's encounters with the two women involved consensual sex and would not be considered crimes in England, he said. The EAW was misleading in its accusations that he had used violence or 'acted in a manner to violate sexual integrity', said Mr Emmerson. Assange burst into the public . consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - . video footage of a US air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007. The . whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million . documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines . in 2010 with a series of leaks. The . US Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were . drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise the profile of Assange. He . recently revealed that the site is at risk of closure and is suspending . its publishing operations to concentrate on fighting a financial . blockade and raising new funds. The . stricken website is running on cash reserves after an 'arbitrary and . unlawful financial blockade' was imposed by Bank of America, Visa, . MasterCard, PayPal and Western union last December, said Assange. These 'mis-descriptions' were at odds with descriptions given by the women themselves about what had occurred. Supporters outside the court said they were 'outraged' by the judges' decision. Susan Gianstefani, 44, held a sign asking: 'Why are we persecuting the innocent?' The Australian Christian worker, who had come from south London with . her husband to show her support, said: 'I think he's a hero for truth . and exposing corruption. 'I think they're out to get him - the system in general and, I think, the US and Australian governments. 'He's made a lot of enemies in high places.' Ciaron O'Reilly, 51, said: 'We've got to stop the war and free Assange and Bradley Manning. 'Assange is probably the most amazing person in recent history who's . upset so many powerful people in such a short space of time so it's . obviously not a level playing field.' His fans declared they would continue to give Assange their full support. Still conspicuous: Mr Assange was wearing a mask at the Occupy London demonstration earlier this month . In July, the High Court heard how Assange told a woman he stands accused of raping that he wanted to impregnate her and other ‘virgins’ in August last year after he visited Sweden to give a lecture. He is said to have told his alleged victim in Stockholm: ‘Sweden is a good country to have kids in.’ The court also heard that Assange had a ‘strange’ discussion with the museum worker and she later awoke to find him having unprotected sex with her. He is accused of saying he ‘wanted to impregnate women’ and that he ‘preferred virgins because he would be the first to impregnate them’. The former computer hacker is also accused of ‘violently’ forcing himself on another woman in Stockholm. Assange denies the allegations and has always claimed that they were politically motivated and linked to the . activities of the whistleblower website.

"By . Ian Drury . UPDATED: . 05:39 EST, 3 February 2012 . Fears: Nick Clegg said he worried the U.S. and Israel may 'take matters into their own hands' and launch a pre-emptive strike against Iran . Iran is developing a missile with a 6,200-mile range capable of reaching Britain, it was revealed yesterday. The rogue state’s new weapon could also deliver an attack as far away as America’s East Coast. Israel’s deputy prime minister Moshe Ya’alon made the chilling claim as his country’s military chiefs revealed Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to produce four nuclear warheads. Nick Clegg last night expressed concern . that the U.S. and Israel would ‘take matters into their own hands’ and . launch a military strike against Iran. The West fears that Iran will equip its missiles with nuclear devices. Defence sources in Tel Aviv predicted there could be a strike against the Iranian regime as early as this summer. Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: ‘I worry that certain countries might take matters into their own hands.’ Iran insists it is developing atomic technology for civilian purposes. Military chiefs in Israel announced that Tehran had stockpiled enough enriched uranium to produce four nuclear bombs. Mr Clegg spoke out as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned Israel to resolve the standoff with Iran peacefully. Threatening: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad says they are only enriching uranium for civilian purposes - but the claims are disbelieved . Asked if he was concerned that Israel would attack Iran, the LibDem leader said: ‘Of course I worry that there will be a military conflict and that certain countries might take matters into their own hands.’ He said Britain had been attempting to demonstrate that ‘there are very tough things we can do which are not military steps in order to place pressure on Iran.’ Last week the European Union agreed to tougher economic sanctions, including an embargo on Iranian oil exports, over its failure to abandon its nuclear programme. Iran threatened to retaliate by closing the Strait of Hormuz, which channels one-fifth of the world’s crude oil, prompting Britain to warn it would send military reinforcements to the Gulf if the international waterway was blocked. The Royal Navy already has five ships there with HMS Daring, one of its sophisticated new Type 45 destroyers, on its way. Mr Clegg refused to speculate if Britain would ‘participate’ in military action. But he said: ‘Of course, in a situation like this you don’t take any options off the table. ‘When you are involved in a major standoff with a country which appears to have a... hostile intent on these issues, of course you don’t do that.’ Escalating row: U.S. have sent the USS Abraham Lincoln to the Strait of Hormuz along with British warships after Iran threatened to close the strait . Meanwhile, Israel’s deputy prime minister Moshe Ya’alon told a security conference that Iran was successfully building long-distance ballistic missiles. He said the weapons, with a range of 10,000km (6,200miles), were ‘aimed at America, not us’ although a missile that could be fired such a distance could also strike Britain. Mr Ya’alon said: ‘Such a non-conventional regime should not have such non-conventional capabilities.’ He told the annual Herzliya national security conference in Israel that an Iranian military compound that mysteriously exploded on November 12 last year was developing long-range missiles. At least 17 people, including a general, died in a blast on the base around 20miles west of Tehran. Iran said an ammunition dump had exploded but the destruction was widely blamed on foreign intelligence services. Major-General Aviv Kochavi, Israel’s chief of military intelligence, said that Iran could make four atomic bombs by enriching uranium it had already stockpiled. He said that from the moment Iran’s spiritual leaders ‘give an order... to speed up production of the first nuclear explosive device, we estimate it will take about a year to complete the task.’","Missile strike on Iranian regime could take place this summer, defence sources suggest .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 08:58 EST, 6 March 2012 . A former Rutgers University student accused of using a webcam to spy on his roommate's intimate encounter with another man told his friends he was hosting a 'viewing party' with beer and rum to watch the dorm room liaison. The revelation came in testimony from Michelle Huang, a Cornell University student who says Dharun Ravi told her about it in a text message on September 21, 2010. Ravi, 20, is on trial for 15 criminal counts, including invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and several charges accusing him of trying to cover his tracks. Glance: Dharun Ravi looked at spectators during his trial at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick, yesterday. He is accused of spying on his roommate . Bias intimidation is a hate crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The roommate, Tyler Clementi, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge between New York and the state of New Jersey on September 22, 2010- the day after Ravi supposedly sent the explosive text. Prosecutors are trying to prove that Ravi intentionally tried to humiliate Mr Clementi. Ms Huang testified that Ravi urged her to video chat him so she could see the webcam footage. 'Do it for real,' Ravi wrote in a text that was shown to jurors. 'I have it pointed at his bed.' People were planning a 'viewing party with a bottle of Bacardi and beer' to watch the web stream that night, Ms Huang said. Ms Huang knew more about the situation than just the party, as she had texted with Ravi repeatedly before learning about his plans for when Mr Clementi’s romantic interest returned to the room. 'Did you really see him make out with some guy lmao?' Ms Huang asked following Ravi's first time using the webcam. 'He was older and creepy and def from the internet,' Ravi responded referring to the man with Mr Clementi who is only identified as M.B. 'That's so nastyyy,' Ms Huang responded. 'Ew watch out he might come for you when you're sleeping.' Tragic end: Rutgers student Tyler Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge in 2010 after webcam footage showing he and another man kissing circulated the internet . Residence hall: Clementi and Ravi lived in Room 30 of Davidson Hall . Before telling her about the planned viewing party, Ravi responded by texting: 'I got so creeped out after Sunday'. 'Keep the gays away,' he continued. It was the first mention of a planned party in the trial, which started its seventh day of testimony on Monday. Ms Huang later testified that after Clementi had killed himself, Ravi texted her that the talk of a viewing party was a joke. Witnesses have said the webcam wasn't working that night. Ravi isn't charged in Mr Clementi's death, and the judge has been cautious about how the suicide would come into the trial. Prosecutors are precluded from linking the spying allegations to the suicide as defense lawyers cannot make the case that Clementi killed himself for other reasons. When prospective jurors were brought . into the courtroom last month for the first time, the judge told them . that it was the case involving Mr Clementi and that Mr Clementi had . killed himself. The issue . came up today when Ms Huang testified about hearing from Ravi that his . roommate had committed suicide. The university sent counselors to his . room and suggested he take several days off, he said, describing Rutgers . officials in a text as very helpful. Overseeing: Superior Court Judge Glenn Berman addressed the courtroom during the trial of Dharun Ravi today . Mystery witness: A man who identifies himself only as M.B. told the court today that he noticed the webcam in Clementi and Ravi's room and that he and Clementi met on a gay dating website . After that testimony, which emerged during cross-examination by Ravi's lawyer, Assistant Prosecutor Julia McClure told the judge that she might recall some earlier witnesses to ask them about conversations with Ravi about the suicide. Judge Glenn Berman said he had allowed the questioning of Ms Huang to continue because jurors might not have understood the texts without that context. But he was apprehensive about delving further into the death because Ravi isn't charged with it. 'My preference is we don't talk about it,' he said. Before Monday, it had mostly come up in passing. In her testimony last week, Rutgers student Alissa Agarwal was asked what day she spoke with investigators. She matter-of-factly said it was the day after Mr Clementi committed suicide. On Friday, the man witnesses said was seen in the web stream kissing Mr Clementi took the stand. The man, who was identified in court only by the initials M.B., was asked about how late he intended to stay in Mr Clementi's room when they met there on September 21. He answered: 'There was every reason to believe that I was going to see him again.' He wasn't asked more and didn't say more. Grief: Stone-faced Joseph and Jane Clementi sit in the courtroom before the start of Friday's trial . Harrowing: Tyler Clementi's brothers James and Brian sat with their parents and other family members in the front row in the courtroom yesterday . The lack of testimony about Mr Clementi's death has created some gaps in the story's timeline. It has been widely reported that Mr Clementi left a final Facebook status on the night of his death: 'Jumping off the gw bridge, sorry.' A Rutgers police officer testified that about an hour after the message appeared, he was dispatched to Mr Clementi's room to try to determine his whereabouts. But the officer didn't say why he was dispatched to check on the student. There is one constant reminder in the courtroom of the death: Mr Clementi's parents and other relatives — including, at times, both of his older brothers — sat through each of the first six days of the trial. The family has set up a foundation to honor Mr Clementi, and one of its main goals is suicide prevention. In interviews with The Associated Press, his parents, Joe and Jane Clementi, and his brother, James, say they don't know why he killed himself — a question the trial won't seek to answer. 'I'm not sure that knowing why it happened makes it any better or makes it any easier,' James Clementi said in an interview last month. 'Someone I love so much isn't here.'

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 08:29 EST, 8 March 2012 . A blundering minister said a woman from Bolton who is looking for work should apply for a job in 'nearby' Sunderland - which is in fact 143 miles away. Economic secretary Chloe Smith said the part-time carer should look for a full-time job at the expanding Nissan factory in the north-east. If the worker was to commute to Sunderland, the journey would take two-and-a-half hours to drive - or four hours on the train. Blunder: Chloe Smith told David Crausby that his constituent should work in 'nearby' Sunderland . Ms Smith, 29, made the mistake while responding to a parliamentary question from Bolton North East Labour MP David Crausby. He wanted to know what his constituent could do as her working hours were being cut. Ms Smith said the woman, who is employed by the Stroke Association in . Bolton, should take a 'clear look around at the opportunities . available', saying job vacancies were on the rise. She during Treasury Questions in the House of Commons on Tuesday: 'There are jobs out there. Members need only to hear this morning’s announcement from Nissan - . somewhere near the honourable gentleman’s constituency - to know that . there is work available.' A spokesman for the Treasury claimed Ms . Smith thought she was responding to an MP from the north-east near the . Nissan plant rather than a Bolton MP. Long distance: Bolton is 144 miles from Sunderland - and it would take an estimated two-and-a-half hours to drive . A change in the rules for people . claiming working tax credit means that, from April, couples must work a . combined minimum of 24 hours a week. Chloe Smith's rapid rise to become the youngest minister in government took some colleagues by surprise. But extraordinary claims circulated at Westminster that Chloe Smith was appointed because David Cameron was confused about her credentials. Miss Smith, who became the youngest MP in Parliament when she won the Norwich North by-election in 2009, was promoted to become Economic Secretary last year. At the age of 29 years, four months and 27 days, she became the youngest minister in government, making an ascent to the political frontline unparalleled in modern times. However, according to an account of the phone call giving her the good news, the Prime Minister was under the misapprehension that she had been a chartered accountant and would therefore be well suited to the post. In fact, she is a former management consultant at Deloitte. After Mr Cameron told Miss Smith he would like to offer her the post, she is said to have replied: ‘Well, thank you Prime Minister. . .It would be an honour, but the Treasury…it’s a little daunting…’ The Prime Minister allegedly responded: ‘Not daunting surely for someone who was a chartered accountant?’ The Norwich North MP is then said to have admitted: ‘Er, well, actually Prime Minister, I wasn’t an accountant. I was a management consultant in an accountancy firm.’ Mr Cameron apparently then said ‘never mind’ and welcomed Miss Smith aboard. The previous minimum was 16 hours, meaning the Stroke Association worker now falls below the threshold. The association was forced to slash . the hours of two of its support workers after losing out on . £17,000-worth of funding from Bolton Council. Mr Crausby accused Ms Smith, the Norwich North MP, of 'knowing nothing about the north'. He said: 'She clearly didn’t know what she was talking about on the whole issue. It was a ridiculous answer. It wasn’t facetious, more naive. 'To be frank, it was typical of a southern MP who knows nothing about the North. They have little experience of our part of the world.' Julie Elliott, Labour MP for Sunderland Central, said: 'It’s not a slip of the tongue to know how far away Bolton is from Sunderland. 'Bolton is quite a famous town in the north west of England and I think someone in her position should know that.' 'The Tories are completely out of touch with the North of England.' Nissan announced earlier this week it would produce its small car, the Invitation, in Sunderland from 2013 at a rate of 100,000 a year. The workforce in Sunderland is expected to rise by 600 to 6,000 people, although it may create as many as 2,000 extra jobs in the supply chain. Nissan has been helped with a £9.3million offer of funding from the Government’s £2.4 billion Regional Growth Fund. Mr Crausby added: 'We should be trying to encourage people to go into work, not on to benefits. 'To increase the number of hours people need to work to gain working tax credit will put a lot of people in difficult circumstances.' A spokesman for the Stoke Association said the council was reconsidering its decision to cut funding and that the hours of the two workers may be restored. A spokesman for the Treasury said: 'The Economic Secretary inadvertently and briefly mistook a Labour MP’s constituency. 'The point she was making is that Nissan’s announcement is excellent news for the north east and a positive sign for the whole UK economy.'","Chloe Smith said underemployed worker should look for work at Sunderland's Nissan factory .

"By . Jenny Hope . UPDATED: . 06:42 EST, 6 March 2012 . Around one in five of 900,000 Britons with heart failure - almost 200,000 patients - could benefit from the treatment . A pill costing only £1.40 a day could save the lives of thousands of heart failure patients every year. The drug ivabradine, which slows the heart rate and improves its pumping ability, cut deaths by up to 39 per cent in trials. Professor Martin Cowie, consultant cardiologist and specialist in heart failure at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said that at a conservative estimate it could save between 5,000 and 10,000 lives a year. It could also slash National Health Service costs by cutting hospital admissions by more than a quarter. Ivabradine, . also known as Procoralan, is licensed in the UK for treating angina and . has been available on the NHS for around five years with a good safety . record. But today it is being licensed by European safety regulators for treating heart failure. The . NHS drug-rationing body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical . Excellence, has yet to decide whether it is affordable for treating . heart failure, but around 20,000 patients currently take it for angina. Prof Cowie, who was involved in a trial of 6,500 patients, insisted it would save the NHS money. He said: ‘I hope this gets approved because it’s very good value for money in reducing the number of hospitalisations alone.’ Made by Servier, the drug is relatively cheap, costing the NHS about £500 a year per patient. Around one in five of 900,000 Britons with heart failure – almost 200,000 patients – could benefit from the treatment. Trial findings showed a 39 per cent reduction in death from heart failure, a 17 per cent drop in the risk of dying from any cause and a 26 per cent cut in the need for hospital stays among patients using the drug. Professor Martin Cowie, left, has insisted the drug will save the NHS money. The drug ivabradine slows the heart rate and improves its pumping ability . Prof Cowie said today’s European . licensing decision was ‘great news for both doctors and patients, and . is a significant step forward in the management of heart failure’. He . added ivabradine would make a dramatic difference to many who could not . take beta blockers, the standard drugs used to reduce heart rate. He said even some on the maximum beta blocker dose still had a heart rate that was too fast – more than 75 beats a minute. Ivabradine lowers the rate to around 60 beats a minute without reducing blood pressure, which means the damaged heart pumps more efficiently at a slower rate. Prof Cowie said: ‘Heart failure is a very common problem. We have trial results showing ivabradine not only improves symptoms and prevents disease progression, but also helps patients return to normal daily activities and increases their enjoyment of life. 'One in five patients could benefit – the key to whether current treatment is working is whether their heart beat is still too high. This is easy to check – a doctor just has to take their pulse, or the patient can do it.’ Around 100,000 people a year are . thought to die from heart failure, which occurs when damage to the organ . leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently around the body. Professor Martin Cowie, consultant cardiologist and specialist in heart failure at the Royal Brompton Hospital, said that ivabradine could save between 5,000 and 10,000 lives a year . About . 68,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. Symptoms include fatigue, . breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles. Treating . heart failure soaks up one to two per cent of the total NHS budget, . with direct medical costs alone amounting to £625million a year. Scientists have also been developing a once-a-day pill that could halve the risk of heart disease and strokes for millions. The . Red Heart ‘polypill’ combines low-dose aspirin, a statin called . simvastatin to reduce cholesterol and two blood pressure-lowering . medicines, lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The . pill, which has been put through trials by the George Institute for . Global Health in Sydney, Australia, will cost £4 a month per patient, . but it is unlikely to be available in Britain for several years.","Ivabradine slows the heart rate and improves its pumping ability .

The clothes Jane Bashara was wearing the day of her murder have gone missing - and may have been disposed of, it has been revealed. After the 56-year-old’s body was discovered in her SUV the morning of January 25, her remains, as well as the clothes she was wearing, were sent to the A.H. Peters Funeral Home in Grosse Pointe Woods. However, the Michigan State crime lab never got the marketing executive’s clothing, and there it is possibility that the evidence could have been destroyed, a fact which is devastating to all parties involved. Scroll down for videos . Crucial evidence: The clothes Jane Bashara was wearing the day she was murdered have gone missing and may have been thrown out . The forensic evidence alone could have exonerated Bob Bashara, Ms Bashara’s husband, his attorney David Griem told the Detroit Free Press. Or, it may have provided new insight into the case for 48-year-old handyman Joseph Gentz, who was arrested last week and charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Gentz’s court-appointed attorney Susan Reed, told the Free Press: ‘You’d think they’d keep track of it, but maybe I’ve been watching too much CSI on television. She added: ‘And what do I know? I’ve only been trying murder cases for 30-some years.’ Records from the Wayne County Medical Examiner’s Office show that she was brought there for an autopsy on January 26 and was dropped off at the A.H Peters Funeral home the next day. The black stretch pants, green-blue blouse, house shoes, and underwear were released to the funeral home by Bob Bashara, records show. Murder: Jane Bashara lived with her husband Bob in the upper-Middle class neighbourhood of Grosse Point, Michicagn . Funeral director Phillip Potter told the Free Press yesterday that he didn’t recall what happened to the clothing. However, it is customary procedure to dispose of clothing not requested by police, especially if it was blood-stained or dirty. Mr Griem said the loss of the clothing is ‘devastating news for the family,’ adding: ‘This is a significant roadblock in the search for truth and justice for Jane Bashara.’ 'You'd think they'd keep track of (the evidence), but maybe I’ve been watching too much CSI. What do I know? I’ve only been trying murder cases for 30-some years.' -Attorney Susan Reed . Many are again questioning the quality of police work done in the case, which has come into question multiple times. The Bashara’s Grosse Pointe home was searched twice; it was only after the second search that blood was recovered in the garage. And the home of Bob Bashara’s alleged mistress was only searched last week. Handyman Joseph Gentz, 48, was . arraigned for first-degree murder last week after police arrested him . more than a month after he admitted to killing marketing executive Jane . Bashara. Gentz is also . facing conspiracy charges, which likely mean authorities believe more . than one person was involved, though that doesn’t indicate that person . would be charged.

Pointe police raided the home of Bob Bashara’s alleged mistress. Rachel . Gillet, 50, had told police earlier that she and Mr Bashara were dating. She was not named a person of interest in the case. Gentz was released last month from the Detroit prison after police claimed they not find enough evidence against him. His release was yet another bizarre twist in the murder mystery of Ms Bashara, who was found dead in January 25 in her Mercedes SUV eight miles from her home. ABC News reported that five unmarked police cars surrounded Ms Gillet’s home early this morning, and left around four hours later carrying seven cardboard boxes, a paper bag, and an additional evidence box. The building’s landlord, Phyllis Huxley, told ABC News that she never received a warrant and was not asked permission before officers entered the home. Meanwhile, Gentz’s court-appointed attorney Susan Reed told the Detroit Free Press that she hasn’t discussed a plea deal with her client. Attorney David Griem said he was unsure if his client Bob Bashara would be charged in the case. ‘I don’t have a crystal ball,’ he said. Nevertheless, he speculated: ‘I guess the next step is to offer Joe Gentz a deal he can’t refuse to testify against Bob Bashara.’ Strangled: Jane Bashara was found dead in her Mercedes SUV on January 25 eight miles away from her home. Bob, right, is said to have been having an affair . Gentz was already wearing blue prison . attire at the time of his arraignment. CBS Detroit’s . legal analyst speculated that Gentz’s arrest would by no means be the . last in this case. ‘Conspiracy means by definition, some . other person. I cannot conspire with myself to commit murder. I need . somebody else. And the big question of the day: Who is that person?’ Ms Bashara’s husband Bob, 54, has . been in the public eye for his place in the murder, for one because . police discovered a secret S&M dungeon in one of Mr Bashara’s . properties, and more significantly because Gentz told officers that Mr . Barshara requested the hit on his wife. Mr Bashara, who remains a person of . interest, maintains his innocence. Last month, he told ABC News . exclusively: ‘I did nothing wrong. I didn’t commit murder. I didn’t pay . to have my wife killed. I’m going to see this through to the end. And . I’m innocent.’ Meanwhile, Gentz remains in jail, and pending a competency evaluation, will appear in court March 16 for a preliminary exam. Property: Bashara was said to have a 'sex dungeon' with whips and chains in the basement of the Hard Luck bar and Lounge . Murdered: Jane Bashara was found strangled in the back of her Mercedes SUV in January . When police first began to investigate Mr Bashara, they uncovered an S&M sex dungeon equipped with whips and chains. Mr Bashara was also preparing to buy a $245,000 home for his longtime mistress, the Detroit Free Press reported. Police named Mr Bashara the lone 'person of interest' in the case, but he denies he had anything to do with his wife's murder. Instead, his lawyer David Griem suggested Gentz is mentally handicapped and that his story about being hired by Mr Bashara is not credible. Mr Griem said Gentz is the sole person responsible for Mrs Bashara's death. Gentz's release from police custody sparked outrage from Mr Barashara and Mrs Barasha's family. 'It was a shock and I was scared when I learned he had been released,' Mr Bashara's sister Laura Mauer told the Detroit Free Press. Bashara initially told police about the night his wife died: 'I got home and she wasn’t . around and I relaxed and figured she was out running an errand,' Mr Bashara told 7 Action News. 'As . 9:00 and 9:30 approached, I became much more concerned and I got more . people involved,' he said. 'I called my kids to see if they had heard . from her and they hadn’t. 'I . had been calling her cell phone to find out and then as time got on I . involved the police because I was concerned there might be something . wrong.' After friends and relatives told him they had not seen her, Bashara reported her missing. 'Accomplice': Joe Gentz told police he was paid less than $2,000 to murder Jane by her husband . Scene: Police believe Jane was murdered in her affluent home in an upscale suburb before her body was driven to a run-down version of Detroit . Speaking to the Detroit Free Press, he said: 'I have no clue. Someone obviously had made their way into her car or attacked her and . did what they did to her and dropped her, stashed her car somewhere. 'My heart is broken, and I'm very sad. And it's terrible to think what she had to go through . in the last moments of her life.' Jane Bashara worked as a senior marketing manager at Kema Services, an energy consulting and testing and certification company. The Detroit News reported that Bob Bashara is president of the Grosse Pointe Rotary Club and was involved in various charities. 'They were just a great couple,' neighbour Alex Jones told ABC 7. 'It's hard on their kids to hear something like that. There’s no doubt in my mind that it was not him.'

A British man fell to his death on the last day of a holiday in Spain as he tried to get into his apartment after locking himself out. Father-of-four Tyrone Jones, 42, had lost his key and tried to get into the Benidorm flat by stepping on to a wall, unaware of a four-metre drop on the other side. The top bricks of the wall were loose and he toppled over, suffering fatal head wounds. His grieving relatives believe he lay on the ground for up to five hours before he was seen. Mr Jones, known as Ty, had been in Benidorm on a two-week holiday with a friend. The . motor trader from Exeter, Devon, was taken to hospital and treated in . intensive care but died without having regained consciousness. Hie was the eldest son of David and Margaret Jones, who had flown to Spain to be at his bedside. David Jones, also from Exeter, said: 'It was the last day of the holiday . and it seems Ty had been out and was returning to his apartment in the . early hours of the morning. 'He . had mislaid his keys and to reach his apartment he had tried to gain . entry by stepping up on to a wall, not knowing there was at last a . four-metre drop on the other side. 'The top course of bricks were loose causing him to topple and fall and he suffered severe head injuries. 'There were no witnesses and it appears he lay there on his own for about five hours before he was spotted.' Tragedy: Tyrone Jones died on the last day of his holiday in Benidorm, one of the most popular holiday resorts in Spain . Mr Jones died on February 13 - a day after his parents arrived in Spain. His father said: 'We were just talking about arranging . to pick him up from the airport the next day when we got the call out . of the blue about the accident. 'We finally got to the right hospital and Ty was in intensive care on life support.' Some of Mr Jones's organs were donated and helped transform the lives of three people, his family said. David Jones said: 'Nothing more could have been done for him. Skyline: Benidorm was the first resort town to be built on the southern Spanish coast and has one of the highest concentrations of tall apartment buildings in the world . 'The surgeons asked if Ty had considered organ donation and we said he had. 'Margaret and I discussed it and said . yes and we later found out that he had helped to save three people . having donated his kidneys, pancreas and liver. 'It helped a little to . know that.' Mr Jones's parents were joined in Spain by his three eldest children - Anna, 21, Nathan 17 and Charlie, nine. The man's death was initially treated as suspicious, but a local judge later spoke to the family and told them it appeared to have been an accident. David Jones said: 'He saw us in chambers and spoke to us for about 90 minutes. 'He was nearly reduced to tears and . said that as a father himself, if it was his son he would have to accept . that it was a tragic accident and try to move on.' Mr Jones's body was released for cremation and a family service was held in Spain.

"By . Rick Dewsbury . UPDATED: . 17:55 EST, 17 February 2012 . When an amateur chef presented a sloppy sunken souffle to judges on MasterChef he must have feared he was in for some stern criticism. But to the surprise of viewers, the critics were full of praise for the 'absolutely stunning' dish which moments later had mysteriously risen. Now bosses on the BBC One programme have been accused on fixing the scenes in order to show the souffle, cooked by a 26-year-old plasterer Tom Rennolds, standing proudly. Viewers watched as earlier in the show Mr Rennolds  boasted: 'I haven't had one souffle sink yet'. Flop: Chef Tom Rennolds presents his collapsed pineapple and chilli souffle to the judges on the popular BBC 1 show MasterChef . Standing proudly: Moments later the footage cuts to another version of the savoury dish, but unlike the previous attempt this one has risen perfectly . His efforts were less impressive though, and he presented a disappointing sunken dish to judges on the popular cooking show on February 1. The the amazement of viewers, the judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace were seen tucking into a perfect pineapple and chilli soufflé. The edited scenes raised the prospect that show producers had duped viewers by ignoring the failed dish. Some questioned whether Mr Rennolds, from Silsden, West Yorkshire, had been given several attempts at getting the notoriously tricky meal right. Wanna-be chefs on the reality show are sent home at the end of each episode if they fail to impress the judges. But the tall, dark-haired contestant is a former manual labourer, and would prove a popular winner of the show. He is already the favourite to win the competition. The show began with the contestants being split into two teams. Eight of them were later given 90 minutes in the MasterChef kitchen to produce their best meal. What's that? Mr Rennolds, a plasterer, serves up the souffle to food critics John Torode and Gregg Wallace who are clearly unimpressed by the attempt at the tricky dish . Deflated: Mr Rennolds, 26, is almost as sunken as his souffle as he watches the judges sample his dish . Surprise: Judge Mr Wallace tucks into the dish, which he says is 'absolutely stunning'. The scene had been edited to show the souffle looking all fluffy again and the chef was put through to the next round . Earlier in the show, Australian judge . John Torode said: ‘Today he really has got to deliver good quality . food, free of mistakes. He says it's never gone wrong before, there's . always a first time.' Mr Wallace added: 'He makes lots of silly mistakes.' The . savoury main course or dessert, which can have different fillings . added, is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites but is notoriously . difficult to get right. Mr Rennolds chose to cook a chilli and pineapple souffle with coconut and ginger ice cream. Viewers . were shown Mr Rennolds placing two of the ‘very daring’ dishes into the . oven.  It appears that one of the soufflés had risen but the other was a . failure. The collapsed dish was given to the judges but the TV programme showed them eating the one that had risen. A second shot moments later also showed the souffle that had turned out well. Mr Rennolds was praised for his ‘absolutely stunning’ efforts and put through to the next round of the cooking show, which is in its eight series. The other four contestants were criticised but they were allowed to stay in. Critics: Judges Gregg Wallace, left, and John Torode in the MasterChef kitchen where Mr Rennolds cooked the souffle . Mr Wallace said: That's lovely. Datey, elegant, beautiful. Stunning, absolutely stunning. 'As light as a feather, sunshine sweet and a little bit of chilli heat prickling your tongue.' It is unclear just why the footage that was broadcast earlier this year showed both of the dishes. A source close to the show told the Daily Mirror that contestant chefs were often given the chance to cook two souffles because of the ‘temperamental nature’ of the lightly-baked cake. A BBC spokesman added: 'Any suggestion that Tom was allowed several attempts to create a perfect meal is completely untrue.  Contestants always make more than one soufflé.  As time is called at the end of cooking they must put only one up to be filmed, tasted and judged. 'We always shoot the soufflés as soon as time is called and cooking is finished. Then filming the judging continues by which time soufflés have naturally deflated. 'This doesn't affect the tasting or judging at all as the souffle taste remains the same and of course the judges have seen how it looks when first plated up.  We always cut back to the shot of the food as it was when first plated up as a reminder of how the dish looked before the tasting.' The company that produces MasterChef, Shine TV, has already faced questions about altering scenes in shows. It was forced to apologise after using computer trickery to show huge crowds meeting Gordon Ramsay when the show launched in the U.S. There were only a fraction of the people who had turned up for the launch. It later emerged that in the Australian version of the hugely-popular show contestants were given the chance to ‘re-plate’ their creations between scenes. The executive producer of the Australian show admitted at the time: ‘On rare occasions both the contestant and the celebrity chef in MasterChef’s celebrity chef challenge are offered the opportunity to re-plate their dishes between the completion of the challenge and the tasting of the dish.’","Contestant's dish was a flop, but viewers were shown an 'absolutely stunning' souffle standing proudly .

The electric motorbike, dubbed the C-1, is a bizarre combination of car and bike and is set to hit our roads late next year. Created by San Francisco-based automotive company, Lit Motors, the fully-enclosed two-passenger bike uses a gyroscopic stabilising system to stay upright even when it's stationary. Clever: The C-1 stays upright, even when it's stationary . Luxury: The C-1 comes with a host of creature comforts with the makers claiming that it's a unique vehicle . The futuristic bike not only keeps its occupants warm and dry, it also keeps them safe - refusing to fall over even when hit in an accident. But this motorbike doesn't come cheap, it will set buyers back a hefty £15,000 with prices only dropping to £10,000 when production increases. A spokesman at Lit Motors said many people had tried to create something similar in the past but no-one had succeeded. He said: ‘No other vehicles on the road use gyros in this manner. There have been previous attempts but nothing like what we're doing. ‘Think of a child's spinning top toy, as long as it spins, it remains upright on its own, with no outside help. Similarly, as long as the gyros are spinning, the C-1 remains upright. ‘Ours is the only bike which stands upright on its own without training wheels. Best of both worlds: The makers say their invention combines the safety of a car with the fun of a motorbike . ‘This allows for a whole host of car-like features like a bucket seat, a steering wheel, a dashboard, climate control, a sound system, seatbelts and multiple airbags. ‘It is absolutely the first of its kind. The C-1 is a completely new class of vehicle, neither car nor motorcycle. ‘We have married the efficiency, agility, small size, and fun of a motorcycle with the stability, convenience, and most importantly the safety of a car. ‘The increased agility and smaller size as compared to a car means that many accidents can be avoided in the first place. ‘Rather than having to wear a helmet the driver can wear normal clothes, even a suit. The driver will stay safe being fully enclosed in a steel roll cage. Green credentials: The C-1 is fully electric, so it doesn't contribute to urban pollution . ‘We intend to take the C-1 around the world, starting in California and North America, then out to Europe, East Asia, Australia, South Asia, South America, and beyond. ‘We think it will be revolutionary and wildly popular. We're expecting a really strong following because we've created a new class of vehicle. ‘We've designed the perfect urban, commuter vehicle. It is fully electric, so not contributing to urban air pollution at all.’","The C-1 uses a stabilising system that keeps it upright, even at rest .

"Moisture evaporated by the scorching heat will be condensed to feed plantlife - the same system used by the humped mammal's nose . Costing £3.3 million it will stretch for 10,000 square metres across Qatar and will open this year . By . Martin Robinson . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 2 March 2012 . Scientists inspired by a camel's nostrils are set to achieve the impossible and grow a man-made forest in the desert. The £3.3 million giant open-air greenhouse in Qatar will bring plantlife to one of the most inhospitable spots on earth and it is all thanks to the humped mammal's nose. Using a trick of nature the Sahara Forest Project will use surface water and cold water pumped up from 200 metres below the sand to feed trees, vegetables and algae. Pioneering: The sweeping giant greenhouse will be in Qatar and will sustain all sorts of plantlife including trees . Incredible: It is the camel's sophisticated nostrils that allow it to stay alive in intense heat . The irrigation system will work in the same way as a camel's nostrils by constantly condensing water that the heat evaporates during the day. As the animal breaths out moist air, its nose instantly sucks it in and condenses any water, keeping it alive in the harsh desert. Its nostrils also suck in water from the warm humid night air to keep it hydrated. Inspired by this designers say their 10,000 square metre project will use a similar idea, which they have already tested successfully. Using solar power they will pump water throughout the giant glass structure. The hot desert air will evaporate surface water that appears overnight but strategically placed hedges will cool it before it escapes into the sky, keeping the greenhouse at a ideal temperature for growth. Closer look: The system uses solar power to pump water around the site and a similar condensing system to that found in a camel's nostrils to irrigate it . As this cooler moist air created by the hedges flows around the site it will hit the cold pipes containing water pumped from deep below the sand, instantly condensing again. This will then provide a constant source of moisture to feed and grow all the plants there. 'The Pilot Project in Qatar will demonstrate the benefits of reducing waste streams in technological systems. Our message is that it is possible to design solutions that are good for the environment, good for social development and that have a long-term economic sustainability,' said Joakim Hauge, Norwegian CEO of The Sahara Forest Project. Sahara Forest Project’s Michael Pawlyn, who was also one of the lead architects behind Cornwall’s Eden Project, told the New Scientist that exploiting the difference in temperature between surface seawater ensures the project is environmentally friendly. Smart: This graphic shows how evaporative hedges will provide humidity and shelter for plants growing there . In action: Developers have already tested the system, shown here, and hope the giant project will be completed this year . The vegetables and algae grown could then be used for biomass production. Current plans for the plant will see it operating as soon as July, receiving visitors during the COP18 Climate Talks to be held in Doha in November. 'The Pilot Project is designed to fit in an approximately 10,000 m2 area and will consist of Seawater-based greenhouses, Concentrated solar power (CSP) for heat & electricity, Evaporative hedges and ponds for reducing brine to dry salts, Algae cultivation facilities, Vegetated outdoor areas and Halophyte cultivation units,' their design brief says.","Moisture evaporated by the scorching heat will be condensed to feed plantlife - the same system used by the humped mammal's nose .

A British soldier has been jailed for four years in Cyprus for raping a British university student in the popular tourist resort of Ayia Napa last summer. Private Sam Trussler, 25, showed little emotion as the criminal court in Larnaca passed sentence today. Rape carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment in Cyprus. (file picture): Soldier Sam Trussler punched his 22-year-old victim in the face . and sexually assaulted her outside a block of hotel apartments in Aiya . Napa . But the judge decided to show 'maximum leniency' after Trussler’s lawyer argued earlier this week that his client was 'a very successful soldier' who had served in Afghanistan and had no previous criminal record. Dressed in black trousers and a white shirt, Trussler left the small courtroom flanked by policemen to begin his sentence 30 miles away in Cyprus’s only prison in the capital, Nicosia. At the time of his crime Trussler was not stationed on the island but visiting on a training exercise with the 1st Battalion, the Royal Anglian Regiment. Cyprus is home to two sprawling sovereign military British bases. The name of his 22-year-old victim, who was on holiday in Ayia Napa, has not been released. During his trial the court heard that he struck her in the face and then sexually assaulted her outside a block of hotel apartments on July 1 last year after walking her home from a nightclub. He fled the scene when three women from the block ran outside to investigate after hearing the victim’s desperate screams. A state pathologist and gynaecologist who examined the student said there was sufficient evidence to suggest she had been raped. DNA samples from Trussler were also found on her clothes. He was arrested a day after the attack when his victim identified him in a police line-up. His sentence includes the nine months he has spent in custody since then. It is understood to be the most serious charge against a British soldier on the Mediterranean holiday island since 1994. In September that year three off-duty squaddies stationed in Cyprus abducted and brutally killed a young Danish tour guide in Ayia Napa. They were also convicted of conspiring to rape Louise Jensen, 23. Prison: Trussler has spent the last nine months at Nicosia central prisons. He has been jailed for four years . The trio received life sentences that were reduced to 25 years on appeal and were released a few years ago. Nicosia central prisons – where Trussler has spent the last nine months – were built by the island’s former British colonial master at the end of the 19th Century. His trial, which began in November, received little publicity in the local press. Violent crime is rare in Cyprus. After Louise Jensen’s killing nearly two decades ago, the British Army’s top brass on the island cracked down heavily on off-duty drinking and boorish behaviour. As a result, British forces in Cyprus have not been plagued by bad publicity for many years. The strategically-located military bases are unpopular with Greek Cypriots who see them as colonial footprints. Trussler’s conviction means he will automatically be dishonorably discharged from the Army. 'We do not comment on individual cases,” said a British military spokesman said. But 'all those who are found to fall short of the Army’s high standard or who are found to have committed an offence under the Armed Forces Act will be dealt with administratively, up to and including discharge”, he told The Mail.",Most serious charge against a soldier on the Mediterranean holiday island since 1994 .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:34 EST, 8 March 2012 . Police investigating the cold-case deaths of women from more than 30 years ago have linked four of them to a convicted triple murderer who authorities say may have been responsible for as many as 26 slayings. Cops are investigating if Vincent Groves is responsible for 26 murders . District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said Vincent Groves, who died in prison in 1996 at age 42, was tied by DNA to the 1979 killings of women found strangled and partially nude in an alley, an industrial park and a bathtub in Denver. Police used a DNA profile of Groves they recently found from an old murder investigation and linked it to the three separate crime scenes. Groves was serving a life sentence for the 1980s strangling of two young women. He had been released on parole in 1987 after serving five years in prison for killing a third woman in suburban Denver. The 1979 slayings of Emma Jenefor, 25; Joyce Ramey, 23; and Peggy Cuff, 20, bore strong resemblances to Groves’ past killings and the disappearance of a woman that Groves was suspected in, police said. DNA also linked the 1988 slaying of 35-year-old Pamela Montgomery, whose body was found in an alley, to Groves. Groves strangled most of his victims; many were found nude or partially clothed, left in the mountains west of Denver, alleys and fields outside the city, police said. Authorities launched a task force in the late 1980s to investigate a string of slayings after authorities began finding an average of a body a month, all possibly killed by the same person. At that time, Grove was suspected of up to 20 killings between 1979 and 1988, he said. More DNA testing is pending to determine if Groves is linked to other victims, Morrissey said. Groves’ DNA profile was recovered from the case file related to 17-year-old Tammy Woodrum. He returned to prison in 1990 for the slayings of Juanita “Becky” Lovato, 19, and Diane Montoya Mancera, 25. Police had circumstantial evidence linking Groves to three slayings in the late 1970s, including Ramey, and one missing woman. They also suspected Groves of four additional slayings, including Lovato and Mancera, after his release from prison.","Police suspect Vincent Groves of killings in Denver .

"By . Anthony Bond . UPDATED: . 09:24 EST, 8 March 2012 . Syria's deputy oil minister has announced he is defecting from the regime and joining the opposition against President Bashar Assad. In a video posted on YouTube, a man wearing a suit and tie identifies himself as Abdo Husameddine. He says he is defecting because of Assad's brutal crackdown that has killed thousands of people in the past year. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Resignation: Syria's deputy oil minister Abdo Husameddine has announced via YouTube that he is defecting from the regime and joining the opposition against President Bashar Assad . If confirmed, this would be the highest ranking official in Assad's administration to defect since the uprising began a year ago. There have been scores of army defections but civilian government officials have remained largely loyal to Assad's regime. It was not clear when or where the video was filmed and there has been no comment from the Syrian government. Meanwhile, the U.N. humanitarian chief has toured the shattered Syrian district of Baba Amr but found most residents had fled following the bloody military siege. Activists have accused the government of trying to cover up evidence of atrocities there. The month-long crackdown on the rebellious Homs neighborhood brought international condemnation, and the top U.S. military leader said yesterday that President Barack Obama has asked the Pentagon for a preliminary review of military options in Syria. Tragic: Relatives mourn the death of a family member moments after his death after being shot by a Syrian Army sniper . These include enforcement of a no-fly zone and humanitarian airlifts, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate. However, both he and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Mr Obama still believes that economic sanctions and international diplomatic isolation were the best ways to pressure Syrian President Bashar Assad into handing over power. Yesterday's visit to Baba Amr by the U.N. humanitarian chief, Valerie Amos, was the first by an independent outside observer since the Syrian military began its assault of the rebellious neighborhood. A key stronghold of the uprising against Assad, it was wrested from rebel control on March 1. The Syrian regime has kept the neighborhood sealed off over the past six days, saying it was too dangerous for humanitarian workers to enter. But activists accused the government of engaging in a 'mopping-up' operation to hide their atrocities. 'They haven't let anyone in for a week, and now they are going to let them in?' Homs activists Tarek Badrakhan told The Associated Press. Young victim: Nazem Najar, 12, recovers in a hospital after being wounded by a Syrian Army sniper in Idlib, north Syria . 'Today it's simple: They finished their crimes and hid all the proof. Now they think they can show that everything is normal.' A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross said Baroness Amos entered Baba Amr with a team from the Syrian Red Crescent that had been waiting nearly a week to be allowed in and found the ravaged neighborhood deserted. 'The Syrian Arab Red Crescent stayed about 45 minutes inside the neighborhood,' Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said in Geneva. 'Volunteers say that most inhabitants have fled Baba Amr.' American Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also lashed out at the delays in letting aid workers in. 'The regime's refusal to allow humanitarian workers to help feed the hungry, tend to the injured, bury the dead, marks a new low,' she said. 'Tons of food and medicine are standing by while more civilians die and the regime launches new assaults.' Baroness Amos said the aim of her . two-day visit to Syria was 'to urge all sides to allow unhindered access . for humanitarian relief workers so they can evacuate the wounded and . deliver essential supplies.' She . met with Syria's foreign minister and is to meet other government . officials today but it was unclear whether she would be allowed to . return to Baba Amr or deliver any aid. Important role: UN aid chief Valerie Amos is in Syria and has visited Baba Amr . The U.N. says more than 7,500 people have been killed since Syria's uprising began. Activists put the death toll at more than 8,000. Republican Senator John McCain has called on the Obama administration to launch U.S. airstrikes to end Assad's crackdown. But Mr Panetta and Gen. Dempsey described a well-armed Syria that bears little resemblance to what the U.S. military and its allies faced in Libya. Syria's air defenses are five times more sophisticated than Libya's, and its chemical and biological weapons stockpile is 100 times larger, they said. Suppressing the air defences would require a sustained air campaign over an extended period of time with a significant number of aircraft, and the U.S. would have to lead the effort, Gen. Dempsey said. Because the air defences are located in populous neighborhoods, airstrikes could also mean scores of unintended deaths. Rocked: Fire rages in a house in the embattled . northwestern province of Idlib, which is also being targeted in a . crackdown by Assad's troops . After seizing Baba Amr from the rebels, regime forces now appear to be turning their attention to other rebellious areas. A wave of new arrests was reported in Homs by the Local Coordinating Committees, an activist group, as well as assaults on the northern province of Idlib near Turkey. The shift suggests the Syrian military is unable to launch large operations simultaneously, even though the security services remain largely strong and loyal. According to witnesses, Syrian troops shelled the northern villages in Idlib yesterday. There also were reports of snipers in Homs province. Russia and China, powerful Syrian allies that have blocked a Security Council resolution against Syria, have made clear they are still standing by the regime in Damascus. Still, in a sign of China's growing alarm, Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said Beijing was pulling its workers out of Syria because of the violence. In Moscow, Russian leader Vladimir Putin said the government wasn't considering granting political asylum to Assad, shooting down rumors that such an offer is on the table as a way to end the Syrian regime's deadly crackdown.

A special-needs teacher has been charged with child cruelty after allegedly forcing her pupils into a series of degrading punishments. Lavonne Alioth made one student stand in a corner for eight hours and deprived him of adequate food, according to an arrest warrant.

"By . Charles Walford . UPDATED: . 12:00 EST, 28 December 2011 . The BBC newsroom was plunged into chaos when news broke that the Duke of Edinburgh had been taken ill, it was claimed today. Staff were left scrabbling for sombre clothes and black ties in the event that Prince Philip's Christmas Eve heart scare developed into something more serious. The Corporation clearly fear a repeat of Peter Sissons's infamous appearance wearing a burgundy tie when announcing the death of the Queen Mother. BBC newsreader Peter Sissons criticised for not wearing a black tie when he announced the Queen Mother had died in 2002, choosing burgundy instead . Sissons himself told the Telegraph: 'According to my spies, those who were working over this year's holiday period lived in fear that the duke might pop off on their shift.' 'Obituaries and black ties were dusted off, and the festive atmosphere in the newsroom was overshadowed by the certainty  that if they were needed, whichever producer drew the short straw would be consigned to outer darkness once the editorial post mortems started.' Sissons also tells how Tim Luckhurst, a former BBC news editor, when thinking about a senior member of the Royal family dying, would say: 'Please God, not on my shift.' The Queen’s husband was airlifted to Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire on Friday night after he complained of chest pains. Following tests, doctors discovered a blocked artery and inserted a small surgical stent to open it up and restore the blood flow to his heart. Although the procedure is relatively common and considered ‘minimally invasive’, doctors were taking no chances given his age and kept the prince in hospital for four nights – much to the notoriously grumpy royal’s displeasure. The Duke of Edinburgh was all smiles as he left hospital yesterday after receiving treatment for a blocked artery . He was finally released yesterday morning, when he rejoined his family at the Queen's Sandringham estate. Just hours after arriving back at the royal country retreat, he joined members of the Royal Family at a shooting party lunch. The family ate together at Wood Farm in Wolferton, which is situated on the estate and often used as an informal weekend retreat by the royals. Prince Philip was seen sitting in the front seat of a Land Rover as he was driven away from the farmhouse at 1.45pm to return to the main house. Meanwhile the rest of the party returned to the pheasant shoot on the 20,000 acre estate. A keen shot even now, Philip was desperately disappointed to have missed the traditional shoot this year but at least was able to attend the lunch.",Staff keen to avoid a repeat of Queen Mother's death fiasco when Peter Sissons wore Burgundy .
"By . Pamela Owen . PUBLISHED: . 06:32 EST, 10 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:20 EST, 11 March 2012 . Mr Scott's DNA was contaminated with the rape victim's . A teenager who spent months behind bars wrongly accused of rape after a DNA blunder has spoken of his 'relief, anger and disgust' after the charge was dropped. Adam Scott, 19, was due to stand trial next month in connection with a sex attack on a woman at Plant Hill Park in Blackley. His DNA - taken in connection with a separate matter - had contaminated a sample from the victim while being processed at a laboratory run by LGC Forensics. Mr Scott, from Truro in Cornwall, is . now considering taking legal action - and his lawyers are calling for a . public inquiry into the blunder, which could lead to other rape and . murder cases being reopened. Mr . Scott was arrested in Devon about three weeks after the October 2 rape . and brought to Manchester after the results of the compromised DNA test . were sent to cops. During interview he insisted that he had never even been to Manchester. But . LGC, a company used by Greater Manchester Police to carry out . scientific testing in thousands of cases a year, insisted there was a . definite match. Mr Scott was charged despite his denials. At the time he had been on bail for an unconnected matter of affray. After being charged with rape he spent nearly three months on remand, before beginning a year-long sentence for the affray. Earlier . this week, after finding out the evidence was contaminated, the Crown . Prosecution Service (CPS) formally dropped the case at a Manchester . Crown Court hearing. Mr Scott was stunned to find out what had gone on via videolink from prison in Exeter. He said: 'I am relieved that I have been found not guilty - but then I always was not guilty. I defended the allegation from the moment of my arrest. 'I am angry that I was falsely accused. I am angry about the amount of pain it has put me and my family through. 'I sincerely hope that justice comes for the victim and that the true rapist is caught. 'I am disgusted that it has taken this long for them to work out what went wrong. I now want to move on with my life and put this horrible experience behind me.' Adam's mother, Michelle Scott, said the allegation had left her 'distraught'. She said: 'I never for one minute believed he was guilty. I'm really glad the truth has come out - but how they managed to contaminate the evidence is beyond belief. The teenager was held on remand at Strangeways prison, Manchester, after being arrested . 'I am very angry that my son has had to live through this experience and suffer the shame of being accused of being a rapist, whilst being locked up in prison.' GMP has already begun an internal review of a small number of murder and rape cases in which DNA evidence assessed by LGC played a crucial role. The scope of that probe may be extended in coming days or weeks. London-based LGC, which works for police forces across the country, has also started its own internal investigation, which might mean reviewing scores or even hundreds of cases. The company has apologised and said it had 'taken steps to ensure that it [the mistake] cannot happen again'. Rundlewalker, the Exeter-based law firm representing Mr Scott, said they were 'utterly astounded' by the failings that led to his arrest, charge and detention for the rape allegation. In a statement the firm said: 'Had his case proceeded to trial and had the jury accepted the DNA evidence, he would have received a significant custodial sentence. 'We remain fearful for any defendant indicted on DNA or other scientifc evidence that has been processed, is being processed or will be processed through LGC's laboratory. We call for a public inquiry into the failings reported.'","Mr Scott was arrested in Devon and taken to Manchester for questioning .

"By . Ray Massey . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 22 December 2011 . A green tax imposed by Brussels will cost a family of four £80 more to holiday in the U.S. The controversial levy comes into force on January 1. A ruling yesterday by the European Court of Justice means any airline using any EU airport will be subject to the environmental charge. This will add an estimated £21 to the price of a return flight to America. Higher costs? An American Airlines flight leaves Dallas Forth Worth airport. The company will now face paying for an emissions trading scheme when aircraft land at EU airports . Abroad: The cost of the new tariff is expected to be passed on to holidaymakers . It comes on top of charges to be introduced in April by the UK Treasury which will add to the burden faced by British holidaymakers. In all, the cost to a family of four of a return flight to Florida will rise by a daunting £344. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is designed to curb emissions from aircraft jet engines of carbon dioxide. From January 1, all airlines will be required to buy a ‘permit to pollute’ to cover the cost of their carbon emissions plus extra costs if they exceed their emissions limit. The court yesterday rejected a challenge from the U.S. and other non-EU nations that the levy infringes their national sovereignty and violates international aviation treaties. The cost will almost inevitably be . passed on to passengers, and the EU calculates the cost will be £10.50 . on a one-way transatlantic flight – or £21 return. For many shorter . flights it will be up to £1.75 each way. Judgement: The European Court of Justice has decided the levy must apply to all airlines . The EU does not have power to raise direct taxes but can impose expensive regulations on businesses in member states, which have a similar effect. The money raised each year by the sale to airlines of the ‘pollution permits’ will go back to the country in which the airline is based, rather than to Brussels. The ECJ rejected an American challenge that the scheme violates the Open Skies treaty prohibition against unilateral taxation or discriminatory treatment. It is especially bad news for British passengers, who will be forced to pay twice over because the Government also imposes the Air Passenger Duty departure levy, known as ‘the poll tax of the skies.’ Burden: George Osborne has increased Air Passenger Duty, which will drive up flight costs . Chancellor George Osborne announced in his recent Autumn Statement that he was increasing the cost of APD from April by an inflation-busting eight per cent. The Treasury insists the Government needs the extra cash to pay off its debts. Under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme each airline is  allocated pollution ‘permits’ allowing it to emit around 20 per cent less carbon than its past average. Airlines exceeding their limit can buy more permits from other airlines which have emitted less than their quota. The aim is to persuade or force airlines to emit less carbon by upgrading their fleets or becoming more efficient. Last month the Daily Mail revealed how Mr Osborne had finally abandoned all previous Government pretence of using Air Passenger Duty as a ‘green tax’ and admitted in a letter to European airport bosses that it was now ‘fundamentally a revenue-raising duty’ which provides Treasury coffers with £2.5billion a year. Yesterday’s decision sparked fury from countries outside the EU and threatened to ignite a transatlantic and worldwide trade war with Britain and the rest of the European Union. The rejected lawsuit was brought by U.S. and Canadian airlines acting through the trade organisation Airlines for America and backed by Russia, China and other non-EU countries. They object strongly on ‘sovereignty’ grounds to being forced to pay ‘green’ taxes to foreign governments. A Bill currently going through the U.S. Congress will even make it illegal for airlines to pay them. Holiday: But long-distance flights could become prohibitively expensive (picture posed by models) Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘It’s unacceptable. The last thing people need at this time of year is the EU sticking extra taxes on us. Families are struggling to make ends meet as it is.’ From April, families flying to destinations in Air Passenger Duty Band B, which include New York, California and Florida, will see APD alone increase by £5 to £65 per person in economy and by £10 to £130 in all other classes. Mid-level long-distance destinations (4,000 to 6,000 miles Band C), such as the Caribbean or Cape Town, will see the tax rise in economy  by £6 to £81 per person – and by £12 to £162 in all other classes. For a trip to Australia – three times as far as New York – the ‘green’ EU emissions tax could be as much as £30 per flight – or £60 per return journey. For a family of four that could add up to £240 emissions charge for a round trip. From April 1, the existing APD on economy flights to Australia  will rise by £7 to £92 per person – or £368 tax for a family of four.","European Court of Justice throws out challenge by North American airlines .

"By . Christian Gysin . UPDATED: . 19:34 EST, 23 February 2012 . An Indian woman has claimed she was kept as a slave and beaten while working as a nanny for a senior Government lawyer. Widow Pratima Das alleges she was a victim of human trafficking who ended up being abused for four years while at the home of Shibani Rahulan – principal legal adviser at the Department of Health. Mrs Rahulan, however, has denied exploiting the 43-year-old and has produced photos of the nanny at family gatherings and holidays which, she says, prove she was not kept under duress. Counter claim: Homeowner Shibani Rahulan - principal legal adviser at the Department of Health - said pictures such as this of Pratima Das on a family visit to the London Eye showed she wasn't held under duress . The allegations were revealed yesterday as Miss Das’s lawyers argued at the Appeal Court that it should overturn an Employment Tribunal’s decision not to hear her original case because she was ‘out of time’. Her counsel, Ian Wheaton, told the hearing that Miss Das – who is illiterate in both her own language and English – had been a victim  of human trafficking when she was brought to London from India  in 2004. He said: ‘It is her case that she was treated as a slave, her passport was confiscated and she was forced to work 15 hour days. ‘She was prevented from eating with the family – reduced to sitting on the floor eating the respondent family’s leftover food. Miss Das pictured on a family outing to the beach . ‘She was effectively held in captivity only able to make short trips to a nursery and she was threatened with violence if she tried to speak to other people.’ Mr Wheaton added that ‘events crystallised’ in June 2008 when she and her employers were involved in a ‘violent altercation’ and she managed to escape from the family home in Harrow, north-west London. She went to hospital for treatment and then to the police claiming she had been assaulted. Miss Das – who now lives in Southampton – then spent many months seeking legal advice but was ‘hindered by administrative delays’. This initially saw her file an original Employment Tribunal action 42 days late which was ruled out of time. Pratima Das, pictured outside the High Court today, is in the process of seeking permission to stay in Britain permanently . She was then a further 80 days late in applying to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. The court heard Miss Das was from a ‘low caste’ family in India and had been told she would  be paid £100 a month for working which should have been  paid directly to her family abroad in Rupees. Miss Das is currently in the process of seeking permission to stay in Britain permanently. In 2009 a judge at an asylum hearing ruled she could not go back to her home in India because Mrs Rahulan, 40, belonged to an ‘influential and higher class family in that area’. Miss Das claimed she could face ‘inhuman or degrading treatment’ should she return. Judge Sharp ruled at the time that Miss Das’s treatment came within the ‘definition of trafficking’, adding: ‘Her employers were harbouring her and abusing their power and taking advantage of her vulnerability for the purpose of exploiting her as an overworked and abused employee.’ But Mrs Rahulan and her current partner Rex Waldron hit back at her claims. In a statement for the family, Mr Waldron said: ‘Miss Das said when she was sacked ‘‘I will make you regret this for the rest of your life’’ – and she’s lived up to that threat. ‘Pratima lived as a member  of the family. We’ve got photographs of her at all of our parties and family gatherings – does she look like  she’s here under duress? As a slave? It’s ridiculous.’ Yesterday Lord Justice Mummery refused the application from Mr Wheaton to allow Miss Das’s case to go before the Employment Appeal Tribunal and advised that she might go to the civil or criminal courts with her allegations. Last night, Miss Das’s lawyer Paul Grant, of Bernard Chill & Axtell Solicitors, said there may yet be an appeal to the Supreme Court on Human Rights grounds.","Pratima Das, 43, claims she was trafficked from India .

Sources said it was the same property . where Farrow was detained on Sunday following a tip-off from the public . after Avon and Somerset Police had launched a nationwide manhunt. The dead man was identified locally as 16-year-old Keegan Wilkes, who had lived at the house with his mum and three elder brothers. Another death: The grim discovery was made at the house in Kent where Stephen Farrow was arrested, pictured . Suspect: Farrow was arrested at the house following a tip-off from a member of the public after a nationwide manhunt was launched . Farrow, 47, of no fixed address, was remanded in custody yesterday at North Avon Magistrates’ Court in Yate, south Gloucestershire, charged with the murders of vicar John Suddards and retired teacher Betty Yates. He will appear before Bristol Crown Court today for a bail application. Stephen Farrow was remanded in custody today charged with two murders . Mr Suddards, 59, was found stabbed to . death at his home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on February 14, . while Mrs Yates, 77, was also knifed to death at her cottage in Bewdley, . Worcestershire, on January 2. He also faces a charge of burglary relating to a separate property in Thornbury, south Gloucestershire, between December 21 and January 3. During the hearing, Farrow spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and that he was of no fixed address. Police said the death of the man at the house in Black Bull Road, Folkestone, Kent, was being treated as non-suspicious and a post-mortem examination is to be held. The discovery of the corpse is not believed to be linked to the earlier deaths. One source said that it is believed to be drugs-related. A Kent Police spokeswoman said: 'We were called at 8.35am following the discovery of a young man's body at the house. 'Officers have been at the address this morning. The death is being treated as non-suspicious.' Farrow appeared before District Judge Joti Boparai surrounded by three female dock officers. The 6ft 4in suspect was wearing a dark grey fleece jacket and green combat trousers. The court heard that Farrow was alleged to have burgled a cottage in Thornbury, stealing cash, jewellery, a radio and other items of unknown value. Prosecutor Sian Sullivan said Farrow’s case was only suitable for trial at crown court. 'I ask that you send those two charges to the crown court and that you also send the burglary as it is related to the offences,' she said. 'They are linked forensically and also by other matters to the defendant.' Farrow was represented in court by Hannah Uglow, who made no representations on her client’s behalf. 'A good guy': Rev John Suddards (left) welcomed strangers into his home, while Betty Yates (right) was a much-liked teacher . The district judge fixed the bail hearing for tomorrow and the preliminary hearing for March 9. She said: 'The two charges of murder . you face can only be tried at the crown court. I am sending your case to . Bristol Crown Court. The burglary matter, as it is linked, will also go . to the same court. 'Your next court appearance will be . at Bristol tomorrow when the court can consider bail, should you wish to . apply for it tomorrow. 'As far as bail is concerned, I remand you into custody.' After the tip-off that led police to Farrow, Detective Chief Inspector Simon Crisp said: 'Once again it has been the . contribution of a member of the public that has made the difference - my . thanks go to that person for their courage in providing us with that . vital information.' Detective Chief Inspector Neil . Jamieson, of West Mercia Police, said: 'I would also like to express my . gratitude to those members of the public who have helped us and . responded to our appeals and I would also still encourage people to come . forward and talk to us if they have information which could assist our . inquiry. 'We still have a . strong police presence in Bewdley and hope this will help reassure . people that the area, and indeed the whole of the West Mercia, remains a . very safe place in which to live, work and visit.' The community of Thornbury was left shattered by the death of Mr Suddards earlier this month . Sian Sullivan, CPS Senior District . Crown Prosecutor for Avon and Somerset, said: 'Having reviewed this case . in line with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, I have today decided that . there is sufficient evidence to charge Stephen Farrow with the murders . of Betty Yates and John Suddards. 'I have also authorised a charge of burglary at a separate address in Thornbury. 'I . would like to remind all concerned that Stephen Farrow now stands . charged with criminal offences and has the right to a fair trial.

When Colin Froggatt heard his beloved springer spaniel Daisy had been found after more than five years, he thought it was nothing more than a shaggy dog story. But the call he had been waiting so desperately for was true. Now the pair have been reunited after the missing dog was discovered wandering the streets 40 miles from home. And Daisy immediately showed that she recognised her owner by wagging her tail. Reunited: Daisy the English springer spaniel is back at home with owner Colin Froggatt five years after she went missing . Mr Froggatt, 62, and his wife . Margaret, 60, feared the worst after Daisy and her brother Flynn ran off . while going for a walk in a park in 2007. They found Flynn nearby but there was . no trace of Daisy - until she was seen foraging for scraps on a street . in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, two weeks ago. Daisy had been micro-chipped in case she got lost which meant her owners, from Toton, Nottingham, could be traced. Mr Froggatt, a retired plumber, said: 'We were over the moon when we got the phone call. 'We were on the way home and got a mobile call from a couple in Doncaster who had found Daisy wandering with another dog. 'We were wondering if it was a hoax at first but when we got back home there was a message from the dog warden. 'After the couple phoned him, he had checked Daisy’s microchip and got in touch with us. 'We phoned the kennels where she had been taken and arranged to collect her the next day. 'Margaret couldn’t stop crying, she was astonished.' Daisy is already settling in at home and preparing herself for more adventures with Flynn. Mr Froggatt said: 'When Daisy was back, she was really obedient and really friendly and she got on with Flynn as if nothing had happened. Roaming: Daisy was found wandering with another dog in Doncaster, South Yorkshire - 40 miles from where she went missing . 'After a couple of days they were inseparable again. It was like she had never been away.' The couple, who have been married for almost 23 years, gave up hope of finding Daisy after she vanished during a walk in April 2007. Daisy was only a year old then and, because she and Flynn could be lively, the Froggatts would put one of them on a lead and let the other run free for a while. Mr Froggatt said: 'On that particular day I had Flynn on the lead and Daisy off, but Flynn managed to back out of his collar. 'The both of them just looked at each other as if they were telepathic and did a bee-line for the exit of the park. They just disappeared. 'A couple of hours later we found Flynn but Daisy was nowhere to be seen. 'Every time someone rang with a sighting of her we would go off in the car and look but there was never any sign of her, until the phone call.' Best behaviour: Daisy, right, has been more obedient since her return and gets on with her brother Flynn, left, as if nothing happened . Mr Froggatt said it was an 'amazing feeling' to have Daisy back. 'She had certainly not been living wild for five years, somebody had been looking after her,' he added. 'I think she was picked up by somebody shortly after she went missing. She is a very pretty dog. Cosy: Daisy and Flynn were inseparable as puppies, as these pictures, taken before the ran away from their owners, show . 'Whether she was sold on or kept, and then ran off again, I don’t know. 'She is very lively so she could have been working on a farm. 'I can’t see how she could get to Doncaster by her own power.' How did she get there? Daisy was found in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, which is 40 miles from her owners' house in Nottingham . Mr and Mrs Froggatt run company Animals at Home, which cares for pets while their owners are on holiday. Mrs Frogatt, a retired nurse with two children from a previous relationship, said they 'searched everywhere' after Daisy went missing. 'We made up posters, did a door-to-door hunt, went online and even asked the local radio station to ask if anyone had seen her,' she said. 'We thought we would never see her again and just hoped that someone kind had got her and was looking after her. 'It was a very emotional reunion. We took her home feeling as if we had won the lottery. 'We have no real idea about her life up to the time she was found.' Mrs Froggatt said Daisy was 'truly part of the family once more'. 'Flynn realised that the boss was back but, despite a few moments early on, they get on well now.'","Daisy was spotted foraging for scraps 40 MILES from home .

Molly Wei, who spied on Tyler Clementi's romantic encounter with another man, testified Tuesday that she was 'overwhelmed with sadness' when police told her he was missing and had likely committed suicide. Wei is the star prosecution witness in the trial of Dharun Ravi, who is accused of invading Clementi's privacy by recording the Rutgers University freshman in the dorm room they shared in 2010. The 19-year-old has known Ravi since middle school and two friend watched Clementi with his male companion on a computer in her room. Wei's testimony was the first mention of Clementi's suicide at the trial in three days of testimony. The prosecution has made the case about the 15 charges Ravi faces for the secret video recording, not about whether those actions drove Clementi to jump off the George Washington Bridge. Scroll down for video . Key witness: Molly Wie points out to defense lawyer Steven Altman where she saw Tyler Clementi kissing another man . Standing trial: Ravi, who turned 20 Tuesday, faces 15 criminal counts after he allegedly spied on his Rutgers University roommate via webcam . Wei, 19, said campus police called her, then picked her up in an unmarked car after class in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on September 23, 2010 — after Clementi went missing. At . first, she said, she was nervous about being told to get into a beige . Cadillac and texted her boyfriend at another school to get in touch with . police if he didn't hear from her within several hours. She said that what she learned there rattled her so much that she had her parents take her home for the night. 'At . the end of the conversation, the police officers told me that Tyler was . missing and that he had possibly committed suicide,' she said. 'I was sad, overwhelmed. I felt very bad if anything had happened. I just was overwhelmed with emotions of sadness. I just felt so bad for what happened.' Wei was charged and arrested initially but entered a . program that will allow her to keep her record clean if she meets a . list of conditions, including doing community service, working or . attending school full-time. She . also agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify truthfully in . Ravi's trial. She said she has completed about 250 of the 300 hours of . community service required. Cover up: Ravi and Wei discussed over text message how they would spin to police their Clementi viewing party . However, Ravi's lawyer, Steven Altman, pushed Wei to admit that police made an error when she was at first charged with broadcasting and recording the encounter. She said Ravi streamed the video to her computer, but never recorded it or posted it to the wider Internet. On Monday, Wei testified that Ravi texted her multiple times as she was being interviewed by police and told her to make the webcam video broadcast seem like an accident. ‘I think that he thought we were going to get in trouble, so he wanted to make it seem like it was more of an accident,’ she told the court. Both she and defendant Dharun Ravi, who turned 20 today, viewed the web images of Ravi’s roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi. Testifying: Molly Wei is seen testifying today against her former friend Gharun Ravi who's accused of using a webcam to spy on his roommate, Tyler Clementi . The accused: Dharun Ravi listens to the testimony in court Monday which includes Miss Wei's who was initially charged in the case as well prior to making a deal with the court . She said Ravi was worried about what she was telling police, and asked her multiple times via text message what exactly she revealed to them. ‘Did you tell them we did it on purpose? What did you tell them when they asked why we turned it on? I said we were just messing around with the camera,’ Ravi said in some of his messages, ABC News reported. Wei responded saying that she told investigators ‘everything’ that happened the night of September 19, 2010 when Ravi set up a webcam in his and Clementi’s room after Clementi asked to have the room for himself. Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge days after that, as the rumours abounded that he was gay. Wei also testified Monday that she agreed to keep it a secret because it was so shocking to see the images - but that it wasn't under wraps for long. ‘First of all, it was shocking. It felt wrong. We didn't expect to see that. And now that what we did, it was like we shouldn't have seen it,’ Wei told the jurors. ‘We didn't want people to know what had happened.’ But within minutes, she testified, she and defendant Dharun Ravi were online chatting with friends about seeing two men kissing. Others knew: Defense attorney Steven Altman cross examined witness Scott Xu, a friend of Ravi's who played Ultimate Frisbee with him and claimed was told during a practice, among other teammates, that he had set up the webcam . Within the hour, Ms Wei said, she agreed to show a few seconds of the video stream to four other women who visited her dorm room. Still, she said, Ravi did not intend to humiliate his roommate. Ravi faces 15 criminal counts, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation. To convict him of bias intimidation- the most serious charge he faces- prosecutors would have to persuade jurors that Mr Ravi acted out of bias toward gays. Witness: Rutgers student Pooja Kolliri testified saying she saw seconds of the webcam's stream of two men kissing which she says shocked her . Unlike other more casually dressed . college students who have testified so far in the trial, Ms Wei wore a . black business suit. And unlike the others, she kept her voice audible . even during the most uncomfortable moments. She said that she invited Ravi, whom . she had known since middle school, to her dorm room for a snack a few . minutes after 9pm on September 19, 2010. When Ravi tried to go back, . she said, Mr Clementi told him that he wanted the cramped dorm room to . himself for a few hours. So Ravi returned. Family's attendance: Tyler Clementi's mother, Jane Clementi, attended the trial today (center) listening to a witness testify that her son had requested a room change days after his roommate set up the webcam . Charges: Middlesex County prosecutors are seen discussing the case that charges Ravi with invasion of privacy, bias intimidation and other crimes . Within a few minutes, she said, he . used her computer to view live images from his webcam. It was then, she . said, that she saw about two seconds of Mr Clementi and an older man . kissing. Even though she said they initially . agreed not to talk about what they had seen, she asked Ravi to tell a . friend about it during an online chat that began at 9.20pm and within . minutes, word got around the dorm. She said she agreed to turn the webcam back on at the request of a woman who was among a group dropped by her room. ‘It was the exact same image, except that they had taken their tops off,’ she said. ‘As soon as they saw it, I turned it off.’ Ms Wei was expected to be back on the witness stand for more cross-examination on Tuesday. Also Monday, jurors heard from university official William O'Brien that Mr Clementi requested a room change about 30 hours after the alleged spying - and a day before he killed himself. Mr O'Brien, associate director of residence life at Rutgers, told jurors that his staff did not see Mr Clementi's request for a new roommate until after he was reported missing from campus.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 05:09 EST, 2 February 2012 . His literary creations are some of the most well-known in fiction, but new research has suggested the characters of Charles Dickens may have had real-life counterparts. The names of Bill Sikes and Scrooge may have derived from real people linked to the famous writer, according to new research. The thug in Oliver Twist, the famous Christmas Carol miser and the ghost of his deceased partner have all been associated with people who worked or lived near Dickens's first London home. Iconic: Bill Sikes from Oliver Twist, played here by Oliver Reed was said to be based on a real-life trader who lived near Charles Dickens in London . According to the research, a trader named William Sykes lived in the same east Marylebone street as Dickens when the writer was a teenager. Author Ruth Richardson has revealed the remarkable links in a new book, 'Dickens and the Workhouse', which investigates the writer's inspirations to coincide with the 200th anniversary of his birth, the Guardian reported today. Richardson has also claimed that nearby Dickens's home was a sculptor mocked by many as a miser, while also close by was the premises of two tradesmen named Goodge and Marney. The character of Scrooge, played here by Tommy Steele, was said to be based on a local sculptor who lived near Dickens who was mocked as a miser . These locals could be the inspiration for Scrooge and Marley, according to Richardson's book. Both the miser and the tradesmen were said to live within yards of Dickens's lodgings in Norfolk Street. Charles Dickens is said to have based his creations on real-life people who lived near him in London . Dickens scholars have until now ignored the real life inhabitants of Norfolk Street and any link they may have to the great writer. But Richardson has described the links discovered between Dickens's creations and their real life counterparts as 'breathtaking'. The business belonging to William Sykes was at 11 Cleveland Street, just a few doors away from where Dickens lived. Richardson believes he was the inspiration for Bill Sikes, as she told the Guardian that 'he was certainly there while Dickens was planning Oliver Twist'. Experts have described the research as 'most interesting and valuable'. Michael Slater, the Dickens biographer for Yale University Press, said: 'Dickens was famous for making up amazing names – like Chuzzlewit – and names were very important to him.'","Characters from Oliver Twist and A Christmas Carol were based on real-life people who lived near writer, research claims ."

Doctors banned from working by the General Medical Council because they are a danger to the public are ignoring the sanction and continuing to practise. The watchdog is powerless to check whether those suspended or placed on 'restricted duties' are obeying the orders. Experts, including former presidents of the GMC, admit it is an ‘intolerable situation’ and warn that not enough is being done to protect patients from dishonest and potentially dangerous doctors. Since 2009 a total of 17 doctors have been found to be working in breach of certain restrictions made by the GMC to ensure they did not put patients at risk, an investigation by Channel 4 News has found. This included four who were found to be continuing to treat patients even though they had been suspended. The cases – uncovered through Freedom of Information requests – are only those the GMC is aware of. Sir Donald Irvine, who was president of the GMC between 1995 and 2001, said: ‘I think it’s an intolerable situation. ‘The current system does not protect patients as well as it should do. It is dependent on the truthfulness and honesty of the doctor. ‘I think some of these cases slipping through the system indicate that something tougher is required.’ He said that all doctors the GMC found to be working in breach of their restrictions should be immediately struck off – and barred from ever practising again in their lifetime. ‘Personally I would favour giving the doctor a very clear signal that if you behave in such a dishonest, deceiving way, you really can’t be trusted as a doctor and you should be struck off.’ In one case, a GP convicted of negligence by the GMC for prescribing Calpol to a baby who later died from meningitis was able to get a job with an out of hours firm without telling them he was on restricted duties. Dr Godwin Duru, who qualified in Nigeria, was told he was only allowed to work as long as he was supervised at all times by another doctor to ensure he was not making similar errors. But in 2009 he secured  a job with out of hours  firm Herts Urgent Care without telling them of these restrictions. 'Intolerable situation': Experts - including former presidents of the GMC (pictured) - warn that not enough is being done to protect patients from dishonest and potentially dangerous doctors . He was only found out when other patients complained about his work and the firm investigated his past. He was immediately sacked and has since been suspended by the GMC. In another example, a GP who had been jailed for three years for possessing heroin managed to get jobs with two separate surgeries without telling them of his conviction. Dr Stuart Green was told by the GMC he could only continue working on condition that he told any potential employer about his criminal past so they could make an informed decision whether or not he would pose a risk to patients. But he was able to work for five months at a surgery in Reading and as a locum in Hackney, east London, for another nine months without telling his employers of his past. He was subsequently found out by the GMC, although it is not known how, and has since been struck off. Charlotte Ellis, a medical negligence lawyer at Richard Nelson LLP solicitors in Nottingham, told Channel 4 News: ‘I think the GMC is just under-resourced. ‘And I personally think that there should be people to [investigate] because patients and the public are at risk. ‘They don’t have the resources to be checking every single doctor who is under their fitness to practise regime’s registration.’ Last year, 106 doctors were suspended by the GMC for up to a year and a further 72 were struck off. About 30 were put on restricted duties and told they could only work under certain conditions. Niall Dickson, Chief Executive of the General Medical Council said:'Protecting patients must always come first and doctors who break conditions or a suspension order can expect us to take swift and firm action against them - in these cases, most of the doctors were then struck off by the GMC. We will not tolerate behaviour of this kind. 'What is more, any doctor practising medicine when they are suspended is breaking the law – we will follow this up with the police as well as acting ourselves.'","Watchdog is 'powerless' to check whether those banned are obeying orders .

It looks like the unlikeliest collection of holiday snaps, but this gnome is not on holiday - the trip is all in the name of science. Gravity changes around the world, partly due to bulges in our planet's shape. To prove it, a German scale manufacturer has sent a plastic figure on a journey around the planet. Kern the gnome is weighed wherever he goes. Kern was at his heaviest at the south pole, where the slower spin of the Earth adds 0.5 per cent to everyone's weight. Write caption here . Write caption here . So far he has visited a string of cities including Lima, Mumbai, Mexico City, San Francisco, Sydney and New Caledonia in the southwest Pacific ocean. Kern travels in a reinforced case containing himself and a Kern EWB 2.4 Scale calibrated according to local gravity in Balingen, Germany, to ensure any weight change he encounters on his travels shows up. The journey has been organised by scale makers Kern & Sohn as a fun way to demonstrate the little known quirk about Earth, that gravity varies depending on where you are. Each place he visits is accompanied by pictures of Kern taken by scientists friends who are ‘putting him up’ and a blog he has supposedly written. When Kern was in Antarctica he was weighed at 309.82g, the heaviest out of all his visits. On his blog he writes: ‘I am a gnome celebrity today. But I won’t let this fame make me big headed. The change in weight could throw out all of my future results.’ Gnome south pole . Paris gnome . Moving further towards the equator, Kern weighed 307.8g in Sydney and 307.82g in Durbane, South Africa, which is roughly the same latitude. In India he writes: ‘I’ve lost weight. Who else can say that after Christmas? I’m in India and I weigh 307.56g. ‘Thanks to my hosts for helping me with this pleasantly surprising measurement. Now I’m leaving the amazing sights, sounds and smells of India and hopping on a long haul flight to Mexico. Roll me an enchilada, I’ll see you all in 19.5 hours time!’ By the time he arrived in Mexico, however, the weight seemed to have gone back on and he weighed some 307.62g. Gravity does indeed differ around Earth, partly because it is not a sphere and is actually shaped more like a potato. Gravity is affected by two main factors - latitude and altitude. If you were to stand on one of the two poles on Earth then you would weigh 0.5 per cent more than if you were on the equator. This is because at the poles there is less rotation which reduces your weight. Differences in local geology may also play a part, but on a far smaller scale. Having large rocks near to you may change your weight by 0.01 per cent.

A policeman who funded an extramarital affair with by fraudulently raking in £70,000 in bank loans walked free from court after a judge branded him as 'emotionally fragile'. PC Jamie Hillman, 37, defrauded more than half a dozen high street banks, including Northern Rock and Barclays, by applying for loans and credit cards. He made several false claims during the applications - including that he was a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police and even that he was a soldier serving in Afghanistan. However, he was using the cash to fund a 'double life' as he conducted an affair with a colleague at Avon and Somerset Police. The greedy PC fled to Australia with the cash but was finally cornered when he returned to Britain to meet up with his lover. But . Hillman - who claimed he had amnesia while committing the fraud - was . spared jail by Judge Carol Hagen at Bristol Crown Court. She . branded him 'emotionally fragile' and 'brave' for admitting his . misdemeanours - handing him a 12 month prison term suspended for two . years. The court heard that . father-of-two Hillman had come to Britain from Australia with his wife . and began working as a PC for Avon and Somerset Police in 1999. But his deception began after he struck up an extramarital affair with a colleague. Web of lies: Hillman defrauded more than half a dozen high street banks, including Northern Rock and Barclays (pictured) Between January and April 2008 he defrauded half a dozen high street banks by using false information to apply for loans and credit cards online. The total amounted to £64,300 - rising to £73,366.30 with interest. Stephen Mooney, prosecuting, said: . 'He embarked upon a course of obtaining loans and credit cards which he . used in part to finance his double life. 'He lied about significant personal details, knowing if he said the truth it would not be granted. 'When it was granted he used it to fund his lifestyle and created excuses for his bizarre behaviour. 'Lying had become a way of life for this defendant.' The . court heard he secured a £12,000 loan from Co-Op Bank and £12,000 from . Halifax by claiming to be a sergeant in the Metropolitan Police. A judge at Bristol Crown Court (pictured) branded Hillman 'emotionally fragile' and 'brave' for admitting his misdemeanours before handing him a 12 month prison term suspended for two years .

The . court was told he also applied for a number of credit cards - from . Halifax Bank of Scotland and Barclays Bank, again saying he worked for . the London force. 'Lying had become a way of life for this defendant' During the . application process for a credit card with Santander, Hillman claimed . to have been training in Canada with the armed forces and was shortly to . be deployed in Afghanistan. He . then claimed to be serving in Afghanistan on another credit card form - . asking for correspondence to be forwarded to his 'brother' in Yeovil, . Somerset. Hillman emigrated . to Australia with his family in 2008 but was finally snared after coming . back to Britain to visit his mistress and finalise his divorce in 2009. The rogue cop initially denied the allegations against him and indicated that he would blame his ex-wife for some of the fraud. But . he was charged with nine counts of fraud by deception in October 2010 . and finally pleaded guilty after a jury was sworn in for his trial. Edward . Burgess, defending Hillman, said his client claimed he had 'amnesia' at . the time of the fraud and also had the symptoms of post traumatic . stress. He said this stemmed from attending a firearms incident with the force back in 2007. Mr Burgess said the effect of a prison sentence would be 'devastating' and 'crushing' on the defendant. As well as the 12 month suspended sentence, Hillman, from St Anne’s Park, Bristol, was handed a 300 hour unpaid work order. Judge . Hagen said: 'If you received a custodial sentence I think there is a . very real chance your mental state would deteriorate fairly swiftly.' Hillman, who resigned from the force when he was charged with fraud, refused to comment when coming out of court. A confiscation hearing is likely to take place in September to discuss his further repayments.","PC claimed he was a Met Police sergeant and a soldier serving in Afghanistan .

Activists blocked a bid to make 'killing the Bill' party policy yesterday, instead opting to debate today the pro-reform 'Shirley Williams motion' The result threw the party into fresh turmoil and leaves Mr Clegg with a political headache. The vote means Labour can now claim that even the Conservatives’ Coalition partners do not support the controversial Bill. Although the vote is unlikely to affect how Lib Dem peers vote in the Lords, it will increase pressure on them to delay the vote until the NHS risk register is published. The vote came just a day after Mr Clegg faced down a more substantial potential rebellion which could have seen the party oppose the Bill in full. Deputy leader Simon Hughes told Sky News: ‘I think the conference reflected the mood of the party and the country. ‘It is not the Bill we would have produced if we had been in government on our own. The party is saying: we are reserving our judgment on the Bill as a whole until we see the final shape of it.’ Tough times: Ed Davey MP, & Chris Huhne MP looked sombre as they listened to Nick Clegg's speech . During a bad-tempered debate, supporters of the Bill were heckled by opponents. In his keynote speech the Deputy Prime Minister conceded the shake-up was ‘controversial’ but had ‘proven the value of coalition’. ‘The Bill was stopped in its tracks and rewritten because this is a coalition government,’ he said. ‘Competition will be the servant of health care, not the master because this is a coalition government. 'This is a Bill for patients not profits. 'It is not a Liberal Democrat health Bill but it is a better Bill because of the Liberal Democrats.' But Rachel Coleman Finch, a party member from Cambridge, told the conference the politics of the Bill were ‘poisonous’, adding: ‘We need to get away from a macho fear of U-turns.’ Testing times: Nick Clegg looked jubilant as he raised his arms in front of his party but during his keynote conference speech the Deputy Prime Minister conceded that the shake-up was controversial' Changes: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (centre) indicated there could be further amendments to the Bill in the Lords . Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander indicated there could be further amendments to the Bill in the Lords. He . said that while there was 'strong recognition' within the party the Lib .

Clegg attempted to rally party members by using his conference speech . to call for higher levies on the rich to fund tax cuts for 'ordinary' households. He also . vowed to 'call time' on wealthy people who aggressively avoid paying . levies by employing lawyers and accountants to find loopholes.

Clegg took a pot-shot at his former Treasury spokesman, Lord Oakeshott, . who has spoken out against plans floated this weekend to impose a . so-called tycoon tax which would set a minimum level of levies paid . based on overall income. In . the Sunday Telegraph, the peer, who enjoyed a successful career in the . City, called Mr Clegg's plan a 'superficially attractive measure that . falls apart under scrutiny' which would 'do nothing to deal with . super-rich non-doms and non residents'. Mr Clegg said: 'The only person against the tycoon tax is one of our very own tycoons.' Gay marriage will be introduced before 2015, Mr Clegg insisted as church leaders today ramped up rhetoric against the plans. He . told activists: 'We are bringing forward proposals for gay marriage, . already provoking debate. Let me just say, if you are a young gay . person, your freedom to love who you choose is a fundamental right in a . liberal society - and you will always have our support.' The first elections to the House of Lords will also take place before 2015, he added. Mr Clegg insisted the achievements secured by Lib Dems in government had proved the 'luddites' wrong about coalition politics. And he declared the next election is simply a 'staging post' for the party. 'I . want our ambitions for education to be at the very heart of our . manifesto in 2015. Education that delivers on the liberal promise: that . every child can go as far as their talent will take them. That is what . we Liberal Democrats will fight for. 'So . 2015 is not the destination. 2015 is a staging post.

A good Samaritan stopped to help an American serviceman who had driven into a ditch - and they have both ended up being banned for drink-driving. Lesley Gillam, 57, went to help Ryan Hoagland, 21, after he left the road in Kentford, west Suffolk, on the night of December 10, a court heard yesterday. But they were both breath-tested by police at the scene and found to be about double the drink-drive limit. Gillam, of Newmarket, had 68 microgrammes of alcohol per 100ml of breath and Hoagland had 79mcgs. The limit is 35mcgs. The pair, who had never met before that day, both appeared separately at West Suffolk magistrates' court in Bury St Edmunds. Gillam admitted driving with excess alcohol. Michael Whatley, defending her, said she had driven to a friend's house where she intended to stay after a night out. They had taken a taxi to and from the Apex entertainment centre in Bury, said Mr Whatley. But Gillam then realised she had left essential medication for her thyroid condition at home and drove to fetch it - 'not realising' she was over the limit. On her way home she spotted Hoagland's car in the ditch and stopped to offer him a lift. 'Unusual circumstances': At West Suffolk magistrates' court, District Judge David Cooper banned Gillam from driving for the minimum of 12 months . But a taxi driver, who was first at the scene, had already called police. Officers turned up shortly afterwards and breath-tested both drivers. Mr Whatley said losing her licence would have a 'devastating effect' on Gillam's life. He said she is a self-employed interior designer and totally reliant on her car. District Judge David Cooper told Gillam: 'You could have just driven by on the other side of the road but you did not.' U.S. serviceman Ryan Hoagland, who is based at RAF Lakenheath, the home of the USAF's 48th Fighter Wing, also admitted driving with excess alcohol . In view of the 'extremely unusual circumstances' the judge said he was banning her for the minimum of 12 months. Gillam was also ordered to pay a £250 fine and £100 costs. Hoagland, based at RAF Lakenheath, the home of the USAF's 48th Fighter Wing, also admitted driving with excess alcohol. The American told the judge: 'I am just grateful that I did not hurt anyone.'

"By . Jill Reilly . UPDATED: . 07:11 EST, 6 March 2012 . Council tenants are going to be paid for doing their own DIY jobs from next month. In a scheme that is sure to anger many private homeowners who struggle to find time for their own repairs, council tenants stand to pocket up to £500 a year for carrying out simple repairs like decorating, fixing leaky taps, and fitting doors instead of calling maintenance staff, they could stand to pocket up to £500 a year. The scheme, Tenant Cashback  is part of Housing minister Grant Shapps' vision to help cut the  £4billion-a-year maintenance bill for social housing. Pay out: If tenants carry out basic repairs like painting, instead of calling maintenance staff, they could stand to pocket up to £500 a year under the Tenant Cashback scheme . He said the scheme could allow their tenants the opportunity to become 'apprentices in the home'. Mr Shapps said: 'Rather than having to wait for landlords to act, tenants should be able to tackle their own DIY dilemmas — and get paid for it. 'For some, this could even serve as an apprenticeship in the home and the start on a path to a whole new career. 'This, combined with the potential to bring the local community together to improve the local area, means all councils and housing associations should give residents the right to take up tools.' Cost cutting: The scheme, Tenant Cashback is part of Housing minister Grant Shapps' vision to help cut the £4billion-a-year maintenance bill for social housing . They will be invited to undertake basic training programmes to increase their job prospects. Social housing landlords are responsible for more than four million homes, and spend an average of £1,000 per property annually on repairs. Community groups can take on repairs for their local area and help neighbours who are unable to fix things themselves. But the news of the scheme has already infuriated homeowners. On an internet forum, one disgruntled user wrote: . I am a homeowner and massively in debt, and I can't even afford to fix my broken fence - why should they be paid using my taxes for doing basic repairs?' Another user commented: . This is really not fair at all. I have to save up to the kid's bedrooms as well as paying my mortgage - why should they get it all for free?' The Tenant Participation Advisory Service has given the idea cautious support. ‘I am a big fan of anything that encourages people to do things for themselves, because I think it delivers value for money,’ said Nigel Long, head of policy at TPAS to Inside Housing. However, the scheme has been greeted with some industry scepticism. Concerns . have been raised such as the potential risks to health and safety, the . quality of repairs undertaken,and legal and insurance implications. Three . social landlords - Home Group, Together Housing and Bromford Group have already begun pilot schemes. Home Group, is offering its tenants tailored DIY courses at a B&Q training centre. Some . tenants on the Bromford scheme are receiving one to one advice on . maintaining their homes and tenants have provided videos with hints to . help their neighbours get started. Vision: Grant Shapps said the scheme could allow their tenants the opportunity to become 'apprentices in the home' and they will be invited to undertake basic training programmes to increase their job prospects . Anne Imeson, a 67-year old Home Group tenant from Middlesbrough, has taken part. She told Inside Housing: 'We were all given leaflets about what the pilot scheme contained and what we had to do. I couldn’t believe people called the housing association’s repairs service out to put light bulbs in. The majority of work on this pilot I was doing anyway.' To ensure tenants do not make claims for repair work they have not carried out, two of the pilots schemes, decided not to pay per repair. Instead, participants are rewarded in . lump sums for maintaining their properties to a mutually agreed . standard and regular checks are carried out to ensure the tenant is upholding their end of the agreement. Yesterday it was revealed homeowners face having to pay up to £735 per year more after Halifax said today they are hiking up their mortgage rates - sparking the threat of a mass customer exodus. The bank is increasing its standard variable rate mortgage from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent from May 1, costing 850,000 customers hundreds of pounds per year. Other lenders are likely to follow suit and increase their charges - despite the Bank of England base rate being held at a historic low of 0.5per cent for three years. The increase, which is the first for three years, will be seen as rank profiteering by homeowners. However, the banks are blaming a rise in the cost of borrowing money on the wholesale markets in the last year for the rises. The changes come as hard-pressed families are being hit by record-breaking petrol prices and an unprecedented squeeze on household spending. The announcement comes just months . after a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said middle-income . families are suffering an ‘unprecedented collapse’ in living standards . as inflation and poor wages wipe thousands off incomes.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:48 EST, 20 January 2012 . Police have apologised to the . family of a nurse who was murdered by her estranged husband weeks after . she complained he was harassing her. Kate Mott, 35, had obtained a court order against husband Brent, 32, a month before he strangled her in January 2010. But 'errors' in the way Merseyside . Police processed the paperwork led to one of her calls to police being . handled wrongly, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said. Murdered: Kate Mott (left) was strangled by her husband Brent during a row over their divorce settlement . The watchdog launched an investigation into the matter shortly after Mott, also a nurse, was convicted of his wife’s murder in August 2010. He was jailed for a minimum of 25 years after Liverpool Crown Court heard he strangled the mother of his two children at their home in Everard Road, Southport, then tried to make her death look like the result of a car crash. He also raped her at or around the time of the killing, the court heard. IPCC Commissioner Naseem Malik said: 'The murder of Kate Mott was a terrible tragedy. 'She was trying to escape an oppressive and abusive relationship. 'She had taken the appropriate legal steps to protect herself, but when she turned to Merseyside Police for assistance she clearly did not receive the level of service she was entitled to.' The scene in Scarisbrick, Lancashire, where Brent Mott abandoned his wife Kate's body in the family car to make it appear as if she died in a crash . Police call centre workers and officers failed to grasp the seriousness of the injunction - a non-molestation order - and Mrs Mott’s complaint was treated as a case of 'adults quarrelling over divorce proceedings', the watchdog said. A police officer told Mrs Mott it would be difficult for the force to act and advised her to contact her solicitor rather than the police. Detective Chief Inspector Andy . Williams, of Merseyside Police, said: 'I would like to take this . opportunity to express our sympathy to the family of Kate Mott for their . terrible loss. Our thoughts remain with them. 'Due to our concerns about the circumstances surrounding Kate's death we referred the matter to the IPCC. An immediate review of our . management of non-molestation orders and domestic abuse policy training . was conducted following the death of Mrs Mott in 2010. 'As a result of this review, . Merseyside Police put in place a number of improvements to strengthen . our management of these orders across the force and specifically within . the force contact centre in which this issue arose. 'The IPCC report recognises that the . force has acknowledged failings in this case and as a consequence has . made a recommendation for the force to improve the reinforcement of . domestic abuse policy and procedures with officers and staff. 'However, it is clear that, in this . case, the processes and training we had in place at that time fell short . of the required standard. We are now confident that the changes we have . put in place has led to a greater understanding of non-molestation . orders. 'We continually review our policies, . processes and the training given to staff to ensure that they are able . to correctly assess the risk posed by individuals. We work with partner . agencies to put appropriate management plans in place for specific . people, which allow us to effectively protect the public.' He did not clarify the name of her husband or add his name to the incident log. He also failed to make any checks about Brent Mott on the Police National Computer. Mrs Mott later said in a letter to her solicitor she 'was extremely disappointed and let down after this call', the IPCC said in its report. 'In our opinion there were failings at each stage of the contact and in particular the way the police officer handled the call with Mrs Mott raises significant concerns,' Ms Malik added. 'While his actions have not reached the level which amounts to misconduct, it is clear his performance fell substantially below what should have been expected. 'He was dealing with a concerned, vulnerable woman but he dismissed her concerns as a case of bickering adults and gave totally inappropriate advice. 'I believed that the failings were of such concern that it warranted an apology to the family of Kate Mott. 'I am pleased that Merseyside Police acknowledged the failing and a senior officer delivered an apology in a face-to-face meeting with Mrs Mott’s family. 'While this may only be a small piece of comfort for Mrs Mott's family, I believe it is an important step for police forces to acknowledge and apologise for errors. 'Although sorry is a small word, it can have a powerful impact.' The IPCC probe was launched following a voluntary referral from Merseyside Police. Ms Malik added: 'Merseyside Police have appropriate policies in place to deal with incidents such as this, and it is hoped the Kate Mott's experience is an isolated case. 'However it was of concern that the officer who mishandled Mrs Mott's call so badly had neither been trained in, nor acquainted himself with, these policies. 'Merseyside Police have put in place a comprehensive action plan for the officer to help him learn from his errors and we recommended the force reinforced its domestic abuse polices with all its officers and staff.' In a statement, Merseyside Police confirmed that an 'extensive' review of the Force's domestic abuse policy and procedure was carried out after the death of Mrs Mott. Following this, the force said, it has made a number of changes to strengthen the processing of non-molestation orders and reminded officers and staff of its domestic abuse policy .","Kate Mott, 35, was raped and her death made to look like crash .

"By . Mark Duell . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 31 December 2011 . Police today launched a huge manhunt for a serial arsonist who hit Hollywood for a second night early this morning. Another eight fires were set in the area last night after 22 blazes were set in only four hours on Friday morning. Dozens of Hollywood residents were forced out of their homes and power was disrupted in several neighbourhoods shortly after midnight. Scroll down for video . Burning up: A fire engine arrives at a blaze in the Laurel Canyon section of West Hollywood on Friday, where former Doors lead singer Jim Morrison used to live . Response: The fires started shortly after midnight and occurred over a four-hour span before dawn . Smoking: Burning cars are shown at the site of an arson fire in the Hollywood section of Los Angeles . ‘It was a long, tough night,’ a Los Angeles County fire spokesman said, adding that the department does not yet have any suspect description. 'Thank goodness no one was seriously injured or killed,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said at an afternoon news conference, where he was joined by county and West Hollywood officials. West Hollywood Mayor John Duran heatedly spoke directly to the person or persons suspected of starting the fires, reports the LA Times. 'What were you thinking?” he said. “This is the most dense part of Los Angeles. If you’re trying to say something, this is not the way to say it.” Authorities ruled out any possible link to terrorism while bracing for . another round of arson attacks, reports CBS News. One of the blazes happened at the former home of late Doors lead singer Jim Morrison, who died in Paris in 1971 aged just 27. He used to live in the house with girlfriend Pamela Courson in the 1960s and it provided the inspiration for the Doors song ‘Love Street’. There were no civilian injuries on Friday but one city fireman was treated and released from a hospital after a fall while battling a blaze.

County supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky told Msnbc.com that the county is putting up $25,000 and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is adding another $10,000. Yaroslavsky added there around $350,000  worth of damage was caused to property in West Hollywood alone from the fires. Fire officials couldn't say whether the rash of fires was the work of a copycat as there was a series of other arson fires early Thursday, also in Hollywood.

A police officer committed suicide because he feared losing his job after assaulting his lover (file picture) PC Corless left behind his widow Lisa and son, who was one at the time of his death. According to the Whiston coroner, Dr Christopher Sumner, PC Corless had grown suspicious that his lover was seeing another police officer. This suspicion had led to several episodes of violence during the weekend of his death. Before recording a verdict of suicide, Mr Sumner said: 'At the time of his death Mr Corless seemed besotted and obsessed with the thought that she (Anne Marie) was having a relationship with another man. 'There is certainly no doubt in my mind that he was carrying out an extramarital relationship with Anne Marie Greenall. 'On the weekend of the February 25, 26 and 27 last year, there was an incident in which Nick Corless assaulted Anne Marie.

'Prison is not the best of places at any time, but it is certainly not an easy place for a police officer. 'It is clear that he intended to take his own life and therefore I can only record one verdict and that is suicide,' he added.

The missing mother of an Iraq war veteran who is believed to have killed . his family in a murder-suicide was found dead on Thursday off a rural . Northern California road, police said. Gilroy police and volunteers had been looking for 52-year-old Martha Gutierrez since last week, after the bodies of her children, 27-year-old Abel and 11-year-old Lucero, were found in their apartment. Investigators believe Abel Gutierrez, a National Guardsman, fatally shot his mother and sister before turning the gun on himself. Victims: Veteran Abel Gutierrez, left, killed his 11-year-old sister Lucero and his mother Martha, right . Gilroy police Sgt. Chad Gallacinao said that authorities have positively identified the woman, and the family had been notified. Investigators on Wednesday asked . citizens in a rural part of Santa Clara and San Benito counties to keep . an eye out for the body, after evidence led them to the area. On Thursday the volunteers found the . body under bushes off the highway. Gutierrez had one apparent gunshot . wound, Gallacinao said. 'Our first priority was locating Martha Gutierrez, now we will try to figure out when and how (her death) happened,' he said. Family members told the San Jose . Mercury News that authorities summoned them to the location of the body . near the border of the two counties. Kristell Gutierrez said authorities confirmed the body belonged to her aunt. 'We were hoping she was alive, but we . kind of knew that she wasn't going to be,' she told the newspaper. 'We're just happy she's been found.' Tributes: Neighbours called Lucero a 'sweet little girl' and said she got on well with other local children . Family members have said they . suspected Abel Gutierrez suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, . and that they had been upset by his talk of suicide and brandishing of . guns. Two weeks before the killings, on February 29, a Gilroy police . officer responded to a service call at the apartment. Yet Abel Gutierrez' family told the officer they did not feel threatened, so Gutierrez was not . placed on a psychological hold, police said. The search for Martha began after the . bodies of her children were found at her apartment and evidence . indicating a violent confrontation in Abel’s Ford Mustang was . discovered. Crews searched 30 miles of Santa Clara County on March 17 but to no avail. He had recently returned from a second tour of Iraq and family members told the San Francisco Chronicle . he would regularly wake during the night, screaming and angrily raging . against the Taliban. He would apparently smoke marijuana to deal with his depression. Police were again called to the . apartment on Wednesday night after a roommate came home, suspected . something was wrong, and went back outside. Responding officers found the bodies of Gutierrez and Lucero dead from gunshot wounds. Crime scene: A San Benito County Sheriff enters the area where the body of Martha Gutierrez was found on Thursday March 22 2012 in California . Tragic: Faustino Gutierrez, left, views the area where the body of his sister Martha Gutierrez was found . There . was no sign of their mother. However, police found clues inside the . home that indicated she may be seriously hurt - or worse. Family members told the San Jose Mercury News that Gutierrez often said that he wanted to kill himself 'all the time' and would ask if that would hurt them. A niece, Kristell Gutierrez, said she knew her uncle was 'very mean' to his mother and blamed her for his father leaving the family. Alissa Fernandez, a neighbour, told the newspaper that Gutierrez 'was just weird, the way he would act.' About two weeks ago, Martha Gutierrez apparently went to the apartment manager, saying she was 'scared of her son'. Mario . Reyes, a neighbour who lives beneath the Gutierrez family, told KNTV-TV . that he thought he heard a scuffle - but no gunshots - around the time . police say the shooting occurred. Iraq: Gutierrez is said to have developed post-traumatic stress disorder while serving in the Army (file photo) Gallacinao said officers found at least two firearms used in the killings, but he would not say whether Gutierrez left a suicide note. Because Gutierrez did not seem dangerous and did not meet the criteria to be placed on a psychiatric hold when police initially attended, they began working with the family and Office of Veterans Affairs in Palo Alto to help him. Gutierrez had been receiving care at a VA facility in Puget Sound, Washington, confirmed a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs Care System. Friends of the family paid tribute to Lucero, who was described as a 'sweet little girl'. A woman named Emily who lives nearby told the Gilroy Dispatch the 11-year-old was 'the best little girl in the world. Her son Julian, also 11, used to play with Power Rangers with Lucero, and said he had prayed that she would be safe when he first heard about the violence. A six-year-old neighbour, Evenny, also remembered the victim happily, and said: 'We were all best friends.'","Police were called to the house two weeks earlier but decided Abel Gutierrez was not dangerous despite suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder .

She told the audience that her husband, raised by a single parent, with the help of his grandmother,  understands the problems of struggling families 'because he has lived them.' She praised the passage of health care reform legislation that she said has already 'saved millions of seniors in this country an average of $600 a year for prescription drugs.” On the road: Before his fundraising blitz, Obama spoke to a campaign-like crowd at the University of Miami to defend his energy policy in the midst of spiking gasoline prices .

'Now, there are some folks talking about repealing that reform,’’ Mrs. Obama said. 'Are we going to let that happen?  Are we going to allow children to be denied health care coverage who have cancer or other serious diseases? We can’t do that.” She also praised President Obama for getting rid of the 'Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ policy toward gays in the military as well as encouraging supporters in the crowd to go to work for the re-election campaign. 'Will be let everything we worked for just slip away?,' she asked. It was Mrs Obama’s first visit to Cincinnati since 2008, when her husband was running for president. Meanwhile her President Barack Obama held a glitzy fundraiser at  the home of Dallas Mavericks guard Vince Carter where about 70 guests gathered for a $30,000-a-person event.

The event raised money from current and former NBA greats and an intimate group of supporters drawn to this weekend's All-Star game in nearby Orlando. The group gathered in Carter's . gymnasium, with the scoreboard showing 2012 on the clock and the score . tied at 44, Obama being the 44th president. 'It's . a nice gym,' Obama observed, understatedly. 'Vince said he left the . other side open in case I wanted to get in a dunk contest with him. I . told him I didn't bring my sneakers, so not tonight.' Obama . thanked NBA Commissioner David Stern, also in attendance, for resolving . the basketball lockout that delayed the start of the basketball season. 'I don't know what I would be doing with myself if I at least didn't have some basketball games around,' Obama said. Public engagement together: Earlier this week President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended a ceremony for the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington . The fundraiser capped a day hauling in campaign cash, taunting Republicans and pushing his energy policy in the face of rising gasoline prices. Yesterday's dinner was Mr Obama's third high-dollar Florida fundraiser of the day, including one at the swanky Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables and a $10,000-a-ticket gathering at the Miami home of veteran fundraiser Chris Korge. But he had more than the November election on his mind. An avid basketball fan, the president also lamented missing Thursday night's highly anticipated NBA matchup in South Florida between the Miami Heat and the New York Knicks - including the Knicks' emerging superstar, Jeremy Lin. 'I'm resentful I'm not going to the game tonight. I'm mad about that,' Obama joked. 'It's not right. It's not fair.' 'We've got a good story to tell about the last three years, but I'm not done here,' the president said. 'I need five more years.' Last week, Obama took a three-day West Coast trip and raised about $8 million in eight campaign events. Before his fundraising blitz, Obama spoke to a campaign-like crowd at the University of Miami to defend his energy policy in the midst of spiking gasoline prices. He predicted his Republican rivals would offer nothing but more drilling and political promises of $2-a-gallon gas. 'That's not a plan, especially since we're already drilling,' he said. 'That's a bumper sticker.' His trip to Florida came as gasoline has reached the highest price at the pump ever for this time of year: an average of $3.58 per gallon. White House advisers see it as a cyclical occurrence but knew Obama had to address the topic, one of deep concern to consumers and growing fodder for Republicans seeking to unseat Obama.","Spoke about poverty about fundraiser before an audience at a Cincinnati hotel who had paid anywhere from $250 to $10,000 for the mid-day event .

"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 06:54 EST, 18 January 2012 . A 20-year-old woman was inspired to lose nearly half her body weight after winning her fight against cancer. Emma Parker shed more than 8st after believing she had been given a second chance at life. In August 2010, aged 18 and already . unhappy with her weight, the customer services adviser from Jacksdale, . Nottinghamshire, was devastated when she was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s . lymphoma. Fighting fit: Emma, 20, is now a svelte size 10 (left) after shedding . eight stone (right). She was inspired after beating cancer at 19 . But when doctors confirmed she was beating the disease, she decided to join her local Slimming World group and managed to lose 8st 3.5lb and drop seven dress sizes in just seven months. She has now been named Slimming World’s Miss Slinky 2012. Miss Parker said: 'Having Hodgkin’s lymphoma made me realise how important life is and not to take things like your health for granted. 'I wanted to be as healthy as I could so that if anything ever happened again I would be fitter and stronger, and I wanted to change everything that made me unhappy, which my weight definitely did.' Miss Parker, who lives with her parents and works for the Co-operative Group, was overweight from the age of eight or nine. At her heaviest she weighed more than . 18st and found even simple tasks like cleaning, walking the dog or . climbing stairs left her out of breath and her joints aching. Then, 18 months ago, she discovered a lump in her neck and was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. 'I thought I'd always be big': At her heaviest Emma Parker found that climbing stairs left her out of breath . She said: 'I’d been struggling with my breathing a lot and even started using an inhaler, then I got a cough that wouldn’t go away. 'I thought it was all down to my weight so it was a real shock when I found out I had cancer, especially as I was only 18. 'Now I’ve lost weight I feel so much fitter and healthier and I don’t get out of breath any more - even when I go jogging.' After undergoing 12 gruelling chemotherapy sessions and a biopsy, she was delighted when doctors decided she did not need further treatment. With her doctor’s approval she started her weight loss journey by joining her local Slimming World group in Leabrooks, Alfreton, in March last year. By October she had reached her target weight of 9st 11lb and had gone from a size 22 to a size 10. She said: 'I never tried any diets because I didn’t believe they’d work for me and I thought I’d always be big. 'My auntie was going to Slimming World and every time I saw her she looked better and better. 'I was nervous because I thought I’d be the youngest person there and worried people would laugh or stare, but there were people of all ages and I got such a warm welcome I immediately felt more relaxed. 'The results have been unbelievable too.' She started following Slimming World’s Food Optimising healthy eating plan and replaced takeaways and fatty foods with healthy home-cooked meals including her favourite chilli con carne and rice. She said: 'It isn’t really a diet. There’s so much variety that I’ve never felt bored and it encouraged me to try lots of new foods. 'I lost 4lb in my first week and that’s when I knew I could really do it, because I realised I could lose weight without feeling like I was missing out on the things I like.' Her group voted for her to represent them in Slimming World’s Miss Slinky 2012 competition and now she has been named the national winner she plans to spend her £2,000 winnings on a new size 10 wardrobe. Miss Parker, who is hoping to be able to celebrate being given the all-clear for a year next month, added: 'Losing weight hasn’t just changed the way I look, it’s changed my whole outlook on life. 'I’m so much happier now and I believe I can achieve anything I want to. I feel that after having cancer, I’ve been given a second chance and I want to make the most of it.'","Emma had assumed she needed an inhaler because of her weight before she found lump in neck .

Senator Davis was not in her office at the time, but two of her staff members were. No one was injured.

Her office says they don't know if the attacks were politically motivated. ‘Politics is always very heated and so we don't know that this has anything to do with politics. 'We'll know more when police and fire identify a suspect,’ said Anthony Spangler, Davis' communications director. Officials say witnesses saw someone ignite a fire then flee the scene, but they did not release any other details on the investigation.","Arsonists attacked the offices of Texas senator Wendy Davis .

"By . Daniel Miller . UPDATED: . 10:58 EST, 21 March 2012 . Guilty: Lavinia Desuze was convicted . of perverting the course of justice after she shredded the . top her 16-year-old son was wearing . when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes . The mother of a teenage thug who killed a pensioner in last summer’s riots is facing jail after she destroyed his clothes in a bid to cover his tracks. Lavinia Desuze, 31, was today convicted of perverting the course of justice after she shredded the distinctive ‘Robbers and Villains’ top her 16-year-old son was wearing when he attacked 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes. The pensioner was trying to put out a fire near his home in Ealing, west London, when he was punched with such force by looter Darrell Desuze that he fractured his skull on the pavement. He died three days later in hospital. But unlike other horrified parents, who 'turned in their own children' after seeing their faces broadcast on TV, Darrell’s mother cut up the top he was wearing after spotting it during a televised appeal for help in finding the killer. She then cycled a mile from her Hounslow home in the dead of night to dump the top, an Adidas bag and white T-shirt in two separate bins in a bid to evade police. A jury of six men and six women took just 20 minutes to convict her of perverting the course of justice following a three-day trial at Inner London Crown Court. She will be sentenced on April 17 with her son Darrell, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, burglary and violent disorder earlier this month. The Honourable Mr Justice Saunders, sitting at Inner London Crown Court, granted the 31-year-old mother bail until next month but warned she faces a prison sentence. He said: 'I don’t want you to be under any misapprehension. The fact that I have adjourned this case for pre-sentence reports does not in any way mean that it will not conclude with a custodial sentence. It is a very serious matter.' Son: Darrell Desuze, seen aiming an imaginary gun in a picture on Facebook and in a . police mugshot, punched Richard . Mannington Bowes . to the ground, killing him with a single blow . The brutal attack on Mr Mannington . Bowes shocked the nation and a photograph of his unconscious body became . one of the defining images of last summer’s riots. Darrell, whose street name is Smokey, went on to loot several shops after he attacked the pensioner. During the trial, prosecutor Brian . Altman QC told jurors his mother had destroyed the clothing in a . deliberate attempt to help him evade justice. 'The prosecution say there was only . one reason why she did what she did. She realised the distinctive . articles of clothing would lead to not only to her son’s identification . but also to him facing justice for what he had done,' he said. Help: Lying headfirst on the ground Richard Mannington Bowes, left, is assisted by Peter Firstbrook and a police officer during the riots in Ealing . Having destroyed the clothing, the . mother later admitted her actions to police, even leading officers to . the bins where she had disposed of the bags but they had been already . been emptied when they arrived. The jury had heard how prior . to her and her son’s arrest a 22-year-old man had been detained by . police on suspicion of Mr Bowe’s murder after being wrongly identified . on the CCTV. Tragic: Richard Mannington Bowes, pictured, hit his head on the ground and never woke up . When the . Met arrived at her home in Hounslow, west London, she is alleged to have . said: 'You’ve got the bloke that did it. Why are you here for my son?' Ms . Desuze admitted her son had been in Ealing that night but claimed he . had tried to help Mr Bowes, allegedly saying: 'He was there when he was . punched. My son helped that man. He put him in the recovery position.' When she was arrested by officers, the 31-year-old answered ‘no comment’ in interview. But in a later outburst in a police . car she blamed police for Mr Mannington Bowes death by sparking off the . riots with the shooting of Mark Duggan, saying: 'Police can kill someone . and get away with it. But a man died after being attacked in the riots, . not murder, and the whole force is out,” the jury was told. Giving evidence during the trial, she . denied trying to pervert justice and claimed that she had destroyed his . clothes to protect him from angry looting victims. She told jurors she had heard that a . man had been charged with the killing and was concerned for her son’s . safety if he wore the clothing. She said: “I didn’t want my son . attacked by anyone who suffered from the riots or had sentimental . feelings about them because I myself was affected by the riots. 'He definitely would have been in danger - he was 16 years old and in a vulnerable situation.' Together: Court sketch of Darrell and Lavinia Desuze at Inner London Crown Court . Asked by Mr Altman QC if the ‘real . truth’ was that ‘you knew the police were after your son and that they . had gotten the wrong man,’ she replied: 'I couldn’t have known that.' Summing up the case, Mr Justice . Saunders told the jury they would have to decide why she did not give . the same account to police when they arrested her. 'If you reach the conclusion that she . didn’t mention it at the time because she hadn’t invented it by then - . as the prosecution say it was an invented explanation - that means that . you have to carry on to conclude that it wasn’t true,' he said. Hard man: Images from Facebook show Darrell Desuze in defiant pose . There was a stand-off between police and . rioters on Spring Bridge Road in Ealing at the time of the tragedy and . around 70 youths were lobbing missiles at officers. As Mr Mannington Bowes remonstrated with . the group and tried to stamp out a fire in a bin Desuze punched . him in the face and he fell smashing his head on the pavement. Mr . Altman added: 'Because of her actions this defendant is charged with . perverting the course of justice by concealing or destroying her son’s . clothing, the Robbers and Villains top, the patterned white T-shirt and . the distinctive Adidas bag, items which, say the prosecution, she knew . would rightly point the finger of guilt at her son. 'She . knew he had been in Ealing. She knew he had been involved in killing Mr . Bowes so in order to prevent any link with this crime she got rid of it . all for one reason and one reason only, to obstruct the course of . justice.'","Lavinia Desuze shredded top her 16-year-old son was wearing when he killed 68-year-old Richard Mannington Bowes .

Jenny Roderick has posted thousands of fliers about her missing granddaughter in northern Kentucky cities. A pretty 17-year old girl, Paige Johnson disappeared last September and police have no leads in the case. Now, officials in Covington Kentucky, are they're telling the girl's grandmother to remove her posters from city property. While putting up them up in Covington last week, Ms Roderick was stopped by police and told that putting fliers on city utility poles was illegal. Scroll down for video . Missing: Jenny Roderick has posted fliers seeking her granddaughter all over northern Kentucky . Ms Roderick told WKRC Cincinnati: 'He wasn't mean or anything, he was just insistent that I had to take them down. And by the time I was walking back after he left, I was crying.' Bearing the summer heat, Ms Roderick spends most of her spare time posting the missing girl's flyer around the region. Refusing to give up hope, she said: 'We still want people to know that that she's not found. And that, you know, there's tons of people that love her.' Paige Johnson is also the mother of a two-year-old daughter named Kenzie. Her grandmother added that: 'It has affected our whole family. We miss her something fierce. And we want her home, you know, even if it is the other way. 'We still want her home and this is what keeps me going.' Young mother: A friend of Paige's commented on this picture on facebook saying: 'How cute are they.. Don't forget to pray for Paige's lil girl.. We hope you come back soon' A spokesperson for the Covington Police said that the officer confronted Ms Roderick because the city received a complaint. He suggested she put them up in legal spots, like store windows and bulletin boards. But Ms Roderick chose utility poles because of their high visibility, and she said that: 'Some businesses will let us put them up in the windows, but not very many. While insisting that the city has 'no intention of being insensitive to her family,' the city manager said that regardless of what the posters say, they have to come down because they break city ordinances. Police department spokesman Spike Jones said officers had begun removing signs but would leave them up in some areas to 'try to balance compassion with the law.' Not giving up: Ms Roderick said: 'we still want people to know that that she's not found. And that, you know, there's tons of people that love her' Paige Johnson was last seen on September 23 by her friend, 23-year-old Jacob Bumpus. Mr Bumpus told police he dropped her off at a friend's house at 1am, but she never made it there and hasn't been heard from since. He came under investigation and hired an attorney. Police say he has cooperated with them and is no longer considered a suspect. Nevertheless, Mr Bumpus is currently locked up on a parole violation. Paige's friends meanwhile have spread the word digitally about her disappearance on facebook and other social media sites. They've also organized benefits to support the girl's family, and regularly post images of her online to remind people that she's still missing.

A machine purrs as it delivers electrical pulses deep into the saggy skin on Barbara Penha's jawline, a high-tech treatment used first to tighten her jowls and then to sculpt her tummy. The technique is all the rage at the chic dermatology clinics that cater to legions of wealthy women here who invest serious time and big bucks into looking their bikini best. But Penha isn't a socialite, nor did she fork out the $450 that a single radio-frequency session typically runs in Rio de Janeiro. The struggling housewife got the treatment free of charge at a clinic that provides the poor access to the kinds of pricey cosmetic treatments that have become almost de rigueur among Brazil's moneyed elite. Fair: Nilcea Furtado receives a free of charge radio-frequency treatment by Dr. Ana Paula, right, at the Brazilian Society of Aesthetic Medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . Free Botox and laser hair removal, free chemical peels and anti-cellulite treatments may at first seem shockingly frivolous in a country like Brazil — which, despite phenomenal economic growth in recent years that has lifted millions out of extreme poverty, still battles with diseases like tuberculosis and dengue. But the philosophy behind the more than 220 clinics across Brazil that treat people like Penha and thousands of maids, receptionists, waitresses and others is simple: Beauty is a right, and the poor deserve to be ravishing, too. The Brazilian Society of Aesthetic Medicine's Rio clinic has performed free procedures on more than 14,000 patients since its founding in 1997, said Dr. Nelson Rosas, who heads the Rio branch. Good looks, doctors argue, are more than skin deep, and by treating what patients view as physical flaws doctors are often also healing their psyches. 'What's a wrinkle? Something minor, right? Something with precious little importance,' Rosas said. 'But when we treat the wrinkle, that unimportant little thing, we're actually treating something very important: The patient's self esteem.' The notion that beauty treatments can act in much the same way as psychoanalysis, helping free patients from crippling neuroses, was pioneered over the past decades by celebrated Brazilian plastic surgeon Ivo Pitanguy. Free of charge: Doctors perform an abdominoplasty surgery at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on March 21. The hospital focuses on reconstructive operations for burn victims and people with serious deformations, but it also provides discounted cosmetic procedures . Nicknamed the 'philosopher of plastic surgery' for his intellectual and psychoanalytical take on the vocation, 85-year-old Pitanguy is largely responsible for Brazil's reputation as a world leader in the field and a top destination for cosmetic surgery tourism. His skill with the scalpel catapulted him to international fame — the surgeon is arguably Brazil's second most famous person after soccer legend Pele. It's made him the go-to man for A-list celebrities, international statesmen and royalty seeking a quick fix to their aesthetic woes. Pitanguy's long and illustrious patient roster is said to include such luminaries as Zsa Zsa Gabor, Francois Mitterrand and Brigitte Bardot, although the discreet doctor has rarely named names. Pitanguy's handicraft on the world's rich and famous allowed him to join their ranks — he commutes to Rio by helicopter from his own private island. But he has remained attentive to the less privileged. More than half a century ago, he founded a surgical wing to help treat the poor. While the wing at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital in Rio focuses on reconstructive operations for burn victims and people with serious deformations, it also provides discounted cosmetic procedures. Other hospitals have since followed suit. Now, at least two dozen mostly public hospitals in Rio alone offer discounted or sometimes free cosmetic surgeries to low income people, according to a website aimed at informing potential patients. Reconstructive: A doctor navigates a gurney with a breast implant patient through a door after surgery at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital. At least two dozen, mostly public hospitals in Rio alone offer discounted or sometimes free cosmetic surgeries to low income people . With more than 11.5 million operations a year, Brazil is the world's second biggest consumer of plastic surgery after the United States, but here there's none of the kind of stigma that still clings to the practice in the U.S. Local celebrities appear on the cover of glossy magazines with titles like 'Plastica e Beleza,' or 'Plastic (Surgery) and Beauty,' and wax poetic about their latest face-lift, breast implant, or round of Botox. Actors on the prime time soap operas that captivate the public here regularly get surgical makeovers, as do the characters they play as part of the soaps' high-drama story lines. Silicone, on prominent display at the beach all year round, takes center stage during Carnival, when samba queens wearing only a sprinkling of sequins and feathers flaunt their pumped-up bustlines and gravity-defying rear ends at Rio's extravagant Sambadrome parade. (Breast and buttock implants are among the most popular plastic surgeries here, along with liposuction, facelifts and procedures to flatten prominent ears). The senate is currently debating whether the government's national health service should fully cover breast reconstruction for cancer patients. The state-funded health service already pays for gastroplasties for the morbidly obese and some surgeries to repair serious deformities or injuries, including correcting cleft palates in children. 'In Brazil, plastic surgery is now seen as something of the norm,' said Alexander Edmonds, an anthropology professor at the University of Amsterdam and author of Pretty Modern: Beauty, Sex and Plastic Surgery in Brazil. 'In a way, surgery is becoming the standard of care among middle class and wealthy women, and so it's not surprising that lower class people aspire to it, too.' Surgery: Barbara Penha receives a free of charge radio-frequency treatment on her abdomen by Doctor Nelson Rosas, at the Brazilian Society of Aesthetic Medicine clinic in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil . While he acknowledges the potent psychological benefits that sometimes result from plastic surgery, Edmonds warns that Brazil's overwhelmingly pro-plastica attitude can be dangerous. 'The word beauty in Brazil kind of obscures the fact that you're talking about real surgery,' he said. 'The problems and risks of surgery are often minimized, and these operations tend to be seen like a 'beautification' like any other, which of course they're not.' Still, worries about risk don't appear to be holding many here back. On the few days a year when low-income people can apply for free or cut-rate cosmetic surgeries, the lines snake out and around the hospitals. Once their case has been approved, patients often spend months or even years on the waiting list ahead of the actual surgery. The free surgeries are widely seen to benefit the hospitals, too, as they allow young doctors to hone their skills. Nilcea Furtado said she waited three years for her first free laser treatment there. Though the clinic, which is also a private training institute for doctors, doesn't perform surgical procedures that require anything more than local anesthetic, Furtado says she's experienced the kinds of psychological benefits described by superstar surgeon Pitanguy. 'Since I was a teenager, I had lots of horrible hairs on my chin and I tried everything to get rid of them but nothing worked,' said Furtado, a 48-year-old secretary whose entire monthly salary is less than a single laser hair removal treatment session. 'I had heard that lasers were effective but they're so expensive, they seemed like an impossible dream for me.' Six free laser hair removal sessions later, Furtado's chin is silky smooth and she says she's a new woman. 'I never knew what it was to look into the mirror and like what I saw,' she said. 'It's an amazing feeling.'","A Rio clinic has performed free procedures on more than 14,000 .

Gabor Rakonczay, of Hungary, set off from Lagos, Portugal on December 21 to begin his solo mission from Europe to the Caribbean. On Sunday he reached the island of Antigua, having made one brief stop in the Canary Islands for rest and supplies. A long way from home: Gabor Rakonczay set off in December from Portugal and arrived in Antigua on Sunday . Rakonczay was incommunicado for 50 days of his voyage after his 7.5 metre canoe capsized, damaging his communications equipment. It had been his only way of keeping in contact with his family, having turned down a satellite tracking system because it was too expensive. So since the line went dead on February his wife Viktoria could only wait and hope for the best. She had previously rowed the Atlantic with Rakonczay but on this occasion remained behind in Hungary. ‘The supplier raised the price at the last minute and I decided to leave without one because it was not possible to postpone the trip,’ the 30-year-old said from Nelson’s Dockyard in southern Antigua. ‘This trip was the first time I didn’t have a tracking system and the first time I really would have needed one.’ Treacherous: Gabor Rakonczay made his voyage without a satellite tracking system because of the expense . But Viktoria remained convinced sure her husband was alive and well throughout his seven weeks of silence, maintaining her certitude that it would be down to equipment failure and nothing more sombre. She posted entries daily on their website, speculating about his position in the canoe nicknamed Valiant and what weather conditions he might be facing. Rakonczay said that in his solitude he often thought about what his loved ones would be going through in his absence. He added that he felt heartened by the faith and confidence his family had in his abilities during the long and unavoidable silence. ‘I was positively surprised in those at home ... because everyone was certain that if I run into any difficulties, I’ll be able to solve them,’ Rakonczay said. ‘It was a great relief to reach port because it meant completing the journey and because my family could finally know for sure that I was OK.’ In his small vessel Rakonczay was at the mercy of the elements and off the radar for many larger boats. Lonely: Gabor Rakonczay was incommunicado for 50 of his 76 days at sea after his canoe capsized rendering his communications equipment useless . He lit smoke flares on three separate occasions to signal ships passing nearby, but failed to communicate with them. ‘Some slowed and even changed direction as they likely picked me up on their radars,’ Rakonczay said. ‘But I was often surrounded by waves 4 meters high and the canoe is less than one meter high, so it’s most likely that they simply weren’t able to see me.’ Despite Rakonczay’s technical difficulties he reached his destination 20 days earlier than planned. Since docking, his achievement has been confirmed by the London-based Ocean Rowing Society International, which adjudicates such feats for the Guinness World Records. Atlantic crossings had previously been made in rowboats and kayaks, but not a canoe, in which a paddle with a single blade is used. ‘We were disappointed he had no satellite tracking on board,’ said Tatiana Rezva-Crutchlow, editor-in-chief of the society’s website. ‘We are very pleased to hear that he has arrived.’ ‘I was very interested in discovering what it’s like to be all alone on a ship in the ocean,’ Rakonczay said. ‘It was my childhood dream.’","Set off from Lagos, Portugal on December 21, arriving in Antigua on Sunday .

"By . Emily Sheridan . UPDATED: . 09:56 EST, 18 January 2012 . Coronation Street has sparked a storm of protest from viewers after an episode showed a child being smacked. Hundreds took to web forums and Twitter to express outrage at the scene which features Faye being hit by her adoptive mother’s boyfriend Owen Armstrong. The builder, played by Ian Puleston-Davies, loses his temper after the ten-year-old schoolgirl deliberately poisons the  fish in his pond. He is seen whacking 10-year-old Faye, played by Ellie-Louise Leach, on the back of the legs as she winches in pain. Controversial: Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies) goes to slap Faye (Ellie Leach) in a scene from Coronation Street . Punishment: The 10-year-old winches in pain as Owen strikes her legs . Monday's episode attracted 9.5million viewers and has led to a small number of complaints to Ofcom and ITV. But many more fans used social networks and blogging sites to express their disgust at show’s producers. One web forum poster described the character’s actions as 'psychotic'. Another said: 'He was really laying into her, or that was the writers' intent.' An angrier fan added: 'Don’t think it should have been shown. Not necessary in this life today. No need for it.' Since the Children’s Act came into effect in January 2005, parents are legally allowed to smack their children. But use of 'excessive force', which cause visible bruising, graze, scratches, minor swellings or cuts, could result in assault charges. The child-smacking seen left some views feeling uncomfortable, while others complained to Ofcom . One Twitter user did not believe that there was anything to complain about . The furore appears to be a sign of the times. Even a few years ago, similar scenes are unlikely to have raised as many eyebrows. It also reflects that the issue of smacking children is still a huge taboo in society. Coronation Street, along with other prime-time soaps, regularly shows much more violent and controversial scenes – albeit featuring adults - which generate little comment. These have recently included the rape of Carla Connor by her partner Frank Foster, a hostage drama which ended with escaped prisoner Tony Gordon shooting dead his cellmate and an explosive tram crash which left several characters dead. Since joining the soap last January, Faye has been something of a problem child and has been seen trying to disrupt her mother’s budding romance with Owen. The focus of many complaints is that Owen is not the child’s father but the boyfriend of her mother Anna Windass, played by Debbie Rush. While many objected to the actual smack, some critics said it would have only been appropriate for her mother  to discipline her in such a way. One Twitter user wrote: 'Owen should never smacked Faye as she wasn't his child but she deserved a smack.' Staff from children’s charity the NSPCC have said they are glad the show's producers have raised the debate. Troublemaker: Owen chastised Faye after she poisoned his fish pond . Spokesman Phillip Noyes told Mail Online: 'We all accept that parents have to be in charge and that clear and consistent boundaries are essential for children and young people to have a secure and happy childhood. 'But evidence shows that smacking is not an effective form of punishment and sets a bad example, especially for children who have a troubled past as in this storyline. 'It teaches children that violence is an answer and it undermines the trusting relationship between a child and their carer. Young people tell us it leaves them feeling frightened and confused but often doesn’t actually deter them from repeating what they were smacked for. Under the 2004 Children's Act, which . came into force in January 2005, mild smacking is allowed but any . punishment which causes visible bruising, grazes, scratches, minor . swellings or cuts can result in legal action. Those who break the law can be punished with up to five years in jail. 'And for a minority of bad parents who . go well beyond smacking and seriously harm their children, it is all too . often used as an excuse to social services, the police and the courts.' The plotline was announced in November but it sparked little controversy at the time. Today, the show’s producers said it did not condone Owen’s actions, adding that that follow-up storyline made this clear. Anna is expected to end the relationship over the incident. A Coronation Street spokesman said: 'We most certainly don’t condone Owen’s actions – as will be seen by the ramifications of the slap, and the effect it has on his relationship.' An ITV spokesman said: 'The episode and subsequent episodes do not condone the slap and it has far reaching ramifications for the character of Owen. ‘That said we have no problem with sparking a healthy debate on this issue.' Actor Puleston-Davies said he and scriptwriters had approached the smacking issue cautiously.He said: 'I think any controversial subject handled in the right way is good controversy not bad controversy. ‘I know it was talked about within the writing group and with the producers at length, so they were very careful. 'I was very aware that I wanted to go through the script with a fine-tooth comb. ‘From the moment it was suggested, they took it very carefully and very slowly, so it took a long time to reach the script stage, and rightly so. I'm happy with the finished result.' Ructions: The ramifications of the slap will lead Anna Windass (Debbie Rush) to end her relationship with Owen . MP John Hemming said that he agreed with smacking as a form of punishment. He told the Mirror: 'There is a line when it comes to these things, and the main thing is what is best for the child. 'Parents are best placed to decide what is best. Smacking, when used responsibly, can work in the child’s best interests.' He added: 'How can you make it illegal for a parent to slap their child on the wrist? The Government should think carefully before making any changes.' In a 2010 survey by the Children's Society to identify the biggest risks for children aged six to 15, just a third of adults believed slapping children as a standard punishment was 'high risk' to their welfare.","Viewers take to Twitter to express outrage at Owen Armstrong hitting Faye .

A psychiatric patient accused with slaughtering his hospital room mate pleaded not guilty to the man's murder. Bart Schafer, 32, allegedly assaulted Robert King, 53, in the room they shared at the County of San Diego Hospital on March 17. King was found covered in blood at around 2pm by staff at the hospital. As they desperately tried to save him he went into cardiac arrest, suffering from severe head injuries. Scene: Robert King was allegedly murdered by his room mate at the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital . He was transported to another hospital with bleeding on the brain and facial fractures but died on Sunday from his injuries. Lt. Kevin Rooney of the San Diego Police Department said: ‘They got him to the trauma center as fast as they could. ‘Shortly after, the psychiatric hospital staff called police and requested officers evaluate Mr. King’s injuries, and we realised that it wasn’t an accident and it was more likely that he had been assaulted.’ At the time Schafer claimed King had fallen and hurt himself, but prosecutors claim he eventually admitted that he had slammed the victim's face into the . ground. Schafer was arrested and charged with attempt murder and assault with a deadly weapon. When King died his charge was upgraded to murder. Room mates: King and Schafer shared a room but it is likely they did not each other well . Rooney said the two patients were roommates, but likely did not know each other well - the average time a patient stays in the hospital is two weeks. When patients are admitted to a psychiatric hospital, they go through a careful assessment to determine whether they are at risk of hurting themselves or others. Deputy District Attorney Makenzie Harvey said the defendant had been . committed to the psychiatric hospital because of a recent arrest and had . been the victim's roommate for only a short time. Schafer faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted. His bail, initially arraigned last week on an attempted murder charge, was increased Monday from $250,000 to $750,000 after King died from his injuries. He will be back in court April 4 for a status conference and April 18 for a preliminary hearing.","Bart Schafer accused in the murder of former hospital room mate Robert King .

The makers of Chupa Chups lollipops, Nutella, Coca-Cola, Britvic and even the British Soft Drinks Association have been reported to the Advertising Standards Authority for allegedly targeting children with ‘half-truths’. While junk food advertising is banned during children’s television programmes, campaigners fear companies are using the internet as a loophole. Under fire: Soft drink maker Britvic made claims about tooth decay on an educational website . Worst offender: The makers of Chupa Chups (left) suggested its yellow lollipops are made only from lemon juice while Nutella (right) omitted its sugar content . In a poll by the Children’s Food Campaign, Chupa Chups was voted the worst offender for a video on its website suggesting its yellow lollipops are made only from real lemon juice. In fact, they contain just 3 per cent fruit and are mostly made of sugar and glucose syrup, according to the label. The runner-up was the British Soft Drinks Association, the industry’s trade body, which claimed in educational materials on its website that ‘small quantities of sugar’ may need to be added to fruit juices because ‘variations in climate and reduced sunshine levels can affect the crop’. The campaign group said the claim was ‘disingenuous’. 'Enriched with vitamins': Coca-Cola said its Glaceau Vitaminwater contained fruit juice . Third on the list, voted for by 1,000 people contacted by the Children’s Food Campaign, was soft drink maker Britvic. It claimed on an educational website that ‘dentists believe insufficient saliva, a side effect of not drinking enough, may be a major cause of tooth decay’. It was not made clear that soft drinks contain sugar and are often acidic – major causes of decay. Coca-Cola, which owns the brand Glaceau Vitaminwater, claimed online that it is a range of ‘spring waters with fruit juice, and enriched with minerals and vitamins’. The campaigners say only three out of the eight products in the range contain fruit and in those that do, it is actually fruit concentrate. Last on the list was Nutella, which was reported to the ASA earlier this year for a TV commercial that mentioned the product’s hazelnut content but not sugar – the first ingredient on the label. The complaint was not upheld. Kawther Hashem of the Children’s Food Campaign said: ‘It is unforgivable that junk food companies relentlessly target children, but also shamelessly mislead the public with half-truths and made-up so-called facts.’ She urged the Government to protect children with ‘consistent advertising regulations and vigorous enforcement across all forms of media’. The British Soft Drinks Association accused the campaign group of ‘misrepresenting information’ on its website. Chupa Chups declined to comment on its website video. Coca-Cola said an ‘incorrect description’ on the Glaceau section of its website had been removed. No one was available to comment at Britvic yesterday.

"By . Leon Watson . UPDATED: . 07:16 EST, 2 January 2012 . Surfing will try to wipe out drug cheats with a radical move to bring in comprehensive testing for the first time. The sport's international governing body, the Association of Surfing Professionals,  will roll out a policy for screening competitors this year. Surfing has long been associated with 1960s and 70s counter culture and the recreational use of marijuana and LSD. Surfer Andy Irons died from a heart attack with traces of crystal meth, methadone and cocaine in his blood . But now the sport is cracking down on its growing culture of performance enhancing drugs at its top level. It comes after the death of the triple world champion Andy Irons, from Hawaii, in November 2010. A postmortem found he died from a heart attack and 'acute mixed drug ingestion'. Traces of methadone, methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth, and a metabolite of cocaine were found in his bloodstream. Another professional surfer, Anthony Ruffo, a 47-year-old pioneer of the Santa Cruz scene in the 1980s, is facing a possible jail sentence for selling methamphetamine after he was caught with an ounce of the drug. ASP spokesman Dave Prodan told the Guardian: 'We believe this is a natural evolution in enhancing the professionalism of our sport.'

He added that the ASP have been in discussions over regulations with the World Anti Doping Agency for more than two years. Professional . surfers compete for prizes of up to $100,000 (£65,000) and testing is . already carried out at some European events and in the UK and Ireland. In 2005, the Brazilian surfer Neco Padaratz was suspended after he tested positive for performance-enhancing anabolic steroids at an event in Hossegor on the French Atlantic coast. Peter Davi, a pioneering big wave surfer, was found to have high levels of methamphetaine in his blood after he died in December 2007 riding a 20m wave off California. He sustained head and chest injuries, probably from being dashed against jagged rocks. Gerry Fitzgerald, a professional in Ireland, said that for most surfers, the idea of taking drugs before tackling dangerous waves was anathema. 'I have seen guys who are stoners and they drop off the scene because it is not sustainable,' he said. 'Athletes are training hard. The way the contests are now, it will catch up with you.' Pancho Sullivan, a professional surfer from Hawaii said he supported the new testing regime despite a tradition of recreational drug use in the sport.","Sport's elite athletes face testing .

A cap on political donations could be imposed without cross-party agreement in the wake of the ‘cash for access’ scandal under plans being discussed by ministers. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will lead talks starting this week aimed at forcing all three main parties to accept a donations limit. This would be coupled with new restrictions on spending during elections and more flexible rules on the use of existing state funding of politics. 'Significant donor': Fares Fares and his wife Tania have dined with PM David Cameron at Chequers. Mr Fares has given the Tories £247,500 since 2008 . But with all sides determined to defend their own interests, Government sources say legislation for a donations cap could be introduced even if talks fail. The donations row has engulfed Number 10 this week after Tory treasurer Peter Cruddas was caught boasting he could secure dinner invitations to the Prime Minister’s homes in return for six-figure donations. Mr Cameron, who denies that claim, was forced to release the names of 15 Tory donors who had been invited to dine with him at Downing Street or Chequers since he became Prime Minister. Together they have given the Conservative Party £25million. Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to release details of private meetings with major donors by the end of this week. Talks: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . Senior Tories believe the main parties are doomed to never-ending sleaze allegations without radical changes to party funding because of perceived conflicts of interest between donors and government policy. They accept they now have little option but to speed up party funding reform but insist it must apply to Labour’s multi-million pound handouts from the unions. The Tories are proposing an annual . limit of £50,000 on donations from individuals or companies, but are . prepared to consider a lower threshold to secure agreement. Conservative . sources say they cannot contemplate a donations cap unless Labour . agrees that trades unions should have to require members to ‘opt in’ to . affiliation fees going to the party. ‘If . Labour won’t agree we should grab the initiative and push new laws . through the Commons – and dare Labour to vote against them,’ said one. Radical . proposals made late last year by sleaze watchdog the Committee on . Standards in Public Life have been rejected as politically . unacceptable, since they would involve £100million more in taxpayers’ money going to political parties to compensate for a £10,000 donations . cap. Government sources say Mr Clegg, who . is in charge of party funding reform at the Cabinet Office, will now . press for a limit to be imposed even if there is no increase in state . funding to sweeten the pill. He, Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband have agreed . to open discussions on such a move. It . would be coupled with a new cap on spending by parties at election time . to reduce the money they require, and an overhaul of the existing . system of state funding. Political . parties already receive millions of pounds a year from the taxpayer, . including money to fund opposition activities in the Lord and Commons, . special advisers’ salaries, grants for policy development and cash for . direct mailshots by MPs.

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 17:57 EST, 18 August 2011 . Held: Former U.S. editor James Desborough was arrested this morning raising fresh questions about whether the NotW hacked phones in America . An award-winning Hollywood-based News of the World reporter was today being questioned by police about phone hacking allegations. James Desborough, who was the paper's U.S. editor, and based in Los Angeles was arrested as he arrived at a south London police station today. The questioning of an America-based journalist raises fresh questions about whether the NotW were involved in hacking phones in America. The FBI are probing claims that 9/11 . victims may have had their phone's hacked by journalists working for . News Corp - the parent company of the News of the World. The phone hacking is not alleged to have occurred while the reporter was in the U.S. Desborough, 38, met police at 10.30am this morning for a pre-arranged appointment and was arrested. It has been revealed that Celebrity couple Leslie Ash and Lee Chapman have settled their phone hacking claim against the News of the World - and now plan to take action against other newspapers. The actress and the former footballer sued the now-closed Sunday tabloid over fears that it illegally listened to their voicemails while Ash was recovering from a superbug in hospital in 2004. The couple said they were 'pleased' the claims they and their sons brought against the paper's publishers, News Group Newspapers, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had been settled. In another development this evening, the private investigator jailed over phone hacking for the newspaper revealed that he is taking legal action against News International. Glenn Mulcaire, who was jailed for six months in 2007 for intercepting messages on royal aides' phones, has lodged papers at the High Court. A spokeswoman for News International, which owned the now-defunct Sunday tabloid, confirmed the action was being taken, adding that 'the claim will be vigorously contested'. Neither News International or Mr Mulcaire's solicitor Sarah Webb, of Payne Hicks Beach, would give any further details about the nature of the action. The newspaper, which was shut down last month, is also facing new claims that knowledge of phone hacking was much wider than previously thought. A letter written by the News of the World’s former royal editor Clive Goodman alleged that other colleagues were involved in phone hacking and that it was widely discussed in editorial conference - until reference to it was banned by then editor Andy Coulson. Desborough's arrest comes a day after allegations . of misconduct against former Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul . Stephenson and his top officer John Yates were dismissed by the Independent Police Complaints . Commission. Fresh arrest: James Desborough became the 13th person to be held when he was arrested today. The News of the World has been shutdown by parent company News International . Celebrity couple Leslie Ash and Lee Chapman (pictured) have settled their phone hacking claim against the News of the World - and now plan to take action against other newspapers. The actress and the former footballer sued the now-closed Sunday tabloid over fears that it illegally listened to their voicemails while Ash was recovering from a superbug in hospital in 2004. The couple said they were 'pleased' the claims they and their sons brought against the paper's publishers, News Group Newspapers, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had been settled. But they added that they believe phone hacking also went on at other media organisations and intend to bring claims against other papers. They said in a statement: 'We are pleased to say that our and our sons' claims against News Group Newspapers (NGN) Limited and Mr Mulcaire have been resolved. 'NGN has agreed to pay our family an appropriate sum by way of compensation and costs and it has apologised for the harm and distress it has caused us. The couple revealed in January that police investigating phone hacking at the News of the World had found documents listing their names, addresses and phone numbers as well as the mobile details of their children. They said they feared highly personal voicemails left by their sons were intercepted while former Men Behaving Badly star Ash was recovering at home after contracting the MSSA infection, a strain of the superbug MRSA, in hospital in 2004. News International declined to comment. Sir Paul and Mr Yates launched a furious broadside at the . police watchdog last night as they were cleared of misconduct. Both men quit over the furore . surrounding the force’s hiring of hacking suspect Neil Wallis – a former . News of the World deputy editor – as a PR consultant and Sir Paul’s . £12,000 freebie at a luxury health spa promoted by Mr Wallis, who was . arrested in July over alleged phone hacking. Separately, reporters at the News of the World have been accused in a Daily Mirror report of offering to pay a New York police officer for private phone records of some victims of the 2001 attacks. Phone hacking suspect Desborough is the 13th person to be arrested as a result of the investigation Operation Weeting. Desborough was being questioned on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. A Scotland Yard spokesman said the suspect remains in custody over allegations of intercepting voicemails. The . reporter has been based in Los Angeles since April 2009 - a month after . he was named the showbusiness reporter of the year at the British Press . Awards. Desborough had . been with the paper since 2005 and broke a story that Fern Britton's . weight loss was down to having a gastric band operation rather than . simply dieting. He is among journalists in the midst of a . 90-day consultation period following News International's decision to . kill off the paper in the wake of the scandal. A statement from News International said: 'We are fully cooperating with . the police investigation and we are unable to comment further on . matters due to the ongoing police investigation.' Scotland Yard's fresh investigation into phone hacking was launched in January. A series of high-profile figures have . been arrested, including former News International chief executive . Rebekah Brooks and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson. The scandal has already caused the . closure of the News of the World after 168 years and the resignation of . Sir Paul and assistant commissioner John Yates. Rupert Murdoch has said there is nothing to suggest that phones have been hacked by News Corp employees in the U.S. A key letter in the phone hacking investigation which had sections redacted was not altered by police, it can be revealed. News International has been accused of trying to cover up claims that knowledge of phone-hacking was widespread at the paper. The bombshell Clive Goodman letter which alleged that other colleagues were involved in phone . hacking had significant sections redacted before it was given to a parliamentary committee. Spot the difference: The above letter was supplied to MPs by law firm Harbottle and Lewis and shows five numbered paragraphs with only the names of journalists blacked out. But below is the same letter, this time submitted by News International, showing that paragraphs three and four are missing completely. These excerpts refer to claims Goodman was employed despite saying he was guilty of hacking and later while in prison. Allegations that Tom Crane and Andy Coulson promised he could have his job back if he did not implicate anyone else on the paper are all missing completely. The News International copy of the letter also redacts more information relating to the editor and discussions during editorial meetings . It also alleged that phone hacking was openly discussed in editorial conference until then editor Andy Coulson banned reference to it. The police asked the publisher to . preserve the integrity of the investigation by removing names, a source . told the Daily Telegraph. News International has been accused of . attempting to cover-up after giving the Commons Select Committee a . version of the letter which had significant sections blacked out. Metropolitan Police investigators did . not ask for any other alterations to be made. It was News International . that took the decision to remove whole paragraphs. Law firm Harbottle & Lewis released a new version of the letter without the key sections redacted.

"By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 04:41 EST, 18 January 2012 . Even rival fans would admit it’s been a fine season for Cromer Town FC as the team sits at the top of its local league. But off the pitch the final whistle is about to be blown on a bizarre legal tussle that could see the players turfed out of their ground after nearly a century. Back in 1922, a rich local woman bequeathed the site to the Norfolk club - but stipulated it must be handed to the town 21 years after the death of all of King Edward VII’s descendants who were alive at the time. Closing time: Cromer Football Club could be forced to leave their ground of 90 years - 21 years after the death of Norway's King Olav V . The countdown was triggered in 1991 . when his grandson, King Olav V of Norway, passed away and yesterday . marked the 21st anniversary of his death. The . Crabs – who are named after the seaside town’s local delicacy – are . being allowed to stay put, however, while lawyers check for any ‘wriggle . room’ to help them avoid being sent off from Cabbell Park for good. At . the moment they are clinging on to the advice of a barrister who . believes they are entitled to another two decades after it was . discovered another descendant of the king died in 2011 and was in his . mother’s womb when the will came into effect. Death: King Olav V, left, died in 1991 . triggering the 21-year countdown to Cromer Football Club's eviction . which passed yesterday. Lawyers are arguing Lord Harewood, right, was . months away from being born in 1922 so the club's tenancy should run . until 20 years after his death . Bizarre bequest: Landowner Evelyn Bond-Cabbell who gave Cromer Football Club the ground when she died in 1922 . Paul Jarvis, chairman of the club, which plays in the Anglian Combination Premier Division, said: ‘Our barrister’s opinion is that we still have another 20-odd years.’ Despite the uncertainty caused by the passing of the deadline, he added it would have ‘no immediate effect’ on the team. ‘We’re sitting happily at the top of the league and aiming by the end of the season to still be there,’ he said. The park was bequeathed in 1922 by Evelyn Bond Cabbell, a wealthy landowner who lived in Cromer Hall, a grand 19th century Gothic revival country house. She wanted it to be used in memory of local residents killed in the First World War – but it remains unclear why the obscure clause was introduced stating when ownership should pass to the town. The football club has been making enquiries about relocating – reluctantly – to a new edge-of-town ground in case it loses its legal challenge. Any move could be financed by using part of the park for a new doctor’s surgery and some housing. But there could be a further problem as the local district council claims there is a legal precedent for it to take possession of the land, not the town.

He has said previously: ‘The trust . disappears 21 years after King Olav's death. I can confirm that when the . trust goes, the legal right for the football club to play at Cabbell . Park goes with it. ‘We will be looking at the wishes of . my great-grandmother to see how it's taken forward. She provided a . sports field for all of Cromer to enjoy. Her wishes are paramount.’ The club does, at least, have the support of the town’s mayor, Greg Hayman, who triggered the stay of execution by revealing the existence of the recently deceased royal descendant. The legal documents state the lease on the land would expire 21 years after the death of all the descendants of King Edward VII ‘now in being’ and Cllr Hayman argues this includes the Earl of Harewood. The 7th Earl, who died last year, was born two months after the club’s benefactor died. Cllr Hayman discovered the link through Burke’s Peerage, the authoritative guide to royal and titled families of the United Kingdom. ‘The football club is not happy with the arrangements to move out of town. We will bring a motion to fight to keep the club in Cromer,’ he said. The stand raises the prospect of a knock-out clash between the town and North Norfolk District Council, which claims it should take ownership of the land, like all assets of the former urban district council, under the 1974 local government reorganisation. But Cllr Hayman insisted the ground was gifted for the benefit of the town and the spirit of the donation should be honoured. He added: ‘That land belongs to Cromer, not the district council, and we should assert our right over it.’","Cromer Town FC must leave ground '21 years after death of all King Edward VII's descendants alive in 1922'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 10:07 EST, 28 March 2012 . The husband of a New York socialite has admitted to bilking a group of investigators out of $590,000 meant for a shopping website that was never created. Andrew Albert pleaded guilty to felony grand larceny Tuesday and faces up to four and a half years in prison. Authorities say Albert never intended to launch the site, which he claimed would become 'the Facebook of online shopping.' Instead, they claim Albert spent the cash on a lavish lifestyle which saw thousands of dollars paid out for groceries, pampering his dog and moving to a plush loft apartment in Manhattan's Tribeca district. Allegations: Andrew Albert (left), who is the husband of socialite Annie Churchill (right) has been accused of tricking investors out of $590,000, which was meant for a shopping website they say he never intended to create . The 49-year-old, married to Annie Churchill, is also said to have blown $20,000 on clothing, more than $9,000 on looking after his hair, and nearly $6,000 at health clubs. Ms Churchill, who is the ex-wife of Winston Churchill's grandson, was not implicated. Albert's lawyer said his client never intended to scam investors. '(He) did try to start a Web site and worked very hard on it for three years,' attorney Michael Farkas told the New York Post. As part of the plea deal, Albert will serve just three years in prison if he pays the investors back $50,000. If not -- he'll be forced to serve the whole term. Business: Andrew Albert said his shopping website would feature a virtual street akin to famous retail boulevards like Madison Avenue in New York . Prosecutors said Albert, of New York, had told investors he was about to launch a high-end shopping website called ON1AVE.com. It would eventually become the Facebook or Amazon of online shopping, he claimed. Visitors to the site would use an online avatar to 'walk' down a virtual street where they could 'shop' in the stores, which would be linked to actual firms like Prada, H&M and Ralph Lauren. The avatar would be programmed with the shopper's measurements, so users could 'try on' the garments before buying them. But the court heard that the venture was, in fact, a 'sham' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance said: 'Andrew Albert falsely told investors that his shopping website would feature a virtual street akin to famous retail boulevards like Madison Avenue or Rodeo Drive. Virtual shops: The website would have allowed shoppers to browse and buy in stores such as Prada (left) and H&M (right) 'In reality, the company he created served as nothing more than a bank account that the defendant used to pay for his personal expenses and lavish lifestyle. 'The defendant's elaborate deception defrauded investors of more than half a million dollars.' José Fanjul, an assistant district attorney, added in court: 'The defendant has shown he is untrustworthy and a self-interested character and is willing to put his own desires ahead of others.' According to documents filed in court, Albert formed a company called Virtual Etail Group LLC (VEG) in June 2008. That winter he started looking for investors. He told prospective partners they would not only be funding the development of the site, but would also become VEG employees and equity members. When specifically asked how he would support himself during the development period, Albert assured investors that he had savings from other projects, as well as stocks and bonds. Prosecutors said that, by June 2008, he had convinced his first investor to put $250,000 toward the online venture. Later that year another investor put up $100,000, while in autumn of 2008 a third person stumped up $240,000. House buy: Andrew Albert is said to have spent some of the cash on a loft apartment in Tribeca, New York . The investors claiming to have been defrauded are Michael Bedrick, described as a close friend of Ms Churchill; three family members, William, Christopher and Maggie Heath; and a group called the Robert Johnston Family Trust. They were each handed an equity share of the firm. The cash was placed into a company bank account, of which Albert was the sole signatory. Prosecutors say Albert then started to transfer tens of thousands of dollars to an account in the name of Equation Entertainment LLC, a nearly defunct media consulting business he had formed in 2004. They allege he used the account, for several years, to pay for rent, clothing, health and beauty expenditures, groceries, restaurants, and other personal expenses. He also used some of the money to move from a small apartment in Greenwich Village to a large $2,000 a month loft in Tribeca, it is claimed. Furthermore, it is claimed he used $51,000 to renovate the property, and $12,000 on moving and storage. And, at the time he was pushing the project, Albert was said to be heavily relying on his wife, who is not implicated in the investigation and has publicly backed her husband, for money. 'He’s innocent, and he’ll be vindicated - definitely, without a doubt,' she told the New York Times during a brief telephone interview. Albert has been released without bail and his lawyer George A Farkas said his client denied defrauding anyone. Mr Farkas added: 'This is absolutely nothing but investors in a high-risk venture not having the patience to wait. There is still time for this venture to get off the ground — maybe, maybe not.'","Andrew Albert said venture would become the 'Facebook of online shopping'

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 08:59 EST, 18 January 2012 . As three young talented brothers, there was always a chance their sporting careers would go down similar paths. But twins Rio and Cole Dasilva and their older brother Jay are unlike any other footballing family - as all three have been snapped up by Premier League Chelsea in a unique transfer deal. The talented twins, aged 12, and their 13-year-old sibling, joined Chelsea from Luton Town in separate deals each worth an undisclosed five-figure sum. Sibling rivalry: Rio, Cole (both 12) and Jay Dasilva, 13, pictured in Luton Town's colours before the move, have been snapped up by Chelsea in a unique transfer deal . The Dasilva's could also net Conference Premier side Luton a further £1million if they make the Chelsea first team. Luton's head of youth Gregg Broughton told lutontown.co.uk: 'I am hesitant to talk about the boys in the collective term because they all have wonderful unique attributes but this is a historical deal to see three brothers transferred together . 'Jay is a special talent, a fantastic student of the game whose temperament compliments his technical ability. 'Cole has strong physical attributes and is very comfortable in possession while Rio is a real livewire whose ability to play in tight areas has always allowed him to shine.' Three's a crowd: Rod, Danny and Ray Wallace all lined up together for Southampton in 1988 . Rio, Cole and older brother Jay have been part of Luton's academy since the age of seven. The compensation which Chelsea agreed to pay also includes payments should the trio rise through the ranks. The overall deal is worth a seven-figure sum if they all go on to make the Chelsea first team. The deal is not the first time Chelsea have favoured footballing siblings in transfer deals. Chelsea are not averse to sibling signings, after having brothers Graham and Ray Wilkins on their books . The 2010 Premier League Champions had Ray and Graham Wilkins play for the Blues in the 1970s, as well as Ron and Allan Harris in the 60s and John and Peter Sillett in the 1950s. English football is littered with instances of brother playing for the same team - from the Charltons for England to the Neville Brothers at Manchester United and the Toures at Manchester City to name just three pairs. To find three footballing brothers in the same side, however, you have to go back to October 1988 when Rod, Ray and Danny Wallace all lined up for Southampton against Sheffield Wednesday. Chelsea agreed to pay Luton compensation to secure the services of the three young brothers, in a deal which could earn the Conference side £1m . Gregg Broughton added: 'Following our loss in the play-offs last season we were told that the boys wished to look at other options, as was their prerogative to do so, and now after six months of uncertainty, we are delighted that they have found a club where they are settled and one that recognises the development work that Luton Town have put in over the last five years. 'Their family has a strong footballing background with older brother Ryan playing as a professional here at Kenilworth Road and father Trevor also a very talented player in the past. 'We never like to lose talented players from the club, but if players are unsettled and wish to look elsewhere, and the deal is right for all parties, then it is the most sensible way to progress. 'We would like to thank Chelsea for the professional manner in which they have conducted themselves and wish the boys the very best for their ongoing careers.'","Rio, Cole and Jay Dasilva all sign for Chelsea in unique deal .

"By . Rob Cooper . UPDATED: . 10:30 EST, 27 January 2012 . Former television presenter Emma Freud was presented with an OBE today by the Queen for her work as a Comic Relief trustee. She co-founded the charity in 1985 with her partner Richard Curtis and has helped to produce live television documentaries for it for around eight years. In March, Comic Relief's Red Nose Day . televised extravaganza raised £74.3million, the highest amount pledged . in a night in the event's 23-year history. OBE: Emma Freud, pictured with her partner Richard Curtis, was given the award by the Queen for her work with Comic Relief . The total figure raised topped £102million - breaking the previous record of £82.3million set in 2009. Today the Queen also knighted Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and racehorse trainer Sir Henry Cecil at Buckingham Palace. The trio were all given their awards in the Queen's Birthday Honour's List. Comic Relief founder: Ms Freud, a broadcaster, paid tribute to the generosity of British people who have given to the charity since it was founded in 1985 . Mother-of-four Ms Freud said after being given her OBE that Comic Relief had been successful because of the generosity of ordinary British people. She said: 'I don't feel like it (the OBE) belongs to us, it belongs to the British . people, and that is the biggest compliment. 'The total we raised this year is unbelievable, this year we're three years into a recession and people are still giving.' Knighthood: Sir Mervyn King, pictured with his wife Barbara Melander, did not speak to the press after being given his honour by the Queen at Buckingham Palace today . Celebrated: Sir Henry Cecil, who is arguably Britain's greatest ever racehorse trainer, receives his knighthood . A hero Australian soldier who won his . country's highest gallantry medal after drawing the fire of three . Taliban machine gun posts to protect comrades met the Queen today. The monarch held an audience with . Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith - awarded the Victoria Cross for . Australia - to hear first hand about his actions. During an operation in Afghanistan the . soldier ran out in front of the Taliban machine gunners after his . comrades were pinned down by fire. The SAS corporal then single-handedly . cleared two of the enemy positions during the fight near the village of . Tizak in Kandahar province in June last year. Cpl Roberts-Smith said: 'Obviously she speaks to quite a lot of soldiers so she's . interested in Afghanistan (and) she has a good grasp of what's . happening there.' Asked about the monarch's reaction to his story he replied: 'She was just glad that we all came home.' The soldier admitted that he was nervous before meeting the Queen but said it was easy to talk to her. 'She is everything that everyone says . she is - she's just a lovely lady and she made me very comfortable. It . was one of those experiences - very humbling, very surreal.' She returned to the Palace today where she . was famously pictured with her father Sir Clement Freud, who died in . 2009, when he was knighted in 1987. Ms Freud was the script editor of the . hit British movies Four Weddings And A Funeral and Notting Hill - both . written by her partner Richard Curtis. Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King paid tribute to his staff after receiving his honour. The 63-year-old has helped steer the economy through dire financial waters during the worst economic crisis since the Depression of the 1930s. But the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates and is chaired by Sir Mervyn, has been accused of being 'asleep at the wheel' in the run-up to the downturn by a former member of the panel. After being given the Knight Grand Cross at the investiture ceremony today, the governor returned to his seat in the palace's ballroom without commenting to the press. When his new title was announced in June, Sir Mervyn said: 'I am honoured to receive this award. 'It is a tribute to the hard work and professionalism of the Bank of England staff, whom it has been my privilege to lead for eight years'. Sir Henry Cecil, arguably Britain's greatest racehorse trainer who has known the Queen for many years, said after receiving his knighthood that he had been 'very lucky'. He is a four-time Derby winner, has had eight successes in the Oaks and has been behind a total of 25 Classic winners, including this year's 2000 Guineas hero Frankel. High-profile: Sir Henry Cecil has ten champion-trainer titles, 72 Royal Ascot wins and four victories in the Derby . Sir Henry is also a popular figure in racing, both at meets and with ordinary punters in betting shops across the country. The trainer said: 'It's a way of life - I like a challenge and my life's been full of challenges and I'm very honoured to receive this, this is the biggest honour I'll get in my lifetime.' Sir Henry played down his achievements over the past 40 years, adding jokingly: 'I was the first person from my prep school to fail common entry to Eton so I think I was qualified to be a porter - I've been very lucky.'

"By . Hugo Gye . Created 12:30 PM on 3rd September 2011 . UPDATED: . 07:07 EST, 8 March 2012 . Campaigner: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has long been keen to publish the unedited cache of U.S. cables . Campaigning website WikiLeaks has published its full cache of over 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables. Unlike previous releases, sensitive information has not been redacted from the cables. The newspapers which previously worked with WikiLeaks have criticised the publication, saying it could endanger whistleblowers and dissidents in oppressive regimes. But the website's founder Julian Assange has been adamant since last year that 'the cables must eventually be made public', according one of his former employees. Guardian journalist James Ball, who worked at WikiLeaks for two months from November, also claims that Mr Assange tried to use money donated to WikiLeaks to pay for his defence against sexual assault allegations in Sweden. Mr Assange denies this claim. Selected diplomatic cables were first released in December 2010, with information such as the names of sources deleted. The cables were published by WikiLeaks and five newspapers from around the world: the New York Times, the Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El Pais. All five have now issued a joint statement condemning the release of unedited cables, saying they 'deplore the decision' and that it 'may put sources at risk'. They continue: 'We cannot defend the needless publication of the complete data - indeed, we are united in condemning it. The decision to publish by Julian Assange was his, and his alone.' The newly published collection of 251,287 cables contains over 1,000 messages which identify overseas activists, and around 150 identifying whistleblowers. A danger to whistleblowers? The diplomatic cables previously had sensitive information redacted . WikiLeaks blames a Guardian journalist for its decision to release the uncensored cache. In his book on WikiLeaks, David Leigh published a password which he was given by Mr Assange to access the data. He claims not to have known that the password was still valid for the file containing the unedited cables, which has been available on file-sharing websites since Mr Assange's arrest last December. WikiLeaks now says the availability of the cables has forced it to release them in a searchable and easily accessible format. However, former WikiLeaks employee James Ball claims that the website's eccentric boss had long planned to release the uncensored data. Mr Ball wrote in the Guardian today that in a discussion over whether or not to publish all the cables, Mr Assange was adamant that they should eventually do so, 'one way or another'. That claim appears to be supported by a written record of the discussion seen by Reuters, which describes a heated argument over the cables' release, with Mr Assange 'insistent all cables must somehow be eventually released.' Following the potentially endangering release, Mr Ball has argued that 'WikiLeaks has done the cause of internet freedom - and whistleblowers - more harm than U.S. government crackdowns ever could.' In a further blow to the campaigning Mr Assange, Mr Ball has claimed that Mr Assange 'attempted to access WikiLeaks funds received through donations' to fund his defence against allegations that he sexually assaulted two women in Sweden last year. He is currently on bail as he fights extradition from Britain, having paid for his defence with help from celebrity supporters.","Julian Assange planned to release full cache all along, according to a former employee .

Scotland Yard’s press chief resigned yesterday over his links to a News of the World executive embroiled in the phone hacking scandal. Dick Fedorcio walked out after learning he is accused of gross misconduct for awarding a £1,000-a-day PR deal to Neil Wallis – a former deputy editor at the tabloid who was known by the nickname ‘Wolfman’. Mr Fedorcio was sent on extended leave last August after the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an inquiry. Resigned: Dick Fedorcio left his job today after the IPCC decided he would face disciplinary proceedings . The move came after it emerged he . awarded Mr Wallis’s firm Chamy Media a £24,000 contract for advice . between October 2009 and September 2010. It is alleged he failed to follow the correct procedures to award the contract. Mr Wallis was arrested on suspicion of hacking last July and remains on bail. The decision to leave the Met means Mr Fedorcio, who was head of public affairs for 14 years, will not face any further action. The Met has faced claims it failed to . investigate phone hacking at the paper because of the close ties between . New of the World bosses and senior Met officers. The IPCC’s report, which it sent to the Met on January 10, will be made public shortly. IPCC deputy chair Deborah Glass said: . ‘Our investigation found that Mr Fedorcio has a case to answer in . relation to his procurement of the contract for Chamy Media. ‘Last week the Metropolitan Police . Service proposed to initiate proceedings for gross misconduct and I . agreed with that proposal. ‘In light of Mr Fedorcio’s resignation . today, those proceedings cannot now take place and I propose to publish . our investigation report detailing our findings in the next few days.’ Controversy: Neil Wallis was hired by Dick Fedorcio to provide PR advice to the Met . Earlier this month the Leveson Inquiry . into press standards heard that Mr Fedorcio invited people from leading . PR firms Bell Pottinger and Hanover to submit rival bids for the . contract that was awarded to Mr Wallis. Chairman Lord Justice Leveson . suggested that the Met head of public affairs chose these companies . because he knew they would be more expensive than the former News of the . World executive, adding: 'The point is, this is set up to get a . result.' Mr Fedorcio, who was head of public . affairs at the Yard for 14 years, denied this, but confirmed that he . initially wanted to award the contract to Mr Wallis without any . competition. Mr Wallis offered his services as a PR consultant to the Met over lunch with Mr Fedorcio in August 2009, the inquiry heard. The Scotland Yard communications . chief, whose deputy was on long-term sick leave at the time, discussed . the possibility of hiring the ex-tabloid executive with then-assistant . commissioner John Yates. Mr Yates said Mr Wallis gave him . 'categorical assurances' that there was nothing about the News of the . World phone-hacking case that could emerge later to embarrass the . Metropolitan Police if he was given the job. Mr Fedorcio said he only became aware . that Mr Wallis was of interest to Scotland Yard over phone-hacking on . the day of his arrest on July 14 last year. Mr Yates has told the Leveson Inquiry . he was 'good friends' with Mr Wallis, and attended football matches and . dined out with him. He also told the inquiry he had helped . to arrange the loan of a retired police horse to former Sun editor . Rebekah Brooks, which she kept at her stables in Oxfordshire. Scotland Yard said it would not comment on any aspect of Mr Fedorcio's pay, including any pension package. It stated: 'Dick Fedorcio, our . director of public affairs for the past 14 years, has taken the decision . to leave on March 31, 2012.

Jack Taylor, 18, admitted stealing a 50cc motorcycle from a house because he thought it contained drugs. But he escaped with community service after a judge heard he had a job as a slaughterman in Norway. Escaped jail: Jack Taylor, 18, pictured here clutching a circular saw in an abattoir, escaped jail because a judge was told he had a job clubbing seals to death . Worcester Crown Court heard he also travels to Alaska and clubs baby seals for a living. Recorder Edward Coke congratulated Taylor because he had 'got off his backside to work'. He added: 'I consider it is important for a young man with a girlfriend to be in employment.' Taylor was given a six-month community order and told to carry out 100 hours unpaid work. He was also ordered to pay £340 costs, £75 compensation and slapped with a 7pm-7am curfew order for three months. The teenager had admitted breaking into a garage of a house in Worcester in the early hours of August 19 last year. The householders heard him and an accomplice dragging a motorcycle along the driveway. Alex Warren, prosecuting, told the court: 'The bike had been taken from the garage and when the intruders were spotted they ran off, dropping the machine on to the floor and breaking the wing mirror.' Siobhan Collins, defending, told the court Taylor stole the bike because he believed there were drugs hidden inside. She said: 'He has just turned 18, has no previous convictions and has worked abroad for some time in Norway as a slaughterhouse man and as a seasonal worker in Alaska culling baby seals.' The judge stipulated that Taylor should complete the unpaid work in Worcester before he flies back to Norway to continue his job. Boast: Jack Taylor, 18, wrote on his Facebook page how he earns £16 per hour slaughtering sheep in Norway. He also clubs seals to death in Alaska . Taylor is pictured on his Facebook page in a Norwegian abattoir posing next to a bloodied sheep carcass. In another picture, a grinning Taylor is seen holding a bone cutting saw used to hack up the animal carcasses. A friend has commented: 'It's the Worcester bone saw killer lol hows tricks mate.' Taylor boasted on his profile that he can earn £16 per hour slaughtering up to 5,000 sheep a week. He wrote: 'a busy week next week thou got to kill about 5000 sheep maybe more but that 8 hours a day every day that get me about 700 800 quid it all good.'

The only works of art depicting the horrors of Auschwitz in occupied Poland - made by an inmate and hidden in a bottle - have gone on display for the first time at the camp's museum. Children can be seen being torn from the arms of their mothers and a guard smoking a cigarette outside a gas chamber as bodies are loaded into a lorry are among the artworks on show. They were made in secret - their discovery at the time would have meant instant execution for the artist - and hidden in a bottle that was then stashed into the eaves of one of the huts. Horror: The 'Sketchbook from Auschwitz' contains drawings of the selection process Nazi soldiers employed on Jewish prisoners at the concentration camp - including this one showing a little boy being taken from his family . Unique: A German soldier smokes a cigarette in front of a gas chamber as bodies are loaded on to a truck nearby. The drawings were hidden inside a bottle in the eaves of one of the huts used to house Jewish people . Agnieszka Sieradzka, Auschwitz art historian, said: 'You can clearly see that the author was determined in presenting the largest number of details. 'Badges of functionary prisoners, number plates of trucks, train cars on the ramp as well as block numbers are carefully depicted. 'The author of the sketchbook hoped that someone would find his work so that it would become a witness to extermination.' Auschwitz, not far from the Polish city of Krakow, was the biggest extermination facility operated by the SS during the Second World War. Some 1.2 million of the six million victims of the Nazi genocide programme were killed there. A former prisoner working as a watchman discovered the 32 sketches in a bottle near the death camp's crematorium in 1947. Holocaust: This image depicts hundreds of Jewish families as they are taken off a train at the concentration camp. The drawings were created before 1943, but the artist is only known as MM . Terror: In this image, a pajama-wearing man offers a book towards a Nazi guard as lines of prisoners look on . 'The Sketchbook from Auschwitz' includes the 22 pages of drawings from an unknown prisoner whose initials were apparently MM. They represent a rare first-hand historical account of the Holocaust. 'These sketches are the only work of art made in Birkenau that depict exterminations,' said museum spokesman Pawel Sawicki. 'The second wing of the main gate was built between 1943 and 1944, but is absent from the sketches. Thus we concluded that the sketches were drawn in 1943 or before. 'From our records we believe that the author would have worked in the hospital sector or gathering luggage from the ramp,' Mr Sawicki explained. On display: The sketchbook is being shown for the first time at the museum at Auschwitz, in Poland. Right, the famous 'Work Makes You Free' on the main entrance of the death camp . The Polish-English publication was launched by the Auschwitz archives last week. Auschwitz has 6,000 works of art in its archives relating to the horrors which took place there and many are due to go on display this year, the 70th anniversary of the start of the Holocaust. The blueprints for the extermination programme were laid down on January 20, 1942 at the Wannsee Villa situated on the lake of the same name in Berlin. To mark the event this Friday in the German capital there are a number of cultural and memorial events including a gala concert and a moment of silence in the parliament.","Drawings of children ripped from arms of mothers and bodies loaded on to lorries .

"By . Associated Press . UPDATED: . 01:51 EST, 18 January 2012 . Accused: Itzcoatl Ocampo, 23, is charged with four counts of murder . The Iraq War veteran would carefully stalk each of his victims from among the thousands of homeless living in Southern California. He would then stab them repeatedly with a knife that could cut through bone, authorities say. For his fourth and latest victim, they say, Itzcoatl Ocampo selected a homeless man featured in a Los Angeles Times story about a killing spree that terrorised those living on the streets for weeks. And Ocampo had plans for more, until he was chased down by bystanders Friday night after the fatal stabbing of a 64-year-old homeless man. He was caught with blood on his hands and face, authorities say. 'He was a monster,' Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told reporters at a news conference. 'He was a terrible threat, particularly to the homeless people in our community.' Ocampo was charged on Tuesday with four counts of murder and special allegations of multiple murders and lying in wait and use of a deadly weapon. Three victims were stabbed more than 40 times each with a single-edged blade at least seven-inches (17.7-centimeters) long. Authorities declined to say whether they had identified a motive. Rackauckas said he had no indication that Ocampo was mentally ill. Ocampo's family said the 23-year-old was a troubled man after he returned from Iraq in 2008. Ocampo was being held in isolation at an Orange County jail while officers keep an eye on him 24 hours a day, officials said. If convicted, Ocampo faces a minimum sentence of life in prison without parole. Authorities have yet to decide whether to seek the death penalty. Scroll down for video . Service: A relative holds a photograph of Itzcoatl posing proudly in his Marines uniform. He is said to have become paranoid and delusional after his deployment . Normal young man: Itzcoatl Ocampo's family has released these images of the young man, showing him in happier times . Ocampo is due to appear in court . today, but his attorney said his arraignment would likely be postponed . since the attorney was not allowed inside the jail to speak with his . client over the weekend and has met with him only briefly. Defense attorney Randall Longwith declined to comment on the allegations. He said Ocampo is being held in a mental ward. 'I walked in, he was curled up in a blanket,' Mr Longwith said. 'He looked like a wet puppy dog.' The killing spree began in December, . prompting police and advocates to fan out across the county known as the . home to Disneyland and multimillion-dollar beachfront homes to urge the . homeless to sleep in groups or in one of two wintertime shelters. The victims: (L-R) James . McGillivray was stabbed outside a shopping centre on December 20; Lloyd . Middaugh was found stabbed on a riverbed on December 28; and Paulus . Cornelius Smit was found stabbed outside a library on December 30 . Murder weapon: Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas holds up picture of a knife similar to the one he accuses of being used by Itzcoatl Ocampo in the killings . Locations: Police in Orange County, California say Ocampo is responsible for four killings since December . Ocampo's arrest Friday was the latest . violent crime involving a veteran. This month, an Iraq War veteran . fatally shot a ranger at Mount Rainier National Park and died later as . he fled police across the mountain's snow-covered slopes. Veterans Affairs officials say such . high-profile violence can paint an inaccurate picture of returning . veterans. The cases, however, raise the issue of veterans having a . difficult time adjusting back into civilian life. A neighbour who is a Vietnam veteran . and Ocampo's father both tried to push him to get treatment at a . Virginia hospital, but he refused. His father, Refugio Ocampo, said his . son came back from his deployment a changed man. He said his son . expressed disillusionment and became ever darker as he struggled to find . his way. After Ocampo was discharged in 2010 . and returned home, his parents separated. The same month, one of his . friends, a corporal, was killed during combat in Afghanistan. His . brother said Ocampo visited his friend's grave twice a week. Clues: An image from surveillance video at a California strip mall shows James McGillivray before his death . Search: Police in Los Angeles, California arrested Ocampo in connection with the murder of a homeless man on Friday night. Witnesses chased the suspect as he fled a car park and led police to him . In custody: FBI special agent in charge William O'Leary speaks at the podium to announce the arrest of Itzcoatl Ocampo, who was charged with the murders of the four men on Tuesday . Like the men Ocampo is accused of . preying on, his father is homeless. His father lost his job and ended up . living under a bridge before finding shelter in the cab of a . broken-down big-rig he is helping repair. Days before his arrest, Ocampo . visited his father, warning him of the danger of being homeless. He . showed him a picture of one of the slain men, his father said. 'He was very worried about me,' his father said. 'I told him, ""Don't worry. I'm a survivor. Nothing will happen to me.""' Itzcoatl Ocampo followed a friend . into the Marine Corps right out of high school in 2006. He now lives . with his mother, uncle, younger brother and sister in a rented house on a . horse ranch surrounded by the sprawling suburbs of Yorba Linda. His family described a physical . condition he suffered in which his hands shook and he suffered . headaches. Medical treatments helped until he started drinking heavily, . they said. Worried: Refugio Ocampo, the father of the 23-year-old who is the prime suspect in the killings, is himself homeless and said the Iraq war killed the man his son used to be . As fear spread through the homeless . community, police last week set up road blockades to seek help from . members of the public in tracking down a suspect. Ocampo, who appeared . to relish the media spotlight, passed through the checkpoints twice but . did not draw attention to himself, Mr Rackauckas said. Ocampo was arrested Friday night when . witnesses chased him down after John Berry was stabbed to death outside . a fast-food restaurant in Anaheim, about 26 miles (42 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles, authorities said. A day before he died, Berry had filed . a report with police saying he believed someone was trying to follow . him. It was one of nearly 600 leads and tips that officers received. 'It is unfortunate that we didn't get to him before the suspect did,' Anaheim Police Chief John Welter said. In addition to Berry, James Patrick . McGillivray, 53, was killed near a shopping center in Placentia on . December 20 and Lloyd Middaugh, 42, was found near a riverbed trail in . Anaheim on December 28. The third victim, Paulus Smit, 57, was stabbed . to death outside a library in Yorba Linda on December 30. Mr Smit became homeless last year . after his girlfriend's home was shuttered by code enforcement officers . because of hoarding and clutter. Ever since, the father of three had . moved between the homes of two of his children and spent some time on . the streets, his daughter Julia Smit-Lozano said. Smit-Lozano, who spent the Christmas . holiday with her father days before he was killed, welcomed the news of . Ocampo's arrest. 'I'm glad the streets are a little safer for the rest . of the homeless,' she said. Watch video here .

"By . Nick Enoch . UPDATED: . 10:38 EST, 18 January 2012 . Finding a pay-and-display parking space can be frustrating enough - and now, even if you do, the meter may not accept your money. Millions of new 5p and 10p coins could be rejected . by parking meters, vending machines and payphones across Britain... because they are slightly thicker. The . Royal Mint is rolling out the new-sized coins from this month - and a significant number are expected to be in circulation by April. The Royal Mint is rolling out new-sized 5p and 10p coins from this month which are slightly thicker (older coins pictured). A significant number are expected to be in circulation by April . The coins could be rejected by parking meters, vending machines and payphones across Britain . It means customers will be left fumbling through their change to . find coins that will be accepted, since some machines will no longer take the . old-style coins while others will reject the new ones. The new coins were . originally meant to be introduced last year, but implementation was delayed to give industry more time to make adjustments to their machinery. They are a cost-saving exercise for . the Government, because the current coins are made of an alloy of copper and . nickel, which has become more expensive. The new coins, which the Royal Mint . started to produce at the beginning of January, are made of nickel-plated steel. Neither the Royal Mint nor the Treasury would say whether the new coins are magnetic. The old 5p is 1.7mm thick while the old 10p is 1.85mm thick. In both instances, thickness will increase by 10 per cent. The reason for this difference is due to 'technical issues', according the Royal Mint and Treasury. The Government's own impact assessment of the introduction of the . new coins said the change in composition will save the Treasury between £7million and £8million a year. However, the . cost to industry and local councils of the transition will be around £80million over . two years. A Treasury spokesman said: 'Making new 5p and 10p coins out of nickel-plated steel . will save the taxpayer a significant amount of money. 'Many countries, . such as Canada, New Zealand and Russia, have already moved towards lower-cost . coinage as a way of reducing spending. 'The Government consulted before deciding on the change, . and the introduction of the new coins has already been delayed to allow . industry - including local councils - time to prepare. 'We also anticipate it . will take many months for the new coins to reach significant circulation . levels, giving extra time to adapt or replace machines.' Jonathan Hilder, head of the Automatic Vending Association, said the delay had . allowed the vending industry to prepare for the new coins. But he added that there . would be issues with accuracy as the machines would no longer be able to judge . the coins by weight. He added that parking meters in rural areas would be . a particular problem as these could not be easily changed, meaning that . customers would find their money rejected . 'Once again, this will hit the less . well-off and rural communities,' he said. Jeff Wilkes, managing director . of Solitaire Payphones, said his company estimated that there were 100,000 of . its own payphones across the country that would not be able to accept the new . coins, although the rest of his company's payphones had been upgraded. This is not the first time in recent Royal Mint history that a change in composition of coinage has occurred. In 1992, 1p and 2p pieces were changed because the copper content was so high, the coins were worth more than their face value.","Older coins were copper-nickel alloy - new ones will be nickel-plated steel as part of cost-cutting exercise .

"By . Martin Robinson . Created 8:06 PM on 29th September 2011 . It was the book the founder of WikiLeaks said was published to 'screw' him for cash but despite huge publicity surrounding its release it has become a sales flop. Julian Assange's unauthorised autobiography came out last week but just 644 copies were sold in its first three days in the shops. Despite containing the explosive admission by Mr Assange that he slept with the two women accusing him of Category 3 (less serious crime) 'rape' and sexual molestation respectively, it sat at a lowly 537th in . the UK book chart yesterday. Memoir: The book is being published by Canongate against Assange's wishes and has sold less than 700 copies in three days . In 2010 Mr Assange's WikiLeaks website catapulted him to world stardom after he published more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables, thousands of which were top secret. But his reputation was hit after the Swedish government attempted to extradite the Australian on suspicion of sexual crimes, which he is still fighting. In this new book, which he was paid £500,000 to be involved in, he claims the women who say they were sexually assaulted did so because they are either part of the American conspiracy or because he failed to return their calls. 'I did not rape those women and can not imagine anything that happened between us that would make them think so, except malice after the fact, a joint plan to entrap me, or a terrible misunderstanding that was stoked up between them,' he said. Support: Protesters at one of Assange's extradition hearings in London, as many back his publication of government documents . 'I may be a chauvinist pig or some sort but I am no rapist, and only a distorted version of sexual politics could attempt to turn me into one. They both had sex with me willingly and were happy to hang out with me afterwards.' Amongst other sensational claims Assange also says a contact in a Western intelligence agency told him that the American government were considering planting drugs and child pornography or embroiling him 'in allegations of immoral conduct' to get him. However, after reading the book's first draft, written by Andrew O’Hagan, the 40-year-old tried to prevent its publication saying he had come to the conclusion that ‘all memoir is prostitution’. Controversy: Mr Assange claims the rape accusations made against him are part of a conspiracy between the U.S. government and the two women . Assange claimed they were 'screwing people over to make a buck' and the book is 'entirely uncorrected or fact-checked by me'. But British publishers Canongate decided to push ahead and more than 70,000 copies of the now unauthorised autobiography were supplied to bookshops last week. But despite the huge interest in its release it has sold in relatively small numbers. 'It was only the 50th bestselling hardback non-fiction book of the week, and only the 537th bestselling book overall, sitting directly behind Julia Donaldson's Freddie and the Fairy (Macmillan) and Sharon Kendrick's Satisfaction (Mills & Boon), a £6.99 collection of three short stories featuring ""three of her sexiest, most intense Greek heroes and glamorous heroines"",' Philip Stone, charts editor at the Bookseller said. But despite the poor sales the publisher maintains they are not disappointed with the sales. Canongate publishing director Nick Davies told the Bookseller that is was 'a marathon and not a sprint', and they had 'never made any big predictions about the sales of the Assange book – particularly on the first three days of sale'. 'There was no build-up for the trade, the media or with the reading public. But we're proud of the way we handled what has been a difficult and unusual launch, and we are extremely proud of the book,' he said.","It sat at 537 in the UK book chart yesterday, with similar sales as a Mills & Boon set of short stories .

"By . Daniel Miller . UPDATED: . 01:22 EST, 19 January 2012 . A British national was among a group of Europeans caught up in a deadly attack by gunmen in Ethiopia, it emerged today. Five foreign tourists were killed, five people kidnapped and two wounded in the incident in the country's arid north before dawn on Tuesday, reports said. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that a British national was involved in an incident on January 17 in Danakil. (File picture): Five tourists have been killed after being attacked by . gunmen while visiting Ethiopia's Afar region famous for its intense heat . and striking salt flats . 'We are providing consular assistance.' It is understood that the Briton was not among those killed or kidnapped. Earlier, . a British diplomat at the airport in Addis Ababa, where embassy staff . met wounded victims last night, had said a UK tourist may have been . among the group which was attacked. The Ethiopian government has branded the attack 'an act of open terrorism'. It said the gunmen came from Eritrea, although the neighbouring country has denied involvement. The . tourists were visiting a volcanic region in Ethiopia's northern Afar . region, which lies below sea level and is known for its extreme heat and . salt flats. The group . included Austrian, Belgian, German, Hungarian and Italian nationals, . Ethiopian communications minister Bereket Simon said. According to an Interpol report, two Germans, two Hungarians and an Austrian were killed. Two Belgians were seriously hurt and two Italians escaped unharmed, the report said. Two Germans were kidnapped and three Ethiopians were also reportedly taken hostage. In . a statement, the Ethiopian government offered condolences to the . victims' families and said it would 'do everything possible to try and . get those taken prisoner released as soon as possible'. It said those kidnapped may have been taken across the border into Eritrea. Some of the tourists were said to be travelling with Addis Ababa-based Green Land Tours and Travel. Other members of the group were apparently booked by a company in Germany called Diamir. In . a statement on its website, the company said it deeply regretted what . happened and that it had no previous indication of risk to guests' security in the region. Mr . Simon said that 'some groups trained and armed by the Eritrean . government' attacked the tourists about 12 to 15 miles from the Eritrean . border. Eritrea's . ambassador to the African Union, Girma Asmerom, said the allegations . were an 'absolute lie' and that the attack was an internal Ethiopian . matter. The two countries fought a border war from 1998 to 2000, claiming the lives of about 80,000 people.","Five foreign tourists killed and two more wounded .

"By . Nick Enoch . UPDATED: . 10:25 EST, 18 January 2012 . Bankers at Goldman Sachs are in line for a pay and bonus pot of $12.2billion, despite a fall in profits. With America is on the brink of a recession, the announcement last night will only add to public fury over Wall Street payouts. The company, which is awarding its workers $12.2billion globally, has 33,000 staff worldwide. d bonusThe company, is handing out $12,2billion globally in pay anes . Analysts expect Goldman to pay out an average of $367,000  in salary, bonuses and stock options to its approximate 33,000 staff globally for their efforts in 2011. This is down from an average $430,000 the previous year. The news comes despite disappointing annual results from the investment bank. Goldman is expected to reveal a full year revenue of $28.8bn – down 26% – while earnings almost halved to $4.4bn. This would make it its second lowest annual profit in almost ten years, reflecting the impact Europe's debt crisis is having on the Wall Street bank. The company's president, Gary Cohn, said the large payouts were necessary for staff retention. Protesters with the Occupy Wall Street movement demonstrate in New York . The dip in profits also underline the struggles the bank, under chief executive Lloyd Blankfein, is facing from new regulations. The Volcker Rule, due to come into force in July, bans banks from gambling with their own money and limits the amount of capital they can invest in hedge funds and private equity investments. Former banker William Cohan said: 'I think a firm like Goldman has real problems. 'Some of the lines they've been traditionally strong in are being regulated out of existence,' he told The Daily Telegraph. The bank said that it had cut total staff numbers by 7% in 2011 - to 33,300 people, meaning the average compensation per member of staff is about $366,360. A protester waves a sign outside Goldman Sachs's New York HQ . Preparing for 'doughnut' bonuses . This year zero bonuses, known as 'doughnuts', will affect even senior staff and could include a bigger proportion of employees than in the 2008 financial crisis, bankers and headhunters predicted as U.S. firms start telling bankers this week what they will get. Slumping quarterly profits, a darkening long-term outlook for the industry and unrelenting pressure from politicians and an angry public, are pushing bank bosses to break away from a culture in which most staff expect a bonus every year and base their personal budget around it. 'This will probably be the worst year for zero bonuses we've seen, although those that will have done well will still get something,' said Jason Kennedy, who runs recruiting firm Kennedy Group. 'Global heads and senior managing directors are among those that will get nothing -- they're the expensive staff, and they'll be living off their higher salaries.' Under-performing bankers already came under pressure in the 2010 bonus round as 'doughnuts' multiplied, but this time division heads are raising the bar and reserving payouts for an even smaller group of star bankers. Bonuses would be down at least 30 per cent for those that do get one, Kennedy said, while other recruiters predict cuts of up to 70 per cent in some areas, such as bond trading. Bankers at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Citi are among those expecting to hear about their bonuses this week, coinciding with these firms' fourth quarter results. Overall pay at JP Morgan's investment bank came in at $8.8billion, down 9 per cent on 2010 levels, while total revenues for the year were flat, its filings showed last week.","Workers expected to receive average of $367,000 .
