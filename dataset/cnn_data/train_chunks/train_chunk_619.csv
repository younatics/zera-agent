Scroll down for video . First kiss: The Christian couple's first-ever smooch was captured on the TLC series, Virgin Diaries, last year after they vowed not to have sex, or even kiss, before their wedding day . In a sneak peek of tonight's episode, Ryan discusses that awkward first kiss. He says: 'I had never kissed a girl before I married Shanna and you know I wasn't really planning ahead, or thinking about what to do.' Shanna echoed his thoughts, revealing: 'It was kinda hard for me because I hadn't really kissed anybody, so I didn't really know what I was doing. So when I went to first kiss him, I just went full force because I was, like, excited.' In the new episodes, Ryan and Shanna join two other virgins who struggle with their circumstances.

Koo Stark arrived at Isleworth Crown Court today armed with a £40,000 painting she was accused of stealing from her former partner . Koo Stark described yesterday how being locked in a police ‘cage’ after she was accused of theft had been her ‘worst nightmare’. Prince Andrew’s former girlfriend was speaking after she handed back a £40,000 painting she was accused of snatching from Warren Walker. She had been due to stand trial for allegedly taking the artwork from the home of Mr Walker, the father of her 16-year-old daughter Tatiana. But a dramatic last-minute deal between lawyers saw the 57-year-old actress-turned-photographer cleared when she agreed to return the 17th century oil painting. Her defence lawyer also said the expensive nature of the case had given rise to the ‘very real risk’ that Miss Stark would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter. Miss Stark, who was accused under her real name Kathleen, had arrived at court yesterday with the painting wrapped in a green blanket and bubble wrap. It was carried in a canvas shopping bag by her solicitor Jules Azzopardi who told security officials at Isleworth Crown Court: ‘Be careful, it’s very expensive.’ The 12in square artwork by the Dutch master Anthonie van Borssom was then examined by lawyers representing  Mr Walker in a consultation room next  to the court. A photograph of the moonlit coastal  landscape – which was still in its frame – was then sent by text message to Mr Walker, who verified it was the one he claimed was his. Once the handover was confirmed,  prosecutors offered no evidence against Miss Stark and His Honour Judge Andrew McDowall recorded a formal ‘not guilty’ verdict. Miss Stark had claimed she believed the painting belonged to her when she took it from Mr Walker’s home in Kensington Park Gardens, London on July 21 last year. But she became embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with Mr Walker, an American financier who had left her ten days before their 1997 wedding while she was heavily pregnant. American-born Miss Stark yesterday said the ‘painful episode’, which included being locked in a police cell, was beyond her ‘worst nightmare’. In a statement she said: ‘I have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me. I leave court with my liberty and my good name, but it should never have come to this. I was a defendant charged with a serious crime. In my mind, I have been looking into a prison for the last ten months. ‘I have travelled through the criminal courts, a stranger in a strange land. When I was arrested I was even put into a cage – as they describe it at the police station. I have been vilified and put in the pillory. Fortunately, common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented.’ Miss Stark struck a deal with prosecutors to hand back the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape to court to avoid trial . Miss Stark was cleared of theft by a judge at Isleworth Crown Court today after the prosecution offered no evidence. The trial was adjourned yesterday when the judge questioned if it was in the public interest . She added: ‘If someone like me can be arrested, bruised and locked in a police cage, an experience I never dreamed would happen in my life, then it could happen to anyone.’ Her relationship with Mr . Walker has been tempestuous since they separated in 1997 and she once threatened to sue him for ‘emotional distress’ after he appealed for custody of their daughter. Miss Stark yesterday expressed hope that her dealings with Mr Walker might improve. However, in court Edward Henry, defending, claimed Mr Walker had ‘sought to criminalise the mother of his child unjustly, disproportionally and inappropriately’. 'Today I have been cleared of a charge that should never have been brought against me. 'I leave court with my liberty and my good name but it should never have come to this. 'I was a defendant charged with a serious crime. In my mind, I have been looking into a prison for the last ten months. 'I have travelled through the criminal courts, a stranger in a strange land. 'When I was arrested I was even put into a cage - as they describe it at the police station. I have been vilified and put in the pillory. 'Fortunately, common sense has prevailed and my former partner has relented. 'As Yeats once said, ""Young we loved each other and were ignorant"". 'I leave with the desire that from now on we will treat each other with respect and that any disputes we may have are dealt with in private and with dignity.' He also said the case had given rise to the ‘very real risk’ that his client would be left homeless and unable to provide a home for her daughter. Defence counsel applied for costs to be donated to the Bar Pro Bono fund which represented Miss Stark at court, but this was refused by the judge. Judge McDowall said: ‘It is an unfortunate fact that for many years these parties have been locked in battle in the civil and family courts. ‘At the end of the day, the fact of the matter is if your client had acted through the civil courts, it would have been dealt with there and if she had not gone to the property and taken away the painting, this would never have happened. ‘If things had gone differently, we might have been here for days. ‘It was better to resolve this matter without running the risk of private personal matters being ventilated in court.’ Miss Stark, who did not qualify for legal aid, later appealed for more support for the Bar Pro Bono fund which had helped her through ‘this painful episode’. Miss Stark met the Duke of York on a blind date during his leave from the Royal Navy and they began dating on his return from the Falklands War in 1982. She was later invited to Balmoral to visit the Royal Family. The couple dated for 18 months before separating after it was revealed Miss Stark had appeared semi-naked in the soft porn film Emily. Warren Walker's solicitor Richard Harbord took the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting of a moonlit coastal landscape from court today . The legal dispute was over the ownership of an oil painting by Dutch artist Anthonie van Borssom, who also painted A River Scene By Moonlight, pictured . The £40,000 painting was wrapped in bubble wrap for its journey to court today. Miss Stark, pictured yesterday at court, agreed to return the artwork, which was examined by Mr Walker's solicitors, to avoid trial .","Miss Stark, 57, returned the Anthonie van Borssom oil painting today .

Immigrants would have to put up a cash bond to enter Britain under radical reforms to be unveiled by Theresa May . Immigrants would have to put up a cash bond to enter Britain under radical reforms to be unveiled by Theresa May. They will be required to pay the ‘entry fee’ as part of a guarantee that they will not be a burden on taxpayers and will leave when their visa expires. The cash would be repaid when migrants leave, but only if they demonstrate that they have not drawn on services, such as non-urgent NHS care or other elements of the welfare state. The Home Secretary, who has already cut the number of migrants coming to Britain to its lowest level for almost a decade, wants ‘immigration bonds’ to be the next stage of reforms. Sources say she hopes to announce a pilot scheme, targeted at ‘high-risk’ individuals from ‘two or three’ countries, starting later this year. Migrants, or family members already in the UK, would be required to put up a sum running into thousands of pounds. The 1999 Immigration & Asylum Act gave the Government the right to demand such a financial security from temporary migrants, which can be forfeited  if they fail to leave after the expiry of their visa. However, Mrs May’s bonds would only apply to non-EU migrants, otherwise they would fall foul of European rights to free movement. The proposals emerged amid Labour attempts to shift its position on immigration, with the party admitting that it should have been more ‘ready to talk about problems’ in the system, adding: ‘That needs to change.’ Last week, official figures showed that the Government’s squeeze on entrants from outside the EU has succeeded in pushing immigration into Britain to its lowest level in nearly a decade. The number coming to live in Britain fell by 74,000 in the 12 months to June last year as curbs on students and workers from outside Europe began to bite. ‘We have reviewed all migration routes to the UK and have put in place measures to reduce immigration,’ said a source close to the Home Secretary. ‘The latest statistics are encouraging and show that net migration continues to fall. But our work is not complete.’ The source said Mrs May was examining ‘financial bonds as a further deterrent to reduce non-compliance by high-risk nationalities’. The measures are being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year . ‘We are looking at a pilot at the end of the year,’ they added. ‘If you’re allowed to come to the UK on, say, a family visit visa, you would have to put down a bond to guarantee that you won’t draw on certain services and to prove that you will leave the country. ‘When you leave, as per the terms of your visa, you can have your money back. If you don’t, we will put the money into an enforcement pot.’ Ministers are also examining separate proposals to reduce ‘pull factors’ for migrants from the European Union. A triple squeeze on access to the National Health Service, taxpayer-subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year. The latest proposals will cheer the Tory benches, following confirmation that Mrs May is examining options for reform of human rights law, including withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, to be included in the party’s next manifesto. Labour examined the idea of making families pay a £1,000 deposit for visiting relatives to ensure they left the UK on time, but eventually backed away from the idea. Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, has warned that such bonds will ‘antagonise settled communities in Britain and enrage our allies such as India’.","Will pay ‘entry fee’ to guarantee that they will not be a burden on taxpayers .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 02:07 EST, 21 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:16 EST, 26 November 2012 . It now appears that the fate of Hostess Brands Inc has been sealed after the maker of Twinkies and Ding Dongs said late Tuesday that it failed to reach an agreement with its second-biggest union. As a result, Hostess plans to continue with a hearing on Wednesday in which a bankruptcy court judge in White Plains, New York, will decide if the company can shutter its operations. The renewed talks between Hostess and The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union came after the company declared last week that it would move to wind down its business and start selling off its assets in bankruptcy court. Failure: Last-minute talks between Hostess and its striking union broke down just hours before a judge is expected to make a decision on whether to allow the company to shutter its operations . Within hours of Friday's announcement that Hostess was going out of business, there was a rush on buying their products . The company cited a crippling strike . that was started on November 9 by the union, which represents 30 per . cent of Hostess workers. After making its case to liquidate on . Monday, the bankruptcy court judge noted that the two sides hadn't yet . tried resolving their differences through private mediation. The judge noted that 18,000 jobs were . on the line and urged the company and union to try to resolve their . differences. Both sides agreed to hold mediation proceedings on Tuesday. ‘Many people, myself included, have . serious questions as to the logic behind this strike,’ said Judge Robert . Drain, who heard the case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern . District of New York. ‘Not to have gone through that step leaves a huge question mark in this case.’ In a statement late Tuesday, Hostess . said it would not comment on the breakdown in talks other than to say . that mediation ‘was unsuccessful.’ A lawyer for the bakers union said he . had no comment, citing mediation ground rules. Hostess shut down its three dozen plants late last week after it said the strike by the bakers union hurt its ability to maintain normal production. The union said the company's demise was the result of years of mismanagement, however, and that workers have already given steep concessions over the years. Hostess, weighed down by management turmoil, rising labor costs and Americans' changing tastes, is making its second trip through Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring. Shortage: Hostress Brands quickly sold out after news spread that the company was going out of business . Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks after an intervention by a bankruptcy judge . The company, based in Irving, Texas, . had brought on CEO Gregory Rayburn as a restructuring expert in part to . renegotiate its contract with labor unions. The company reached an agreement with . its biggest union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on a . contract that dramatically reduced pension contributions, as well as . slashing wages and health benefits. But the company said the bakers . union stopped returning its calls about a month ago. The Teamsters urged the smaller union . to hold a secret ballot on whether members wanted to continue striking. Many workers in the bakers union decided to cross picket lines last week . but Hostess said it wasn't enough to keep operations at normal levels. Teamsters General Secretary Ken Hall . said the failure of the mediation talks Tuesday and the likely . shuttering of the company was a 'tragic outcome' for Hostess workers. Rayburn said that Hostess was already . operating on razor thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. The bakers union meanwhile pointed to the steep raises executives were . given last year as the company was spiraling down toward bankruptcy. The company's announcement last week . that it would move to liquidate prompted a rush on Hostess treats across . the country, with many businesses selling out of Twinkies within hours. Was it all in vain? On Friday Michelle Craft bought $100 worth of Hostess treats in Denver, but now it looks like the company might not go out of business afterall . Demand: there were long lines outside the Hostess store in Denver when the company announced its demise on Friday . Even if Hostess goes out of business, its popular brands will likely find a second life after being snapped up by buyers. The company says several potential . buyers have expressed interest in the brands. Although Hostess' sales . have been declining in recent years, the company still does about . $2.5billion in business each year. Twinkies alone brought in $68million . so far this year. It's not the sequence of events that . the maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Ho's envisioned when it filed . for bankruptcy in January, its second Chapter 11 filing in less than a . decade. The company, who said that it was . saddled with costs related to its unionized workforce, had hoped to . emerge with stronger financials. It brought on Rayburn as a . restructuring expert and was working to renegotiate its contract with . labor unions. But . Rayburn wasn't able to reach a deal with the bakery union. The company, . which had been contributing $100million a year in pension costs for . workers, offered workers a new contract that would've slashed that to . $25million a year, in addition to wage cuts and a 17 per cent reduction . in health benefits. But the bakery union decided to strike. Outrage: Diana McKinley, a 33-year employee of Hostess, pickets on Thursday in Sacramento, California . The . quintessential junk food treat - a cream-filled, 150-calorie sponge . cake - has been called the 'cream puff of the proletariat' and the 'snack with a snack in the middle.' It had faced extinction after its . maker, Hostess Brands, announced plans to liquidate amid a dispute with . striking bakers.* James A. Dewar, a manager for the . Continental Baking Co, came up with the idea in 1930 after seeing the . machines that made shortcakes with strawberry filling sit idle at the . bakery when strawberries were out of season. He injected the elongated . sponge cake with banana filling - vanilla would be used later - and . called it a Twinkie after seeing a billboard for the Twinkle Toe Shoe . Company. Dewar, who died in 1985 at age 88, said he ate at least two . packets of Twinkies a week.* . Twinkies were scorned by nutritionists as the archetypal unhealthy snack . and became a comic's punch line, but somebody was eating them. Hostess . was able to manufacture 1,000 a minute at its bakeries and in 2005 the . Washington Post said Americans had bought $47 million worth of Twinkies . in the previous year.* Many jokes about Twinkies play off . their longevity thanks to their ample chemical preservatives. There has . been much speculation about how many decades a Twinkie can sit on a . shelf before being eaten. For the sake of freshness, Theresa Cogswell of . the Twinkies' parent company Hostess, has said that no more than 25 . days was ideal but a Maine college professor gained notoriety by keeping . one atop his blackboard for 30 years. He said it still looked good.* . In 2000 President Bill Clinton's White House Millennium Council put . together a time capsule in order to give people in 2100 an idea of how . we lived. Its contents included historic items such as a piece of the . Berlin Wall, film of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, a U.S. World . War Two soldier's helmet, a photo of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and . a Twinkie.* The trial of San Francisco city supervisor . Dan White, who fatally shot the mayor and another supervisor in 1978, . gave rise to what came to be known as the 'Twinkie defense.' The defense . said White was suffering mental problems, as evidenced by the way he . had given up his healthy lifestyle and started eating junk food. The . defense argued that this behavior was an indication of his instability. White ended up serving five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.* . Twinkies' surge in popularity in the 1950s was partially attributed to . its ads on 'The Howdy Doody Show' directed at kids, who demanded the . desserts in their lunch boxes.* Hostess collected recipes . from connoisseurs to publish the 'The Twinkies Cookbook' in 2006. The . 50 recipes included Twinkie-based burritos, lasagna, tiramisu, . milkshakes and sushi (with dried fruit rather than fish). Deep-fried . Twinkies have been a staple at U.S. state fairs.* . The Twinkie has a long list of television and movie credits. Archie . Bunker always had one in his lunch on the sitcom 'All in the Family' and . they have been featured in the animated series 'Family Guy' and 'The . Simpsons.' A character in 'The Deer Hunter' eats Twinkies dipped in . mustard. In the wacky comedy 'Ghostbusters' a scientist tracking demons . calculates that the level of 'psychokinetic energy' in New York City . could normally be as big as a Twinkie but things had become so bad that . that Twinkie would now be 35 feet long and weigh 600 pounds (about 270 . kg).* Twinkies are just part of the Hostess snack food . family. Other well-known treats from the company include Ding Dongs, Ho . Hos, Suzy Q's, Sno Balls, Zingers and Drake's cakes.* . Twitter and other social media were filled with laments about a . Twinkie-less world on Friday. Entrepreneurs and speculators turned to . eBay. A box of 10 Twinkies was being offered on the online auction site . for a starting bid of $500.

The tiny intricate worlds and shrunken people that make up these latest trend in art are so detailed you can almost picture yourself in them. Using everyday objects like Tupperware boxes, tea cups, thimbles, a footprint in the snow and even  finger nails as their canvas, artists from around the world have created unbelievably tiny scenes. From an itsy-bitsy farm in a Tupperware . box to a teeny unlucky crushed man in a snow footprint and a microscopic . family enjoying a picnic on a woman's nails, the patience and skill . needed to make these worlds is incredible.

Artist Yuri Yamamoto shows off his skill by transferring part of his miniscule farm scene, complete with farmer, cows, pigs and chickens, to a spoon . There is certainly black humour in this piece as an unlucky mini-man has been crushed by a walking giant . One of the artists Slinkachu has developed an entire project around the concept of tiny scenes set in urban streets. Entitled the 'Little People Project', it has been going since 2006, and the anonymous 32 year-old male artist behind Slinkachu has set up hundreds of scenes around the world. He says of the project: 'One day, while working outside, i started to imagine how much fun it would be hide miniature people in the square around me. 'Over time I have become a lot more . interested in how people react to the images and how people empathised . with the characters and the stories in the photography. 'Each scene involves the remodelling and painting of miniature model train set characters, which I then place, photograph and leave on the street. 'It is both a street art installation project and a photography project. 'The street-based side of my work plays with the notion of surprise and I aim to encourage city-dwellers to be more aware of their surroundings. 'All the figures are stuck down using super glue and are left in situ on the streets. 'Each scene probably takes me a five or six hours in total to complete, from the idea stage to making of the figures, which I individually customise.' A creme brulee serves as the scene of a devastating fire that these mini fireman are dutifully extinguishing in this piece by Minimiam, who uses desserts as a canvas for their art . The great escape gets shrunk down in this scene in which many tiny people are pictured on each others shoulders in an attempt to reach freedom . This tiny beach scene sees mini beach goers enjoying the sand and sea, complete with a tiny umbrella and beach chairs . Other artists like Yuri Yamamoto create a diverse range of art, of which the tiny Tupperware creations are just one aspect. Canadian Nichola Battilana, who runs Pixie Hill Studio, makes a range of thimble worlds under her 'Faery and Pixie' section, aiming to create a mystical world which ignites the imagination. The tiny house is hand sculpted with paperclay and the moss and are natural, and painstaking positioned into the thimble. These tiny climbers brave the mountains of meringues, with one of them tumbling down a sweet but treacherous piste in this piece by Minimian .

On trial: Isaac Aguigui is accused of murdering a former comrade who he thought betrayed an anarchist militia . A former soldier accused of killing two people and leading a plot to assassinate President Obama worked at the last Republican National Convention, it has been revealed. Isaac Aguigui is currently on trial alongside three comrades charged with murdering another soldier and his girlfriend because they had apparently betrayed their anarchist militia group. The Army private was pictured on the floor of the 2008 GOP convention in St Paul, Minnesota, where he apparently served as a page. Gawker identified the alleged killer from a photograph published in Reuters in September 2008. The picture was captioned: 'Republican National Convention page Isaac Aguigui watches from the edge of the floor at the start of the first session of the 2008 Republican National Convention in St Paul, Minnesota September 1, 2008.' The man in the photograph is wearing a badge saying 'Isaac Aguigui', and bears a striking similarity to the defendant's mugshot. This year's Republican convention is currently taking place in Tampa, Florida. Aguigui and three others are accused of killing Michael Roark, 19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend Tiffany York near their base at Fort Stewart, Georgia in December last year. Roark had apparently become involved with F.E.A.R., an anarchist militia founded by Aguigui whose name stood for Forever Enduring Always Ready. He fell in with his alleged killers when they served together in the 4th Brigade Combat Team of the Army's 3rd Infantry Division. Prosecutors said the group believed it had been betrayed by Roark, who left the Army two days before he was killed, and decided the ex-soldier and his girlfriend needed to be silenced. Political: This photograph was originally captioned, 'Republican National Convention page Isaac Aguigui watches from the edge of the floor at the start of the first session of the 2008 Republican National Convention in St Paul, Minnesota September 1, 2008' Accused: Aguigui, right, being led away from court in Georgia last December . Attorney Isabel Pauley said Aguigui funded the militia using $500,000 in insurance and benefit payments from the death of his pregnant wife a year ago. Aguigui was not charged in his wife's death, but Ms Pauley told the judge her death was 'highly suspicious'. She said Aguigui used the money to buy $87,000 worth of semiautomatic assault rifles, other guns and bomb components that were recovered from the accused soldiers' homes and from a storage locker. He also apparently used the insurance payments to buy land for his militia group in Washington state. Victims: Michael Roark, 19, and Tiffany York, 17, were found shot in the head near Fort Stewart in December . In a videotaped interview with military investigators, Aguigui allegedly called himself 'the nicest cold-blooded murderer you will ever meet'. The prosecutor said the militia group had big plans - plotting to take over Fort Stewart by seizing its ammunition control point, and bombing the Forsyth Park fountain in nearby Savannah. Ultimately, prosecutors said, the militia's goal was to overthrow the government and assassinate the President. One former member of the group has pleaded guilty to the charges, and is testifying against his former comrades. All are charged by state authorities with malice murder, felony murder, criminal gang activity, aggravated assault and using a firearm while committing a felony.","Isaac Aguigui was pictured working at GOP event in St Louis, Missouri ."

The nine traffic-calming obstacles have been removed from Charlton Park Lane in Greenwich, which is near  one of the Olympic venues. When the Games are over, the humps, which were installed more than 15 years ago, will be put back – at a total cost to the taxpayer of  at least £50,000. The street’s proximity to the Royal Artillery Barracks, where the shooting and Paralympic archery events will take place, has led to it being designated part of the Olympic Route Network, along which competitors and executives from international firms sponsoring the Games will be ferried in BMWs. Before: One of the nine speed humps which have been torn out of Charlton Park Lane in Greenwich to ensure Olympic dignitaries get a smooth ride to and from the Games . After: Residents say traffic has sped up along the road as a result of the calming measures being removed . Transport for London (TfL), which is carrying out the work on behalf of the Olympic Delivery Authority, said electronic speed-warning signs and extra police patrols would be deployed. But when a Mail on Sunday reporter visited the area last week, the signs appeared not to be working and there was no visible police presence. Residents said they knew nothing of the plan until workmen started digging up the road last month. Carly Arnold, 31, said:  ‘The traffic has definitely speeded up since the bumps were taken out.’ Brooke Turner, 18, said: ‘It’s as if the Olympics are more important than road safety.’ Thoroughfare: The street has been designated part of the Olympic Route network because of its proximity to the Royal Artillery Barracks (pictured), where the shooting and Paralympic archery events will take place . Ordinary motorists will be banned from some sections of the Olympic Route Network. Bus stops will be suspended, side roads closed and traffic-light timings changed to give priority to Olympic vehicles  at the busiest times. Local Labour MP Clive Efford said: ‘If there is a danger to residents, the council and police must deal with it immediately. The Olympics will bring huge benefits to London but cannot take priority over road safety.’ TfL’s Garrett Emmerson said: ‘The temporary removal of the speed humps is to aid the successful operation of the Olympic Road Network in getting athletes, officials and others working at the Games to events at the Royal Artillery Barracks on time. The humps will be replaced with speed-activated signs –  a successful speed-calming measure – during this period.’ Greenwich Council said residents had been consulted about the plan and denied that safety had been compromised.",Traffic-calming obstacles to be put back after Games... costing taxpayer £50k .

David Cameron invoked the vision of Margaret Thatcher’s favourite political guru yesterday in an attempt to fight back from the shattering Tory defeat in the Eastleigh by-election. He refused to ‘tack right’, but said he would pursue ‘common ground’ policies on welfare, immigration, the NHS and crime to woo ordinary voters. The Prime Minister’s ‘common ground’ theme is a tribute to one of Mr Cameron’s Tory heroes, Sir Keith Joseph. Inspiration: David Cameron with Baroness Thatcher in 2007 . Sir Keith was the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism, but was nicknamed ‘the mad monk’ by Left-wing critics for his ascetic manner and some of his more controversial views. Mr Cameron’s response to the Eastleigh result, where the Conservatives finished third behind the Lib Dems and UKIP, came as: . Mr Cameron’s vow to stay on the ‘common ground’ followed pressure from Tory Right-wingers to take a tougher stance on Europe and other issues to counter the UKIP threat. His refusal to ‘tack right’ is  a clear message that he will not abandon policies such as gay marriage, which have enraged his Right wing. But by praising Sir Keith, he is trying to convince activists that he has not renounced the Party’s  Thatcherite heritage. Mr Cameron said: ‘We are engaged in a battle for Britain’s future... it is a battle we will only win if we reject the cynicism, the political calculation and the easy ways out – and stick to the course we are on. ‘The right thing to do is to address the things people care about – to fix yourself firmly in what Keith Joseph called the “common ground” of politics.’ A No 10 source said: ‘We have shown we can occupy that ground by cutting immigration by a third, introducing a welfare cap and imposing a tough  but fair criminal justice policy. 'But it is not just as an appeal to the Right – we will continue to ring-fence health spending. 'And we are taking the right decisions on the number one issue facing the country – the economy. These are all common ground issues. Labour aren’t there at all.’ Sir Keith Joseph was the intellectual driving force behind Thatcherism . Sir Keith, who is regarded as one of the chief architects of Thatcherism, believed that the out-of-touch political elite had to find ‘common ground’ with ordinary voters. He was widely acclaimed  for his brilliance and sincerity, but admitted that he lacked the  judgment, personality or stamina to be leader. He was a candidate to succeed Edward Heath in the 1974 Tory leadership election – until he gave a speech in which he argued the poor should not have more than two children per family. He said the ‘balance of our population, our human stock’ was ‘threatened’ by the higher number of children in poorer families. After being accused of advocating selective breeding, or eugenics, he withdrew from the race, and backed Thatcher instead. Sir Keith later said it would have been ‘a disaster for the party, country and me’ if he had become leader. In 1981, he clashed with Michael Heseltine by opposing plans to rebuild recession-hit Merseyside and suggesting a ‘managed run-down’ of the area instead. Sir Keith, who died in 1994, held three Cabinet posts. His political soul mate Lady Thatcher said the two politicians who had most influence on her were Sir Keith and the equally controversial Enoch Powell, both of whom she called ‘very great men’. Triumphant Mr Farage used his party’s stunning second place finish in Eastleigh to reveal that he intended to go one better by winning a by-election in his own right before the next Election. He told The Mail on Sunday that if another by-election occured in the immediate run-up to 2015, he intended to stand. Mr Farage’s allies say he ‘bitterly regrets’ not standing in Eastleigh. Many commentators believe his popularity would have enabled him to win it. Nigel Farage, with Eastleigh UKIP candidate Diane James, is said to regret not standing for the seat himself . Mr Farage said: ‘I would certainly consider standing in a by-election once the Euro elections in 2014 are out of the way.’ He also launched a new personal attack on ‘dishonest’ Cameron, stating: ‘The aspirational classes who supported Thatcher won’t touch Cameron with a bargepole because we are the only party who want to take those on a minimum wage out of paying tax altogether and who know bright children from poorer backgrounds will benefit hugely from more grammar schools. ‘If Cameron thinks that printing leaflets in UKIP colours, as they did in Eastleigh, will bring him votes then he’s wrong – all it does is highlight the Tories’ dishonesty.’ A confidant of Mr Cameron said: ‘It is high time Farage’s fantasy politics and economics of the mad house are exposed. 'Just because you smoke and drink pints at 11am does not make you a good leader. When UKIP is subjected to scrutiny, they will crumble.’","David Cameron said he will pursue 'common ground' policies to woo voters .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:07 EST, 18 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:17 EST, 19 June 2013 . A former Boston mob hitman has revealed even more chilling details in his second day of testimony at the trail of his long-time boss, James 'Whitey' Bulger. John 'The Executioner' Martorano, who has admitted to killing 20 people, implicated Bulger in nine murders in less than two days on the witness stand. He is expected to tie the former organized crime kingpin to 11 killings from the 1970s to the early 2000s. Martorano, a 72-year-old who lives a quiet life on a golf course, calmly described brutal executions of associates, cold-blooded betrayals of friends and mistaken hits on victims who weren't mixed up in organized crime at all - just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Turning: John Martorano, who has admitted to killing 20 people, claimed he was 'heartbroken' when he learned that his former boss has been supplying information to the government . He admitted to gunning down six people who . he hadn't meant to kill - including a bartender Michael Milano who had . the misfortune of driving the same kind of car as one of Martorano's . targets. The Boston Globe reports Martorano . portrayed himself as a 'man of honor' and claimed Monday he 'wasn't a . hitman' because he never accepted money for the murders he committed. He . said he only killed people to help friends or family members. On . Tuesday, though, he admitted that he had been paid $50,000 to murder an . Oklahoma businessman in 1981. Facing justice: James 'Whitey' Bulger is accused of murder, extortion and running a criminal enterprise . The money was given to him by, John Callahan, who had been skimming profits off the businessman's Florida company. Martoano said he considered Callahan a good friend. But in 1982, Bulger an the other leaders of Bulger's Winter Hill gang decided that Callahan had to go, too. 'I felt lousy. But these were my partners,' Martorano testified. 'We were up to our necks in murders already. If it had to be done, it had to be done.' He subsequently went to Miami with an associate, Joe MacDonald, . and set up a meeting with the unsuspecting Callahan. When Callahan met . Martorano at a van he had rented, Martorano shot Callahan in the back of . the head with a handgun wrapped in a towel. Callahan's body was later found in the trunk of an abandoned car at Miami International Airport. Another slaying he described seemed to come right out of a scene from a Martin Scorsese film. Thomas King was a mobster with a rival gang that Bulger and his crew had been forced to work with. Bulger hated King, Martorano testified. 'Him and Tommy couldn’t get along, He wanted to get rid of Tommy,' he said. Bulger decided to kill the dangerous King, but knew he would be wary of being lured into a trap. So, he had Martorano and his allies contact King and tell him they needed his help murdering another mobster. Godfather: James 'Whitey' Bulger holds John Martorano's youngest son, John Jr., during his Christening ceremony in this undated handout photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts . Winter Hill Gang: A diagram showing the 'Winter Hill Gang' organization in the late 1970s was passed around jurors as John Martorano took the stand in the trial of accused mob boss Whitey Bulger . They gave king a bulletproof vest and then a gun. The gun had only blanks in it. King got into the front passenger seat of a car he believed would take him to the bar where his target was. Martorano got in the back seat behind him. 'I shot Tommy,' Martorano told the court. 'Where did I shoot him? In the head.' Martorano also said he witnessed Bulger kill mobster Edward Connors in 1975 because he had bragged about helping Bulger's gang murder a rival. Bulger and his partner Stephen 'The Rifle' Flemmi lured Connors into a phone booth in Dorchester. 'They walked to the phone booth and shot Eddie,' Martorano testified. Martorano, is a star witness in the Bulger trial. He has said he had a . detailed knowledge of many of the 19 murders Bulger is accused of . committing. He described shooting dead rival mob member Alfred 'Indian Al' Notorangeli from a car in 1974 while Bulger rode behind him another car that was ready to block out anyone to tried to get in the way of the hit. Before Martorano killed Notorangeli, he gunned down bartender Michael Milano, who had the misfortune of driving the same car as Notorangeli. Martorano called that murder 'a mistake,' because Milano wasn't the intended target. Deaths: The body of Roger Wheeler, the former owner of World Jai Alai, is shown in this undated handout photo. John Martorano said he killed Wheeler in 1981 under orders from Winter Hill Gang leaders Bulger and Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi . Innocent bystander: This photo presented to jurors shows the bullet-riddled car of bartender Michael Milano. He was killed after being mistaken for a member of Bulger's rival gang . Gruesome: The Buick was riddled with bullets in a hit on Albert Plummer, who worked for a rival mob boss . A crime scene photo from the time reveals Milano's car riddled with bullet holes. Martorano also said he killed one of Notorangeli's henchmen, Albert Plummer, in a hail of bullets. He served just 12 years in prison after admitting to the killings under a plea deal. He now lives in a quiet suburb of Boston on a golf course. He testified that he collects Social Security. However, he was also paid $250,000 for the film rights to his story and has made $80,000 off a 2012 book about his life titled 'Hitman.' He has also been paid thousands by the U.S. government, including a check for $20,000 from the Drug Enforcement Agency gave him when he was released from prison. Martorano worked closely with Bulger and Flemmi from the 1960s until the 1990s. On the witness stand on Monday, he called the men 'my partners in crime, my best friends, my children’s godfathers,' according to the Boston Globe. 'After I found out they were informants, it sort of broke my heart,' Martorano said on the witness stand. 'They broke all trust that we had, all loyalty.' Martorano is, by his own admission, a brutal killer. He worked as the lead enforcer and hit man for Bulger's Winter Hill Gang, for whom he gunned down at least 20 people.

But these professional beachscapes taken from a helicopter show the familiar scene of the family photo in a completely different light. Photographer Gray Malin took to the skies to achieve these dramatic aerial views of the world's beaches, which he shot over a period of eighteen months. View from above: Some of the aerial shots look directly down on the sunbathers from a distance. This shot has pulled away from the people and their sun loungers, turning them into dots on a canvas .

Sun worshipers: Eye-catching patterns and shapes are created by colourful bikinis, towels and parasols against a backdrop of beige sand . Mr Malin took rides in 16 helicopters over six different continents to observe and photograph beach scenes. He said he was first inspired by sunbathers at a swimming pool. He then expanded the project to take in beachscapes. He said: 'I became mesmerised by the spectacle of hundreds of sunbathers and swimmers splashing around in this gigantic pool. I took a photo of the scene and it ended up being the creative spark that ignited the series.' In an interview with enpundit, Mr Malin said: 'When I get up in the air and start looking down on those beautiful beaches and pools, I begin to start seeing the world as art. 'Each geographic location is made up by the beautiful, vibrant patterns of many things, such as beach towels, surfboards, and umbrellas, all of which create repetition of shape and form.

So Serena Williams may possibly be glad that she didn’t heed her own rules for dating. In a documentary film, the 31-year-old player is shown saying that she ‘only dates black men’. Serena Williams became romantically involved with her white tennis coach, Patrick Mouratoglu, last year, after previously stating she 'only dates black men' The film was shot months before she became romantically involved with her white tennis coach, Patrick Mouratoglu, last year. Asked if she had ever considered marriage, she tells the filmmakers: ‘I’m married to me. I’m very selfish and set in my ways. ‘There are some great guys out there, wonderful people. I only date black guys. I don’t mind white guys, I just prefer black guys.’ Serena has dated US actor Jackie Long, American footballer Bryant McKinnie and rapper Common, who are all black, but Mouratoglu is not her first white boyfriend. She had a relationship with US film director Brett Ratner, which ended in 2005, and was also linked to 21-year-old Bulgarian tennis star Grigor Dimitrov before her current romance. Serena has dated US actor Jackie Long, American footballer Bryant McKinnie and rapper Common, who are all black, but Mouratoglu is not her first white boyfriend . Serena began dating Mouratoglu, 42, after recruiting the Frenchman when she suffered her first ever opening round defeat in the French Open last year. Since then he has guided her to her fifth Wimbledon title, an Olympic gold medal, her fourth US Open title and her second French Open title, and also lifted her back to world No 1 in the WTA rankings. The documentary, which is called Venus And Serena, is released next week. In it, her 33-year-old sister Venus also talks about her private life. Venus, who is dating 24-year-old Cuban model Elio Pis, says: ‘I’d like to think about getting married one day. But I want to play tennis for ever. I can’t be having kids and doing that.’ Serena will play at Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, but Venus has pulled out with a back injury. Yesterday Serena had to apologise for her comments about the case of a drunken 16-year-old girl raped by two high school American football players in Ohio who then swapped video of the assault on social media. Asked to comment following their conviction, she told Rolling Stone magazine: ‘I’m not blaming the girl, but ... she’s 16, why was she that drunk where she doesn’t remember? It could have been much worse. She’s lucky. ‘She shouldn’t have put herself in that position, unless they slipped her something, then that’s different.’ After criticism on Twitter, Serena said last night: ‘For someone to be raped, and at only 16, is such a horrible tragedy.

Scotland Yard said it was examining the laptop after a complaint that the Respect MP had authorised a lawyer to spy on the Hotmail account of Aisha Ali-Khan, suspended by Mr Galloway last October. The Bradford West MP, who denies he condoned hacking, put down a Commons motion last year accusing Ms Ali-Khan of a dirty-tricks campaign against him with her husband, Afiz Khan, a member of the Metropolitan Police anti-terror squad. He told MPs: ‘Afiz Khan sent emails to an individual in the Hon Member’s office who acted as his agent and co-ordinated this operation from his police email account and from at least two other fake email accounts.’ Mr Galloway’s claims led to the arrest of the couple on suspicion of data protection offences and, in Mr Khan’s case, of ‘abusing his position as a police officer’. But now Scotland Yard is also investigating how Mr Galloway first became aware of the emails. Ms Ali-Khan, 32, a mother of one, has denied any campaign against Mr Galloway, saying the emails the MP saw were part of a private correspondence in which her husband was counselling her over ‘bullying and misogyny’ in the MP’s Bradford office.

An independent audio expert believes that George Zimmerman is most likely the harrowing voice screaming for help in the crucial 911 call made seconds before Trayvon Martin was shot dead. As attorney's convene back in court in Florida today to continue a hearing to determine whether jurors will even listen to the phone call - this new revelation significantly bolsters Zimmerman's claim of self-defense. ABC News exclusively obtained a sample of the distressing emergency call - which could prove pivotal once the trial of 29-year-old Zimmerman begins - and sent it to Kent Gibson of Forensic Audio. Scroll Down to Listen to the Distressing Call for Help . George Zimmerman arrives in Seminole circuit court, in Sanford, Florida, for a pre-trial hearing on Friday, June 7, 2013 . Final Hearing: George Zimmerman arrives in Seminole circuit court, in Sanford, Fla., for a pre-trial hearing on Friday, June 7, 2013 . In his expert opinion, a comparison of Martin's voice, Zimmerman's voice and the screaming on the 911 call indicate that the voice is 'more likely to be Zimmerman than Martin by a significant margin.' ABC News explained they were able to finally make their startling but qualified judgement on the identity of the voice after they exclusively obtained a recording of Trayvon Martin's voice. To ID any audio, forensic experts need samples of both Zimmerman and Martin's voice - and ABC provided their expert with a cellphone recording of Martin laughing and talking about two men arguing over a bike. However, he adds the disclaimer that there is so much howling and pleading on the tape that only two seconds are usable in his opinion - therefore he says, there is no definitive identification of 'the screamer'. In court this morning, the first witness, Tom Owen, a New Jersey based voice expert who listened to the recording for the Orlando Sentinel last year, ruled out Zimmerman as the voice. He told the hearing that in 300 court appearances before today, he had never failed to qualify his opinion as expert. Concurring with ABC News' expert, Owen played the court the 'usable' footage and then played publicly available samples of Zimmerman's voice. 'The screams don't match Zimmerman at all,' said Owen. However, defense attorney Don West attacked Owen's credentials, asking why he claimed to have been an audio expert for 50 years, when that would mean he began his career as a teenager. Owen replied that he produced weddings from the age of 15 and began work in voice identification in the early 1980s. George Zimmerman arrives in Seminole circuit court with his attorney, Mark O'Mara, (left), in Sanford, Florida today . The FBI's forensic audio expert told the hearing on Thursday that he found it 'disturbing' that the court would want to admit evidence where no one can positively determine who is screaming. Indeed, almost to prove this point, he pointed to one expert whose testimony was submitted as evidence in which he says he can hear Martin saying 'I'm begging you' moments before he is shot. One other witness claims he can hear the screams come from Martin, while another says Zimmerman. Today's final hearing before the trial begins next week argues that the science involved in picking out certain parts of audio is inadmissible. However, the state, who contend the voice is of Trayvon Martin believe their audio experts prove the audio is credible evidence.

Shawn Vincent, spokesman for Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara, told ABC News, ""That 911 call will get played in court. It is an important piece of evidence that will be played for the jury to make up their mind."" 'The 911 call is probably the best evidence of what happened that night besides George Zimmerman's testimony and Trayvon's,' said legal analyst Bill Schaefer to ABC News, who noted Martin wouldn't be able to testify explaining his version of what happened. Yesterday, George Zimmerman revealed his dramatic weight gain during his latest court appearance today as a judge denied his attorney's request to let some witnesses testify in private. Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year. Zimmerman, who has been in hiding since his arrest, appeared in court on Thursday as his lawyer asked the judge for some witnesses to give their testimony out of the public eye. Defense attorney Mark O'Mara said the witnesses have concerns for their safety about testifying at Zimmerman's trial, which starts next week.

Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year . O'Mara said that the seven witnesses he wanted to keep hidden include one eyewitness to the altercation between Zimmerman and Martin on the night of February 26, 2012. He said their testimony could impact the jury's decision, but prosecutors and attorneys for media groups objected to the request. Prosecutor John Guy had opposed the request, explaining it might be 'alarming and confusing to a juror and might otherwise highlight their testimony when it shouldn’t be highlighted'. O'Mara also called Ben Kruidbos, a former IT director in the state prosecutor's office, to the stand. The defense claims Kruidbos is a whistleblower who revealed deleted texts, photographs, and video found on the teenager's phone which prosecutors failed to disclose to the defense.

George Zimmerman and his wife Shellly have been seen together in the Florida courtroom where jury selection is taking place at the start of his murder trial. Mrs Zimmerman has been in court every day of the trial so far but until now had not been seen together with her husband. Earlier in the week, Shelly Zimmerman arrived at the court with the family's security guard to watch the proceedings, but on Friday the couple were seen arriving together in the courtroom and even chatted with one another during a break in proceedings. Standing by her man: George Zimmerman, followed by his wife Shelly enters the court room on the fifth day of jury selection in his murder trial for shooting death of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 . The look of love? Shelly Zimmerman, left, looks at her husband George Zimmerman as they leave the court room. Zimmerman has been charged with second-degree murder for the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin . Prior to this weeks jury selection, Shelly Zimmerman was last seen in February when she had to appear in court on perjury charges. According . to prosecutors, she lied at her husband's April 20, 2012, bond hearing . when she testified that the couple had no money when in fact more than . $130,000 in donations had come flooding in for her husband's defense. More than two dozen potential jurors interviewed individually by prosecutors and defense attorneys during the past week were told to return to a Florida courthouse next week for further questioning. The sides must agree on six jurors and four alternates. Zimmerman, a 29-year-old former neighborhood watch volunteer, is pleading not guilty to second-degree murder, claiming he shot Trayvon Martin in self-defense. Before lunch, Judge Debra Nelson told . 23 candidates to return Tuesday and she did the same to an additional . six potential jurors before ending the day Friday. She asked them not to discuss the case or selection process with anyone. Court spokesman Michelle Kennedy, . however, said a tally she had received from the judge put the number of . potential jurors called back at 28. United: Although Shelly Zimmerman has been present in the courtroom during the first few days of jury selection, on Friday she arrived and departed from court with her husband . Of the 29 candidates, 19 are white; six are black; two are Hispanic; one describes himself as mixed race; and one is Asian-American. The racial and ethnic makeup of potential jurors is relevant because prosecutors claim Zimmerman profiled 17-year-old Martin when he followed him through his gated community shortly before the unarmed teen was fatally shot. The case prompted public outrage, as some critics believed authorities initially didn't investigate the case thoroughly because Martin was a black teen from the Miami area. The potential jurors asked to return were overwhelmingly female and middle-aged. After Friday's court session ended, defense attorney Mark O'Mara said he was confident he could pick a jury in Seminole County. 'Personally, I'm very happy about that,' O'Mara said. 'We're making good progress that jurors, for the most part are being honest and straight-forward.' Right behind you: Zimmerman's wife Shelly showed up at court with the family security guard, left, to support her husband George, right, on his first day of trial . Defense investigators were able to . uncover the Facebook posting by the dismissed juror. O'Mara said he was . worried about possible 'stealth jurors,' who want to sit on the jury . with ulterior motives. 'It could have easily gotten by us,' O'Mara said. Race-related questions came up regularly during jury candidate interviews on Friday. During . questioning of a potential juror Friday, O'Mara specifically asked a . man in his 20s who identified as mixed race what his racial background . was. The man said German, Filipino, Chinese and Spanish. Later . in the day, a middle-aged black man who works in a school described his . family and friends' reaction to Martin's death as 'typical,' given a . history of violence against African-American men in the U.S. Prosecutors . and defense attorneys want to build a pool of 40 potential jurors who . have been screened for any influence of pretrial publicity before they . move to a second round of questioning. Attorneys had interviewed 41 . potential jurors over five days by mid-afternoon on Friday. At least 85 potential jurors already have been dismissed. Support: This week is the first time Shelly has appeared in court since she attended her hearing on perjury charges in February . Wanting justice: Trayvon Martin's parents Tracy Martin, second righ and Sybrina Fulton, say they have faith in the justice system . Chubby: Photographs taken inside the courtroom show the former neighborhood watch officer is drastically heavier than he was in mugshots taken after he gunned down Trayvon Martin last year . A 44-day delay in Zimmerman's arrest led to protests around the nation. Some . questioned whether the Sanford Police Department was investigating the . case seriously since Martin was a black teen from the Miami area. Zimmerman identifies himself as Hispanic. Attorneys . need to find six jurors and four alternates. In Florida, 12 jurors are . required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, when the . death penalty is being considered. The . judge said Thursday that jurors picked to serve will be sequestered . during the two weeks to a month that the trial will last. They . will have limited contact with their families, they will spend the . night at a hotel and their actions will be monitored by court security . outside the courtroom during the duration of the trial. The death of the teenager, who was unarmed, sparked protests across the U.S. There is no dispute that Zimmerman shot an unarmed Martin, 17, during a fight on a rainy night in February 2012. Prosecutors . will try to show the neighborhood watch volunteer racially profiled the . black teenager, while Zimmerman's attorney must convince jurors . Zimmerman pulled his 9mm handgun and fired a bullet into the high school . student's chest because he feared for his life.

The family of a nurse who committed suicide after answering a hoax phone call about the Duchess of Cambridge have received no answers from her hospital bosses despite sending them 40 questions. Instead, Jacintha Saldanha’s family have been told by King Edward VII Hospital – where the pregnant duchess was being treated for acute morning sickness – that they will have to await the outcome of an internal inquiry which may answer some of the questions. Ms Saldanha’s husband and two children have also received no answers from Australian radio station 2Day FM, which was behind the prank, despite sending the broadcaster 20 questions before Christmas. The radio station’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, has written back, merely stating that an official inquiry by Australia’s media watchdog was under way. So far, Southern Cross Austereo has not made any attempt to contact Ms Saldanha’s family to express their condolence or apologise for the hoax call, which has received international condemnation. Ms Saldanha, 46, was the duty nurse when DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian called King Edward VII pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, asking about the duchess’s condition. She forwarded the call to another nurse, who divulged confidential medical information about Kate. The prank was broadcast by 2Day FM within hours, and made headlines around the world. Ms Saldanha was found dead in the nurses’ quarters three days later, having hanged herself with a scarf.

Controversial: Helen Grant MP's son lives with his grandmother, which puts him in a good state school catchment area . A Tory Minister is at the centre of an elitism row after it emerged that her son has secured a place at a exclusive grammar school by living with his grandmother. Helen Grant was embroiled in a scandal over expenses last year when it was revealed that she lived not in her constituency of Maidstone, Kent, but in a £1.8 million home in Surrey. But although she chooses not to stay in the town she represents Mrs Grant’s son does live there – with the MP’s mother and within the catchment area of the academically successful Maidstone Grammar. The unusual arrangement has led to claims that Mrs Grant had been able to take advantage of a free, elite  education for her son at the state-funded selective school, despite living 40 miles away. Her controversial living arrangements first came under the spotlight last year when it was revealed she was claiming £20,000 for a flat in  the capital – even though her Reigate home is within the London commuter belt, where MPs cannot claim allowances for second homes. However she was allowed to take the money as her constituency is outside the ‘exclusion zone’, even if her home isn’t. Now the MP is facing further pressure over the fact that her 17-year-old son lives with his grandmother, Gladys, in Sutton Valence, just over four miles from the school where last year an impressive 97 per cent of pupils achieved five or more good GCSEs. Last night Michael Pyke, from the Campaign for State Education group, said: ‘This seems to be a good example of the way the system benefits wealthy people. ‘If Kent was all-comprehensive, I very much doubt whether Mrs Grant would have made this arrangement.’ Kent is one of the last grammar school bastions in Britain, containing 33 of the country’s remaining 164 schools. Despite pressure from parents and pro-selection Tory MPs, David Cameron has refused to back their expansion, leading to fierce competition for the few schools which still exist. Selective state education is not available in Surrey. Mrs Grant, 51, succeeded former Minister Ann Widdecombe to the Maidstone seat at the 2010 Election, with a majority of under 6,000. Class credentials: In a gathering of Conservative MPs born in Council Houses Helen Grant sits centre left . But political opponents have drawn up a petition calling for Mrs Grant’s resignation since her expenses were revealed. It says: ‘In a government that is destroying the lives of those most in need, the Equalities Minister is busy making her life very comfortable.’ Mrs Grant takes home £97,000 from her political job and a further £26,000 in fees from the legal company she established 20 years ago. While she claims £20,000 rent on her riverside flat in London, the Tory MP in whose Reigate constituency she lives, Crispin Blunt, is not allowed to claim anything. A spokeswoman for the Minister said: ‘Mrs Grant declines to comment on issues regarding her children.’","Son goes to state-funded selective school despite her living 40 miles away .

Bring that bling: Mario Williams has gone on the offensive - he wants the 10-carat $785,000 diamond engagement ring he gave to Erin Marzouki, his former fiancée, back . The suit seeks recovery of a stunning 10.04 carat diamond ring from Marzouki after she decided to end her engagement with Williams in January. According to court documents, 'During the parties' relationship, on or about December 12, 2011, plaintiff purchased a $785,000 diamond engagement ring from Valobra Master Jewelers,' the complaint states. Read the lawsuit in full... '(Marzouki) never intended to marry (Williams) and used the relationship as a means to get to (Williams’) money and acquire gifts,' says the lawsuit, filed by Houston attorneys Monica Schulz Orlando and Michael Gary Orlando.

Breakup: Mario Williams, 28, is suing Erin Marzouki, 31, in a civil lawsuit for the return of her $785,000 engagement ring after the couple split up . Bling: The ring is a GIA certified radiant cut diamond weighing 10.04 carats, E color grade and VS2 clarity grade worth $785,000 . Williams gave the engagement ring to Marzouki on February 19th 2012 along with an American Express card to which she charged $108,000 during 2012 and 'additional luxurious items' valued at about $230,000. But it was all over within a year with when Marzouki 'unilaterally terminated' the engagement on January 21st 2013. The court documents says Williams ex-fiance 'never intended to marry and used the relationship as a means to get money and acquire gifts.' The lawsuit exudes Williams' bitterness over the failed relationship and states that Williams has refused requests to return the diamond engagement ring.. Rich: Wiilliams signed six-year deal with the Buffalo Bills in 2012, worth up to $100 million, with $50 million guaranteed . Lawsuit: Court documents show Erin Marzouki, 31, called off the relationship after less than a year . In one year he claims he spent $1,123,000 on a fiancée who broke up with him just months after they’d become engaged. Williams’ lawyers are now looking to take out a restraining order that would prevent Marzouki from selling or damaging the ring or keeping any proceeds by selling it. According to Texan law, Williams would be entitled to recovery of the ring under a 'conditional gift rule' and Williams is legally allowed to ask for it to be returned. Williams was the first selection in the 2006 NFL draft by the Texans and played in Houston through the 2011 season. No sympathy: Darren Rovell of ESPN puts things in perspective from a cash point of view . Rules: Some men pay 2 to 3 months salary for their fiancees engagement ring so surely it would ring true here? Although by regular standards the ring is a fortune, it is pocket change to Williams who last year signed one of the most lucrative contracts for a defensive player in NFL history: a six-year, $100 million with the Buffalo Bills with $50 million in cash guaranteed. ESPN's Darren Rovell noted that Williams spent three percent of initial guaranteed money Buffalo gave him on that ring whilst CBS Sports' Doug Gottlieb was also perplexed by Williams demands.","Fomer Houston Texan star Mario Williams is suing his ex-fiancee, Erin Marzouki .

The 44-year-old actor went to Gotham Gym in West Village, New York, where a woman confronted him inside as he was working out. Kathleen Thurston, 47, ran past the front desk in hysterics, crying and shouting that she loved the X-Men star, according to reports. Scroll down for video . Gym buff: Hugh Jackman was stalked by Kathleen Thurston while working out at his West Village, New York, gym, where he was just spotted last Wednesday . Workout: Jackman was exercising at Gotham Gym in the West Village when police said he was confronted by the razor-toting stalker . Though the woman was eventually stopped by a gym employee, she reached into her waistband and grabbed an electric razor full of her body hair, according to TMZ. 'The primary concern is my family': Hugh told reporters that he is looking out for the safety of his family after his Saturday gym incident . 'The razor fell out of her hands when I stepped in between them,' Mike Castle, a trainer at the gym, told police. Hugh asked the woman not to touch him, according to NYPD spokesman Sgt Tom Antonelli. Kathleen left the gym as soon as security arrived. She was arrested a few blocs away from the facility and charged with stalking. 'Here's a woman who obviously needs help so I just hope she get the help she needs,' the actor told CBS New York correspondent Carol D'Auria. Jackman was reportedly shaken by the incident, fearing that the woman was grabbing for a weapon when she reached into her pants. The New York Post reported that the woman's address is listed as a Harlem shelter for the mentally ill. The Les Miserables star has had more than just one run-in with this stalker. Jackman has also seen the woman outside his seven-year-old daughter's elementary school in Manhattan and outside his home in the West Village, where he lives with his wife Deborra-Lee Furness. 'I suppose for me, the primary concern is my family, obviously,' the actor told CBS New York regarding his stalker. Still reeling: Jackman put on a brave face after the incident as he headed out in New York on Sunday .

Blanked: The family of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who committed suicide after transferring a call about Kate Middleton, have received no answers from her employers King Edward VII Hospital . The family of a nurse who committed suicide after answering a hoax phone call about the Duchess of Cambridge have received no answers from her hospital bosses despite sending them 40 questions. Instead, Jacintha Saldanha’s family have been told by King Edward VII Hospital – where the pregnant duchess was being treated for acute morning sickness – that they will have to await the outcome of an internal inquiry which may answer some of the questions. Ms Saldanha’s husband and two children have also received no answers from Australian radio station 2Day FM, which was behind the prank, despite sending the broadcaster 20 questions before Christmas. The radio station’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, has written back, merely stating that an official inquiry by Australia’s media watchdog was under way. So far, Southern Cross Austereo has not made any attempt to contact Ms Saldanha’s family to express their condolence or apologise for the hoax call, which has received international condemnation. Ms Saldanha, 46, was the duty nurse when DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian called King Edward VII pretending to be the Queen and Prince Charles, asking about the duchess’s condition. She forwarded the call to another nurse, who divulged confidential medical information about Kate. The prank was broadcast by 2Day FM within hours, and made headlines around the world. Ms Saldanha was found dead in the nurses’ quarters three days later, having hanged herself. Her accountant husband Benedict Barboza, 49, son Junal, 17, and daughter Lisha, 14, sent King Edward VII 40 questions before Christmas, in their search for answers.

"By . Matt Chorley and James Chapman . PUBLISHED: . 21:33 EST, 8 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:49 EST, 9 May 2013 . Nick Clegg today tore into coalition plans to allow nurseries to look after more children, warning it will have no impact on cutting costs for parents. He said any adult would struggle to care for six two-year-olds at once, as he lifted the lid on a long-running government row about the risks to child safety. Tory minister Elizabeth Truss launched a strong defence of her plans in the Commons, but Labour said the chaotic policy put child safety at risk. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg could block flagship Tory childcare reforms . The Deputy Prime Minister has horrified . Tory colleagues by threatening to block flagship Government reforms of . childcare just weeks before they are due to be implemented. Mr Clegg said parents groups, experts and childcare providers had warned the reforms - championed by Tory education minister Elizabeth Truss - would not work in an official consultation. He said: 'A lot of people basically got back in the consultation and said this isn't going to work, particularly for very small children, it isn't necessarily going to be passed on in terms of cost savings to parents.' Miss Truss has designed radical . reform of the system to improve the quality of staff, while reducing . costs by lowering the stipulated adult/child ratios. She wants to raise the qualifications . required of nursery staff and, in return, allow the establishments to . increase ratios – for instance four rather than three . under-two-year-olds per adult, and six toddlers rather than four. Childminders will be able to have two babies in their care rather than one and four under-fives rather than three. But Mr Clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in: 'Having six under-twos instead of four is quite a challenge for the adult. 'I think four is already quite a handful, just imagine if they go up to six. This is not a great ideological thing, this is just about getting it right for parents up and down the country,' he told LBC 97.3. 'When the last government changed the so-called ratios and allowed an adult to look after more young children, they did it for three and four-year-olds, it had almost no effect in reducing the cost for parents whatsoever. 'So you do need to be led by the evidence and that is what I will continue to do in the debate."" 'In a nutshell this debate is about: can you raise quality and quantity at the same time. We have got to get the balance right. We owe it to parents who want quality childcare.' He said the behind-the-scenes row had been going on 'for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks'. And he told LBC host Nick Ferrari: 'I will challenge you to spend a morning looking after six two-year-olds - I think you will find it quite a challenge.' Ratio reform: Education minister Elizabeth Truss has championed changes to the number of children nurseries can look after . Tory ministers want to relax the rules on carer-to-child ratios, to bring them more in line with other European countries . Mr Clegg insisted the row will not . affected the rest of the government's wide-ranging childcare package . which also includes £1,200 tax breaks on childcare for working parents. In the Commons today, Miss Truss insisted the reforms would help to cut costs for parents while allowing childcare staff to be paid more. 'The current system of childcare is not working for parents,' she told MPs. 'Too many parents in the UK are . struggling to juggle their work and childcare arrangements. Families in . England pay some of the highest costs in the world - 27 per cent of . their income goes on costs, compared to 11% in countries like France.' She . said that in Ireland and Germany, the ratio for two-year-olds was six . to one, in France each member of staff could look after eight . youngsters, while in Denmark and in Sweden there were ''no national . staff ratios at all'. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said ratios should not be relaxed because it will not cut costs . 'Our proposals will allow nurseries who hire high-quality staff to able to exercise professional judgment. It is exactly the same concept that we have used in academies, giving high-quality institutions the autonomy to make decisions for themselves and to be able to exercise professional judgment. 'These ratios are not compulsory. This is about professionals in the childcare sector being able to exercise their judgment and being able to deliver an affordable, high-quality service to parents.' But Labour's shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said the row was proof of a government in chaos. Writing for MailOnline he said: 'All this gives the impression of a Government that runs on the basis of chaos and confusion. This creates real fear amongst parents who need some reassurance on the quality and affordability of childcare. 'The truth is this is a Government with no plan to help hard working families with the costs of childcare, which have spiralled under this Government. 'It’s not just the experts of course, as any parent will tell you, young children are demanding and they need lots of attention, so while a childminder can have the very best qualifications, they still only have one pair of hands. 'Labour have been campaigning on this issue for months, warning that the changes would risk the quality of care and even child safety.' In . January Miss Truss unveiled a major overhaul of the rules on who can . look after children, the qualifications they need and the ratios of . staff to children with the aim of having fewer, better-qualified staff. But government advisor, Professor Helen Penn, said: 'The figures she gives seem to me to be rather grotesque.' Professor . Penn, an expert in early childhood, co-wrote a report for the . government on the reforms with Professor Eva Lloyd last year. However, . a leaked copy revealed it warned allowing childminders and nursery . workers to care for more children would lead to a 'deterioration' of the . quality of care. In an interview with the Daily Mail last month, Miss Truss said too many childcare settings were ‘chaotic’ with children ‘running around’ and ‘no sense of purpose’. A spokesman said: 'Nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children' But in government meetings over recent days, Mr Clegg has made clear he can no longer support the reforms of ratios. ‘The . question that needs to be answered is will this drive down costs,’ said . a Lib Dem source. ‘If it doesn’t then that defeats the object of doing . it.’ Another Whitehall source said the Lib Dems appeared to have been ‘spooked’ by the negative reaction of some childcare providers. The Prime Minister will now have to begin ‘horse-trading’ with the Lib Dems. A . spokesman for the Deputy Prime Minister said: ‘The delivery of good . quality, affordable childcare is one of Nick Clegg’s biggest priorities. Nick remains to be persuaded that this is the right thing to do for very young children. ‘Or, crucially, to be persuaded that this would actually help families with high childcare costs.’ In one survey, conducted by the National Children’s Bureau, out of 341 staff interviewed, 95 per cent said they were concerned about the policy. ‘The Government’s own adviser on childcare, Professor Cathy Nutbrown, said the ratio plans ‘make no sense at all’. Neil Leitch, Chief Executive of the Pre-school Learning Alliance, said: 'Thousands of parents and practitioners, as well as some of the country's leading early years academics, are against these changes, which will lower the overall quality of childcare in this country. 'We trust the Deputy Prime Minister will listen to what parents and the sector have to say about these proposals, which we believe are a huge mistake.' The Department for Education refused to comment.","Deputy Prime Minister says reforms will not reduce nursery fees .

Authorities are reopening the case of a teen who hanged herself after she was allegedly raped and bullied for months. The police force's Nova Scotia office said it had received new and credible information in the case of 17-year-old Rehtaeh Parsons, whose family said she was photographed while being sexually assaulted in 2011 and bullied after the photo went viral online. Her death on Sunday has been compared to similar cases in the United States, including a 15-year-old California girl who killed herself after her family says she was sexually assaulted by friends and a photo surfaced online. Victim: Rehtaeh hanged herself on April 4 after a constant campaign of bullying on the Internet and in real life that lasted a staggering 17 months even though she switched schools and moved house . Police had concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone in the Canadian case after an initial yearlong investigation, but the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Halifax now say a person who provided new information is willing to verify who the suspects are and cooperate with investigators. The reopening of the case comes after police were publicly criticized for their handling of the case. Tragic: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, killed herself after allegedly being gang-raped and then bullied . Corporal Scott MacRae said he could not provide any details about who the source is or what the new information is. He would not say whether they were a witness and said it's too early to speculate if there will be charges. 'We're certainly encouraged by this,' he said. MacRae said Parson's family had been informed, and they 'welcome the re-opening of the file.' The Nova Scotia government came under criticism after Justice Minister Ross Landry initially ruled out the possibility of reviewing how the RCMP handled allegations that Parsons was sexually assaulted. Landry changed course this week, saying he had asked senior officials for options to review how the Mounties and the Public Prosecution Service concluded they could not file charges. A group reported to be the cyber-activist hackers Anonymous released a statement Friday saying it has seen 'several public statements' from one of the alleged rapists acknowledging that he had sex with Parsons while she was intoxicated and that she threw up during the assault. The group had earlier vowed to release the names of four males investigated in the alleged sexual assault if police did not reopen its investigation. Speaking to MailOnline, the victim's . mother, Leah Parsons revealed that the boy who allegedly raped her . daughter then circulated . the picture of the assault has admitted to her that he sent it to his . friends because he was just ‘bragging’.

"By . Glen Owen . PUBLISHED: . 16:06 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:51 EST, 4 May 2013 . Nigel Evans has a healthy Parliamentary majority in Ribble Valley of over 14,700 – but should his arrest trigger a by-election, it could still present a huge headache for David Cameron. Even before Nigel Farage’s UKIP emerged as the ‘fourth force’ in British politics last week, the constituency had a history of causing difficulty for Conservative Prime Ministers. In 1991, Mr Evans was the Tory candidate for Ribble Valley when Cabinet Minister David Waddington was elevated to the House of Lords – triggering a poll in which the party’s majority of 19,528 turned into a Liberal Democrat majority of 4,601. Despite Nigel Evans's (left) healthy majority in his Ribble Valley constituency, a by-election could still pose a headache for David Cameron, right . Although Mr Evans won the seat back for the Conservatives at the next year’s General Election, the party is still scarred by the memory of the Liberal Democrats – then just three years old as a party, and UKIP’s predecessors as the natural ‘party of protest’ – increasing their share of the vote by a whopping 27 per cent. It was one of the largest swings in by-election history. Mr Evans has not been charged with any offence, but if he subsequently chose to stand down from Parliament in the wake of the allegations, UKIP would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first Westminster MP. At the last Election, Mr Evans took 50 per cent of the vote; Labour were in second place, on 22 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats third on 20 per cent and UKIP fourth, with just under seven per cent. Waiting: Mr Evans has not been charged with any offence, but if he subsequently chose to stand down from Parliament in the wake of the allegations, Nigel Farage's UKIP would regard it as the perfect opportunity to secure their first MP . However, if the party could match the surge it managed in the Eastleigh by-election earlier this year, when it increased its share of the vote by eight-fold to 28 per cent, then victory would be within its grasp. Although Nigel Farage says in an interview with today’s Mail on Sunday that he will not consider standing for Parliament himself until after the 2014 European elections, his party’s stunning performance in last week’s council elections – taking 139 seats and securing 23 per cent of the vote – would still give his party the ideal springboard. Ribble Valley, which was created as a constituency in 1983, is a wealthy, rural area which is traditionally more right-of-centre in its voting patterns than the rest of Lancashire. In last week’s council elections Labour finished just four seats short of outright victory on the county council. The party was holding discussions with the Lib Dems over the weekend to oust the Conservatives from power. UKIP did not gain any seats, but was blamed by Conservative councillors for cutting into their share of the vote. In the wake of the results, the council’s Conservative deputy leader, Albert Atkinson, said: ‘I blame David Cameron for this. ‘He needs to listen.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Mr Evans's constituency saw one of the biggest swings in history in 1991 .

"By . Simon Walters, Glen Owen and Brendan Carlin . PUBLISHED: . 18:25 EST, 27 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:38 EST, 27 April 2013 . David Cameron's election guru believes that Tory chairman Grant Shapps and Chancellor George Osborne are ‘liabilities’ who will cost the party votes in this week’s crucial town hall polls, it was claimed last night. Tough-talking Lynton Crosby has had a series of clashes with fellow  campaign chiefs Shapps and Osborne, according to insiders. They say that Australian-born Mr Crosby, recruited by Mr Cameron  to revive flagging Tory ratings, regards Mr Shapps as ‘ineffective’. And he reportedly believes Mr Osborne’s abysmal personal popularity means he is driving voters away in large numbers. 'Liability': Chancellor George Osborne has been criticised by David Cameron's election guru, nicknamed the 'Wizard of Oz' The divisions in the Tory high command emerged amid reports that rebel Conservative MPs may use big losses in Thursday’s town hall elections to launch a fresh assault on Mr Cameron’s leadership. Mr Crosby last night strongly denied criticising Mr Shapps and Mr Osborne saying: ‘It is not true. They are doing a splendid job.’ In a separate development a Conservative MP warned the Prime Minister he faces losing out to the anti-EU UKIP in the polls. Basildon MP John Baron urged Mr Cameron to use the last few days of  campaigning to pledge a tougher stance on Europe – or see UKIP leader Nigel Farage make big gains. The Tory drive to halt the UKIP bandwagon has been hit by tensions between new arrival Mr Crosby and Mr Shapps and Mr Osborne. One official said: ‘Lynton cannot see the point of Shapps. He doesn’t think he has much to offer by way of campaign skills or as an effective frontman for the party.’ Tough talking: Australian Election Campaigner Lynton Crosby has been hired by David Cameron to lead his election campaign . Mr Crosby is also said to have had a number of heated exchanges with Mr Osborne about tactics. ‘George loves to show off his encyclopaedic knowledge of elections, arguing that this or that tactic was proved to be a disaster in an election campaign in America in days gone by,’ said a source. ‘Until now, no one has challenged him but Lynton knows as much about elections as George and will tell him he is wrong – and why. George doesn’t like it.’ Mr Crosby was dubbed ‘the Wizard of Oz’ after being credited with helping Australian Prime Minister John Howard win four elections. However, he is a controversial  figure. He invented ‘dog whistle politics’ – so-called because it is too high for the human ear and can be used to send hidden messages to voters – which focus on cracking down on immigration, welfare and crime. In December, The Mail on Sunday  revealed that as a then adviser to London Mayor Boris Johnson, he used the phrase ‘f****** Muslims’ in a diatribe about winning ethnic minority votes. With fears the Tories may haemorrhage votes to UKIP, Right-winger   Mr Baron urged Mr Cameron to ‘beef up’ his pledge to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU if the Tories win the General Election, due in 2015. Mr Baron said the Prime Minister should make an immediate commitment to introduce legislation on  a referendum before the General Election. It was the best way to counter UKIP claims that he was not fully committed to a referendum – and would spike UKIP’s guns. Mr Baron called on the Prime Minister to heed the calls already made by more than 100 fellow Tory MPs. He said: ‘We have to prove we are serious in our commitment for an EU referendum. That’s why we must bring forward legislation in this Parliament regarding the referendum in the next. If we did that, it would beg the question: Why would anyone bother to vote for UKIP? 'Ineffective': Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has not impressed Lynton Crosby . ‘It would certainly help as I suspect UKIP are going to do well.’ Tory Party strategists are attempting to ‘manage expectations’ by predicting the Conservatives will lose 300 of the 2,400 local authority seats being contested. The Prime Minister’s aides are pessimistic because the seats were last fought in 2009 when Gordon Brown’s Government was at rock-bottom. Now it is Mr Cameron suffering from a mid-term fall in support, with polls putting the Tories eight points behind Labour. Critically, UKIP, which is consistently running at double figures in the polls, is fielding 1,734 candidates – up from 560 last time. Although UKIP is not expected to win a large number of seats, by appealing to Tory voters on issues such as pulling out of the EU and opposing Green Belt development, the party could deprive the Conservatives of victory in dozens of areas.Out the seats being contested, 1,477 are held by the Conservatives, 255 by Labour, 480 by Lib Dems and 197 by other parties. If Mr Cameron manages to hold on to 1,200 seats – pegging losses to fewer than 300 – he will present it as a vindication of his leadership strategy. But if he loses more than 350 seats, his backbenchers will become restive. More than 500 would be regarded as a disaster. Ed Miliband will need to add at least 350 seats to present the poll to his backbenchers as a success. Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems are steeled for the loss of up to 100 seats. UKIP’s difficulty will be converting votes into seats: in 2009, despite averaging a vote of 16 per cent in the areas where its candidates stood, they secured just eight seats. As most of the seats are being fought in southern England, where the main battle is between the Tories and the Lib Dems, Mr Farage could siphon votes away from both parties without adding significantly to his haul. Commentators expect UKIP’s total gain to be in the ‘high teens’, while claiming 50 seats or more would be classed as a ‘wow’ result. Election expert John Curtice, Professor of Politics at Strathclyde University, said: ‘Some Tory losses are inevitable. The seats up for grabs were last contested four years ago during the darkest days of Gordon Brown’s premiership. ‘What will be crucial for Mr Cameron is the scale of the losses. He would love the figure to be less than 300. That would mean he has hung on to some of the gains his party made in 2009.’ Yesterday Jesse Norman, the Tory MP appointed as one of Mr Cameron’s new policy advisers, warned against a shift to the Right to meet the UKIP challenge.","Election guru Lynton Crosby has criticised Osborne's personal unpopularity .

Anger: UKIP leader Nigel Farage condemned 'another appalling case of . discrimination' after a member was prevented from volunteering as a . mentor for young adults by leading children's charity Barnardo's . A row over two UKIP members having their foster children removed took a new twist last night when another woman claimed she had been barred from looking after children because  she was a party candidate. Nigel Farage, UKIP leader, condemned ‘another appalling case of discrimination’ after former district nurse Anne Murgatroyd said she had been prevented from volunteering as a  mentor for young adults by leading  children’s charity Barnardo’s. Ms Murgatroyd, a mother of three, claims she told the charity of her political affiliation and was told it would ‘not be appropriate’ for her to perform the role, which involves supporting children coming out of the care system, because UKIP ‘opposes multi-culturalism’. The charity said there were other reasons for Ms Murgatroyd’s rejection but refused to disclose further details. The claim came as two investigations were launched into a council’s ‘indefensible’ decision to remove three vulnerable children from their foster parents because of their support for UKIP. Social workers at Rotherham Borough Council claimed the married couple’s affiliation with UKIP meant they supported ‘racist’ policies which made them unsuitable carers for the non-British children and there were concerns for their ‘cultural and ethical needs’. But amid widespread condemnation of their actions yesterday, the Labour-run council began an internal review, and Education Secretary Michael Gove announced his own investigation. Last night, Mr Farage said he had ‘no reason’ to doubt Ms Murgatroyd’s story. He said: ‘I met this lady at our party conference. We knew about this story at the time but she chose not to publicise it. She has now decided to make it known, really in support of the couple in Rotherham. Because of all that, I believe her story is genuine.’ Separately, UKIP officials said Ms Murgatroyd informed them of her problems with Barnardo’s several months ago. The latest claim emerged in a series of posts Ms Murgatroyd, who stood as a UKIP candidate for Leeds City Council in May’s elections, made on Twitter. Response: The charity said there were other reasons for Ms Murgatroyd's rejection but refused to disclose further details . She wrote: ‘Barnardo’s would not allow me to be a volunteer befriender of young people leaving care when I told them I was standing for UKIP . . . Barnardo’s rationale for this was that “UKIP opposes multi-culturalism”.’ Responding to a Mail on Sunday reporter, she wrote: ‘I’d almost gone through their process and been accepted when I told them I’d be standing for UKIP in locals . . . They checked with managers,  discussed it, couldn’t accept me due to issue of multi-culturalism. ‘Their rationale was that because UKIP opposes multi-culturalism it would not be appropriate for me to mentor young people coming out of the care system. My argument was that, yes, I do oppose forced marriage and female genital mutilation and family killings but that does not make me unsuitable to befriend young people.’ Anne Murgatroyd said the charity told her it would . ‘not be appropriate’ for her to perform the role . Barnardo’s denied ‘blanket banning’ any applicant. It said: ‘The needs of the child must be paramount when making any decision about matching them with carers and the most important thing is to provide a loving and supportive environment. People from all backgrounds work and volunteer for Barnardo’s but there are many factors to take into consideration when assessing suitability to work with children or young people. Cultural context is relevant, but so are family background, health, and any previous experience.’ The foster couple in Rotherham at the centre of a separate storm claimed Howard Woolfenden, the council’s former director of safeguarding children and families, had taken the decision to separate them from the children in their care without prior discussion. They also denied claims their membership of UKIP affected their treatment of the children. The wife said: ‘We were actively encouraging these children to speak their own language and  to teach us their language. We enjoyed singing one of their folk songs in their native language. ‘These children have now been placed with families who are also white British. How are these  people going to meet the cultural needs of these children?’ The Equality and Human Rights Commission said the decision may have breached the parents’ right to freedom of political opinion. Mr Woolfenden was not available for comment. In a statement, Rotherham council announced an immediate investigation and said: ‘Membership of a political party should not stop someone fostering children.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband called for an urgent probe. by Michael Gove, Education Secretary . Appeal: Education Secretary Michael Gove wants more parents from every background to come forward to adopt . I know how important it is  to ensure you choose the right family to look after a child who has been in care. Because I was a child in care. And I was brought up by the right family. Because  I was adopted. My mum and dad did an amazing job, providing me with love and security, enabling me to enjoy wonderful opportunities. I can never adequately repay them. But one of the ways in which I’m trying is my work to reform our care system. As Education Secretary I’m responsible for Government policy on child protection, children in care, adoption and fostering. Just last week I laid out how big a job we face to get things right. If we needed any reminder of what we’re up against then yesterday’s reports from Rotherham powerfully demonstrate just how much change is needed, because children still don’t come first. For years now, child protection has been crippled by politically correct attitudes that put the interests and ideologies of adults ahead of the needs of children. On the one hand, we leave children with abusive and neglectful parents for too long, as the case of ‘Baby P’ Peter Connelly exemplifies. On the other hand, we don’t welcome and support people who want  to adopt or foster effectively enough. So neglected children are not rescued sufficiently early or placed in loving homes sufficiently quickly. A particular problem has been the way in which rules on ethnicity, race and culture have been applied. When it comes to adoption the perfect has been the enemy of the good. Social workers have put the need to find a perfect ethnic or cultural ‘match’ for children in care ahead of the pressing need to find those children a loving home. So children from black and minority ethnic backgrounds spend longer in care, and get adopted later, than others. We know that the earlier a child  is adopted the better, so these  PC attitudes, allegedly designed to help children, only end up harming them. And that is why the decision by Rotherham council to take a child away  from loving and successful foster parents for ‘cultural’ reasons – because they were members of UKIP – is so especially harmful. It sends a signal to those who want to foster or adopt that they’re not wanted if their attitudes fall outside a tightly circumscribed and politically approved set of views. That’s offensive to any idea of  a genuinely liberal society and a tragedy at a time when we need more parents to foster and adopt. And it’s why we are changing the law to stop ethnic and cultural considerations being put ahead of a child’s need for early adoption. I want more parents from every background – gay or straight, black or white, Left or Right – to come forward to adopt because there are so many children whose lives will be transformed immeasurably for the better if they are enfolded in the loving arms of kind parents. It is also an immensely rewarding choice to make. Adoption means taking a  child not just into your home  but into your heart. It is a relationship which is – in  every sense – for good. And there is no more generous  gift you can give a damaged, neglected or abused child  than a fresh start.

'My son and Zsi were wonderfully . creative and sensitive individuals who lived life to the full and . enjoyed being in Clapham Common with their dog Ollie,' she said. 'Joe had worked at Lots Road . Auctions, Chelsea, as valuer and cataloguer for rugs and carpets since . leaving the Slade School of Art in the mid-nineties, when he graduated. 'Zsi  met Joe at  Lots Road Auctions, . after graduating from Kingston College of Art. She exhibited her silk . screen prints and etchings under the name of Zsi Chimera. Her most . recent exhibition in Britain was at the Smokehouse Gallery, Hackney. She said that would be 'sadly missed by their families, and work colleagues and their many, many good friends.' Yvonne Rennie's husband Michael, 49,  escaped the burning basket by jumping 10ft to the ground but then was forced to watch as his wife plunged to her death. Today he issued a statement saying 'Yvonne was my rock, my friend, my . shoulder to cry on. She was my world. My heartfelt condolences go out to . the other families that have lost relatives around the world in this . terrible disaster.' The construction worker is being . treated in Cairo for burns on his body and was found sobbing in hospital . as the realisation set in that he had lost his wife. Tragedy: Michael Rennie watched his wife Yvonne plunge to her death in a horrifying hot air balloon disaster . Happier times: The Rennie couple are their wedding day. Michael Rennie screamed helplessly 'My wife!' as the burning basket rose higher in the sky once he jumped out . Desperate: With severe burns on his body, he then helplessly ran along a 200 metre dirt track, pictured, to a group of houses to raise the alarm . Survivor: Michael Rennie was airlifted to hospital after he survived the blaze which killed his wife Yvonne . The Egyptian pilot, whose clothes were on fire, leapt out just before Mr Rennie and was the only other survivor. Mr Rennie ran 250 yards along a track chasing the balloon screaming ‘My wife. My wife’. But . he could only watch in horror as the doomed craft rose rapidly into the . skies and exploded at 1,000ft above Luxor, then plummeted to the ground . along with its passengers. Mr Rennie called her Yvonne's father Michael Harris as well as his own father John, 80. Mr Harris told The Sun: 'He’s a broken man. He broke down when he spoke to me and apologised. 'Nightmare doesn’t describe it.' Mr Harris told how he believed it was his daughter that had dragged Mr Rennie on to the hot air balloon - he said she was a daredevil who enjoyed an adventure. Leapt out: The Egyptian pilot, Momen Morad whose clothes were on fire, leapt out just before Mr Rennie and was the only other survivor . Speaking in Britain he said he was . desperate to know about the last moments of his daughter's life and said . it was possible the couple who married in 2007 had been put in different parts of . the basket to distribute weight evenly. Mr Harris added: 'I took her to the airport — I just wish I had brought her home.' The newspaper also revealed that yesterday the balloon's pilot asked his mother about the death toll as he lay in his hospital bed. Moaman Abdo, 27, who was left with 70 per cent burns told his mother: 'I can’t believe it, I saw people dying, please tell me no one died.' Egypt’s Civil Aviation Minister Wael El-Maadawi revealed last night that Mr Adbo leapt from the balloon without shutting off the gas valve to the burner. Today Tour operator Thomas Cook defended its Egypt balloon trip arrangements amid safety concerns. Tuesday's flight, was booked with Sky Cruises by a ground agent, Bright Sky Travel, which Thomas Cook contracts to provide various excursions in Egypt.

Bodies: Medical workers in Cairo with the bodies of those who were killed in the tragic accident . This morning it was revealed that other . balloon owners operating in the area were claiming that Bright Sky . Travel had a reputation for maximising its margins and starving them of . cash. Ala Mahmoud, head of Egyptian balloon . company Magic Horizon, accused Thomas Cook of 'not being professional' in its dealings with Bright Sky. He told the Independent newspaper . that when Thomas Cook hired Bright Sky as its agent three years ago, his . company had been invited to bid for a contract to provide balloon . flights over Luxor. He refused after being offered the equivalent of £35 for every £70 ticket. Mr Mahmoud said: 'The problem is they . are taking so much money. It means the balloon company may not be . looking for safety or quality, they are just looking for quantity.' Today Thomas Cook said it insisted . that local companies offering balloon trips were fully licensed by . Egypt's aviation authority. The company added that Sky Cruises had been 'verified and approved by the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority'. The same balloon, operated by Sky Cruise, had been involved in another crash less than 18 months ago, it was revealed yesterday. Air balloon crash: The events leading up to the crash that killed 19 people . Video footage shot in October 2011 . showed the balloon narrowly missing a hotel roof in Luxor before . plunging into the Nile. Luckily, all the passengers on board that flight . escaped with nothing worse than bruising. Yesterday Sky Cruise produced paperwork showing the balloon was checked and certified airworthy in October 2012. Tuesday’s tragedy is believed to have . happened near the end of the dawn flight, after a landing rope became . entangled with a helium gas tube, severing it and sparking a fire. Mohamed Youssef Mohamed, 27, a pilot for Magic Horizon balloons, was on his own balloon at the time. ‘One of my tourists on board pointed . out that the balloon appeared to have caught fire on the right-hand . side,’ he said. ‘It was just two or three metres from the ground and was . about to land but the pilot was quickly engulfed in flames and flung . himself out of the basket. ‘Seconds later, on the other edge of . the basket, the British survivor jumped out. By the time it reached 70 . metres I saw four people fall – I’m not sure if they jumped or if the . basket opened due to the fire. This was all before the sound of the gas . explosion.’ The whole incident took a little over . two minutes. Another witness, a holiday worker called Mohamed, said: ‘It . was a horrific sight. The scene was pure hysteria. The pilot Momen . Murad was a professional with around 10 years of experience flying hot . air balloons and was well known in Luxor as a skilled flier.’ The green hot air balloon can be seen as it took off, before exploding and plunging to earth in Egypt . Before the blaze: This picture shows the basket carrying tourists that exploded and plunged to earth . An investigation is underway by Egyptian authorities and all balloon flights have been grounded. Ahmed Mohamed Al Yemeni, Luxor’s . deputy public prosecutor  who is in charge of investigating the . incident, said: ‘Investigators are searching for evidence of a technical . malfunction of a gas canister used. It appears likely the gas was . largely responsible for the accident.’ Yesterday Mr Rennie’s brother David . complained that he had ‘not been told anything’ by Thomas Cook, the tour . operator used by the four Britons. He said he could not speak about the . disaster until he had seen his brother, who works for a construction . company, but the family ‘were grieving for our loss of Yvonne’. This sequence shows the moment the hot-air balloon exploded during the sightseeing trip, killing 19 tourists . Mrs Rennie joined the radiology department of Perth Royal Infirmary as an appointments officer in June 2006. Radiology manager Douglas Mitchell said: ‘We are in shock at the sudden and tragic loss of Yvonne. ‘She was a much-loved colleague who . enjoyed her job and her tragic passing has had a huge impact on all of . us who knew and worked with her. She will be sadly missed.’ Mr Bampton . and Miss Gyetvai both worked for Lots Road Auctions in Chelsea. They were described by their neighbours as ‘a quiet, lovely couple’. Grim: The site of a balloon crash where the remains of the burned gondola are seen. In total nineteen tourists were killed after the hot air balloon exploded and came down in a ball of flames . Investigation: An Egyptian inspector of the Civil Aviation Authority walks among the wreckage. Shocked eye-witnesses told yesterday how the pilot and a number of passengers jumped from balloon at around 300ft as it was being towed into land and hit a power line .

He was born on April 8 with a cleft palate, conjoined kidneys, a small jaw, and cysts in his brain. Jasper Holt was born with a condition that doctors have never seen before - they have dubbed it 'Jasper's syndrome' Jasper, pictured with parents Jeffery Holt and Gemma Moorby, was born on April 8 with a cleft palate, conjoined kidneys, a small jaw, and cysts in his brain . A cleft palate - he will see cleft palate specialists this week . A small jaw . Brain cysts - he is to have an MRI scan this week . Conjoined kidneys - he had surgery at one-day-old to have his kidneys separated . At just one day old he had to undergo surgery to reconstruct his lower abdomen and separate his kidneys. ‘We were initially told [before he was born] that he had a brain development problem called lissencephaly,’ said his father, Jeffrey Holt. ‘However, subsequent scans showed that wasn't the case and what was wrong was basically unknown. ‘When he was born his heart and kidneys were working fine but he was put straight on a ventilator. ‘He has a cleft palate and his kidneys were shaped like a horseshoe because they had not separated.’ Jasper, who is now one-week-old, was born at Newcastle's Victoria Royal Infirmary, weighing 5lb 2oz. Mr Holt and Jasper's mother Gemma Moorby, 26, have now been told he is most likely suffering from a chromosomal abnormality. Jasper, pictured with his parents and brother, Oscar, is most likely suffering from a chromosomal abnormality . Mr Holt said: ‘They have been doing lots of tests but it could be years before we find out which chromosome has been affected. ‘Doctors have said it could be that it is totally unique and have named it “Jasper Syndrome”. ‘He came off the ventilator a few days after he was born but a scan that night showed he had cysts on his brain. ‘He also had a bit of a setback on the same day and had to have a little bit of oxygen. Next week we will see the cleft palate team and he will have an MRI.’ At just one-day old he had to undergo surgery to reconstruct his lower abdomen and separate his kidneys .

Mr Holt, of Barrow, Cumbria, explained how a routine ante-natal scan turned their world upside down and saw them travel 117 miles to Newcastle. The 31-year-old said: ‘We were told that Jasper had problems with his kidneys and brain. It was devastating. Days later we had to go to the hospital in Newcastle. It has been a total nightmare.’ Ms Moorby was under the care of the couple’s local Furness General maternity unit until the baby’s condition was discovered and she was referred to Newcastle. Mr Holt said: ‘They made such a difference. They explained everything to us and have been great in helping us understand what was going on. ‘We can't thank them enough for their care.’","Jasper Holt was born at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on April 8 .

The 60-year-old married son of sex research pioneers Masters and Johnson has admitted to masturbating in New York City’s Central Park, in what would be his first of two arrests this year for public exposure. William H. Masters III pleaded guilty on Monday to misdemeanour public lewdness following his May arrest that was just 25 feet from a public walkway. A New York police officer reported seeing him expose his genitals and masturbate in an area of the park called the Ramble that's known for homosexual liaisons. Guilty William H. Johnson II, pictured, has pleaded guilty to masturbating in public after caught by a police officer in New York's Central Park earlier this year . 'The defendant intentionally exposed the . private parts of his body in a lewd manner and committed a lewd act in a . public place... with intent that he be so observed,' a police complaint . read. Defense lawyer Irwin Rochman tells the New York Post his client has since been in counselling. Masters is avoiding jail time but if the Southampton resident gets arrested again he'll face up to 90 days in jail. Masters' father was part of the Masters . and Johnson sex research team. He and Virginia Johnson conducted . interviews and observed sex acts. They wrote the 1966 best-seller 'Human . Sexual Response.' Found: An officer allegedly discovered him masturbating nude 25 feet from a public walkway . Masters also is charged with exposing himself to a sheriff's deputy and another woman on a Michigan river in September. That case is pending. Police say Master exposed himself to two female undercover police officers as they passed by his exclusive summer home in Michigan that month. Given his previous history, officials in Michigan planned to canvass the area surrounding the posh summer homes in the Pointe aux Barques where he was caught, showing local women photographs of him in an attempt to link him to a previous plague of flashing incidents. Parents: Masters is the son of renouned sex researcher Dr William H. Masters, right, and Virginia E. Johnson, left, who studied human sexual response, dysfunction and disorders . Charged with aggravated indecent . exposure, Masters was released on $5,000 bail and is . facing two years in jail for the incident, which officers say was only . the latest in a string of debaucherous deeds in the area. Police told the MailOnline that Masters III was arrested that Saturday near his family's lux vacation cottage. This was his first arrest in the county. 'One thing is for certain, future ""free stylists"" need to take note that their actions will not be tolerated.'Sheriff Kelly Hanson . 'It’s a very rich, wealthy gated community,' explained a local source to the New York Post, 'with cottages built by families like [tire magnate] Harvey Firestone.' Masters III was nude on the banks of the Pinnebog River at the Port Crescent State Park Day use area in Hume Township when two female kayakers paddled by. Officers claim he 'yelled for attention' from his perch on a nearby dune and then proceeded to make 'obscene gestures' at the women when they looked his way. The boaters, however, were part of a . 'combined law-enforcement-agency sting operation, working out of a . two-person kayak on the river.' The . officers beached their kayak and chased after Masters III, calling for . backup from a Michigan conservation officer to help in their pursuit.

Stung: Officers claim he 'yelled for attention' from his perch on a nearby dune and then proceeded to make 'obscene gestures' at the women when they looked his way. He was arrested near his summer home in nearby Pointe aux Barques . They eventually collared him and arraigned him on Wednesday for the felony charges. 'This sting operation was prompted by many incidents over the years such as yesterday’s,' Sheriff Kelly J. Hanson said. 'A lot of law enforcement time, effort and resources have been expended over the years on this non-sense. This was not our first operation and will not be our last.' He added that in the past two weeks alone, there have been four such incidents. Dr . William H. Masters and Mrs. Virginia E. Johnson were the co-authors of . the controversial books 'Human Sexual Response' and 'Human Sexual . Inadequacy'. Both books were best-sellers and have been translated into 30 languages. Together they founded an independent not-for-profit research institution . in 1964, originally called the Reproductive Biology Research Foundation . and renamed the Masters & Johnson Institute in 1978. Their work was essential to the study of sexual dysfunction, sexual disorders and human sexual response. Among . their most high-profile studies, they investigated the nature of female . orgasm, specifically the physiology of clitoral and vaginal arousal, as . well as the difference between the two, dispelling long standing . misconceptions. 'One thing is for certain, future ""free stylists"" need to take note that their actions will not be tolerated,' he said. There have been numerous incidents reported to police over the past five years, but there have only been two arrests so far. 'We are a community of about 31,000 people and we take offense to behavior like this,' Sheriff Hanson said. Masters III, who divides his time between Manhattan and Southampton, is the son of William H. Masters and Virginia E.

'Excellent example to other candidates': European Commissioner for Enlargement Stefan Fuele said Croatia had met the EU's expectations . The European Commission gave Croatia a clean bill of health yesterday, meaning the Baltic country will join the EU from July. Marking the end of Zagreb’s decade-long effort to join mainstream Europe, European Union Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fuele said Croatia had met expectations. 'Croatia has fulfilled all the conditions for joining ... I think it is an excellent example to other candidate countries,' Mr Fuele told a Croatian government session where he presented the final monitoring report. Croatia will be the bloc’s first new member since Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007. The other EU hopefuls in the Balkans - Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, and Kosovo - have yet to start entry talks. Zagreb concluded EU accession talks in June 2011 and will join on July 1, once its accession treaty has been ratified by all current 27 members. In the past two years, the government was required to complete the restructuring and sale of its ailing shipyards and resolve a banking dispute with Slovenia. While the Commission’s report was largely positive about Croatia’s readiness to become the 28th EU member, its language on fighting organised crime was less glowing. It said Croatia’s legal framework to deal with organised crime and corruption was adequate, but some changes to the legal system had not been fully implemented or were being used half-heartedly. Croatia needed to use tougher sentencing to deter crime, the report said, noting that convicted criminals often face only suspended sentences. An EU official said the Commission would watch corruption, but the bloc was convinced Croatia was on the right path. Tkalcica street in Zagreb, the Croatian capital: Croatia is the first Balkan country to enter the EU. Other nations in the region - Serbia, Macedonia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Albania, and Kosovo - have yet to start entry talks . An early-morning view of Dubrovnik harbour, . Croatia: While the Commission's report was largely positive about . Croatia's readiness to become the 28th EU member, its language on . fighting organised crime was less glowing . Situated at the crossroads of Central Europe, the Balkans and the Mediterranean, Croatia was formerly a part of the Socialist Federal Republic Yugoslavia. The country, which covers 21,851 square miles, is divided into 20 counties and the city of Zagreb and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. It has a population of 4.28million, most of whom are Croats, and mostly Roman Catholic. Croatia today has a very high Human Development Index. The International Monetary Fund classified Croatia as an emerging and developing economy, and the World Bank identified it as a high income economy. The service sector dominates the country's economy, followed by the industrial sector and agriculture, with tourism being a significant source of revenue during the summer. It is already a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, NATO, and the World Trade Organisation. 'We believe that the process itself . has been solid and credible, and that the process that has started in . Croatia is irreversible,' the official said. He . said the situation in Croatia was different to Romania and Bulgaria, . whose efforts to fight corruption and improve the rule of law are still . under European Commission monitoring. Croatia, like Romania and Bulgaria, will not automatically become a member of the passport-free Schengen zone. However Croats will have the right to seek work in other EU member states, unless they impose a restriction of up to seven years like they did in 2007. The seven-year restrictions on the movement of Romanians and Bulgarians in the European Union are due to expire at the beginning of 2014. Although EU countries could request Croatia be given the same type of seven-year movement restrictions, EU officials said no country had made that request. The Commission report will be presented to EU countries for approval, as well as the European Parliament, which will discuss Croatia on April 18.","Croatia will be the bloc's first new member since 2007 and joins July 1 .

The deadly serious case of ricin-laced letters being sent to President Barack Obama, a U.S. Senator and a local judge has turned into a bizarre tale of a southern-fried feud between two Mississippi men who are both reportedly MENSA members, taekwondo experts and musicians. Each man says the other is crazy. Kevin Curtis, the Elvis impersonator charged with sending the poison letters last week, says he may have been framed by J. Everett Dutschke, an accused child molester, martial arts instructor and political candidate with whom he has been rivals for several years. Federal authorities on Tuesday dropped all charges against Curtis and spent several hours searching Dustschke's house in Tupelo, Mississippi. Dutschke addressed the media and denied he sent the ricin letters. While the comedic drama plays out in a series of baffling TV interviews given by both sides, the FBI remains mum about its investigation - and how agents managed to nab the wrong suspect and hold him for nearly a week. Scroll down for video . Southern-fried feud: J Everett Dutschke, left, and Kevin Curtis, right, are both caught up in the federal investigation over poison letters sent to the president. They are both also martial arts rivals . Sweet relief: Paul Kevin Curtis, who had been in custody under suspicion of sending ricin-laced letters to President Obama and others, left, hugs his attorney Christi McCoy during a news conference following his release Tuesday . Defending himself: Dutschke told reporters he had no involvement in the ricin case as authorities combs through his house on Tuesday . Dutschke has not been named as a suspect by authorities and has not been arrested. However, he admitted a longstanding animosity with Curtis. Dutschke says he is a member of MENSA, the society for high-IQ individuals. Curtis claims to be a member of the group, as well. 'He is not a MENSA member,' Dutschke emphatically said as federal agents and hazmat crews combed his house. 'The certificate he posted online is a lie.' During a strange and rambling press conference on Tuesday, Curtis said Dutschke 'hates him.' He offered several reasons why. 'I don't if it’s a martial arts kind of conflict and he thinks you’re better than him and he wants to challenge you in the rink. I don’t know,' he said. Both men are trained in the Korean martial art of taekwondo and they agreed to a showdown at a local martial arts studio in Tupelo. 'At one point on the phone I did say, ""If you wanna meet somewhere just you and I..."" and he said, ""Taekwondo Plus, Main Street."" I said, ""I’ll be there in 20 minutes."" 'Framed': Kevin Curtis, who works as an Elvis impersonator, may have been set up by a man who was once his brother's business partner, his lawyer says . Accused: J Everett Dutschke, right, had his home raided by federal agents on Tuesday after Curtis lawyer alleged he might be behind the ricin attack. He is seen here with Senator Roger Wicker . Denial: Dutschke has said he had nothing to do with the ricin attacks and is a 'patriotic American' 'I drove there. He wasn’t there. Then he sent me an email, ""Come back tomorrow at 7 and the results of you being splattered all over the pavement for all the world to see what a blank blank blank blank you are."" And then at that point I knew that I was dealing with a coward.' Both men are also musicians. Dutschke plays blues guitar and has released several albums under the name Dusty and the Robodrum. Curtis tours across the south as an Elvis impersonator. It's all nonsense, Dutschke told reporters on Tuesday. 'He’s crazy. He’s just a little nutty. I don’t have a relationship with him,' Dutschke said. Curtis, for his part, said Dutschke is 'delusional.' In a CNN interview on Tuesday, Curtis' lawyer Christi McCoy said her client has mental issues. Federal authorities wanted to have him evaluated for competency before trying him in court. Curtis heaped praise on his lawyer for fighting for him and ensuring he was quickly exonerated. 'In the jungle of the law and court, you have monkeys, you have kangaroos and you have lions. She was the lion queen. She was just amazing,' he told CNN's Piers Morgan. 'I've never heard of ricin or whatever. I thought they said rice. I told them I don't eat rice,' Curtis said at a press conference Tuesday, describing the moment he was questioned by federal authorities. McCoy said whoever framed her client was able to lead the FBI to his door simply by including Curtis' catch-phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message' and a few other clues in the threatening notes that were mailed to Washington. Musician: Kevin Curtis works as an Elvis impersonator and performs music for a living. He once performed for Senator Roger Wicker, one of the politicians who received ricin in the mail . McCoy suggested in court on Monday that . federal authorities should instead investigate Dutschke. She later told CNN that federal agents have not recovered any physical evidence tying Curtis to the poisoned letters. On Tuesday afternoon, six days after Curtis was arrested, the U.S. Attorney dropped terrorism charges against him. He had been accused of sending letters laces with the deadly poison ricin to the offices of Obama, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland. 'I respect President Obama. I love my country and would never do anything to pose a threat to him or any other U.S. official,' Curtis said Tuesday. McCoy suggested in federal court on Monday that Dutschke is one of the men who the FBI should investigate in the ricin case. Dutschke, she said, is a former friend . of Curtis and that the two had a falling out over a book Curtis wrote . called 'Missing Pieces.' On . Friday afternoon ten local officers and federal agents raided Dutschke's house in Tupelo . and searched it. Dutschke denied any involvement in the ricin case on . Tuesday. 'I'm a patriotic American. I don't have any grudges against anybody. I did not send the letters,' Dutschke said. He said he was asked to take a lie detector and that police had previously questioned him as well. Dutschke and Curtis are both musicians, are both politically active and are both heavily interested in martial arts. Dutske was arrested early this year and charged with molesting three girls - including a teenager he 'touched' between 2007 and 2011, an eight-year-old girl and a seven-year-old girl. He has not yet stood trial for the charges and is free after posting $25,000 bail. Found nothing: Curtis' lawyer said that despite extensive searches of his home, federal agents did not recover any physical evidence linking Curtis to the ricin letters . McCoy said that whoever framed her client dropped obvious clues that led federal investigators to arrest Curtis. Curtis made several posts on Facebook about the 'organ donation industry.' He signed each of his posts with the phrase 'I'm KC and I approve this message.' He also authored a book on organ donation called 'Missing Pieces.' The poison-laced notes included a reference to the book, as well. A day earlier, FBI Agent Brandon Grant . testified searches on Friday of Curtis' vehicle and house in Corinth, . Mississippi, found no ricin, ingredients for the poison, or devices used . to make it. A search of Curtis' computers found no evidence he . researched making ricin. 'There . was no apparent ricin, castor beans or any material there that could be . used for the manufacturing, like a blender or something,' Grant . testified. He speculated that Curtis could have thrown away the . processor. McCoy believes the only explanation is that somebody else set her client up. 'It's horrific that somebody would do this, but yes, I believe that's what happened,' McCoy said. Still, Grant testified that authorities believed they have the right suspect. 'Given the right mindset and the Internet and the acquisition of material, other people could be involved. However, given information right now, we believe we have the right individual,' he said. Suspect: The FBI has arrested a suspect accused of sending letters laced with ricin to President Obama, pictured on Wednesday, and a Mississippi senator . Hound dog: Curtis posted hordes of pictures on his Myspace page showing him from the 1980s and 90s . Grant said lab analysis shows the poison in the letters was in a crude form that could have been created by grinding castor beans in a food processor or coffee grinder. Grant testified Friday that authorities tried to track down the sender of the letters by using a list of Wicker's constituents with the initials KC, the same initials in the letters. Grant said the list was whittled from thousands to about 100 when investigators isolated the ones who lived in an area that would have a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark, which includes many places in north Mississippi. He said Wicker's staff recognized Curtis as someone who had written the senator before. All the envelopes and stamps were self-adhesive, Grant said Monday, meaning they won't yield DNA evidence. He said thus far the envelopes and letters haven't yielded any fingerprints.","Kevin Curtis was set free on Tuesday after the FBI arrested him last week based on clues included in the poison letters sent to three politicians .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 16:55 EST, 18 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:10 EST, 18 May 2012 . The war in Afghanistan will end up costing taxpayers £20billion, it emerged last night. At a Nato summit in Chicago, David Cameron and other world leaders will tomorrow draw up a firm timetable for pulling combat troops off the frontline against the Taliban. But official figures show that the war had already cost £17.3billion by the end of March this year on top of regular defence spending since 2001. About tiem: A firm timetable will be drawn up to withdraw troops from Afghanistan - but it has already hit taxpayers hard . The true cost of the war was revealed by the House of Commons Library and will be formally published by the Ministry of Defence later this year. It puts Britain on course for a bill approaching £20billion by the time British troops hand over responsibility for combat operations in Helmand province. A total of 414 British servicemen have lost their lives in the country, more than 20 of them at the hands of the Afghan security forces they are supposed to be training to take over. The Government has said British troops will have ended combat operations by the end of December 2014. But Mr Cameron has also signalled that a large number of troops will pull back from the frontline and begin coming home next year. [caption . British troop numbers will fall from 9,500 to 9,000 this year and that number is expected to halve during 2013. Mr Cameron will use the Nato summit to demand that other countries help shoulder some of the costs of the conflict as Western military involvement winds down. In an article published yesterday, Mr Cameron said countries that had not sent troops should shoulder their share of costs since the world’s leading economies had paid a disproportionate amount. ‘Today the G8 accounts for four-fifths of the donor funding now going to the region,’ he said. ‘We must encourage other countries to step up and contribute to the future of Afghanistan, irrespective of the role they have played so far.’ But the most pressing issue to be discussed at the Chicago summit will be to ensure that Western governments launch a co-ordinated withdrawal. The Prime Minister and President Barack Obama will ask the new French President, Francois Hollande, to ditch his election pledge to withdraw France’s 3,300 troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year. Mr Hollande has already watered down his pledge. He now talks about withdrawing combat troops, rather than all troops, by the end of the year. But French officials have made it clear that he is likely to want all troops home during the early part of 2013. British commanders are concerned that an early French withdrawal will put pressure on Britain and the US to fill the gaps left behind. The National Security Council in London has also discussed warnings that failure to leave in an orderly and co-ordinated manner would leave British troops at greater risk of attack as they pull out. The UK has been in talks with neighbouring Uzbekistan about pulling soldiers out across that land border. Removing lots of heavy equipment will add to the costs of the war. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said the huge costs of the Afghan operation made an orderly withdrawal all the more important. ‘After the lives sacrificed and the money spent, it is vital that withdrawal does not lead to the return of the conditions which led us to war,’ he added. ‘Withdrawal must be internationally co-ordinated and we need a renewed focus on the safety of British personnel before and beyond 2014.’","War has already cost £17.3billion .

A fourth suspect has been arrested concerning the alleged forced labor of a mentally disabled woman held captive with her young daughter, according to federal prosecutors in Ohio. Dezerah Silsby, 21, appeared in court on Thursday afternoon after turning herself in and denied that she helped threaten, beat and force the woman to do the suspects housework for two years. Mentally-disabled Shannon Eckley and . her five-year-old daughter were held in 'modern-day slavery' for two . years by the four suspects in northeast Ohio who abused them and kept them in . line with venomous snakes and pit bulls. Scroll down for video . An FBI affidavit says Dezerah Silsby, 21, admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from their relative's house to captivity . The two victims were kept her in a room with a free-ranging iguana and ordered her to feed the reptile fruits and vegetables her daughter was denied, according to court papers. 'The living conditions were simply subhuman,' said Steven Dettelbach, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio. The mother and daughter were sometimes forced to eat dog food, according to a law enforcement source with first-hand knowledge of the investigation. They were also frequently denied access to the bathroom, FBI Special Agent Eric Smith told reporters on Tuesday. Jessica Hunt, 31, and Jordie Callahan, 26 are accused of keeping Shannon Eckley as a slave for two years - threatening her and milking her of government benefits . An FBI affidavit says Silsby, 21, . admitted she used ice cream to lure the woman and her daughter from . their relative's house to captivity. In . addition, the affidavit says, Silsby smashed the woman's hand with a . rock so she could go to a hospital and bring back pain medication for . the suspects. Silsby . was released after her brief court appearance on Thursday and ordered . her to stay in contact with the probation office while awaiting trial. She entered a not guilty plea and left the courthouse without commenting. Defense attorney Jennifer Scott said Silsby isn't capable of the crimes detailed in the allegations. ‘She . has not done these things,’ Scott said outside court. ‘In the course of . the process of the justice system I believe the true facts will come to . light.’ Silsby, . married with a 3-year-old and pregnant, has a demeanor and personality . ‘not of the type to manipulate and force individuals into the types of . accusations that are being made,’ Scott said. Threats: The suspects are accused of threatening to make their snakes and their pit bulls attack Eckley and her daughter if she didn't do their bidding . The other suspects, Jordie Callahan, 26, . Jessica Hunt, 31, and Daniel J. ‘DJ’ Brown, 33, all of Ashland, about . 60 miles southwest of Cleveland, were jailed to await a bond hearing on . Monday. They were arrested Tuesday, and Silsby surrendered in Ashland on Wednesday. The attorney for Hunt said she will plead not guilty. The attorneys for Callahan and Brown declined to comment. Callahan's . mother, Becky Callahan, said that the allegations were ‘all lies.’ She . said that the woman was friends with her son and Hunt, her son's . girlfriend, and that they tried to help the woman by offering her a . place to live. Beginning . in early 2011, the suspects forced the woman to cooperate with them by . threats and physical abuse, federal prosecutors said. The . woman told authorities she was forced to do housework by the suspects, . who she said raided her bank account and menaced her with snakes and pit . bulls. The woman and . her daughter, who's 5-years-old, were freed in October after police . investigated an abuse allegation one of the suspects made against her. Callahan is seen with one of the massive pythons he owned and used to threaten Shannon Eckley . The Ashland case has dark similarities to last month's revelation in Cleveland that three women had been keep captive for a decade . Daniel Brown is accused of aiding Hunt and Callahan . Police . first got involved when the woman was arrested on a candy bar . shoplifting case and asked to be jailed because people had been mean to . her. Authorities said . the abuse allegation was a ruse complete with a video staged by the . suspects. They said the suspects had forced the woman to act as if she . were mistreating her child. The . woman later pleaded guilty to child endangering and was sentenced in . February to about five months in jail. She served only part of that . sentence. Between May . 2011 and October 2012, Eckley and her daughter were locked in the . basement of an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, and forced to do housework . and look after Hunt's four children. All the while, Callahan and Hunt stole her government benefits and used the money on themselves, authorities say. Eckley's enslavement bears chilling . similarity to the case of Ariel Castro, the man who was charged last . month with kidnapping three woman and keeping them against their will in . his house for ten years while he repeatedly raped, beat and emotionally . tortured them. Castro's house of horrors is located in Cleveland, Ohio, 65miles northeast of Ashland. Federal charges allege Callahan and Hunt also repeatedly beat Eckley and her toddler daughter. When they were not beating them to keep them in line, they used their pets. The pair kept a poisonous coral snake, a ball python and a Burmese python that weighed 130 pounds as well as lizards, spiders, scorpions and 'numerous' dogs - including pit bulls. The pair used these pets to terrify and menage Eckley and her young daughter - threatening to turn them loose on the captives if they didn't behave. Callahan and Hunt live together and allegedly worked together to abuse Eckley . Hunt, who works at Wendy's, is seen handling a snake, as well. The coupled owned numerous pets that they allegedly looked after better than Eckley . Callahan and Hunt have four children who Eckley was forced to clean up after . Callahan allegedly used dogs to threaten Eckley, as well . Callahan posted numerous photos on . his Facebook page of he and Hunt handling the creatures. One picture . shows a snake coiled around a rat. Another shows Callahan apparently . feeding a live chicken to his massive Burmese python. Callahan also allegedly used a gun to threaten Eckley on one occasion, as well. Callahan . and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May . 2011. Authorities allege she arrived in a living hell. Once she moved . in, the pair began treating her as a slave. They . initially locked her in the basement and forced her to sleep on the . concrete floor without a mattress. They deprived her of food - while . lavishing attention on their animals. The pair allegedly harvested the money Eckley received from government benefits and used the money for themselves. They also used her to get drugs. In December 2011, Callahan allegedly bashed Eckley's hand with a rock. He then took her to a doctor - leaving her child at the apartment - and told her to request a prescription for Valium. Once she got the narcotics, Callahan and Hunt used them for themselves. Callahan and Hunt invited Eckley and her daughter to come live with them in May 2011 . They executed the stunt a second time, as well. On that occasion, Callahan kicked Eckley in the hip. Brown is accused of aiding Callahan and Hunt by allegedly catching Eckley when she tried to escape. Authorities say he lied to her and said he would help her when he saw her outside the apartment. The couple also allegedly sent Eckley to the store to run errands, though they always kept kept her daughter at the house. In October 2012, on one of her trips to the store, Eckley was arrested for shoplifting after stealing a candy bar. She told police that she wanted to go jail because the people she lived with 'were mean to her.' The officer then questioned Callahan and Hunt, who showed him the video of Eckley beating her child. Eckley was arrested and charged, but further investigation revealed the the deplorable conditions she was living under, authorities say.","Shannon Eckley was kept for nearly two years in an apartment in Ashland, Ohio, starting in May 2011 .

Struggle: When TV comedian Lee Nelson pretended to steal his own DVD at a record-store signing last night, things didn't go quite to plan after a PCSO helped an actor restrain him . But after ending up on the busy street, south London tearaway Lee Nelson - a creation of comic Simon Brodkin - was spotted by a real police community support officer who mistook him for a shoplifter. He then became involved in trying to arrest the 'thief'. Shoppers looked on amazed and traffic came to a halt as a struggle took place. The three men rolled around in the middle of the road before the PCSO marched the comedian back into HMV and forced him to the ground. The store had been packed for a signing of Lee Nelson’s first DVD when the comedian - who is played by 35-year-old actor Simon Brodkin - carried out the stunt. But not all bystanders saw the funny side. Stunt: After 'stealing' the DVD, the BBC comedian sprinted out of HMV in central London's Oxford Street where an actor chased him along with a real PCSO who detained him . Shopper Richard Hampshire, 67, a retired civil servant, said: ‘I thought it was disgusting, a cheap stunt. ‘The PCSO was just doing his job and it was quite a dangerous situation. ‘They were wrestling in the middle of the road, there could have easily been an accident. ‘It was completely irresponsible and quite distressing - a lot of people thought it was a real incident.’ Mr Brodkin was last night in unapologetic mood. He posted a picture on Twitter of the incident, with the words, ‘HMV signing’s going well’. Asked to comment on the stunt, he issued a statement in the character of Lee Nelson, in which he said: ‘How can you get arrested for nicking your own DVD? ‘Mr Loophole lawyer, if you’re reading this, get me off and I’ll sort you out with the 20 other DVDs I took.’ Mr Brodkin, a former doctor who gave up his medical career to pursue work as a stand-up, stars in his own BBC Three show, Lee Nelson’s Well Good Show, and has written for and appeared with comedians Al Murray and Jason Manford. Scuffle: The three men rolled around in the middle of the road before the PCSO marched the comedian back into HMV and forced him to the ground . Scene: This is the store where the 'altercation' took place . A spokeswoman for Mr Brodkin said: ‘He . was doing a signing for his DVD at HMV in Oxford Street, and as a treat . for his fans he ‘stole’ one of his own DVDs, then was chased around the . store by an actor dressed up as a police officer. ‘Somehow they ended up out on the pavement, where a real police community support officer got involved, thinking it was a theft taking place. Promotion: Lee Nelson was plugging his first live stand up DVD . ‘Shoppers were looking on and buses were stopping, it was all very dramatic. ‘The community support officer brought him back into the store where it was explained that it hadn’t been a real theft taking place.’ The controversy comes after Mr Brodkin caused outrage on Sunday with a comment about Coventry Blitz just before he was due to perform in the town. He posted on the Lee Nelson Twitter account: ‘Just arrived in Coventry. They must be hoping it gets bombed again soon!’ Coming just days after the 72nd . anniversary of the city being reduced to rubble by the Luftwaffe, the . comment was met with fury by Coventry residents. A . spokesman for HMV said last night: ‘Lee was just having some fun with . some staged shots inside the store to promote his new DVD, but he got a . bit overexcited and ran outside as part of the act. ‘Unfortunately . there was a real PCSO there who wasn’t aware it was all staged, but he . was a really good sport and was fine after we explained. ‘If anyone was alarmed then we’re sorry, but most people there could see it was just a bit of a playful stunt.’ Scotland Yard said it was aware of the incident but declined to comment further.

But David Bowie yesterday published all the lyrics to his first album for ten years – in a newspaper advert. Typeset as four finely printed columns of text with his name at the end, the full-page advert in The Times marks the final bit of publicity ahead of tomorrow’s release of The Next Day. Bowie, 66, has also been publishing the lyrics on his Twitter page and on Facebook. David Bowie pictured with Tilda Swinton in the video of his new song The Stars (Are Out Tonight) But critics said that many would have flicked past the newspaper page without realising it actually contained all 17 new songs, which have titles such as Dirty Boys, Valentine’s Day and The Stars (Are Out Tonight). David Bowie's ad contained the lyrics of his songs including from his 1973 album Aladdin Sane . Steve Turner, a pop expert who has written extensively on Bowie, said: ‘It’s very avant garde. It’s very Bowie. It’s an advert, but with no reference to what the advert is about. ‘Having no line breaks also makes it more difficult to read.’ Some lyrics focus on the reclusive star’s stay in West Berlin from 1976 to 1979. There are also references to the writer Vladimir Nabokov, the Belgian poet Georges Rodenbach, and the American folk singers Pete Seeger and Joan Baez. Bowie officially announced the release of his album on his website on Friday. He even gave an explanation for his long hiatus from the music world. An official statement read: ‘In recent years radio silence has been broken only by endless speculation, rumour and wishful thinking .. a new record... who would have ever thought it, who’d have ever dreamed of it? ‘After all David is the kind of artist who writes and performs what he wants when he wants...when he has something to say as opposed to something to sell. ‘Today, he definitely has something to say.’ Dylan Jones is author of When Ziggy Played Guitar: David Bowie And Four Minutes That Shook The World . The response to David Bowie’s new album, . The Next Day, has been one of unshackled euphoria. Grown men who have . witnessed  a dozen Bowie ‘comebacks’  (I remember three in 1974 alone) have been treating the record as though it has some sort of magical, . transformative powers, preferring to ignore the fact his last two . records – Heathen, in 2002, and 2003’s Reality – were equally as good. Their enthusiasm is an expression of relief as much as anything – relief . that someone we have all invested so much emotional energy in over the . years can still deliver ‘the goods’. What is truly remarkable is yet more proof of Bowie’s (pretty much) innate ability to place himself in exactly the right place in any . contemporary pop cultural matrix. For instance, the videos for Where Are . We Now? and The Stars (Are Out Tonight) – unequivocally the two best . songs on the record, reminding you that Bowie still has an acute . commercial sense – are not just smart,  inventive and oddly . self-deprecating, they’re also perfect examples of Bowie’s ability to . wind narrative around him in a totally  age-appropriate way. Many of the reviews of The Next Day have indicated that this record breaks new ground for Bowie, which on occasion it does. Bowie’s own particular creative charabanc may have more wheels on it . than practically anyone else’s in the music industry, but he  hasn’t . reinvented it. A wheel is  still a wheel no matter how many times you . turn it. Consequently, you can hear echoes from many of his previous records on . The Next Day, everything from The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And . The Spiders From Mars (and in particular the Five Years drum coda on the . brilliantly histrionic You Feel So Lonely You Could Die), Heroes, . Lodger, Scary Monsters, The Buddha Of Suburbia and Outside as well as – . saliently – his last two albums. There are some seriously good tunes on the album, which is released . tomorrow, not least the beautiful anti-war I’d Rather Be High. Do we . really have to rely on a sexagenarian like Bowie to write the greatest . protest song of the new decade? Apparently we do. Personally, I think the album is two or three songs too long (there are 14 plus three additional tracks on the deluxe version) but then what . album isn’t these days? And I hardly think you can begrudge Bowie from . overloading his comeback album, having not released anything officially . for a decade. In the ten years since Bowie has been away, he has been more active than . at any time in his career. Or rather, we have all been active on his . behalf. In this vacuum has arisen one of the greatest mass cults of the . modern age. You may have thought Bowie was  a cult hero before he disappeared, but . since 2003 Bowieism has become even more of a religion than Presleyism. There have been dozens and dozens of newspaper articles, magazine . covers, exhibitions, anniversaries, homages, books (apologies), TV . specials and films. There’s even a plaque in Heddon Street in London’s West End to . commemorate the photo session for the Ziggy Stardust LP (and to which we . Bowiephiles all trooped, out of little but abject devotion). Back in 1974, Bowie released a ramshackle concert album called David . Live. He looked and sounded so tired, jaded and drug-addled, he later . said it should have been called David Bowie Is Alive And Well And Living . Only In Theory.

An Illinois man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months in prison for binding and blindfolding two of his children a year ago in a Wal-Mart parking lot in eastern Kansas in the belief they were possessed by demons. Adolfo Gomez, 53, also was ordered to serve 24 months of post-release supervision after his prison term ends, said Cheryl Wright Kunard, a spokeswoman for the Douglas County district attorney's office. Gomez and his wife, Deborah Gomez, were arrested June 13, 2012, in Lawrence after a woman saw a child bound and blindfolded near the family's vehicle. Scroll down for video... Sentenced: Adolfo Gomez, the Chicago-area man who bound and blindfolded two of his children in a Kansas parking lot in the belief they were possessed, will now go to jail for nearly three years . Adolfo Gomez (left) and his wife Deborah Gomez were arrested after police discovered two of their five children bound and blindfolded in the parking lot of a Walmart store in Kansas last year. Adolfo has been sentenced to 30 months in prison. Police reported finding two of their . children, ages 5 and 7, bound by their hands and feet in the store . parking lot, while three other children, ages 12, 13 and 15, were inside . the SUV unrestrained. Adolfo . Gomez pleaded no contest in December to felony child abuse and child . endangerment. Deborah Gomez was sentenced earlier to one year of . probation after pleading no contest to child endangerment. The . Gomezes told police they were in the parking lot because their vehicle . had broken down on Interstate 70 near Lawrence on their way to Arizona. Police Detective Randy Glidewell . testified that when he interviewed Adolfo Gomez on the day of his . arrest, the father said he had been listening to an online preacher . who was predicting the end of the world and that a 'darkness had come . over the house' where the family lived in Northlake, Illinois . Possessed: Deborah Gomez pleaded no contest previously and sentenced to one year of probation . Ranting: Adolfo Gomez is arrested in Lawrence, Kansas after tying up his children out of a belief that they were possessed . 'And [they said] the world was coming to an end, and that's why they left,' Glidewell said. The detective also said Adolfo Gomez . told him he hadn't slept in nine days, and that Gomez was particularly . concerned about one of the younger children. One . of the older children told police the family believed demons were in . their home and outside their SUV in the WalMart parking lot. The child also said  the family had . recently watched online videos about demons and 'a fallen angel'.

Found: Police spotted a boy, 5, on the ground beside a van (pictured) with his hands and legs tied up and a blindfold covering his eyes . The older daughter said they were . going to attempt to cast the demons out the younger children but did not . say how they planned to do that. The family had been . traveling from Illinois to see a family member in Arizona when their SUV . broke down on Interstate 70. They stopped in Lawrence and . were in the Walmart parking lot when Linda Baranski, 64, called the . police after seeing one of the bound children outside the vehicle in the . store's parking lot. She said the child was sitting 'flat on the cement, and . they were bound and I thought gagged, and they were rocking back and . forth'. 'Unusual': Police found the children's mother inside Walmart (pictured) shopping while her daughter, 7, was inside the car also bound and blindfolded . Problems: The family recently left their home in Illinois when they were forced to stop at the Walmart due to car problems on their way to Arizona .

But Mr Lock soon wished he had never set foot inside after a run-in with the branch’s ‘faulty’ sliding doors left him with a fractured hand. And despite being left severely shaken, the bank has not only failed to apologise, but a Barclays employee is said to have defiantly declared: ‘If you want any financial help or assistance then you will have to sue us.’ 85-year-old Bert Lock, from Bletchley fractured his hand after being trapped in sliding doors at Barclays . The incident happened last week, when Mr Lock visited Barclays in his home town of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, to collect some bank envelopes for friends so they could pay in cash. As Mr Lock, 85, left the bank, he became trapped in the doors and was thrown to the ground. His walking frame was badly damaged in the fall and he was later diagnosed with a fractured hand. Mr Lock said: ‘As I came out of the bank, the sliding doors started to close and I assumed the sensor would stop them. ‘But they just kept on coming and got faster and then crushed me and literally threw me on to the floor in a heap. I went down on my right hand very heavily and the doors broke the handbrake on my wheeled walking frame.’ Mr Lock said customers and staff quickly came to his rescue and he heard a member of staff shout: ‘Turn the doors off – they are not working’. Engineers have since been seen working on the doors. A taxi was called and Mr Lock went home where he sat alone in a ‘state of shock’ for the rest of the day.

Dunkin' Donuts is the latest chain to jump on the gluten-free bandwagon, with plans to unveil a new wheat-free range across U.S. stores this year. But while the gluten-free cinnamon sugar doughnut and blueberry muffin might help reduce bloating in sufferers of celiac disease, it won't do much for their overall weight. According to Boston.com, the retailer's cinnamon doughnut clocks in at 320 calories, compared with the 260 calories in a regular glazed doughnut. Although the gluten-free blueberry muffin is 400 calories - 60 calories less than the standard version. Dunkin' Donurts executive chief Stan Frankenthaler said the new range aims to target a broader range of consumers. 'We recognize the importance of providing our guests with many options, including alternative choices for people with food and dietary restrictions,' he said in an e-mail statement. The pastries will be packaged separately to avoid contamination from other foods that contain wheat flour. Less than 10 per cent of Americans have an intolerance to gluten, the major protein found in grains like wheat, barley and rye. About one per cent of Americans have celiac disease, where even small amounts of gluten can prompt severe discomfort. Another eight per cent have a mild reaction to gluten. However thousands of consumers have adopted gluten-free diets in recent years for the so-called 'health benefits', leaving the fast-food industry scrambling to keep up. Coffee retailer Dunkin' Donuts is known for its carbohydrate-dense foods including bagels, doughnuts and muffins made with wheat flour . Domino’s Pizza Inc.has gluten-free crusts and Chipotle has gluten-free options, while Starbucks is considering creating some gluten-free . items after it bought a bakery that sells organic breads last year, according to Bloomberg. Nancy Childs, a food marketing professor at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said more people are opting for wheat-free because they think it's better for them. 'The number of people who think they benefit from going gluten-free is growing,' she told Bloomberg. 'People feel that they are choosing a healthier alternative when they buy gluten-free fare.' Even so, a gluten-free label may . lure customers and help boost sales, according to data from researcher . Nielsen.

The ingenious idea was captured in a hilarious video by funnyman Fabrizio Goldstein aka 'The Fat Jew' in which he cites wanting the homeless people of New York to have the opportunity to have 'gorgeous bodies' as the reason for the venture. The bike share scheme kicked off in the Big Apple recently but, at nearly $10 a day, the cost of biking around Manhattan is almost as punitive as the $32 price of a sought-after Soul Cycle class. However, the fact the pedals still spin when the bikes are in the dock means CitiBike has 'opened up a whole new world' to the New York's poor, he says. Scroll down for video . Feel the burn: Fabrizio Goldstein aka 'The Fat Jew' is taking Soul Cycle classes for the homeless in New York . Displaying his ample stomach, Goldstein is seen in the tape, posted on The Crosby Press on Wednesday, instructing a group of about six homeless people each sitting on a bike. He says he rounded up the participants in Tompkins Square park in the East Village and they all jumped on a bike at a nearby docking station. 'There were five or six people who were like, ""Let's party,""' he told the New York Daily News. 'I think they recognized a good time.' In the class, which was Goldstein's third, he yells out common spin phrases like 'this is a cardio party' and 'you guys feelin' the burn?' 'The Fat Jew' said he regularly makes silly videos and the Soul Cycle spin off similarly started out as a joke.

On Thursday he tweeted: 'I'm teaching SoulCycle classes to homeless people in New York City using parked CitiBikes. I'M BEING SERIOUS.' He says the class isn't just for the homeless - anyone who balks at the idea of paying the exorbitant cost of the real thing can join in. 'Indoor cycling is too expensive it's not available to everybody,' he says in the video.

One day after the FBI ended an unsuccessful dig for Jimmy Hoffa's remains, a law enforcement source has revealed that the former Teamsters boss's body may never be found because it was allegedly run through a wood chipper. Speaking to DNAinfo New York, the source claimed that Hoffa was strangled by New York mobster Anthony 'Tony Pro' Provenzano after he was lured to the Red Fox restaurant outside Detroit by his 'adopted' son Charles 'Chuckie' O'Brien. Hoffa disappeared in 1975 after leaving the restaurant, where he was supposed to meet with Provenzano and Detroit Mafia figure Anthony Giacolone. Scroll down for video . g . Law enforcement officials help search the area in Oakland Township, Michigan on Tuesday where they believe the remains of Teamsters union president Jimmy Hoffa might be buried . Agents uncovered concrete slabs from a field where they have been digging. They believe the slabs may belong to the foundation of a barn that once stood on the property, under which Hoffa may have been buried . The law enforcement source, who is . described as close to the original investigation into Hoffa's . disappearance, said Hoffa had left the restaurant with O'Brien and that Provenzano and Giacolone were waiting in the backseat of the car. That's when Provenzano allegedly strangled Hoffa, and then the men drove . 16 miles to Inkster, where they ran his body through a wood chipper. The FBI has linked Hoffa to DNA evidence found in the car that was driven that night. O'Brien has denied any involvement in Hoffa's disappearance. Giacolone died in 2001 and Provenzano died in 1998. In the latest attempt to find Jimmy . Hoffa, authorities excavated a field in Oakland Township, Michigan, this . week that was once owned by a reputed Michigan mob boss. An aging former mobster had told . federal agents that Hoffa was buried in a shallow grave under a concrete . slab in the field after he was murdered in 1975. The agents found the . slab, but not Hoffa's remains. The . government has followed up on some 15 credible leads as to the . whereabouts of the once-powerful union leader, but his final resting . place remains a mystery. CNN estimates the search has cost taxpayers $3 million in the last four decades. 'We did not uncover any evidence relevant to the investigation on James Hoffa,' said Robert Foley, head of the FBI in Detroit. Full-scale: FBI agents have set up shop in a field that was once owned by a top mafia figure. They believe Jimmy Hoffa could be buried in a shallow grave here . Search: Federal agents can be seen cutting down the tall grass in the field where they were told Hoffa's remains are buried . Full force: Dozens of cars line the grassy field where FBI agents began searching for Hoffa's body . 'I am very confident of our result . here after two-days-plus of diligent effort. As of this point, we'll be . closing down the excavation operation.' Previous searches have included the . suburban Detroit home a former mob enforcer and an eastern Michigan . horse farm and a backyard swimming pool. It has also been claimed . Hoffa's remains are entombed beneath the former Giants Stadium in New . Jersey and beneath the headquarters of General Motors. All investigations into Hoffa's whereabouts have turned out to be both costly and fruitless. The feds had high hopes for the latest dig. The source of the tip was Tony Zerilli, an 85-year-old former mobster . who said he was told the location of Hoffa's body by a hitman who . claimed to have killed him. 'The bureau had a short list of . people they wanted to talk to about that and I can’t think of anybody on . that list who was more highly placed then Anthony Zerilli,' former U.S. Attorney Keith Corbett told WDIV-TV in January. 'This is certainly the . most interesting and attractive lead that has come up since I’ve been . involved with this - and I think the bureau would react the same way.' But, officials came up short again. 'Certainly, we're disappointed,' FBI head Foley told reporters Wednesday. He said about 40 agents were involved . in an operation that covered about an acre. The FBI has not put a cost . on the search, but Foley said it's more important to solve a case. 'With any investigation we consider . cost-benefits analysis,' he said. 'The FBI and its partners are no . corporations. We do not have a profit margin as a bottom line.' Hunt for Hoffa: The field where FBI agents are searching is 20 miles north of the suburban Detroit restaurant where he was last seen in 1975 . Hoffa's rise in the Teamsters, his . 1964 conviction for jury tampering and his presumed murder are Detroit's . link to a time when organized crime, public corruption and mob hits . held the nation's attention. Over the years, authorities have received . various tips, leading the FBI to possible burial sites near and far. In 2003, a backyard swimming pool was . dug up 90 miles northwest of Detroit. Seven years ago, a tip from an . ailing federal inmate led to a two-week search and excavation at a horse . farm in the same region. Last year, soil samples were taken from under . the concrete floor of a backyard shed north of the city. And detectives . even pulled up floorboards at a Detroit house in 2004. Other theories have suggested he was . entombed in concrete at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, ground up and . thrown in a Florida swamp or obliterated in a mob-owned fat-rendering . plant. The excavation site was 20 miles north of the restaurant where Hoffa was last seen in July 1975. Zerilli, 85, has said Hoffa was murdered by mobsters who dumped his body in a shallow grave. The property was owned in 1975 by . Jack Tocco, Zerilli's cousin, who reportedly became head of the Detroit . mafia after Hoffa vanished. A house and barn used to stand on the land, though both building were later torn down. Zerilli . says Hoffa was taken to the property after meeting with two organized . crime figures at the Macus Red Fox Restaurant in Bloomfield Hills, . Michigan. The mob insider said he was told by a mob enforcer that Hoffa, 62, was executed on the property and then buried. Mob royalty: Tony Zerilli, 85, was the second in command of the Detroit mafia before he was indicted and sent to prison. Now, he says, he's 'dead broke' Turncoat? Zerilli, seen here in his federal prison photo, has told the FBI to look on property once owned by his cousin, who was the head of the Detroit mafia . The mafia initially planned to move the body to a hunting lodge upstate, but police pressure became so intense after Hoffa's disappearance that 'once he was buried here he was buried and they let it go,' Zerilli told WDIV in an interview in January. Zerilli and his cousin Tocco, led the organized crime families in Detroit until 1996, when both were indicted on racketeering charges. He was sent to prison in 2002 and released in 2008. 'Clearly . when he returned [from prison] he would’ve been a person, based on his position in . the hierarchy, who would have been able to learn the facts and . circumstances surrounding the disappearance of James Earl Hoffa,' said . Corbett. Despite being mob royalty, Zerilli says he is now 'dead broke.' When he went to Tocco and asked for money, he said, Tocco refused. Now, Zerilli is writing a book about the Detroit Partnership - the Motor City's mafia. Fanning out: Federal agents spread out across the property. There is no telling how much of the field they will have to excavate . It's unknown how long the FBI will have to search the property to determine whether or not Hoffa is buried there .

Britain is advertising 250,000 jobs to job seekers in the European Union creating more competition for unemployed people at home. Around half the jobs advertised on a taxpayer funded EU website are in Britain, raising questions about the government’s approach to unemployment. By contrast France has advertised just 14,000 posts for other EU workers and seven countries - have put up so few that they do not register with the European Commission’s EURES work programme. EURES, the European job mobility portal, is the EU body that advertises British jobs to any EU worker. The European Union provides grants for unemployed EU workers to get interviews and resettle in another EU country. No such grant exists for workers in the UK to relocate to find work or get an interview. The British jobs being advertised in Europe include department managers, general managers, finance and sales jobs, computing posts and clerking posts. The huge disparity in job listings will fuel claims that the UK goes too far to go along with EU rules while other countries ignore them when they find it inconvenient. The numbers are disturbing since while unemployment is 7.7 per cent, it has just hit 12 per cent in the Eurozone for the first time since the single currency was formed in 1999. Tim Aker, of Get Britain Out, warned that the discrepancy is likely to pile further pressure on the UK jobs market. He said: ‘The Eurozone’s problem is going to become ours. The EU is paying to export Eurozone unemployed to the more prosperous EU member states in a cynical attempt to lower Eurozone unemployment. This will mean more competition for unemployed British workers struggling to get a job. ‘The facts show that labour mobility is only going one way, the jobs are here as the Eurozone destroys the economies of its member states. It’s time we got out of the EU to secure British jobs.’ A European Commission spokesman said the scheme benefited the UK economy, adding: ‘There is no evidence that migrant workers take jobs away from host country workers.’","Half of the jobs advertised on a taxpayer funded EU website are in Britain .

A company selling furniture used by athletes during last year’s Olympic Games has been flooded with complaints after failing to deliver the goods on time, or even give refunds. Some items that were ordered from Ramler Furniture five months ago and intended as Christmas presents still have not arrived. Meanwhile customers who wanted a refund could not get hold of anyone from the company for several months. A contact phone number was removed from the website and people with complaints were not getting any response by email. Hundreds of customers left messages on the company’s Facebook page before getting a reply. Souvenir: Olympian Matthew Pinsent pictured lifting the first of 16,000 . beds to be installed in the Athletes Village, Olympic Park, London, many of which were later sold by Ramler Furniture . Ramler Furniture, which supplied the Olympic venues and the Athletes’ Village, began selling the goods last August as part of its contract with the London 2012 organisers. The company offered more than one million items, ranging from beds that Olympic stars such as Jessica Ennis and Usain Bolt could have slept in, to bean bags, bathroom bins and even coat hangers. Customers began buying the items through a website called Remains of the Games. At its peak in August and September, the website was receiving 10,000 visits a day from customers, who expected delivery of the goods within the industry standard of 28 days. Unhappy customers: Karen Roberts, left, and her sister Alison Thompson, from Gravesend, Kent, eventually received a refund after their goods were never delivered . But hundreds of people are still waiting for their items to arrive. Ramler, which has apologised for the fiasco, says it has now paid back almost £100,000 in refunds, and is frantically trying to deliver the remainder of the goods to other customers. A spokesman said that of the 500 customers who complained, almost 200 were still waiting for goods or refunds. The company has sold more than 700,000 items. LOCOG, the Games organising . committee, said it had been unaware of the problems until  contacted by . The Mail on Sunday this weekend, and that it was now monitoring Ramler’s . performance with ‘concern’. Customers say the experience has left a . ‘sour taste’ in their mouths. Ramler, an Australian company, provided most of the furniture for the Games venues and the Athletes’ Village. The . Village contained 17,000 beds, which were up for sale, along with 6,900 . bean bags, and 5,000 dining chairs. Ramler was also selling rugs of the . fake grass used in Danny Boyle’s Opening Ceremony at £95 each. When . customers ordered their goods, they were told by Remains of the Games . staff that their order would either be ready for collection at two . depots in Nottingham or Tilbury, Essex, or delivered in a few weeks. But . by the end of September, customers could not contact Remains of the . Games by phone because the number had been removed from the website. Karen Roberts, 51, from Gravesend, Kent, said she ordered three wall clocks, one floor lamp, two notice boards and a deck chair  for £280 in August, but had not received anything by this month. She sent 29 emails to Ramler, and eventually left an angry message on its Facebook page, threatening to go to Trading Standards. Going, going, gone: Ramler Furniture sold off more than one million items varying from beds, bean bags and even coat-hangers from the athletes' village . Within hours, she received a refund into her PayPal account. Mrs Roberts said: ‘On a scale of one to ten on how bad their service was, I would give them 11. It did feel like a scam. It was just frustrating. I just wanted something to remember the Olympics by.’ Her sister Alison Thompson, 42, said she bought an umbrella for £9 and a locker from an athlete’s bedroom for £24. The locker, ordered in September, was meant to be a Christmas present for her 12-year-old daughter Jordan. She said: ‘We’ve managed to get a refund, but it’s not the money  I care about. We really wanted a memento from the Games.’ Ramler spokesman Paul Levin said the main reason for the delay in delivering orders was that  beds and chairs were not being returned on schedule as workers cleared the Olympic Village. He added that many items were not fit to be delivered because they were damaged or stained. Mr Levin said: ‘I apologise to customers for the delay.’","Ramler Furniture, which supplied the Olympic venues and the Athletes' Village, began selling the goods last August .

Ferguson this morning announced that his 27-year tenure at Old Trafford would end with retirement after the final game of the season - at West Brom on May 19. Sportsmail understands . that the United hierarchy have their man and will officially announce . the decision on who replaces Sir Alex Ferguson once personal terms have . been agreed. And that man will not be Jose Mourinho, despite his talks . with Chelsea reportedly stalling this week. United's board members - most notably Sir Bobby Charlton - are believed to have been attracted to Moyes due to his longevity at Everton and his commitment to building teams. The Scot met with Everton chairman Bill Kenwright at his offices in London this evening. Catch me if you can: David Moyes appeared in good spirits as he left Bill Kenwright's offices on Wednesday . As one door closes: David Moyes arriving and leaving Bill Kenwright's offices in London on Wednesday evening . Heading for United? David Moyes (right) leaves Everton's Finch Farm training complex today driven by his agent brother Kenny . In the driving seat: Sportsmail understands that Moyes (pictured today) is the chosen successor to Ferguson . Who should replace Ferguson at Manchester United? It is understood that Ferguson had planned to stand down for a while but was hoping to delay an announcement until the weekend. Moyes is believed to earn £4million a . year at Everton - making him the only Barclays Premier League manager to . receive more than any of his players. His contract runs out in the . summer and he can expect to see himself climb up the pay scale . considerably with a move to the champions. Jose Mourinho was believed to be in the running to . succeed Ferguson, who has won 38 tophies including 13 . Premier League titles and two European Cups in his time at Old Trafford, but United's directors appear to have decided against the Portuguese. Moyes, 50, has previously said . that he wanted to wait until the end of this campaign before deciding . whether to extend his time at Goodison into a 12th year. He will be happy to work with fellow Scot Ferguson, who has taken a position on United's board of directors. Moyes will also be an attractive proposition to United because of his consistency and loyalty to Everton during the last decade. His focus on bringing through youth talent is also a huge selling point for the club that selected at least one player who has come through the academy system for more than 1,000 consecutive games. Leading man: David Moyes is favourite to replace Sir Alex Ferguson, with Jose Mourinho in second place . Chief executive David Gill told MUTV: 'We knew this day would come and we have been preparing for that. The board will take council from Sir Alex and Sir Bobby (Charlton) on the new appointment.' Sir Bobby Charlton spoke about Mourinho previously, expressing discomfort about the idea of him replacing Ferguson. He said: 'Mourinho is a really good coach but that's as far as I would go really.' Charlton added: 'He pontificates too much for my liking. He's a good manager, though.' However Gill did say that the next man would need to possess 'requisite football experience in terms of domestic and European experience', which could have counted against Moyes, He has limited experience in Europe, mostly coming in the Europa League (formerly the UEFA Cup). However, it seems those reservations will not affect the decision to appoint him. Mourinho, who is likely to leave . Real Madrid this summer, has . been strongly linked with a return to Chelsea. His Stamford Bridge return has hit a snag with Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich refusing to pay the buyout clause in the Real boss's contract, as well as compensation for Mourinho's backroom staff. Big shoes to fill: Ferguson is the most successful manager in English football history . Sports Personality of the Year: Ferguson is now the 4/1 second favourite, behind Andy Murray (5/2). Ferguson is 25/1 to own the English Grand National winner in 2014 & 6/1 for the Cheltenham winner in 2014 . Abramovich paid Mourinho and the backroom team £17million when he sacked them in 2006, and the buyout cluase in his Madrid contract is believed to be £20m in the season, with a fee open to negotiation in the summer. Mourinho is still the favoured candidate to succeed Rafa Benitez at Stamford Bridge, but Chelsea want more control over the recruitment of the team surrounding the manager than they had when he arrived from Porto in 2004.","Man Utd set to make announcement by Thursday evening (UK time)

Three homes: John Cruddas once complained about a lack of affordable housing . he Labour Election chief who lambasted Tony Blair for failing to provide enough cheap homes is planning to write the party’s manifesto from his latest new home – one of three he owns worth a total of £1 million. The latest addition to MP John Cruddas’s portfolio is a self-designed holiday cottage overlooking a beach on a scenic isle off the coast of Ireland. He has had an office added to the building so he can use it to write Ed Miliband’s General Election manifesto – in between ‘exhilarating’ walks and kite-surfing on the beach. Regular flights from nearby Knock International Airport mean Mr Cruddas and his wife, Labour peer Baroness Healy, can ‘commute’ the 500 miles to Westminster. The four-bedroom retreat in County Mayo is in addition to Mr Cruddas’s mansion block flat in West London’s fashionable Notting Hill and a third home in his constituency in Dagenham, East London. Former union official Mr Cruddas fiercely criticised Tony Blair’s Government for chasing middle-class voters and claimed a ‘lack of affordable social housing’ was its ‘outstanding public policy failure.’ His outspoken views led to Mr Miliband putting Mr Cruddas in charge of a shake up of the Party’s policies and designing and writing its election manifesto. Mr Cruddas designed his latest home on the beautiful island of Achill and had it built to his specifications, including an open-plan kitchen, dining room and an office. From there he will be able to work on Labour’s manifesto overlooking a sandy beach instead of hectic Westminster or his tough urban constituency. ‘I am going to bring some of my colleagues here to do a bit of work and get away from it and sort out a few things,’ Mr Cruddas told an Irish journalist. ‘We have quite a big agenda ahead of us over the next couple of years but this will be the perfect place to get things done.’ Luxury: The MP's £180,000 Irish holiday home where he kite-surfs and plans to bring colleagues to 'sort things out' Retreat: The view across the beach towards Mr Cruddas' holiday home on the beautiful Achill Island, County Mayo. His property is the white one in the front left . He said the island setting is ‘one of the most beautiful places you can come across .  .  . a strange type of beauty because it is a wild and ferocious type. There is nothing as exhilarating as walking along the beach, especially on Christmas Day’. The holiday home, worth about £180,000, is also ideal for two of Mr Cruddas’ other hobbies, golf and fishing. He joined the exclusive, £1,500-a-year Walton Heath golf club in Surrey, once captained by the Duke of Windsor. His new home is close to the greens of Achill golf club, which promises members ‘beautiful, ever-changing scenery and invigorating Achill air’. Distance: The MP's new home in Achill, County Mayo, is around 500 miles from Westminster . The area, one of Ireland’s most . popular holiday destinations, claims to have ‘the best fishing waters in . Ireland’ with mullet, mackerel and skate. It also offers scuba-diving. Ireland’s . Atlantic coast is one of the furthest points in the British Isles from . Westminster. In Mr Cruddas’s own words: ‘Next stop New York.’ While . speaking out for Labour’s traditional supporters, Mr Cruddas, 51, and . wife Anna, who both have Irish roots, are part of Labour’s . ‘aristocracy.’ Mr Cruddas was Mr Blair’s union fixer in No 10 and his . wife was given a peerage after advising John Prescott and Harriet . Harman. As an MP, he earns a salary of £65,000 a year, while peers can claim a £300-per-day attendance allowance. London: His £650,000 flat near his son's Holland Park school. He bought the property for £375,000 and claimed more than £80,000 expenses towards it . Constituency: The Labour MP's £200,000 terraced home in Dagenham which forms a part of his £1million property portfolio . It . is not the first time the couple have been involved in controversy over . property. In 2007, Mr Cruddas was accused of using his MP’s . second-homes expenses to fund a London flat which enabled him to obtain . better schooling for his son. The . couple bought a home in Notting Hill for £375,000 and claimed more than . £80,000 in expenses on the property, which fell within the catchment . area of elite Catholic Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School in nearby . Holland Park. Pupils are required to learn Latin and attend weekly Mass. The MP was able to make the second-home claims because he nominated his constituency home in Dagenham, worth about £200,000, as his ‘main home’ for expenses purposes. At around the same time as he bought the Notting Hill flat, now worth up to £650,000, his son began attending Cardinal Vaughan School, known for its excellent results. The secondary school nearest to Mr Cruddas’s constituency home, Dagenham Park Community School, is one of London’s poorest in terms of results. Mr Cruddas denied he had moved simply to get his child into the school and said he had ‘always supported Catholic comprehensives’. He provoked ridicule when he described Labour’s policy review as ‘not policy as such, rather the search for political sentiment, voice and language; of general definition within a national story. Less the Sprit Level, more What is England’. A spokesman for Mr Cruddas declined to comment.","John Cruddas will write Ed Miliband's manifesto from his four-bedroom County Mayo retreat .

The millionaire boss of French technology giant Dassault Systemes said 'residing in France has become a big handicap.' Bernard Charles' criticism of President Francois Hollande's new tax regime comes as two senior executives at Moët Hennessy move to London from Paris. President Hollande is under pressure as Gallic tycoons look to quit France to flee higher taxes while the economy continues to struggle. Cashing out: Bernard Charles, 55, has revealed he is considering joining thousands of wealthy French fleeing President Francois Hollande's new tax regime . Mr Charles, 55, said he is considering whether to follow suit and leave the country. He told French daily Le Monde in an interview: 'Residing in France has become a big handicap. Very largely, our hiring of top managers will have to be done elsewhere than in France.' Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault denies the two executives from Moët Hennessy, the champagne and cognac arm of LVMH, are leaving because of tax reasons. Mr Arnault, who heads LVMH luxury goods company, told the Financial Times that tax is not behind the move by LVMH director Gilles Hennessy and Christophe Navarre, chief executive of Moët Hennessy. Mr Arnault is himself applying for residency in Belgium. The latest moves will be bad news for President Hollande, whose approval ratings have dropped to as low as 30 per cent as unemployment reached 10 per cent of the workforce. Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault has applied to Belgium for dual nationality . LVMH said it will continue to be based in Paris and told the Financial Times Belgian national Mr Navarre 'pays, and will continue to pay, his taxes in France.' The paper reported that Mr Hennessy plans to retire later this year. Mr Charles said his own decision about whether to leave France will not be based on tax. 'But to be clear, this isn’t about plans for a 75 per cent tax on all earnings above a million euros - even if I do think that tax above a certain level is confiscatory.' Mr Charles sold £24million worth of shares in Dassault Systemes - which makes software for industry - last year. Asked if this was a sign he was about to quit, he answered: 'I had to do that to pay other taxes related to the purchase of other shares, but it does show how heavy taxes are these days. 'But if I find I can no longer buy and sell shares in the company, I will leave.' Actor Gerard Depardieu has quit France for Russia over the tax plans . He also revealed that other highly-paid Dassault executives had left France, adding: 'I can’t say how many, but not as many as those that want to.' His concerns of crippling new taxes on the rich come after optician chain tycoon Alain Afflelou - who has an estimated £190million fortune - said last year he was moving to Britain to pay less.

In the post she said 'Michael Thatcher has always been so . discreet, and prudent about his relationship with Lady Thatcher.' She said that both Michael and his sister made sure they did not use her name 'with arrogance and pride.' 'Not only those grandchildren have not . used her name to try to exalt themselves, but all the opposite they have . always been humble and kind. 'The Thatcher grandchildren have . demonstrated their own successes as young people on their own for whom . they are, not because their last name and personal relationship with one . of the most the most extraordinary woman in this century. Ms Boyne . added: 'Amanda Margaret Thatcher, a college girl, is an extraordinary . woman of faith with a melodious voice and a kind heart (and as my son .

Michael started playing the sport when he moved to Dallas in 2004 and in 2007 he helped his high . school American football team into the Texas state finals. Aged 18, he took a brilliant diving catch from a looping 48-yard pass in front of 10,000 fans last week.

The body of Sarah Groves, 24, was found in a pool of blood inside her cabin on a houseboat on Lake Dal, in the picturesque town of Srinagar in Kashmir. Stabbed to death: Sarah Groves has been found stabbed to death on a boathouse in Kashmir . Discovered: Police have said the 24-year-old was found inside the boat this morning on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir . Arrested: Dutch national Richard de Wit, was arrested about 45 miles from the scene of the suspected murder . Scene: The houseboat where the body of Sarah Groves was found in Srinagar today . Police said her body was discovered with multiple stab wounds and with a knife lying beside her in the early hours of yesterday. A 43-year-old Dutch tourist is being questioned by police. The man, named locally as Richard De Wit, is reported to have fled the scene in a small boat which capsized in the lake, forcing him to swim to the shore. He was arrested in the town of Qazigund, 45 miles south of Srinagar, in wet clothes and without shoes. He was carrying his passport. It is believed that Miss Groves travelled to Srinagar two months ago, intending to stay there for just four days. But she decided to remain longer, renting a cabin at the New Beauty houseboat. De Wit arrived at the guesthouse three days ago, and was staying at the cabin next to Miss Groves. They were the only two tourists staying on the boat. Miss Groves, left, was staying in the cabin next to Richard de Wit, pictured in a Facebook photo (right) Inside: A pair of shoes (left) belonging to the 24-year-old woman from Guernsey are pictured on the houseboat in Srinagar . Incident: Sarah Groves was found dead inside a houseboat this morning on the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir, Indian media have said . Houseboat: An Indian policeman stands outside the house boat New Beauty where the woman was found dead . A Kashmir police source claimed that on Friday night De Wit smoked a large quantity of cannabis and returned to his cabin after midnight. He reportedly became paranoid that Miss Groves was going to kill him, then forced his way into her room and allegedly killed her in a frenzied attack with a knife. The houseboat’s owner, Abdul Rahim Shoda, said that he and his son discovered Miss Groves’s body at about 2.30am yesterday. He said that his son, Samir, heard screams from the houseboat and went to investigate. He is said to have seen De Wit flee in the boat. Senior police officer Abdul Ghani Mir said: ‘The Dutch national had fled from the houseboat in the night, leaving behind his belongings. He was trying to flee from the valley.’ Sarah Groves has allegedly been stabbed to death on a houseboat on Dal Lake, a popular tourist destination . Owner: One of the sons of the boathouse owner Abdul Rahim Shoda (pictured) is also helping police with the inquiries, although he has not been arrested, according to reports . Shoes: An Indian policeman stands guard on a houseboat near a pair of shoes (left) belonging to Sarah Groves . It was reported that police also detained Samir Shoda as they suspect that he might have supplied De Wit with cannabis. Police could not confirm whether Miss Groves was sexually assaulted before being murdered. Last month, tougher sentences for sexual offences were introduced in India following a national outcry over the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in Delhi last year. Anyone convicted of rape or murder now faces the death penalty. Since then, two foreign tourists have been attacked. Tribute: Messages of respect have been paid to Sarah on sites including Twitter . Family: The son of the houseboat owner said Sarah had been enjoying her time with the family . Location: Houseboat owner Abdul Rahim Shoda speaks on his mobile phone near the house boat where the body was found .

A Swiss woman was gang-raped last month as she and her husband camped overnight on a cycling holiday in central India. Days later, a British woman jumped two floors from her hotel room south of Delhi to flee an alleged sexual assault. Miss Groves is believed to have been born in Manchester and was living in Guernsey. Her father, Victor, 70, is a retired businessman who ran a string of IT companies in Cheshire before his retirement. On her Facebook page, she has posted photos and messages showing she had been travelling around the world. It is understood that she was due to fly out to Nepal in three days’ time from Kashmir. Shocked friends have left messages for Miss Groves on social networking sites. James Blower, a businessman in Guernsey, tweeted: ‘Can’t believe Sarah Groves is dead. Such a little ray of sunshine and not a bad bone in her body. Taken far too young.’ The Foreign Office has confirmed that a British woman has been killed in Srinagar and that it is providing consular assistance to her family.","Sarah Groves, 24, was found dead inside boat on Dal Lake in Srinagar .

It is expected to conclude she misled MPs and express ‘limited confidence’ in her ability to run Government departments. A report by the committee into the running of the Border Agency, which covers her time as the agency’s head, is also likely to call for reform of Whitehall’s ‘revolving door’ system of appointments that allows senior officials to be awarded plum jobs even if they fail. Ms Homer was appointed to HMRC in January 2012, after spending just a year as head of the Transport Department. Prior to that, she spent four years as chief executive of the Border Agency – a period marked by a huge backlog  of asylum cases and scares over the release of hundreds of foreign criminals. During her evidence to the committee, chaired by Labour MP Keith Vaz, Ms Homer refused to accept suggestions she should return any of the £20,000 in bonuses she received as head of UKBA. It later emerged that in 40,000 cases, individuals could still be in the country and were potentially untraceable . She was quizzed over more than 100,000 . items of mail left unopened as staff struggled to deal with 147,000 . immigration case files, some dating back to the Nineties, parked in a . ‘controlled archive’. It later emerged that in 40,000 cases, individuals could still be in the country and were potentially untraceable. Ms Homer apologised that the cases had not been checked against up to 19 databases, including the Police National Computer and anti-terrorist watchlist, and said she regretted she may have ‘inadvertently misled’ the committee over the size of the backlog and whether security checks had been carried out. Mr Vaz accepted her apology – but said if it happened again it would be reported to Parliament as a ‘contempt of the House’. Tomorrow’s report is expected to express MPs’ fury that Ms Homer, 56, does not appear to accept she failed during her time as head of the UKBA – and cast doubt on her ability to carry out her duties at HMRC. Ms Homer was paid almost £1 million in salary and bonuses during her time at the beleaguered agency. She is now paid £180,000 a year as head of HMRC. The report is expected to conclude Parliament should be given a stronger role in appointing top civil servants – a view likely to be shared by No 10, where senior figures have expressed frustration at the way Whitehall tries to block key reforms and rejects interference over its appointments.","Lin Homer, chief executive of  HM Revenue & Customs, 'misled MPs'"

The percentage of American men who work or are actively searching for work is at an historic low. Men between the ages of 25 and 54 now participate in the workforce at only around 88 percent.  In 1956, 98 percent of American men were active in the workforce. Due to a changing job marketplace, the Great Recession, male imprisonment and other factors, a fewer percentage of men are now working than ever before. Vanishing act: Men aged 25 to 54 who participate in the American workforce are at an all-time low according to Bureau of Labor Statistic data . Among the less educated, reports CNN, men have been increasingly left behind as employment opportunities require more skill or a level of education beyond a high school degree. Pair that with a widening dearth of well-paid manufacturing jobs and men with lower education levels are at an even greater disadvantage. College educated men are also vanishing from the workplace. Analysts report that men 25 and up with a bachelor’s degree participated in the workforce at 80.2 percent in May 2012, an over 7 percent drop from ten years ago. Even in boom years, like those that . preceded the Great Recession, men’s participation rate continued to fall . despite unemployment reaching a 30-year low in the early 2000s. Going down: Men 25 to 54 now account for less of the American workforce than ever before. Male participation rates have dropped steadily for decades, and the descent quickened with the onset of the Great Recession . Changing places: Men with lower levels of education are increasingly choosing not to work at all instead of taking labor jobs that once paid much more. Meanwhile, women continue to make up more and more of America's workforce . The rate of workforce participation in America--that is, those who are working or searching for work--has decreased for men aged 25-54 for decades for several reasons. Education: Fewer jobs exist for those with only a high school education and many men who could once hold well-paid manufacturing jobs, for example, now choose not to work at all instead of taking less desirable, and lower paid, blue collar work that still exists . Imprisonment: Incarceration rates have increased exponentially in recent decades. 1 in every 100 Americans are now in prison, over 90% of whom are male. Disability: With the Great Recession came a large influx of application for disability benefits and few of those who subsequently received them have since weened themselves off . And the Great Recession itself exacerbated the problem. As the crisis grew, men’s workforce participation dipped below 90 percent for the very first time. And it has continued to drop since, despite an improving economy. Another factor is the number of men behind bars. An astonishing 1 out of every 100 Americans are imprisoned and over 90 percent of inmates are men. And, perhaps even more than lack of education, a criminal record can make finding a job in the afterlife of incarceration challenging. Challenging enough, perhaps, to make men just stop trying. Which is another growing group of non-participators. Workforce participation accounts for employed people as well as those seeking employment. It does not, of course, account for those who’ve stopped trying to find work altogether, such as those collecting unemployment or other benefits. ‘The proportion of guys doing nothing has risen,’ Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNN. After unemployment rates rocketed as a result of the recession, many men began to rely on unemployment benefits. They also, increasingly, began relying on the federal disability system. CNN . reports that 1.9 percent of working age men received disability . benefits in 1982. In 2012, that number had reached 3.1 percent. And only 2.2 percent of those enrolled quit the program by the start of 2013. There . are still jobs out there, of course, even in a harsh economic climate. So who’s taking them in the absence of male applicants aged 25 to 54? Economic woes: With the Great Recession came a great deal of lay-offs and though numbers have bounced back somewhat, the male workforce participation rate hit 90 percent for the first time and has continued to drop ever since . Women, according to MIT economics professor David Autor. Female college enrollment rates have helped boost their ability to gain employment in sectors that are growing, ones that require higher education degrees. According to Autor’s research, women born in 1975 were roughly 17% more likely than their male counterparts to attend college and nearly 23% more likely to complete a four-year degree . ‘Women's persistence and enrollment rates have given them a real edge over men,’ said Burtless.","In 1956, 98 percent of males 25-54 participated in the American workforce .
In 2012, that number had dropped to 88 percent and it isn't improving any time soon ."

Brady, sketched at the tribunal yesterday taking notes, is not allowed a pen while in the secure hospital in Merseyside, after he used it as a potential weapon . Moors Murderer Ian Brady walked out of his mental health tribunal yesterday, complaining he had 'listened to this ad nauseam'. But he was quickly slapped down by the judge who warned him 'we will hear the evidence.' The child killer even suggested a panel member had fallen asleep at one point during the hearing. The tribunal is being held because Brady wants to be judged sane and moved from maximum security Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside, where he is being force fed, to a prison, where he believes he will be free to starve himself to death. The 75-year-old complained that he had heard all the evidence before as a criminal psychologist was questioned over several hours about his mental health. At the end of Dr Adrian Grounds's evidence, Judge Robert Atherton, chair of the three-man tribunal panel, asked if Brady wanted to say something. Brady, wearing dark sunglasses, a dark jacket, white shirt and tie, spoke in a low, gravelly Scottish accent. Many of his words were inaudible. Referring to Dr Cameron Boyd, who sits on the tribunal panel, Brady said: 'It even apparently lulls him to sleep.' The mental health tribunal itself is taking place behind closed doors at Ashworth Hospital on Merseyside . Two faces of a killer: A sketch of Brady, feeding tube in nose, and, right, in 1965 . Brady said he had left the tribunal . for around two hours this morning because the lawyers and the witness . were going over old ground. 'I've listened to this ad nauseam. I know it by heart,' Brady said. But Judge Atherton cut him off, . saying: 'We will hear the evidence. 'If we take the view someone is . wasting time you can be pretty certain they will be told.' The hearing is being held in a room inside Ashworth and relayed by video to Manchester Civil Justice Centre.

Moors murder victim Lesley Ann Downey, who was just 10 when she was sadistically murdered . The tribunal heard evidence yesterday about his behaviour inside the hospital. He only comes out of his room at night and shuns contact with others, partly due to his superiority complex. But he also fears other patients and . habitually carried a pen between his knuckles as an improvised weapon, . until it was taken away. As well as his ""nocturnal"" existence, . Brady was described as contemptuous of his peers. He shows anger that . can erupt over minor matters and unleashes verbal tirades against staff . and other patients, the tribunal heard. He also targets individuals, both . staff and patients, attempts to manipulate others, bypasses security and . bends the rules to suit himself. He will only deal with people ""high . up"" the hospital hierarchy - consistent with his narcissistic . personality disorder, the tribunal heard. Brady, who has been on hunger strike since 1999, claims he has faked psychotic episodes by 'acting' in the past. The hearing was told of hospital records from January 29 this year stating how Brady has now 'almost totally isolated himself'. Innocent: Keith Bennett (left) and John Kilbride (right) were murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley. Keith's body is still missing.

Following a seizure last July, . hospital notes recorded him saying: 'If I have to, I will never let them . see me in pain. I will act as if I have not a care in the world.' Brady is currently 'nursed' in the hospital setting because he is regarded as being severely mentally ill. But if he was deemed fit to be . returned to a jail, the regime would be much less 'tolerant and . flexible' of his behaviour and the abuse he metes out to staff and . others, the tribunal heard. Dr Grounds, a criminologist and . forensic psychologist called by Brady's legal team to support his case, . told the hearing Brady wished to have control over the manner and timing . of his death but that view did not arise out of mental illness. Brady . reasoned he had no prospects of release or of a better life. He said Brady had a lifelong severe personality disorder which had not diminished at Ashworth Hospital. However, psychotic symptoms of mental . illness he had shown in prison had reduced. He said it was possible he . could relapse if transferred to prison but added that the prison system . could manage his current condition. A further review to decide if he . needed to be returned to hospital could take place if his mental health . deteriorated, Dr Grounds added. Brady and partner Myra Hindley murdered five youngsters in the 1960s, burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Both were jailed for life at Chester Assizes in 1966. Hindley died in jail in November 2002 at the age of 60. Ian Brady claimed to be in communication with a reincarnated Nazi and believed he could change the laws of physics, his psychiatrist revealed. Describing the delusions which led to his being detained at Ashworth in 1985, Dr James Collins said Brady also complained of being controlled by ‘green beings’. At one stage, he said Brady had been exchanging letters with a woman he believed to be ‘a reincarnated Nazi’. He told a prison visitor that he could ‘walk through locked doors at night’, he added. Dr Collins is Brady’s responsible medical officer at Ashworth but said the mass murderer had refused to engage with him for more than a decade. He believes Brady continues to suffer from paranoid schizophrenia, recounting how the delusions escalated in the 1980s when he began adding excessive amounts of salt to his food. He said it showed that Brady thought his food was being tampered with – a psychotic symptom.

David Cameron could publish plans to . introduce a tax break for married couples as early as November, . according to senior Downing Street sources. The Prime Minister yesterday confirmed . that he would definitely recognise marriage in the tax system before . the general election in 2015. And a senior figure insisted Mr . Cameron is prepared to overrule Chancellor George Osborne, who has . repeatedly blocked the early introduction of the measure as many Tory . MPs would like. ‘The Prime Minister is the First Lord . of the Treasury,’ the senior figure said, pointing out that Mr Cameron . is in ultimate charge of tax measures. A No 10 official said the measure . would be introduced in either an autumn statement or a budget, meaning . the pledge could be fulfilled when the Chancellor makes his next . announcement in November. A pledge to recognise marriage in the . tax system was included in the Coalition agreement three years ago but . Mr Osborne has refused to include it in any of his budgets or autumn . statements since. Mr Cameron was asked during a local . election campaign drive in Carlisle yesterday if he still intends to go . ahead with his plans for the measure. He said: ‘Yes I do, we set them out at . the last election in the Conservative manifesto. 'The Coalition . agreement specifically said that while the Liberal Democrats don’t agree . with them they would abstain if we promoted them and that’s exactly . what we’ll do before the end of this Parliament.’ Asked if it will be . this year he added: ‘It will be before the end of this Parliament.’ Chancellor George Osborne and Deputy PM Nick Clegg are both thought to be against using the tax system to recognise marriage . But the ConservativeHome website . reported yesterday that ‘on tax breaks for marriage, there are signals . that the policy will be implemented, perhaps as early as the autumn’. Tory MPs and Cabinet ministers . including Iain Duncan Smith have urged Mr Cameron to introduce the . measure no later than this year in order to reinforce the Government’s . pledge to be the most family friendly ever, rather than leaving it until . 2015. Many believe it would placate Tory . voters offended by the introduction of gay marriage, and stay-at-home . mothers who will not benefit from new state support with childcare . bills. The decision to float the idea again . now will be seen as an attempt to appeal to traditional voters ahead of . the local elections on Thursday. The Tories are expected to lose 300 or . more council seats, placing further strain on Mr Cameron’s relations . with his party. Eligible couples could be up to £150 better off from a tax break for people who tie the knot but one person does not work . The Prime Minister has a problem . because when the 35 English councils up for grabs were last fought over . in 2009, it marked a high watermark for Tory fortunes and the party won . 30 councils outright, picking up 1,531 seats. This time, Labour is widely predicted to gain several hundred seats, while the Lib Dems will join the Tories in losing seats. The exact details of the marriage tax . plan have not been spelt out but it is assumed that the tax change would . mirror plans unveiled by the Tories before the 2010 general election. The Conservative manifesto proposed a . transferable tax allowance that would apply to all married couples – and . gay couples in civil partnerships – who pay the basic rate of income . tax. Spouses not using all of their . tax-free personal allowance, either because they stay at home or work . part-time and earn less than the threshold for basic rate income tax, . were to be able to transfer £750 of their benefit to their working . partner. Eligible couples where one partner is . not using all the tax-free personal allowance and the other earns up to . £44,000 would be up to £150 a year better off.","Prime Minister wants to recognise marriage in the tax system .

Radical cleric Abu Qatada should be on a plane to Jordan at 'the earliest opportunity', the Home Office said today. The UK Parliament today ratified a treaty with Jordan today which will make it possible to deport the preacher after a decade-long legal battle. Last month, the cleric unexpectedly . volunteered to leave the country as soon as the treaty between the UK . and Jordan is ratified by both countries. The deportation of radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada takes a step closer when the UK parliament ratifies the treaty with Jordan . The prospect of finally removing Qatada from the UK had seemed remote for years. Human rights judges in Britain and Strasbourg had halted his removal to Jordan on the grounds some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. But Home Secretary Theresa May announced in April that she had thrashed out a mutual assistance treaty with Jordan, guaranteeing Qatada the right to a fair trial. The deal has already been ratified by the Jordanian parliament and today it was announced that it has been signed off by the UK Parliament. A Home Office spokesman said: 'We welcome the approval of the Treaty by both the UK and Jordanian Parliaments. Our focus remains on seeing Qatada on a plane to Jordan at the earliest opportunity.' David Cameron held talks in Number . 10 this week with the King of Jordan, who has already approved the . agreement in his country. Talks: David Cameron last night met Jordan's King Abdullah II for talks in Downing Street . Deal: The UK parliament is expected to ratify the agreement with Jordan as early as today . The agreement has been approved by both houses of the Jordanian parliament and has been signed off by the country's King Abdullah. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said the issue of kicking Qatada out . of Britain was only briefly raised during the meeting with King Abdullah . because confidence is now so high that the saga is almost at an end. September 16 1993 - The Jordanian father of five claims asylum when he arrives in Britain on a forged passport. May 1998 - He applies for indefinite leave to remain in Britain. April 1999 - He is convicted in his absence on terror charges in Jordan and sentenced to life imprisonment. February 2001 . - He is arrested by anti-terror police over involvement in a plot to . bomb Strasbourg Christmas market. Officers find him in possession of . £170,000 in cash, including £805 in an envelope marked 'For the . mujahedin in Chechnya'. August 2005 - The preacher is arrested under immigration rules as the Government seeks to deport him to Jordan. April 2008 . - The Court of Appeal rules that deporting him would breach his human . rights because evidence used against him in Jordan may have been . obtained through torture. February 18 2009 . - In a landmark judgment, five Law Lords unanimously back the . Government's policy of removing terror suspects from Britain on the . basis of assurances from foreign governments. It is ruled he can be . deported to Jordan to face terror charges.April 18 2012 - Abu Qatada lodges an appeal - potentially delaying his deportation by months. March . 6 2013 - He is returned to jail over fears the terror suspect was . trying to communicate with associates, in breach of bail conditions. March 27 2013 . - Court of Appeal admits hate preacher is 'very dangerous' but rules . sending him to face a terror trial in Jordan would not be fair.April 17 2013 - Home Office says it will take its battle to the Supreme Court. April 23 2013 - Court of Appeal rejects government request to appeal. ‘We have a very clear way forward which we are actively perusing to get this individual on a plane out of the UK and back to Jordan. ‘There will remain a legal process that we will seek to expedite as quickly as possible.’ The agreement does not name Qatada directly, but it states that any evidence used to prosecute someone who is to be deported cannot be used 'unless the prosecution in the receiving State proves beyond any doubt that the statement has been provided out of free-will and choice and was not obtained by torture or ill-treatment by the authorities of the receiving State'. Ministers have been trying for a decade to send Qatada to Jordan, where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the Millennium. Last week Mrs May revealed the legal battle has cost £1,716,306 in eight years, which includes Qatada's legal aid costs of £647,658. The Home Office has spent more than £1 million pursuing the case through the courts. Qatada’s removal was originally approved by the British courts, only to be halted by the European Court of Human Rights last year. Judges in Strasbourg said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture. Controversially, Mrs May opted not to appeal against this verdict. Instead, she and her ministers secured personal promises from the Jordanian authorities there would be no use of torture evidence, and began the deportation process again in the UK legal system. But last November, the Special Immigration Appeals Commission said it was not satisfied with the assurances, and halted Qatada’s removal. The court said it must reflect the Strasbourg ruling. That decision was upheld by the Appeal Court and the same court refused permission for the Home Secretary to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court. However the treaty with Jordan is seen as a major breakthrough in finally ending the long and expensive saga. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) previously heard that a USB stick understood to belong to Qatada's oldest son contained 'jihadist files' made by the ''media wing of al Qaida'. Qatada is also being investigated by Scotland Yard over suspected extremist material found during the search of his home. The Metropolitan Police passed on the material to Danish authorities to reportedly investigate a connection with a controversial Islamic publisher.","UK parliament to ratify treaty which would clear the way for deportation .

David Cameron's Chief Whip was last night at the centre of allegations that he has used ‘leaked’ MPs’ expenses to ‘bully’ enemies of the Prime Minister. The claims have been made by Tory rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against Mr Cameron’s policies on Europe and gay marriage. They accuse Sir George Young – who is charged with imposing discipline on the increasingly fractious Parliamentary party – of ‘victimising’ them by using confidential details of their travel and housing claims. Controversy: Sir George Young, left, is at the centre of allegations he has used 'leaked' MPs' expenses to 'bully' enemies of the Prime Minister, right . Now one rebel MP has made a formal complaint to the Government’s official watchdog, the Information Commissioner. He has accused the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) – the body that monitors MPs’ pay and perks – of breaching the Data Protection Act by passing information to Sir George. The MP, who has defied the whips to call for a cut in the EU budget and vote against gay marriage but asked not to be identified, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Sir George warned me that I should play ball with Ipsa, or risk personal financial details being made public. I feel that amounted to blackmail. ‘I wrote to Sir Ian Kennedy, the chairman of Ipsa, to complain, and received a letter back which told me that, “MPs should not be surprised that Ipsa has dealings with Chief Whips”. Allegations: The claims have been made by Tory rebels who say it is part of a campaign of intimidation to stop them speaking out against Mr Cameron¿s policies on Europe and gay marriage . ‘That is why I have complained to the Commissioner. Ipsa should not be passing information to third parties.’ Relations between MPs and Ipsa have become increasingly acrimonious since it introduced a rule that requires them to hand back a share of the profit on  the rising value of taxpayer-funded  second homes. It has left some MPs facing demands for more than £50,000. The row has broken out amid claims that Sir George has found out which rebels owe money to Ipsa and then used the information to ‘intimidate’ them – an allegation that is strongly denied. Another MP claimed he was told by Sir George that he should settle a disputed expenses claim if ‘he wanted to be an MP at the next Election’. A third MP said: ‘Sir George is trying to find a new way to victimise and bully the rebels, threatening to take their whip away or “tell the boss” if they don’t cough up to Ipsa.’ A source close to Sir George said:  ‘It is complete paranoid nonsense to suggest that the Chief Whip has in any way used MPs’ expenses difficulties as a way of enforcing discipline. It’s just not his style. ‘It is perfectly normal for the Chief Whip to discuss an MP’s expenses with them if there is an issue. ‘The information about the expenses of the MP who has complained was  not confidential.’ Last night, an Ipsa spokesman said it was ‘perfectly reasonable’ for the body to ‘raise concerns’ about MPs with chief whips. ‘Where MPs claimed for a subsidy from the taxpayer for their mortgage, we ask for the taxpayer’s share of any increase in the value of the property,’ he said. ‘If an MP refused to comply with  that rule, we would challenge that,  and it is reasonable that we raise  our concerns.’","Sir George Young accused of 'victimising' rebel MPs by using their claims .

Officials at the Best Friends Animal Society say Lucas was euthanized Wednesday because of accumulating health problems. Nearly two dozen of the Vick dogs were rehabilitated at Best Friends in Kanab, Utah. Lucas was one of two not allowed to be adopted because of his history as a fighter. Pit bull Lucas, once one of Michael Vick's best fighting dogs has been euthanized after accumulating health problems . Lucas, who bears scars from fighting, was described as 'a blessing to be around' by staff at the sanctuary where he lived . So, he spent most of his time lounging in the administrative offices at Best Friends, where he was widely known as one of the friendliest dogs at the sanctuary. Gregory Castle, the CEO at Best Friends, says it was 'a blessing in every way to be around him and to witness the wonderful effects on everyone he met.' In April 2007, Vick then of the Atlanta Falcons was implicated in an illegal interstate dog fighting ring that had operated for five years. He pleaded guilty to federal felony charges and served 21 months in prison.

The arthritic dog whose owner was pictured lulling him through the pain in a lake reached the incredible age of 20 in spite of his illness. Owner John Unger posted a new photo of the German shepherd chowing down on a festive birthday cake in celebration. The story of loyal dog Shoep became an international sensation when the picture of Unger wading in Lake Superior with him was viewed by millions last year.

World-wide fans: After an image of Shoep being lulled by his owner to ease his arthritis pain went viral, he has gained a cult following- some of who sent him cards . Since then, their story has served as the inspiration for a charity called the Schoep Legacy Foundation which has raised more than $25,000 to help low-income families care for their aging dogs thanks to donations from people as far away as Saudi Arabia and Japan, all inspired by the gorgeous image. Mr Unger's good friend Hannah Stonehouse Hudson, who is a professional photographer, captured the heartbreaking moment between the man and his aging rescue dog in Wisconsin when Mr Unger thought his best friend was at the end of his life. But thanks to the generosity of strangers, Schoep has been receiving top-notch care and is wagging his tail more than ever before, allowing Mr Unger and his dog more time together.

'It could help another 30 or 40 Schoeps,' Dr Haukass said. 'It's incredible to be in a position to help others,' Mr Unger said. But beyond helping other animals, Mr Unger said that he's found himself counseling people who have had to deal with a devastating loss in their lives. Along with donations, people have been sending Mr Unger their personal stories of woe. 'They're going through some depression of their own. They're very deep and emotional letters. Those are the ones that hit home a lot,' Mr Unger said. 'But they look at the picture that Hannah took and it helps them have a better time with it. That's pretty extraordinary.' Mr Unger knows first hand about love and loss. He and his ex-fiancée adopted Schoep 19 years ago, but when the relationship ended, Mr Unger was on the brink of suicide. 'To be honest with you, I don’t think I’d be here if I didn’t have Schoep with me (that night). He just snapped me out of it. I don’t know how to explain it.

'We just hadn't found the right one.' His then-fiancée they spotted the pup at the Ozaukee Animal Shelter 19 years ago. 'We fell in love with her immediately,' Mr Unger told the MailOnline. Schoep . was in a cage with another dog, possibly his mother, crouched in the . back quietly staring at the corner with his back to Mr Unger. 'I knew - that's him,' Mr Unger said. At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse. 'He didn't even know what toys were,' Mr Unger said. 'I really wanted this dog because I wanted him to enjoy life.' The couple worked hard to establish the trust of the dog and eventually brought out its 'full potential'.

Vintage: At the time Schoep was named Tramp by the shelter staff and showed signs of abuse . When Schoep was in so much pain, it is Mr Unger's time to return the favor. Suffering from excruciating arthritis, the animal was not sleeping through the night and could barely walk. ‘Schoep falls asleep every night when he is carried into the lake. The buoyancy of the water soothes his arthritic bones. Lake Superior is very warm right now, so the temp of the water is perfect,' Mrs Hudson explained. Mr Unger could not afford the costly treatments, which at $200 dollars a session, would ease Schoep's pain. But after Mrs Hudson's photograph traveled across the world, thousands of dollars came pouring in. Treatment: Schoep has been getting joint laser treatments, which reduce pain and swelling while healing the animal's limbs, as well as pain medication from the Bay Area Animal Hospital . Gift: 'He's walking so much faster,' Mr Unger said. 'His stride, his gait, is longer. It's unbelievable' Friends: 'He sleeps through the night. He's interested in going for more walks during the day,' Dr Haukass said. 'He walks with less of a limp. His ears are standing up and his tail is wagging better' 'We didn't expect any of this,' Mr Unger said. 'Then, when the donations did start coming in for his care, they didn't stop.'

'I took Schoep in for a check up because he was limping,' Mr Unger said. The doctor recommend pain medication, but said that it may be temporary or not help at all. Inspired: This image has touched thousands . Then, Mr Unger said, the doctor told him, ' ""If there isn't any improvement, we should probably..."" a good vet wont say ""put him down,"" but he said at that point I may start to want to think about it.' Faced with the possibility of losing his best friend, he called up Mrs Hudson for an impromptu session. She met the pair at sunset on Lake Superior, because Schoep's cataracts prevent him from seeing in sunlight. 'She couldn't believe he fell asleep in my arms,' Mr Unger said. Mrs Hudson watched the man and his dog float around the lake for maybe five minutes before Schoep began to get cold and shake. Mr Unger said he had to take him out of the water to let him warm up and was worried she hadn't had the chance to snap an image. 'I didn't think she even took one picture,' he said. 'But then she told me she got what she wanted.'","Schoep was in so much pain that owner John Unger, 49, thought he was close to the end .

A Bollywood superstar and his wife are under investigation by health officials in India following reports that the couple know the sex of a baby they are having through a surrogate mother. A complaint to India's health authorities has alleged that Shah Rukh Khan and his wife Gauri know they . are expecting a boy. Sex determination tests are banned in India to stop the practice of aborting female fetuses due to a preference for sons. Controversy: Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, left, and his wife Gauri, right, are facing an investigation by health officials in India folowing reports that the couple know the sex of a baby they are having through a surrogate mother . India's Health Ministry has now launched an investigation. The Press Trust of India reported that Khan was not at home when authorities tried to question him about the reports that the surrogate mother had the test. Khan - who has a 16-year-old son and a 13-year-old daughter - has so far not commentated. Speaking to CNN, Dr Jignesh Thakkar of the Indian Radiological & Imaging Association, said that the health ministry investigated the case at its request. 'We wanted to know how this apparently had been . leaked out because it's confidential information that only a doctor and . not even a patient knows,' he said. Complaint: The 47-year-old actor is popularly known as `King Khan' in the Indian film industry. He is now facing an investigation by health officials . 'Action should be taken against . doctors and patients who are not following this law.' The 47-year-old actor is popularly known as `King Khan' in the Indian film industry. He has acted in around 75 Hindi feature films, including many box-office hits. He has also hosted a season of the Hindi version of the game show, ""Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?"" He and his childhood sweetheart Gauri have a son and a daughter. India's 2011 census showed that the country had 914 girls for every 1,000 boys under age 6, a gender ratio mainly attributed to sex-selective abortions despite the ban on prenatal gender tests. As well as being banned in India, sex determination tests are also banned throughout Asia because of a traditional preference for sons. Doctors found to have provided information to parents about the sex of an unborn child could face three years in jail. They could also have their medical license suspended for five years. Parents could also face five years in jail. Sex detection was banned in India in 1996 in attempt to stop the abortions of girls. However, experts say it has had little impact on the country's unbalanced sex ratio. The preference for sons has been historically confined to upper castes but with the country's society advancing over the years, the practice has also been taken on by the middle classes .","India's Health Ministry investigating Shah Rukh Khan and his wife .

A teenage boy has admitted religiously harassing a McDonald's worker - by persistently mocking her because she is a Pagan. The 16-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, visited the fast food restaurant frequently over a period of more than six weeks to taunt the woman over her beliefs. The case is understood to be the first in the UK to involve a case of religious harassment against a Pagan. The boy, who lives in Lawford, Essex, pleaded guilty to religiously aggravated harassment at Colchester youth court on Wednesday. Religion: A 16-year-old boy has admitted religiously harassing a Pagan in Essex. Pagans, such as these at Stonehenge, worship a variety of deities . Magistrates banned him from contacting the woman and gave him a three month referral order, which means he must report to a panel of youth workers and may be forced to do unpaid work. The court heard how the boy  repeatedly went to the McDonald's restaurant in Colchester, Essex, between December 24, 2001 and February 18 and harassed the female employee because she was a Pagan. Paganism, the followers of which include druids, shamans and heathens, is recognised as a religion under UK law. Prosecutor Simon Newell said: 'Religiously aggravated harassment is an unusual offence - the first I have dealt with, especially one where perhaps not everyone would consider it a religion, but it is deemed to be so. 'The defendant has found out others have called her a Pagan and he has jumped on the bandwagon. Diverse: The Pagan community features a range of people, including druids, shamans and heathens. Paganism is classed as a religion . Banned: The boy, 16, has been banned from eating in the McDonald's in Colchester, Essex . 'He was soon made aware of the effect it was having by the victim and senior staff. 'He knew this was unacceptable and then continued. 'He accepted in interview he did it to annoy her.' However, Mr Newell added: 'He did not know it constituted religious aggravation and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.' Paganism describes a group of contemporary religions based on a reverence for nature. It encompasses a diverse community, including Wiccans, druids, shamans, sacred ecologists and heathens. The majority of Pagans share an ecological vision that comes from the belief in the spirituality of the natural world. Pagans do not worship the devil or practice 'black magic' and their practices do not involve . harming people or animals. The number of Pagans in Great Britain is estimated at between 50,000 and 200,000. The Prison Service recognised Paganism as a religion in 2000. Laura Austin, mitigating, said: 'He is apologetic and did not realise Paganism was a recognised religion. 'The teasing was going to a level where the victim got very upset about it. 'His parents are not happy with him and have imposed their own curfew. 'You do wonder if the employers could or should have done more to prevent the behaviour.' The court was told the teenager had been banned from eating in the restaurant and was only allowed to order food to takeaway. The boy had an existing referral order, which magistrates extended by three months. He was also given a restraining order, banning contact between the teenager and his victim until November. After he was sentenced, the boy offered to write a letter of apology to his victim. No order was made for costs or compensation. Cas Morehan, the franchise holder of the McDonald's store, said: 'Unfortunately there are instances where staff are subjected to harassment and abuse by customers.'","Boy persistently visited McDonald's to mock the woman .

Maurice Wrightson, 64, has been praised for his 'remarkable courage' after it was revealed he frantically shouted to passengers: 'There's a problem with the brakes' as he tried to steer them to safety. Mr Wrightson worked for Classic Coaches, based at Annfield Plain, County Durham. A crane hoists the frame of the bus which crashed and burned on the road from l'Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps.The driver was killed, and three people were severely injured . It has been revealed the doomed driver of the coach which crashed in the French Alps tried desperately to warn his 50 passengers there was a problem moments before the horror smash . Frédéric Cuvillier, minister of . transport, said: 'You can’t call it a miracle because there is one dead . and many wounded. But the human toll could have been much heavier. 'The driver’s courage saved many . lives. All the testimonies of the people we have met have confirmed . this. His attitude and his actions prevented an even worse situation.' The driver was killed in the . horrendous smash. Other people were catapulted out of the bus and some . jumped from the moving vehicle. There were 53 people on board, including two drivers. The vehicle apparently suffered brake . failure at the foot of the notorious, twisting descent from the ski . resort of Alpe D’Huez. Eyewitnesses said many of the . passengers – seasonal ski-company employees returning to the UK – flung . themselves from the shattered coach windows as the vehicle rapidly . turned into a ball of fire. Heath Williams, managing director of TGM, the coach firm’s parent company, paid tribute to Mr Wrightson. He told the Northern Echo: 'We are deeply saddened to learn that one of our two drivers on board has died. 'We are offering our full support to his family and our thoughts are with them at this difficult time. Early indications are that our driver tried to take evasive action and that he alerted passengers. 'We pay tribute to him for his efforts, and also to our relief driver who helped people to leave the vehicle.' A ski instructor, Loïc Glénat, was one of the first in the scene. He was making his way down the winding Alpine road after his morning’s work. He said: 'There were three cars ahead of me and then the bus. I kept my distance because the exhaust fumes are smelly. 'So I didn’t see the exact moment when the bus collided mountain. I saw right after ... It started to smoke. ' The identity of the driver has not been released but all travelling on the coach are believed to have been British . The coach careered off a steep . mountain road which has 21 hairpin bends - leading to fears that the . vehicle's brakes may have failed . He quickly set up a road-block and called the emergency services. He said: 'I made the call at 2.40pm. When I approached the bus, I saw young people coming out of the windows, . through the rear window in particular. They had to break it.' The ski instructor, who speaks English, remained on the scene to help with translation. He said: 'I asked them what had . happened. Apparently, between turn 20 and turn 21, the driver told them . that there was a brake problem. Upon impact, they knew ... they were . expecting it.' A journalist from a local newspaper, . who happened to be on was on his way to the resort of Alpe D’Huez, was . also quickly on the scene. He said: 'It looked like a war scene.' The accident happened in the Alpe . d'Huez ski resort - three passengers are understood to be in a serious . condition, while 17 suffered minor injuries . Burnt out: The 51 passengers are understood to be travelling back to the UK after working a ski season for Brighton-based company Skibound which organises trips for schools . He said: 'It was almost 3.30pm. I was . just about to start the climb to Alpe d'Huez when I saw a black plume . tearing into the blue sky. When I arrived, the front of the bus was . already on fire and the flames had moved towards the rear of the . vehicle. 'The bus was against the huge rocks . that extend around the parapet of turn 21, the last of the descent, a . protection which prevented it from tipping over the cliff. There were . people on the scene, no relief, but two young people who seemed totally . shocked. 'I left my car to see if they needed . help. One of the two stammered in English: ""There are people inside ... It's horrible. You have water?” It was a young man from Devon, called . Richie - one of the survivors of the bus accident. 'He complained of . hurting his arm when he came out of the pile of metal. His friend, . equally confused, lived in Bristol. The other passengers were recovered . from the wreck and they stood on the road ahead. ""We were on the way back,"" Richie . said. ""I was a few rows behind the two drivers when I heard the driver . shout: ""There is a problem with the brakes ... ""The bus then crashed . into the rocks. A sudden shock and then immediately it caught fire. I do . not know how I got out ... but I think the drivers were stuck,"" he . said. Three people remain in hospital with . serious injuries. One of them, a woman, was last night  transferred from . the CHU hospital in Grenoble to the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyon, . which has a specialist burns unit. It is believed she suffered 80 per . cent burns. According to local reports, the panicked . bus driver shouted to his passengers that there was a problem just . moments before the crash . Failed: A firefighter works on the wreckage of the coach which was carrying two drivers and 51 passengers . Help: A helicopter was seen at the site airlifting passengers to hospital and several passengers were taken for treatment by road . A further 22 people were still in hospital last night being treated for minor injuries. The rest of the group was accommodated for in a hotel in Grenoble, where a psychological unit was set up. Bilingual police officers have been drafted in to interview the passengers. Some of the passengers initially refused to board the bus that was to take them away from the scene. It is expected that many of those uninjured in the crash will be repatriated to the UK today. The bus was carrying seasonnaire staff employed by SkiBound. The employees were returning to the UK. The tragedy is the third to hit the company SkiBound this year. In February a 13-year-old girl died on a school skiing trip in Piemonte, northern Italy.  Poonam Bhattal was involved in an accident on a chairlift. SkiBound organised the trip. And in January a British teenager drowned in a swimming pool after a night out with friends in Alpe D’Huez. Details of those involved in the crash have not yet been released . People were believed to have been trapped inside the vehicle once it caught fire . Lucy Sallis, 19, became trapped under a tarpaulin that partly covered the municipal pool.  Lucy was employed by SkiBound. Alpe D’Huez is the most famous cycle . climb in the world. It has 21 switchbacks and rises over eight miles to a . height of 6100 feet. Each bend is numbered with a board, . starting at bend 21 at the bottom. The hairpin bends are named after the . winners of the stages. Alpe D’Huez is also one of Europe’s . premier ski resorts. With 182 miles of piste and 84 ski lifts, it is one . of the world’s largest resorts. The bus was a Classic Coaches chartered service operated by UK coach operator TGM.

The controversial star's Messiah Complex world tour focuses on icons including Che Guevara, Mahatma Gandhi, Malcolm X and Jesus Christ, and examines 'the importance of heroes in this age of atheistic disposability'. It originally included dates in Abu Dhabi and Lebanon, but they have now been scrapped. Brand, 38, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Richard Bacon show: ‘The venues contacted us to say we can no longer guarantee your safety.’ He said there was concern about what content could be included in his shows, adding: 'Also the image by the brilliant artist Shepard Fairey does depict me looking a little bit Christ-like, looking off forlorn, thinking, with a necklace with various religious and corporate insignia on them. 'I suppose there's an indication that it might be offensive. Probably if you are in some sort of fundamentalist group in Abu Dhabi and then you Google my name and then watch a few things on YouTube, you'll probably think: ""Yeah, just don't bother having him here. Get someone else"". 'I think you're safety is never guaranteed at any point. Death awaits. So I was like ""Oh please, I really want to go to Abu Dhabi"". For me that makes it more of appealing idea (to perform if my safety isn't guaranteed). I said my safety is never guaranteed at any point - I'd still come if you want.' The tour started on June 12 in Chicago, Illionois, and ends in Reykjavik, Iceland, on December 9. Revelation: Earlier this week, his ex-wife, Katy Perry, revealed that Brand told her he was divorcing her in a text message. The couple split just 14 months after getting married in India in 2010 .

Crash victim: Paula Jurek, 20, a student from Poland, died after being hit by a lorry at a junction . A lorry with a faulty indicator crushed a cyclist to death without the driver even realising what he had done, an inquest heard yesterday. A loose bulb in the indicator meant that Paula Jurek had no idea the vehicle was turning into her path. The 20-year-old tourism undergraduate suffered multiple injuries and died almost instantly as she went under its front wheel. Witnesses told St Pancras Coroner’s Court they did not see driver Barry Roe indicate before making the left turn. His lorry was later found to have had a bulb fitted incorrectly to its left side indicator. Road traffic collision investigator Paul Deneyes told the inquest: 'It wasn't that it was broken as such, it was that the bulb wasn't fitted correctly. 'It's possible that a cyclist travelling on the near side of the lorry may not have known it was making a left turn because they could not see the indicator.' Eyewitnesses said they didn't see the driver indicate before it hit Miss Jurek, a management and tourism student at London Metropolitan University. AA patrolman Romain Lamamy said: 'The front wheel of the lorry went over her. 'I told him he had driven over a cyclist. I told him several times and pointed her out under the wheel. I was shocked that he had not noticed.' The accident happened at the junction between Camden Road and St Pancras Way in Camden, north London, on April 5, 2011. Mr Roe, who was acquitted of causing death by careless driving at a subsequent trial, told the inquest that he did not see Miss Jurek, who had come to Britain from Poland two years earlier. He said: 'As I moved off I checked all my mirrors. I was stationary at the lights, then they changed to green and it's then that I indicated. 'I did not know about the defect with the indicator light. I checked it that morning. I checked the lights and the tyres. It's normal procedure.' Recording a verdict of death by road traffic collision, Deputy Coroner Selena Lynch said: 'I have come to no conclusion about whether or not the indicators were activated by the driver of the lorry. Junction accident: Paula, 20, who had been in Britain for two years, was studying a management and tourism at London Metropolitan University . 'The deceased was riding her pedal cycle and as she approached the lights she came to a standstill to the left of the lorry. She was not visible to the driver, even through his rear and side view mirrors. 'The rear side indicator was defective and the deceased was not aware the lorry was turning left. 'My verdict is one of road traffic collision. I am afraid this isn't the first such case of this type. I have done many over the years. 'There's a great conflict on London roads between users. Great dangers arise when cyclists and lorries come into contact with one and other. It's always the cyclist that comes off worse. 'Perhaps the only comfort we can take is that this death did not involve a lot of suffering as Miss Jurek was unconscious almost instantaneously.' Accident spot: Student Paula Jurek was cycling straight along Camden Road (pictured) when she was hit by the lorry as it made a left turn into St Pancras Way at the junction . After the inquest Paula's angry mother, Iwona, who travelled over from Poland for the hearing, said: 'We didn't know this was an inquest, we thought it was the court case. We have only found out the driver had been acquitted. 'We're shocked and angry. There has been no communication. We have been waiting for two years for justice. After hearing the evidence we still have doubts and want to take the matter further. Justice would make the matter easier to take.' Paying tribute to her 'special' daughter, she added: 'She had big dreams. She was very intelligent. 'She had lived in London for two years and loved it here. She loved people and wanted to travel the world. She was special.' A spokesman for the London Cycling campaign said: ‘Crashes with large lorries account for about half the cyclist deaths in London. 'We at the LCC have been campaigning to improve the equipment on lorries and for all drivers to have extra training including sessions riding a bike. 'It is difficult to understand how the driver in this case was acquitted for failing to see Paula. If he was turning into a ""blind spot"" he should have done it with extreme care. ‘We have called for that junction to be made safer with a safe area for cyclists but to date nothing has been done.’","Student Paula Jurek died in the accident at a busy central London junction .

The geiger counter wristwatch worn by Sean Connery in the James Bond film Thunderball is to go under the hammer after it was bought for £25 at a car boot sale. The whereabouts of the Breitling Top Time watch had been a mystery for years until it turned up at the sale. The . prop - one of the many gadgets used by 007 during his 50 years . on-screen - helped Bond locate stolen atomic weapons during underwater scenes in the 1965 film. Scroll down for video . James Bond's Breitling Top Time watch, seen in Thunderball, was bought for £25 at a car boot sale following years of mystery as to its whereabouts . Now the watch is to be sold by . Christie's in London with an estimated price of up to £60,000. The . Top Time model by the Swiss firm was the first watch that audiences saw being adapted by Q's team of boffins in the series. It was one of a . number of items given to Bond by Q - played by Desmond Llewelyn - when . he headed over to Nassau in the Bahamas to give him extra equipment. One of the hands of . the watch shows the strength of radioactivity, to help him track down two Nato atomic bombs stolen by SPECTRE. The . basic watch was originally made by Breitling in 1962, then adapted by . the James Bond art department. It was the only one produced for the . movie. It is thought that the watch was passed on by someone who worked at Pinewood Studios, where most of the film was made. The watch helped Sean Connery's Bond to track down two Nato bombs stolen by SPECTRE in 1965's Thunderball . Christie's, which will sell the watch in a Pop Culture sale on June 26, had little further detail . about the bargain hunter who found the watch, or where it was found. A spokesman said: 'This is a great opportunity for collectors to acquire a unique piece of James Bond memorabilia.' Bond's watches became an essential part of his armoury - as well as money-spinning merchandise for the franchise. Thunderball was the only time a Breitling made an appearance in the films, while Hamilton and TAG Haeur made one-off appearances in Live and Let Die and The Living Daylights respectively. But the classic Bond watch was decided in Ian Fleming's novels - the Rolex. In 1962's Dr No, producer Cubby Broccoli had to lend Sean Connery his own Rolex as the company would not loan one for the production. Pierce Brosnan's Bond, left, adopted the Omega Seamaster in the 1990s while the classic Rolex Submariner helped Roger Moore dodge death and unzip dresses in Live and Let Die . The Rolex Submariner became synonymous with Bond, appearing on his wrist in Dr No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Live and Let Die and The Man with the Golden Gun, returning for one final outing in 1989's Licence to Kill. Bond's watches were far more than accessories, with the timepieces adapted into gadgets by Q-Branch. In Live and Let Die, Roger Moore used his Rolex to unzip the dress of agent Miss Caruso with the line: 'Sheer magnetism, darling', while it also doubled as a buzz-saw to help his escape death-by-sharks. The Breitling in Thunderball helped him track down atomic bombs, while the production team opted for Seiko digital watches in the 1970s and 80s. In The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond received ticker tape messages out of his watch, while in Moonraker his Seiko had built-in explosives and a detonator. Other Seikos included GPS tracking devices and a TV screen for 007 to take video calls. Bond's timepiece became a sleek Omega Seamaster in the 1990s, thought to be more modern than the Rolex. It first appeared in GoldenEye on Pierce Brosnan's wrist and is still worn by Daniel Craig, who became an ambassador for the brand.","Sean Connery's Bond used the watch to find stolen Nato atomic bombs .

Amanda Knox collapsed and had to be supported by her boyfriend yesterday when she was told she would face a retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher. The American was at home with her family in Seattle when she received a phone call at 2am telling her an Italian court had quashed her acquittal for the killing. She was shattered by the news, and turned to her lover James Terrano in an attempt to 'keep positive' despite the new development. Knox, 25, will not voluntarily return to Italy to stand trial, and is unlikely to be extradited by her native U.S. - she will therefore probably be tried in absentia. Scroll down for video . Retrial: Amanda Knox holds hands with her boyfriend James Terrano in downtown Seattle on Sunday . Questions: Meredith Kercher's sister Stephanie Kercher, left, said at her family's home in Coulsdon, Surrey: 'There are a lot of unanswered questions still'. Right, her sister before her 2007 death . 'The colour ran from her face as she heard the news,' a source told the Sun. Her lawyer phoned her family home in . the early hours of the morning after she had gathered relatives and . friends together to wait for confirmation of the court's decision. 'She hugged James and then the rest of the family,' the source said. 'They are trying to keep positive but it is hard.' Yesterday’s ruling by the supreme court in Rome means the case will be tried again next year. Judges . accepted that there were ‘contradictions’ in the case, quashing the . acquittal of Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, . 29. In a dramatic turnaround, the pair, . who both spent four years behind bars before they were cleared, were . told they must stand trial again for the murder of the 21-year-old . British student. Knox, who has rebuilt her life in her . home town of Seattle, cannot be compelled by Italian law to . appear at the retrial and might not face extradition for years, if at . all. Meredith's sister Stephanie and mother Arline welcomed the news about the retrial on Tuesday . Jailed: Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29, spent four years in jail, but were freed on appeal in 2011 largely on the grounds DNA evidence was flawed . Her lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova said: . ‘Amanda does not intend to come back for the retrial. Her home is in . Seattle and she doesn’t need to be here.’ He added that the decision to order a . new trial was shocking. ‘She thought that the nightmare was over,’ he . said on the steps of the courthouse. ‘But she’s ready to fight.’ Within minutes of the ruling, Knox . issued a statement condemning it. The girl known worldwide by her . self-awarded nickname 'Foxy Knoxy' said: ‘It was painful to receive the . news that the Italian supreme court decided to send my case back for . revision when the prosecution’s theory of my involvement in Meredith’s . murder has been repeatedly revealed to be completely unfounded and . unfair. ‘I believe that any questions as to my innocence must be examined by an objective investigation and a capable prosecution. ‘The prosecution responsible for the . many discrepancies in their work must be made to answer for them, for . Raffaele’s sake, my sake, and most especially for the sake of Meredith’s . family.’ Knox and Sollecito spoke on the phone . soon after yesterday’s verdict. Sollecito’s current girlfriend Annie . Achille said: ‘They will see what can be done.’ She added that her . boyfriend, who turned 29 yesterday, is ‘destroyed’ and not talking to . anyone. Meredith Kercher, from Coulsdon, . Surrey, was in Italy as an exchange student from Leeds University. She . was found dead in 2007, in the cottage she shared with Knox in the . picturesque hilltop town of Perugia. Her throat had been slit and her . semi-naked body had been covered with a duvet. After a lengthy trial in . Perugia, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of the murder in December . 2009 and sentenced to 26 and 25 years respectively, . But two years later the pair were . freed after an appeal court found that the case had been botched and DNA . evidence contaminated. A third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA . and bloody footprints were found all over the crime scene, is serving a . 16-year prison sentence, reduced from 30 years on appeal. Meredith’s family welcomed yesterday’s . judgment. Her sister Stephanie said: ‘We are never going to be happy . about any outcome because we have still lost Meredith but we obviously . support the decision and hope to get answers from it. There are still so . many unanswered questions. All we have ever wanted to do is do what we . can for Meredith and to find out the truth of what happened that night.’ Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito were seen kissing in the wake of the murder . Knox had rejoiced after her conviction . was sensationally overturned in 2011. She fled Italy within hours, . returning home to the US, where she quickly embraced life as a free . woman. She now shares a flat with boyfriend James Terrano, a classical . guitarist, and is studying at the University of Washington in Seattle, . where she can be near her parents and three sisters. The former student is preparing for . the publication next month of  a memoir for which she has been paid a . reported £2.5million. Sollecito remained in Italy and is studying . robotic surgery at the University of Verona. He has already released a . book about his experience. In it he said that he and Knox were still in . touch – he visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype . regularly. The retrial will be held in Florence, with different judges, to avoid accusations of prejudice against the accused pair. Rudy Guede was identified by police after his bloody fingerprint was found on a cushion at the scene of the crime. The . 21-year-old Ivory Coast national had given his fingerprints when he . applied for an Italian identity card several years earlier. He was known to police as a petty thief and small time drug dealer. Guede . had arrived in Italy in 1992 as a five year-old child with his father . Roger, who left his wife behind in west Africa to seek work in Italy. But . when Guede was 15 Roger went back to Africa, leaving his son behind in . the care of a multi-millionaire Paolo Caporali who had . occasionally employed the boy in odd jobs. In . the summer of 2007, Guede rented a flat in the centre of Perugia and . became friendly with four male students who lived in the flat below Miss . Kercher and Knox. In . September and October Guede was linked to three break-ins - two in . Perugia and one in Milan. Following the murder he fled Perugia and went to Germany on a train. He was arrested there and extradited back to Italy. In . October 2008 he was sentenced to 30 years in jail for the murder and . sexual assault of Miss Kercher after opting for a fast-track trial. The day before his arrest on suspicion of Meredith Kercher's murder, Patrick Lumumba had been handing out flyers publicising a candlelit vigil in her memory. Mr Lumumba, a well-known and popular figure in Perugia for a decade, . was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He is believed to be . related to murdered Congolese prime minister Patrice Lumumba. He arrived . in Italy legally in 1988. Married with a young child, he opened a . bar and restaurant called Le Chic on a narrow street in Perugia town . centre in August 2007. The same month that Miss Kercher arrived to begin a . short Italian course. He employed her housemate Amanda Knox to help him with promotional work, before firing her for flirting with customers. He believes Knox took her revenge by framing him for Miss Kercher's murder. Mr . Lumumba was arrested on suspicion of causing her death on November 6. He spent two weeks in prison before being able to prove that he spent . the night of the killing talking to a customer in his pub.

The young boy who made global headlines four years ago at the center of the infamous ‘Balloon Boy’ hoax is now fronting a heavy metal band with his two older brothers. In 2009, six-year-old Falcon Heene was at the center of a media storm after his parents claimed he had boarded a homemade helium-filled flying saucer which had broken free of its restraints and floated away. TV cameras captured the frantic chase, until the silver balloon dramatically touched down and the young boy was nowhere to be found. Scroll down for video . Young rocker: Four years on from the 'Balloon Boy' hoax Falcon Heene is fronting the 'world's youngest heavy metal band' Falcon Heene was just six-years-old in 2009 when father Richard claimed his son had been carried away in a helium balloon . It later turned out Falcon had been hiding in the family garage in Fort Collins, Colorado and parents Richard and Mayumi Heene confessed they had invented the whole tale in a bid to attract interest in a reality TV show about their family. With a traumatic experience like that under his belt and still only ten-years-old, it perhaps isn’t that surprising that young Falcon now appears to have grown into an angsty young boy who has chosen to express himself through the medium of heavy metal music. Four years on from the balloon incident young Falcon is fronting the Heene Boyz, the self-proclaimed 'World's Youngest Metal Band.' The power trio consist of Falcon on vocals and bass, Bradford Heene, 13, on guitar, and Ryo Heene, 12, on drums are playing New York's Sullivan Hall later this month as they celebrate the launch of their second album 'American Chili'.

GPs are being warned that they face legal action if they refuse to accept illegal immigrants as patients. Human rights lawyers have been threatening doctors who have removed failed asylum seekers from their surgery lists – even though they are not entitled to free NHS care. Meanwhile, figures reveal that foreigners, including tourists and migrants, have been given an estimated £40million of free NHS treatment in the past three years. Anyone who does normally live  in the UK – including tourists – is meant to pay for any NHS treatment they receive. The only exceptions are urgent care received in A&E departments or treatment for certain infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Refugees and asylum seekers are given free NHS treatment, but if their application to remain in the UK is turned down by the Home Office they lose the entitlement. But government guidelines on when to provide free healthcare are vague and simply advise GPs to ‘use their discretion’. Figures obtained by Pulse magazine show that some hospitals are managing to claw back only a quarter of the costs owed to them by so-called health tourists. Its investigation also revealed that one surgery in Essex had been ordered to reinstate two failed  asylum seekers from Nigeria after being threatened with legal action by human rights solicitors. Doctors had removed the couple after their asylum application  had been turned down by the Home Office. But they subsequently received a letter from Bristol-based law firm Pierce Glynn threatening legal action unless they were reinstated, and they have now been put back on the books. The manager of the surgery said that they were urged by their local primary care trust to reinstate the patients. The unnamed member of staff said: ‘Someone at the PCT read the letter and panicked. 'Hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people cannot exploit the system.' ‘Do we just register everyone who is illegal?’ Another practice in Leeds was also told not to remove illegal immigrants in the face of similar threats. Tory MP Chris Skidmore, who sits on the Health Select Committee, accused lawyers of ‘piggy backing’ on the NHS. He said: ‘GPs are under enough pressure. They should not be made to feel accountable for not registering people who have no legal right to treatment. ‘I fear this is only the tip of the iceberg. In many cases, staff may not be asking people’s nationality as it is beyond the hospital or clinic to recover the costs of treatment. Refugees and asylum seekers are given . free NHS treatment, but if their application to remain in the UK is . turned down by the Home Office they lose the entitlement. ‘Given that NHS resources are going to be stretched, these are savings which should be made.’ Dr Richard Vautrey, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Hospital trusts must put in place arrangements that ensure people cannot exploit the system.’ The investigation obtained data from 35 hospital trusts in England showing that on average they had debts of £230,000 owed by foreigners since 2009. If that figure is replicated across all 168 hospital trusts in the country, then the NHS would collectively be owed £40million from health tourists. This included St George’s Healthcare Trust in London, which had recovered only £1.5 million from the £3.5 million owed. Another trust, Royal Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, had managed to recover only 24 per cent of the £419,000 owed by foreign nationals. Health minister Simon Burns said: ‘We won’t tolerate abuse of our National Health Service. The NHS has a duty to anyone whose life or long-term health is at immediate risk, but it is not there to serve the health needs of the globe.’","Foreign nationals, including migrants and tourists, have received £40m of free NHS treatment in last three years, figures show ."

When their women's 4 x 100m freestyle relay team swam to gold on the opening night of the London Olympics, millions of Australians thought the sleep deprivation necessary to watch the Games would be worth it. And though that tally wasn't immediately built upon, they could still delight in a barren start for the Brits on their home turf. The Sydney Telegraph took great pleasure on the fourth day of competition in pointing out that Kazakhstan had three more gold medals than the hosts - 'Go Team Borat!' they screamed. The whole of Australia looked forward to the inevitable avalanche of precious metal. Tom Slingsby won Australia's second gold medal of the Olympics in the men's laser class sailing today, 11 days after the first . It all started so well for the Aussies when (left to right) Melanie Schlanger, Alicia Coutts, Brittany Elmslie and Cate Campbell took gold in the women's 4 x 100m freestyle relay on Day One . But their mickey-taking has backfired in spectacular fashion - sure, Tom Slingsby took gold in the sailing laser class at Weymouth today but the Aussies' total after 10 days of the Olympics still stands at a measly two gold medals. And it is worth pointing out now that this is less than Kazakhstan - and Belarus, Cuba, Romania and 20 other nations. Great Britain, by contrast, has 16 golds and third place in the standings. While Team GB has seen a gold rush just about every day, Australia is currently averaging one medal every six. Long before the closing ceremony, the Olympic authorities, press and bleary-eyed armchair pundits Down Under have already accepted that its athletes have put on their worst performance in 36 years. At the Montreal Olympics in 1976, they failed to win a single gold but the impressive hauls in every Games from Barcelona 1992 onwards made Australia an Olympic superpower. But even the most patriotic fan would struggle to convince anyone that Australia are having a good Olympics, despite 12 silvers and seven bronzes. Australia's Mitchell Watt (left) was favourite in the long jump, only to be beaten by Britain's Greg Rutherford (centre) The fact this is the first Olympics . reported second-by-second on Twitter and other social media isn't . helping the Australian mood. Brits joked over the weekend about 'Aussie . Thumb' - a condition caused by scrolling down the medal table. Other tweeters pointed out that if Yorkshire was a country, it would have more gold to cheer than Australia. Nothing . epitomised the hurt more than Australian long jumper Mitchell Watt, who . was the favourite, coming second to Britain’s Greg Rutherford on . Saturday night. Referring . to that event, one newspaper suggested that if a book was ever written . about Australia at the London Olympics it could be called Second to a Brit. Even the men's hockey team - ranked number one in the world - chucked away a three-goal lead against GB yesterday. But it isn't just the Poms dishing out the punishment. The Aussie Olympics have been in free-fall ever since pre-race favourite James Magnussen was pipped to gold by the American Adrian Nathan in the 100m freestyle swimming final by 0.01 seconds. Magnussen was ashen-faced afterwards . and his night didn't get any better when Australia finished fourth and . outside the medals in the 4 x 100m freestyle relay. The . losses came as a shock to an Aussie public well used to seeing the . likes of Ian Thorpe and Grant Hackett dominating in the pool. The Sydney Morning Herald described the . Superman of the pool as facing his kryptonite after he failed to win any golds. And their relay triumph aside, London has also brought heartbreak for two female swimmers - Stephanie Rice and Emily Seebohm - who were considered dead certs for gold, at least in Australia. Rice . failed to medal at all in the 200m and 400m Individual Relay finals and . said she was considering calling time on her career, while Seebohm . claimed social media had made her complacent after taking silver in the . 100m backstroke. The . debate that followed Australia's failure in the pool was quickly . magnified and applied to the other sports as the expected golds failed . to materialise. In . a front page story, Australia's swimming boss Leigh Nugent blamed the . nation's 'easy life' society and small population for the results. 'We . live in a society where people look for the easy way,' he said. James Magnussen looks horrified as he glances up at the scoreboard to see he has lost to America's Nathan Adrian by just 0.01 seconds in the 100m freestyle final . Swimmer Emily Seebohm reacts with bewilderment after finishing second in the 100m backstroke, just one of a string of disappointing results for Australia in the first week of the London Olympics . On a higher level, . Australian Olympic chef de mission Nick Green said that while silver was not a . dirty word, there would be a post mortem on what had gone with the team’s . performance. The inquest will have to include rowing, beach volleyball and track cycling. In the latter, Britain dominated as Australia foundered.

The so-called 'Ashes on Wheels' went decisively in Britain's favour - almost a series whitewash. And it got worse on Monday night as Shane Perkins could only manage bronze in the men's sprint. Finger are being pointed in all directions. Some, including Kevan Gosper, Australia's senior member of the IOC, blame the Government for slashing funding for sport. 'The money is the difference between silver and gold,' he said. But Slingsby's gold will offer a brief respite from the recriminations. The world champion held off a strong challenge from the Cypriot Pavlos Kontides in today's medal race at Weymouth. The Australian, 27, kept his rival behind him at the back of field to take overall victory. 'Words just can't describe how I feel now,' Slingsby said. 'It's been a long road and I've been through the highs and lows of this sport but nothing beats this. 'I've worked so hard. The Olympics is the dream, the pinnacle of the sport and right now I'm the happiest guy on the planet, I can guarantee it.' He may have realised his dream but there's no escaping the fact that the Olympics has been a nightmare for the Australian team.","Australians finally get second gold medal in sailing laser class, 10 days after their first .

Councils will be banned by law from fining families who put their bin out at the wrong time or do not close the lid. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has lashed out at rules which allow so-called ‘Talibin’ officials to target law-abiding householders who make genuine mistakes. Instead, local authorities will be restricted to issuing penalties to those who commit a ‘public nuisance’ by allowing bags to pile up or who fly-tip their rubbish. New law: Councils will be banned by law from fining families who put their bin out at the wrong time or do not close its lid . Mr Pickles said yesterday that, under the previous Labour government, Whitehall bureaucrats had too much leeway to fine householders for minor breaches. He added: ‘For too long Labour’s barmy bin rules have allowed local authorities to slap fines on law-abiding people who make innocent mistakes. ‘Putting out your rubbish should be a simple process, and it is ludicrous that we have a system where a milk carton in the wrong recycling container or a wheelie bin a few inches out of place can lead to people facing similar fines to shoplifters. ‘We’re bringing common sense back with a new law to rein in bin bullies which ensures that councils only issue fines to persistent and deliberate offenders.’ Critic: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said yesterday that, under the previous Labour government, Whitehall bureaucrats had too much leeway to fine householders for minor breaches . In 2005, the Labour government introduced fixed penalty notices of up to £110 for offences of putting rubbish out on the wrong day, not closing the bin lid, placing a rubbish bag next to a full wheelie bin, or putting recyclable goods out with normal rubbish. Meanwhile, the penalty for shoplifters who stole goods worth under £100 was only £80. From July 1, a change will be made to the Deregulation Bill, which mainly reduces the burden of excessive regulation on businesses, to ensure fixed penalty notices are handed out to householders only in cases where there has been ‘harm to the local amenity’. Mr Pickles said the strict rules have been disproportionately hitting law-abiding people, while under Labour only 0.05 per cent of genuine fly- tipping incidents were ever successfully prosecuted by local authorities. Under the amendments to the Bill, householders can be fined only if they cause a nuisance, damage the local area – such as those who allow stinking rubbish to pile up outside their house, or repeatedly fail to comply with the rules. The Government has also promised to help bring back weekly bin collections, but this has not happened widely. Despite putting up a £250million fund to encourage councils to collect bins once a week rather than once a fortnight, only 85 councils have applied for the cash.","Communities Secretary Eric Pickles has lashed out at current rules .

Holidaymakers travelling to Cyprus could be turned away at the airport by budget airline easyJet if their passports are due to expire within the next three months - despite UK and Cypriot authorities insisting that their passports are still valid for travel. The airline is telling passengers flying to Paphos and Larnaca that they must have at least three months left to run on their passport or they won't be able to fly. But EU regulations say that a passport is valid for travel right up until the day of expiry. No go: Passengers flying to Cyprus with easyJet could be refused boarding unless their passport has three months left to run . According to The Independent, 32-year-old charity executive Jonathan Rickard was told he couldn't board an easyJet plane at Gatwick Airport for a flight to Larnaca to attend a wedding. Ground staff refused to let him fly because his passport expires on August 14 - in eight weeks time. Valid: Passports are valid for travel within the EU right up until the date they expire . The airline is now refusing to refund his ticket which cost almost £300. He told the newspaper: 'I felt gobsmacked that I was being forced to walk away from a holiday I had planned for months.' Both Foreign Office guidelines for travel to Cyprus and the Cyprus Tourist organisation confirm that Mr Rickard's documentation should have been valid for him to leave the UK and enter Cyprus with no issue. The airline however is standing by its three month rule. It said in a statement: 'Entry requirements can and do change regularly and differ considerably by the nationality of the arriving passenger. 'Ultimately, it is the individual passenger's responsibility to ensure that their travel documentation is valid for the country to which they are flying.' Passports are also valid to many non EU countries within Europe until the day they expire and to the US so long as a special visa or 'Esta' is obtained. Other countries, such as Egypt and Thailand impose a six month minimum on a passport. Since MailOnline published this story, easyJet have issued a new statement admitting that they were wrong to deny Mr Rickard a seat on the plane. A spokesman said that passengers flying to Cyprus will be able to board their flight with less than three months left to run on their passport after all. He said: 'Unfortunately easyJet made an error in Mr Rickard's case and so would like to apologise that he was unable to travel. We will be contacting the passenger directly to remedy the situation.'","The budget airline will refuse passengers flying to Larnaca and Paphos .

Rebuke: Tom Hayes was told off by a judge for having his hands in his pockets as he appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court . A former City banker accused of plotting to rig Libor interest rates was told to take his hands out of his pockets by a judge yesterday. Tom Hayes, 33, who used to work for UBS and Citigroup, allegedly conspired to manipulate the London Interbank Offered Rate, which is used to determine the interest on loans between banks, from 2006 to 2010. At one point during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court, District Judge Quentin Purdy rebuked him for not abiding by court etiquette. ‘Take your hands out of your pockets please,’ he told Hayes, who was dressed in a dark grey open-neck shirt and pale grey trousers. Hayes was arrested last December as part of a massive criminal inquiry into the scandal by the Serious Fraud Office. The charges against him relate to a period between August 2006 and September 2010, and allege that he acted ‘with the intention that the economic interests of others would be prejudiced and/or to make personal gain for themselves or another’. Dressed in a dark grey open-neck shirt and pale grey trousers, he spoke only to confirm his identity during a brief hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. At one point, District Judge Quentin Purdy rebuked Hayes for not abiding by court etiquette. ‘Take your hands out of your pockets please,’ he told Hayes. Lydia Jonson, defending, said her client was not yet prepared to formally enter pleas to the eight charges. Accused: Hayes faces eight counts of conspiracy to defraud in relation to manipulation of the Libor interest rate . Under his bail conditions, he is required to surrender his passport to the police, sign in regularly with a police station near to his home, and not to leave England and Wales. He is also forbidden from contacting, directly or indirectly, any of a number of named individuals. Mukul Chawla QC, prosecuting, asked for the individuals not to be named in open court because of a ‘sensitivity’, which he did not expand upon. Adjourning proceedings, Judge Purdy said: ‘I’m formally sending you for trial on all eight charges to appear at the crown court sitting at Southwark for a preliminary hearing on July 4. ‘I must tell you that if you are not there, and there is no good reason, a warrant will be issued under the Bail Act and a trial could take place in your absence without further warning.’ Hayes, of Woldingham, Caterham, Surrey, faces eight counts of conspiring to defraud.

An epilepsy sufferer who continued driving despite his condition killed a passenger after he had a seizure at the wheel. Peter Murdoch was diagnosed with epilepsy around 30 years ago but never told the DVLA. He was driving with his wife and two friends when he failed to stop at a junction onto the A592 in Bowness, Cumbria, narrowly missed two cyclists and ploughed into a wall in June last year. Passenger Elizabeth Thompson, 68, from Marlow, Buckinghamshire, died instantly of multiple injuries, an inquest heard. Tragedy: Passenger Elizabeth Thompson died in the crash after her friend Peter Murdoch had an epileptic seizure at the wheel . She and husband Garth had been visiting friends Peter and Dorothy, of Main Street, Staveley, Cumbria. The couple did not know about Mr Murdoch's epilepsy. The inquest heard the four were travelling along Glebe Road, Bowness when they approached the 'give way' junction leading onto the A592 on 10 June last year. But Mr Murdoch failed to stop or turn and instead carried straight on, narrowly missing two cyclists before hitting a wall straight ahead. Garth Thompson told the inquest that he had noticed a change in his friend's behaviour prior to the crash. He said: 'I was aware that he had . become somewhat non-responsive. He accelerated and was driving faster . than you would normally think appropriate but then slowed down and all . seemed to be well again. Then he accelerated inappropriately when he . came up to the junction.' In reference to his epilepsy, Mr Murdoch told the court: 'I obviously should have contacted the DVLA but I do not remember . anyone ever mentioning it.' Scene of the crash: The court heard Mr Murdoch failed to stop at a junction and drove straight into a wall in Bowness, Cumbria . Mrs Murdoch told the inquest at South Lakeland Magistrates Court: 'The epilepsy goes back to the 1980s, and was dealt with by medication, after which his seizures were rare.' She mentioned an occasion where he was playing squash and blacked out, leading to an overnight stay in hospital. PC Craig Irving, a collision investigator for Cumbria Police, said all the evidence pointed to Mr Murdoch having some sort of seizure before the tragedy. A spokesman for Cumbria Police said that after discussion with the CPS and medical experts a decision taken not to prosecute Mr Murdoch. 'We have written to the family of the victim to explain our decision and offer our condolences.' Ian Smith, South and East Cumbria . coroner, said the accident highlights the potential danger of taking to . the wheel after being diagnosed with conditions such as epilepsy. He recorded a verdict of accidental death and said he would be writing to the DVLA and Department of Transport. 'I will write about the apparent lack of importance put on notifying the DVLA about medical conditions,' he said. 'I think doctors ought to take an . active stance in relation to anyone who may have a problem and should . also be required to notify the DVLA.' Explaining the decision not to . prosecute Mr Murdoch, a CPS spokesperson said: 'There was clear medical . evidence that the suspect suffered an epileptic seizure and was not in . control of the vehicle at the time of the crash. Automatism is a defence . to the charges of causing death by dangerous driving, dangerous . driving, causing death by careless driving and careless driving. As . such, we concluded that none of these charges could be brought. 'The defence of automatism would not . apply if the suspect had driven with the knowledge that there was a real . risk of a seizure, but blood tests confirmed that he had been taking . his medication as appropriate, so he was fit to drive, and there is . often no indication in advance that a seizure will take place. It could . not be proved that the suspect had willingly driven dangerously. 'We also considered whether the . suspect should be charged for failing to notify the DVLA about his . condition, which is punishable by up to a £1,000 fine. There was . sufficient evidence to prove this offence but we concluded that it would . not be in the public interest to proceed as this offence will not be . repeated (the suspect’s licence was revoked), the driver was unaware of . the need to notify the DVLA and the victim’s family did not support a . prosecution.","Peter Murdoch failed to stop at junction and drove straight into wall .

CNN has put significant resources into New Day which is part of a wider shake up of the network brought about by new boss Jeff Zucker . Reviewers said that New Day, which runs from 6am to 9am, brings ‘nothing new to the table’ and that anchor Andrew Cuomo looked too macho and was ‘uneasy and out of place’. They also said it felt like ‘overkill’ because CNN used eight of its own correspondents for live interviews during the debut. CNN has put significant resources into New Day which is part of a wider shake up of the network brought about by new boss Jeff Zucker. He axed Soledad O’Brien’s Starting Point and replaced her with Cuomo, who joined from ABC, Kate Bolduan and Michaela Pereira. New Day has been billed as ‘newsy not drowsy’ and the first show was packed with current affairs and very few puff pieces or cookery segments.

Among the 25-54 age bracket, New Day got 95,000 viewers behind 262,000 for Fox & Friends, 132,000 for Morning Joe and 121,000 for Morning Express. Writing on TV Newser, critics Gail Shister said the problem was that Cuomo’s ‘testosterone level is off the charts’ and that it all felt ‘overdone’. She said: ‘While Bolduan and Pereira gabbed like girlfriends around the glass table, the uber-intense Cuomo seemed uneasy and out of place. ‘Face it, the guy can make a lost-kitten story sound like a mass murder.’ She also asked that he stop calling interviewees ‘my friend’ and said it makes him seem ‘unctuous’ and ‘irritating’. New York Daily News critics Don Kaplan said that he thought the hosts were ‘overcaffinated’ but that overall he thought it showed promise.

'I think people are too concerned about what’s fashionable. Women have such boring wardrobes these days because they must follow fashion, they must, they must. But sometimes it’s about saying, oh, this would work well with that.’ Miss Hulanicki, who last year was awarded an OBE for services to the fashion industry, acknowledged it is now harder to dress interestingly because high streets are saturated with shops selling near-identical clothes.

Jaymin Abdulrahman admitted throwing her six-day-old baby girl down a bin chute but had denied her intention had been to kill her . A mother who threw her newborn baby 40ft down a tower block rubbish chute while suffering from post-natal depression was jailed for two and a half years today. Jaymin Abdulrahman, 25, accepted she put her six-day-old baby girl down the chute but told the jury she had not planned the incident and had 'lost control of her thoughts' at the time. The baby, who cannot be named . for legal reasons, miraculously survived but suffered skull fractures and brain injuries after . she fell into a bin store at a block of flats in . Wolverhampton last September. Experts estimated the force the impact was the equivalent of being in a 30mph car crash without a seat belt. Today a jury of seven men and five women found Abdulrahman guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm but cleared her of two other charges including attempted murder. Birmingham Crown Court heard how Abdulrahman initially told police that her child had been kidnapped by strangers but the baby was found a few hours later, apparently lifeless, at the bottom of the chute. Prosecutors alleged that the Iraqi national deliberately placed her baby daughter into the chute with the intention of killing her. But Abdulrahman, who accepted that she put her baby into the chute, told the jury she was 'tired, sad and exhausted' in the week after her daughter's birth and unaware of why she was crying. Rachel Brand QC, defending Abdulrahman, told the court that her client had been suffering from a post-natal psychosis - a severe form of post-natal depression. Describing Abdulrahman, who came to . the UK from Iraq in 2011, as a competent and loving mother, Miss Brand . also argued that her illness meant she was not capable of 'forming an . intent to either kill or cause really serious injury to her baby'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The baby was found in a large bin wrapped in a piece of material after she was thrown down the rubbish chute . Speaking through a Kurdish . interpreter, Abdulrahman told the court she was in tears while cleaning . her bathroom shortly before placing the baby in the chute. 'I was extremely sad,' she told jurors. 'I went to the living room, I put the baby in a rubbish bag and I threw her away. 'After I had done so, I just couldn't believe what I had just done, and I couldn't understand why I did it. I was in shock.' Answering questions from Ms Brand, . Abdulrahman added that she had not 'planned' to do what she did and had . not thought about what she was going to do. 'Even now as I am speaking to you, I . am still in a state of disbelief of what I have done. I have lost . control of my thoughts when I did so. 'I can't tell whether I was crying at . the time or not, but I have done this. I wasn't aware of what I was . doing. If I thought that by doing so I would do some harm to the baby, I . wouldn't have done it.' Jailing Abdulrahman, judge Mrs Justice Kate Thirlwall said she accepted that the incident was not premeditated and that Abdulrahman was suffering from post-natal psychosis - a severe form of post-natal depression - at the time. She said: 'On September 2 last year you gave birth to your baby daughter. Investigation: Police tape gives residents in the block of flats that the chute is not to be used following the incident . 'Six days later you placed her in a black bin liner and you placed that bin liner in the rubbish chute and closed that chute. 'She fell from the fifth floor. She sustained critical head injuries from which she will never fully recover. 'You gave a false story to your husband and to the police about the baby being abducted. That story was obviously nonsense. 'It's quite clear that the jury were satisfied that you were suffering from postpartum psychosis (severe post-natal depression) at the time you acted. 'Anyone who sat through the whole trial will understand exactly how they came to that conclusion. 'As you said yourself, you were her mother. You should have been her guardian. You will have to live with the consequences of your actions for the rest of your life.' Abdulrahman was told she will serve half of her sentence in prison before serving the rest on licence. She showed no emotion as she was led down from the dock. Prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said the baby girl suffered serious brain injuries and was likely to need intensive support from medical professionals. He also said it was unlikely she would be able to feed herself orally and that she was developing the signs of a severe form of cerebral palsy. Abdulrahman's barrister Rachel Brand QC told the court: 'When you describe this as an utterly tragic case, one cannot be accused of exaggerating. 'This was a life shattering event for this little family. 'She (the baby) makes steady but slow medical progress. He (Abdulrahman's husband) has been constant in his attendance at the hospital and that's where he stays now. 'He's not here but I know he will welcome her back with open arms.' Abdulrahman moved to the UK to live in Wolverhampton, in the West Midlands, with her arranged marriage husband Mohamad Amin, 32, in August 2011. She told the jury she was happy in the marriage and she and her husband started trying for a baby as soon as she arrived in Britain before she eventually fell pregnant early in 2012. But days after giving birth, the court heard Abdulrahman suffered post natal depression. On the day she attacked the tot she also smashed up the Moses basket which she also lobbed down the rubbish chute. Police released a shocking digital reconstruction of the baby's fall which revealed it took just 2.2 seconds for the tot to fall from the fifth floor of the tower block to the ground. Experts said the impact the baby suffered was the equivalent of her being in a car crash at 30mph without wearing a seat belt. The baby was found in a communal rubbish area on the ground floor by Mr Amin wrapped in a headscarf-like material and surrounded by broken pieces of the tot's Moses basket.","Jaymin Abdulrahman, 25, threw six-day old child down chute at block of flats in Wolverhampton last September .

"By . Rachel Quigley, Nina Golgowski and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:34 EST, 20 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:40 EST, 20 June 2013 . A Missouri judge has decided who will get custody of the orphaned daughter of Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher six months after the NFL star killed the child's mother before taking his own life. Jackson County Probate Commissioner Daniel Wheeler issued an order Thursday granting custody of 9-month-old Zoey Perkins to her cousin Sophie Perkins, of Pflugerville, Texas, saying she was more suited than Belcher's mother to be the baby's guardian. Zoey lost both her parents on the morning of December 1, 2012, when her father, Belcher, fatally shot her mother, Kasandra Perkins, in the couple's Kansas City home. Custody battle: Belcher is seen here with his girlfriend Kasandra Perkins, 22, and their baby daughter Zoey who with their death is at the heart of a $3million custody battle . Woman in charge: A judge ruled to grant custody of 9-month-old Zoey to Sophie Perkins, 35, her cousin on her late mother's side . Battle lost: Jovan Belcher's mother, Cheryl Shepherd (pictured), fought to be appointed as her granddaughter's legal guardian . The football player then drove to . Arrowhead Stadium and killed himself in front of coaches and the team's . general manager as they pleaded with him to put the gun down. During a three-day hearing last week, . Sophie Perkins, 35, and Belcher's mother, 54-year-old Cheryl Shepherd of . West Babylon, New York, each argued that she would be the best guardian . for the girl. Perkins' lawyers attacked Shepherd's . smoking habit and the number of police calls to her home over the years, . while Shepherd's attorneys criticized Perkins for putting the girl in . day care 45 hours a week while she worked. [caption . Perkins, who was Kasandra Perkins' first cousin, is the sister of Whitney Golden Charles, whose husband is . Chiefs All-Pro running back Jamaal Charles. The Kansas City Star reported that she graduated from Texas . Tech University in 1999 and has worked for Dell Computer for 13 years. ‘Out of these bad circumstances, this . was the best result for Zoey,’ said Mark Roberts, Perkins' attorney. ‘Both sides love Zoey; both sides were operating with her best interest . in mind. The court had a difficult decision to make, but we think it was . the right decision.’ Other than some trips to New York to . spend time with Shepherd, Zoey has mostly stayed with Perkins in Texas . since the shooting. The time the girl spent bonding with Perkins played a . role in Wheeler's decision, he wrote, as did the police calls to . Shepherd's home. ‘There have been numerous police reports made from Ms. Cheryl Shepherd's home during the past twenty years,’ wrote Wheeler. ‘While not controlling, and while not . making Ms. Shepherd's home inappropriate to raise Minor, the Court . concludes that this is evidence of Ms. Sophie Perkins' home being more . stable than Ms. Shepherd's home, and this favors the appointment of Ms. Perkins as guardian.’ Zoey is to receive more than $1million . under the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, including $108,000 . annually over the next four years, $48,000 in the fifth year and $52,000 . each year until she turns 18. She will continue to receive that amount . until she turns 23 if she attends college. Troubled: The murder-suicide has sparked debate in the NFL about gun ownership and the personal struggles of players . The girl’s total inheritance has been estimated at $3million, including $1.2million from a life insurance policy. A trust funded with money from the Chiefs owners, coaches, players, employees and the public will also help care for the child. Commerce Trust Co. has been appointed as conservator of Zoey's estate and will handle her finances. Cheryl Shepherd's family previously had been granted 'temporary guardianship' of Zoey, but legal experts said in January that the agreement severely damaged Shepherd's chance of winning back custody of her granddaughter. Zoey was orphaned on Dec. 1 when her father killed her mother, Kasandra Perkins, at the couple’s home in suburban Kansas City. Belcher's mother had . been living with the couple for about two weeks and was in the home when . her son killed Perkins before taking his own life at the Chief's Arrowhead Stadium. Ms Shepherd received temporary custody . of Belcher's daughter soon after the shootings and filed a . petition in mid-December asking to be appointed as Zoey's guardian and . conservator of her estate, which is worth about $3million. Paying respects: Hundreds of mourners memorialized Jovan Belcher at his funeral - despite his murdering the mother of his child before committing suicide . Memorial: Jovan Belcher was eulogized as a 'humble, kind young man' by his mother as his family and friends grappled with the horror of what he did . In January, judges in Texas and Missouri determined that the custody dispute would be handled in Missouri’s Jackson County, where the baby was living at the time of her parents’ deaths and where her paternal grandmother filed a custody petition. In addition to the well-being of the child, millions of dollars are at stake in the custody battle. A trust funded by the Hunt family, . which owns the Chiefs, along with team coaches, players, employees and . contributions from the public, will help care for the child. Also, Belcher's beneficiary will . receive $600,000 in life insurance, plus $200,000 for each credited . season – Belcher was in his fourth season at the time of his death – and . $100,000 in a retirement account. Zoey's maternal grandparents, Rebecca . Anne Gonzalez and Darryl Perkins, and other Texas relatives have filed a . lawsuit seeking temporary custody of the girl, that her residence be in . Tarrant County, Texas, and that a guardian ad litem be appointed. The other woman: Brittni Glass spent the night with Belcher before he murdered his girlfriend but has since denied the two had a sexual relationship . It is believed that the murder suicide took place after a fight about whether or not Belcher was Zoey's father. His suicide was witnessed by coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli. A source told the New York Post: . '[Cheryl] believed that there was an issue over whether [Belcher] was . the father. She said he believed he wasn’t necessarily the father of . the child.' A Kansas City law-enforcement source confirmed: 'She told police there was a question about the paternity.' The . source added: 'The implication was that paternity was what the two of . them were fighting about — that the baby might not have been his.' The couple had been receiving counseling for relationship and financial problems, police said. A spokeswoman said she would not comment on the doubts raised over baby Zoey's paternity. It also emerged last month that the NFL player . had a secret girlfriend - Brittni Glass - who he allegedly told he would shoot Perkins 'if . she didn't leave him alone'. Belcher is also believed to have had . drinks and dinner with her before he arrived home, shot his . girlfriend after a blazing row, and then ended his own life. Details of the Belcher case are contained in police reports submitted to the Jackson County prosecutor, who has ruled the event a murder-suicide. They include dozens of interviews with witnesses. Glass has denied the two were in a relationship. Glass, also 22, told police that Belcher complained about Perkins threatening to take all his money and the baby if they broke up. He said Perkins 'knew exactly how to press his buttons and make him angry,' according to a summary of the woman's interview with police. Belcher had been with the woman and some of her friends at a downtown Kansas City entertainment district the night before the shooting, the woman said. He spent part of the night in her apartment and part of it sleeping in his car before going home early in the morning, the report said. He and Perkins were arguing before he shot her, his mother, Cheryl Shepherd, told police. Shepherd had moved in with the couple two weeks earlier to help care for the baby. Shepherd heard Belcher say 'You won't talk to me that way' and then she heard a thump and gunshots. Shepherd rushed into the bedroom and found Perkins lying on the bathroom floor, she told police. Before fleeing the house, Belcher knelt next to Perkins, apologized and repeatedly kissed her, his daughter and his mother, Shepherd said. Belcher drove off in his Bentley to . the practice facility at Arrowhead several miles away, where he pulled . into the parking lot and saw Pioli, the report said. Pioli quoted Belcher as saying, 'I . did it, I killed her.' Belcher held a handgun to his own head. 'I got to . go, can't be here, and take care of my daughter,' Pioli recalled . Belcher saying. He had asked to speak with Crennel . and linebacker coach Gary Gibbs, the report said. Crennel told police he . pleaded with Belcher to put down the gun. One witness said she heard . Crennel say, 'you're taking the easy way out'. Belcher lowered the gun, but only to load a round into the chamber, Crennel told police. Seeing a police officer in the distance and hearing sirens, Belcher knelt behind a mini-van, blessed himself and fired the gun into his temple, the report said.","Sophie Perkins, 9-month-old Zoey's cousin from her mother's side, was chosen as her legal guardian .

In the 19th century, the teaching and practice of watercolour painting became widespread and professional artists, such as Richard Westall, George Hayter, Edward Lear and William Leighton Leitch, were employed to teach Queen Victoria and her family.

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 16:11 EST, 19 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:38 EST, 19 June 2013 . A 14-year-old boy who allegedly murdered his great-grandmother has told a court how he and a friend took turns hitting her with a hatchet and a hammer so they could kill her and steal her money. Antonio Barbeau gave the chilling details as he testified in the trial of his friend Nathan Paape, who has pleaded not guilty to the grisly crime in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in September last year. Barbeau told the court that the weekend before the murder of 78-year-old Barbara Olson, he and Paape had talked about ways to get money and how they could steal from his great-grandmother. On the day of the murder, they asked Barbeau's mother for a ride to 'a . friend's house' and then they walked two miles to the home, where Olson found them in the garage. Testimony: Antonio Barbeau raises his hand to take the oath before testifying during a trial for his friend Nathan Paape, with whom he allegedly killed his great-grandmother last year . 'We were going to try to scare her to . get money and use force if needed,' said Barbeau, who has already been convicted in the case and is now awaiting his sentencing. When asked what type . of force they planned to use, Barbeau said: 'An . attack, I guess to kill.' She invited them into her home and as she turned her back to call Barbeau's mother, Barbeau hit her on the head with the hatchet, the Shaboygan Press reported. He said he then ran to the bathroom as he was feeling sick but that when he emerged, he saw Paape hit the woman with the hammer multiple times. 'Accomplice': Nathan Paape, pictured right with defense attorney June Spoerl, has pleaded not guilty . Weapon: Sheboygan Falls Police officer Nicole Schmelter holds up an axe allegedly from the crime . 'She was still yelling when I went to the bathroom, but had stopped when I returned,' he said. Barbeau then hit Olson with the hatchet again, and said Paape then took the weapon from him and hit her once or twice too. Victim: Barbara Olson, 78, was found in a pool of blood at her home last September . The account came in stark contrast with Paape's, the Shaboygan Press reported. Paape claimed the robbery and . murder were Barbeau's idea and that he only hit Olson twice . with a hammer because he feared his friend would turn on him. Paape thought Barbeau was joking about killing Olson, his lawyer said. But Barbeau said his friend never suggested he thought it was a joke. He has pleaded not guilty but if convicted, he faces life in prison and a minimum 20 years in prison. Barbara Olsen's body was found in a pool of blood outside her home last September. Once the teens realized Olsen was . dead after the horrific attack, they attempted to drag her body to the . car, leaving a trail on blood through the house, police said last . September. After failing to load Olsen into the vehicle, they dumped her in the garage. The boys then allegedly stole several items, including a purse, loose change and jewelry. The . perpetrators then hopped into Olson's car and sped off. They eventually . dumped the vehicle in the parking lot of a local bowling alley and . walked to a nearby eatery, where they shared a pizza. Savage: Barbeau, left, and Paape, right, provided conflicting stories about who was behind the attack . Investigation: The teens were arrested just 12 hours after the woman's body was discovered at her home . The . teens later returned to the abandoned car and tried to wipe off their . fingerprints, the complaint states. They left some of their loot in . plain sight, along with the car keys, hoping that someone would steal . the vehicle and get blamed for Olsen's murder.

William Robinson, 20, of Doncaster, is accused of assault by . penetration. The court was told a fourth man in the group had left the room before the alleged assault took place. The female student said one of the three men pulled off . her jogging pants. 'I told them to get off. My next-door neighbour heard . me say: ""Get off! Get out of my room!""' the court heard. The woman said she faced exclusion from the college after reporting the men to staff, and was then forced to explain the situation to her parents, the court heard. The woman told the jury her parents persuaded her to report it to the police after she received a letter from the college recommending she be excluded. She told the court: 'I told the college I had been sexually assaulted but I didn't give the details of what had happened, I just gave them an outline. 'The college said I had brought it into disrepute by having sexual actions with a group of people. The alleged assaults are said to have happened in a hall of residence on the campus at Bishop Burton College (above), East Yorkshire . 'A couple of days later, they recommended that I was excluded. 'I was upset about it and my mum persuaded me to go to the police.' The court heard a senior member of staff at the college interviewed the alleged victim and sent her a letter which read: 'I'm writing to confirm you have received a recommendation for exclusion from the college for bringing the college into disrepute by demeaning sexual actions with a group of people.' The offences are alleged to have taken place last September. The woman told the jury all three men befriended her outside the college, took her keys and pushed her into her room, where they sexually assaulted her. She then claims they left laughing. The three men claim she consented to what happened, the court heard. Prosecutor John Thackray said: 'The Crown say these three defendants, in drink, took advantage of her and took advantage of her knowing it was without consent. 'The prosecution say it was obvious to all three defendants that she was not consenting at any time. 'The complainant [later] reported the matter to the police.' Her friend reported what had happened to the college - which covers further and higher education for those aged over 16 - and an investigation was launched. She was asked to name the men by the college and told the jury she searched Facebook to identify her alleged attackers. Mr Price's barrister Paul Genney suggested to her: 'You went perfectly willingly with those men and everything that happened with them was done with consent. 'I suggest you were angry with them for walking off and laughing and you were upset and hurt. 'You got a crime number from the police so it would back up your appeal to the college.' The jury was shown CCTV footage of the men approaching the alleged victim as she smoked outside the college that night. The woman alleges they pushed her into her room but the defence suggests she was smiling and going with the men willingly. The defendants deny the charges. The trial continues.

The daring attack in the upscale . neighborhood, which is home to many embassies and officials, was another . blow to the government, exposing its vulnerability in the very seat of . Assad's powerbase. A Syrian government official said . that an improvised explosive device was placed under a car that was . parked in the area and was detonated as al-Halqi's car drove by.

The channel said it was showing the video as a proof that al-Halqi was not hurt. But the prime minister's comments . after the meeting did not refer to today's blast and he was not asked . about it by reporters, leaving doubts as to whether the footage was . filmed before or after the bombing.

Baby-faced: Murray is consoled by Nalbandian in 2005 . Andy Murray will make his eighth appearance at Wimbledon looking to end Britain's long wait for a home men's singles champion. Here, Sportsmail assesses the US Open winner's performances on his previous visits to SW19. 2005: Murray made his senior Wimbledon debut at the age of 18. There was great excitement surrounding the teenager following his win in the US Open juniors in 2004 and he justified the hype by reaching the third round. Murray's first match was a comfortable win over George Bastl and he followed that up by eliminating 14th seed Radek Stepanek. Next up was former finalist David Nalbandian and the young Scot looked set for a famous win when he took a two-set lead before cramp took its toll. 2006: Murray . was now the leading British player and again he did not disappoint. Victories over Nicolas Massu and Julien Benneteau set up a blockbuster . clash with top-five player and former finalist Andy Roddick. Murray had . beaten the American en route to winning his first ATP Tour title in San . Jose earlier in the season and he repeated the feat with a brilliant . straight-sets win. The Scot could not maintain that standard, though, . and lost to Marcos Baghdatis in the fourth round. 2008: After . missing the 2007 championships with a wrist injury, Murray was looking . to make up for lost time. He reached the fourth round with relative ease . to set up a clash with Richard Gasquet that turned out to be one of . Wimbledon's classic encounters as the Scot hit back from two sets and a . break down to reach the quarter-finals for the first time. Hopes were . high as he prepared to face eventual champion Rafael Nadal but it proved . to be a one-sided affair in the Spaniard's favour. 2009: With Nadal unable to defend his title because of injury, Murray was the highest seed in his half of the draw. He almost came unstuck in the fourth round against an inspired Stanislas Wawrinka in the first match to be played entirely under the new Centre Court roof before prevailing in a deciding set. Murray reached the semi-finals for the first time and was favourite to see off Roddick but he paid for a cautious approach and was beaten in four sets. 2010: The British number one came into Wimbledon in indifferent form but by the end of the first week it was clear he would be a contender once again. A victory over Gilles Simon in front of the Queen was a highlight and he was not really tested until a quarter-final clash with big-hitting Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Victory earned the world number four another shot at Nadal but, despite doing most things right, it was not even enough for him to win a set. 2011: Nadal again in the semi-finals, and more despair loomed for Murray. This time he led, and had Nadal in trouble. But a loose forehand early in the second set was the beginning of Murray's demise. Nadal seized on the sign of weakness to win in four sets. Even though Murray felt he was playing better tennis than he had in 2010, it was scant consolation as he said: 'It's tough. But I'm giving it my best shot each time. I'm trying my hardest. That's all you can do. I'm disappointed.' 2012: This time Murray reached the final, and had all of Britain abuzz as he attempted to become the first home champion since Fred Perry in 1936. His opponent, Roger Federer, had other ideas though. Despite making a great start, Murray lost 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 as Federer landed his seventh Wimbledon title. Revenge of sorts came in the London 2012 Olympic final, back at Wimbledon, as Murray thrashed Federer.","Murray to play Benjamin Becker in first round on Monday .

Cristina Torre, 44, spotted the one-year-old boy hanging from the front of a store on 3rd Avenue and 92nd street at around 10am. As she was calling 911, the baby fell, but landed safety in Torre's outstretched arms. Hero: Cristina Torre caught the one-year-old boy, whose name has not been released (right), in her arms when he fell out of a window and then from a shop awning in Brooklyn . Saved: The daughter of Yankee legend Joe Torre made the catch of a lifetime in Brooklyn on Wednesday after she caught the falling child . Ms Torre told NBC: 'I was still talking to 911 and I just put out my arms, and literally, it was effortless,' she said. 'It was meant to be. He landed in my arms.' Kristen Bramsen, 48, told The New York Post: 'I really think the baby would have been dead if it wasn't for the woman.' Police later determined the little boy, whose name hasn't been revealed, slipped through an open window after pushing out a piece of cardboard that had been placed next to an air conditioner at his second-floor apartment. He cut his mouth as he hit the store sign on the way down but was otherwise unharmed. The parents were fast asleep when the child fell, though both - Sam Miller, 23, and Tiffany Demetria, 24 - were handcuffed and taken into custody by police after the frightening incident. 'It took a long time for them to get to the parents. I looked over and the father was on the ground clutching his heart,' Bramsen told The Post. The parents have been charged with child endangerment and their three other children, aged two, three and five, placed in state care.

'Your children, that's your proudest moments and when they are responsible and caring and all that stuff it is a proud moment, especially in today's world where we seem to glorify bad things. I am just so proud of her.' He added that while his daughter didn't play a lot of sports growing up 'she always had good hands'.

A pastry chef who raped and murdered Irish journalist Jill Meagher in Australia last year has been sentenced to life in prison. Adrian Bayley, 41, had already admitted the rape and murder of journalist Mrs Meagher after he attacked her in a lane in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick in September last year, as she walked home after socialising with colleagues from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. He was told by a judge at Melbourne's Supreme Court that he must serve a minimum 35 year sentence for the 'savage and degrading' crime. Jailed: Adrian Bayley is pictured (left) being led into a prison van at the Supreme Court in Melbourne earlier this month after pleading guilty to raping and killing Jill Meagher (right) Sexual predator: Mrs Meagher's killer Adrian Bayley had been convicted of 21 rapes against six women and was on parole when he attacked the 29-year-old in September last year, Victoria Supreme Court heard . Bayley was sentenced to life for 29 year old Miss Meagher's murder and 15 years for what Judge Geoff Nettle described as a violent rape. Jailing Bayley, he said: 'The deceased was unknown to you. You were larger and stronger than she and you used that physical advantage to dominate her. 'In effect, you dragged her off the street late at night while she was going peaceably about her own business within a stone's throw of her home. 'The rape was savage and degrading.' Bayley had previously been found . guilty of 21 rape offences and was on parole for attacking five . prostitutes when he assaulted the County Louth woman in September last . year. In 2002, he was sentenced to 11 years . for raping five prostitutes, but was freed on parole in 2011, which . would have lasted until March this year. The start of a life behind bars: Bayley walks to a prison van after his sentencing to at least 35 years jail for the rape and murder of Jill Meagher . Flanked by six police officers, Bayley looked emotionless as the judge passed sentence today. Justice Nettle told Bayley, who had pleaded guilty to rape and murder at an earlier hearing, that he posed a serious risk to the safety of the community. Mrs Meagher's family - parents George . and Edith McKeon, her brother Michael and husband Tom Meagher - were in . the court to hear the sentencing. Outside . the court, her father Mr McKeon, said in a brief statement that . 'justice has been done' and he thanked the police and prosecutors for . their work. The court had . heard that Mrs Meagher had gone out earlier that evening with friends . from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, and ended up in a bar in . the inner-city suburb of Brunswick. At . around 1.30am she set off home, telling a friend that she lived only . five minutes walk away and it was then that Bayley, who had also been . out drinking, spotted her. Bayley told police he had offered to . help her because she appeared upset after speaking on her phone about . her father's state of health, but when she rejected his offer it made . him angry. He had told . police later that after Mrs Meagher had been raped he strangled her with . his hands because she had threatened to tell the police about what he . had done. Targeted: Mrs Meagher (pictured with her brother Michael on her wedding day) was attacked by Bayley as she walked home alone to her Melbourne home . Tragic: Flowers were placed outside of Duchess Boutique in Sydney Road, Melbourne, the last place Jill Meagher was seen alive via CCTV footage . In a 40 minute address to Bayley, Justice Nettle told the court how Bayley had left Mrs Meagher's body in the alleyway while he returned to his home and collected his car and a shovel. He drove her body to the Gisborne South countryside and buried her in a shallow grave. Bayley threw random possessions of Mrs Meagher's from his car window on the way home and later destroyed her mobile phone before trying to clean any evidence out of his car the following day. He was caught after police reviewed a . series of CCTV tapes taken on the road where Mrs Meagher went missing . and thanks to a number of witnesses who came forward to help detectives. Crime scene: Forensic police gather evidence at the countryside area where Jill Meagher was buried by Bayley . Justice Nettle recalled how Bayley had at first denied any involvement in Miss Meagher's death but as the interrogation continued and evidence was presented to him, Bayley began to make admissions which culminated in a confession that he had raped and killed the Irish woman. He told Bayley: 'The combination of rape and murder of the kind you have committed is particularly heinous and, in your case, it is made even worse by your attempt to conceal the deceased's body and the fact that the offending was committed while you were released on parole and on bail.' The judge told Bayley that he was 'determined to have your way with her and so you overpowered her and raped her where she stood. 'Then you attacked her again because she was threatening to call then police and in the process you strangled her to death.'","Jill Meagher, 29, was raped and strangled after a night out with colleagues .

The dirtiest secret of Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret may be that it’s actually a good movie. Made-for-TV movies, especially those ripped from the headlines of high profile real-life drama, are often tawdry and flat takes on complicated situations. Look-a-like actors may add to visual accuracy of the film, but a Lifetime original movie is often just a Lifetime original movie: prepackaged, disposable, just watchable enough. But don’t look to the recent failure that was Lindsay Lohan’s turn as legend Liz Taylor for comparison with Lifetime’s Jodi Arias film. Viewers are impressed…with how bad it isn’t. Scroll down to view trailer... Oddly respectable: Jesse Lee Soffer, left, plays Travis Alexander and Tania Raymonde, right, plays his murderer Jodi Arias in the upcoming Lifetime movie Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret that viewers have so far enjoyed . Though Arias murdered Travis Alexander back in 2008, her May 8 conviction is still extremely fresh. Nonetheless, Arias’ dirty little secret will be revealed, in case you didn’t already hear about it, this Saturday at 8pm on Lifetime. According to USA Today, the film is the product of vigilance on the part of writers who sourced material from videos, court documents, and forensic evidence. And when the trial became progressively more sudsy, so did the script. And though the trial itself wasn’t originally in the movie’s script, writers were reportedly made to hurriedly add it in the eleventh hour, simply because it was too good to be missed. 'Every time Jodi Arias would open her mouth on the stand,' screenwriter Richard Blaney said, 'we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script.' The movie’s drama—taken straight from the froth that was the Jodi Arias trial—may just be art imitating life. And the writers took great pains to write nuanced representations of the people they’re actors would soon portray. Art imitating life? Airing Saturday at 8pm, the movie didn't need trumped up drama. 'Every time Jodi Arias would open her mouth,' said a screenwriter, 'we would get calls asking if we could work it into the script.' ‘The obvious responsibility was to speak for Travis,’ screenwriter Gregory Small said. ‘But we're not just casting aside what was going on with Jodi, either. She was a fascinating, smart, articulate woman. She seemingly had the people skills and the ability to have led a wonderful life, but some diagnosable deviance led to this.’ Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret is a ripped-from-cable-news saga of a woman found guilty of killing her former lover, motivational speaker Travis Alexander. On June 4, 2008, Arias stabbed and slashed him nearly 30 times, slit his throat and shot him in the head in what prosecutors said was jealous rage, and what Arias unpersuasively argued was self-defense, when, according to her, he attacked her. Dirty Little Secret unearths no secrets, dirty or otherwise. Every sordid detail, it seems, has been trumpeted for years by the media, then recycled for months during Arias' trial in Phoenix that got blanket coverage on TV and in particular on cable's HLN, vaulting that network to record ratings. Deadly beauty: The ripped-from-the-headlines movie comes just a month after Arias' murder conviction . Uncanny: Tania Raymonde (left) plays Arias (left) and the likeness is marked, though the actress had no access to the murderer, her portrayal was surprisingly nuanced . Portraying what led up to the crime, it's tucked handily between the May verdict for the murder trial and the July retrial in the life-or-death-penalty phase. Dirty Little Secret is a pretty good film. It's a draw-you-in, sudsy melodrama stocked with guilty pleasures: romance, sex, obsession, betrayal and vengeance. Tania Raymonde (perhaps best remembered as Alex Rousseau on Lost) is swell as Jodi, with a remarkable likeness to this sexy, young woman no man could resist, at least not Travis as he fought a losing battle with his Mormon principles to feast on this forbidden fruit. Or, to use a metaphor straight from the film, forbidden coffee – which, as Travis explains to Jodi early on, he shuns as a Mormon because of its addictive properties. ‘I'm like coffee,’ Jodi teases him. ‘Very strong coffee,’ he agrees as he submits again. Would Jodi approve? Arias, pictured, was tried and convicted in May for the 2008 murder of Travis Alexander. The film shows the events leading up to that crime . Jesse Lee Soffer (Jordana Spiro's jammed-up brother on last season's short-lived The Mob Doctor) makes a fine Travis – glib, blandly wholesome and all too relatable in his mission to have it both ways, relationship-wise: treating Jodi as a red-hot plaything while he nurtures a ‘suitable’ wife-worthy prospect. Trouble arises, of course, as love-struck Jodi bridles at the strictly recreational role she plays in Travis' life. Even joining the Mormon church can't earn her an upgrade from her booty-call status. Travis argues that he never promised more. When Jodi was gazing into his eyes, he tells her, ‘You saw lust. You saw weakness. But you didn't see love. It was never there.’ So, for a time, Travis thrives as a satisfied two-timer, while Jodi is increasingly desperate to please. ‘I just want to be the girl that he wants,’ she tells a chum. Mind you, such an assessment of this film and its doomsday narrative is meant in no way to trivialize the real-life tragedy of Jodi Arias and Travis Alexander. Dirty Little Secret is a step up from the reality-TV treatment the case has gotten with its more excessive coverage. The film also serves as a refreshing alternative for telling the tale, dramatized for maximum titillation while, in its tidy, two-hour package, efficiently stripping away the wretched excess. An oddly respectable bit of fluff, this film would never be mistaken for art, which typically explores something larger than itself. But there's a lesson to be learned here nonetheless for anyone who looks beyond the tawdriness: If a lover seems too good to be true, he or she probably is. So watch your step.","Jodi Arias: Dirty Little Secret, though soapy, takes a straightforward look at the events leading up to her month-old murder conviction .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:48 EST, 1 October 2011 . New York City police are bracing for a weekend of mayhem in lower Manhattan with thousands expected to risk arrest as the Occupy Wall Street protest moves into its third straight week. More than 1,000 demonstrators speaking out against corporate greed and social inequality took their protest to the New York Police Department (NYPD) headquarters yesterday. The Occupy Wall Street protesters camping out in lower Manhattan marched several blocks north yesterday and demonstrated there for about two hours against the police response to the downtown protest, which is in its second week. United: Demonstrators from the Occupy Wall Street campaign sit in the plaza in front of the New York Police Department headquarters on Friday . Critics have accused officers of being . heavy-handed, saying they have roughed up people who did nothing wrong, . the NYPD has disputed that claim. Protesters also say they're upset . about reports from The Associated Press that an NYPD intelligence unit . has sought to infiltrate the city's Muslim community. The movement, whose members have . vowed to stay through the winter, are protesting issues including the . 2008 bank bailouts, foreclosures and high unemployment. And . the increasing presence of more affluent-looking demonstrators is . fuelling questions over whether this is the moment a frustrated middle . America is uniting for a national uprising. The protest encampment in Zuccotti . Park in downtown Manhattan is festooned with placards and anti-Wall . Street slogans. There is a makeshift kitchen and library, and . celebrities from filmmaker Michael Moore to actress Susan Sarandon have . stopped by to show solidarity. Grungy youths sleeping on the street, . topless women waving signs stating 'I love this country', and ageing . hippies have won their share of national headlines for their cries of . rebellion. But among these protesters are also men wearing suits and mothers who have driven in from the suburbs. Julien Harrison, an aspiring teacher, was among the frustrated masses, travelling from Portland, Maine to voice his frustration. Mr Harrison, who said his student debt amounts to $50,000, has only been able to find only manual labour since getting his master's degree. He told VOA News: 'Of course, they’re laying off teachers all over the country,' he said. 'It’s getting more and more competitive. I just came from Portland. There’s people with Ph.Ds, masters, undergraduate degrees competing to be a barista at a coffee shop.' The 'people powered movement for . democracy' - inspired by the Egyptian Tahrir Square uprising and the . Spanish acampadas - has been targeted by critics who say the rallies, thanks to a vague list of demands and disorganised leadership, will be . only a footnote in the history of middle America's growing frustration . with unemployment and a dismal economic forecast. But demonstrators say otherwise. Susie and Artie Ravitz stand next to . Carlson. Retirees from Easton, Pennsylvania, told the Huffington Post . they drove to lower Manhattan to add numbers to the uprising. 'The main thing is to draw attention . to the disparities,' she said. 'The rich and the greedy are taking the . country down. It's really a discouraging time. 'You have young people . with college degrees left out in the cold, unable to find jobs. I have . kids and grandchildren. I really worry what their lives are going to be . like.'

The unions could provide important . organizational and financial support for the largely leaderless . movement. On Friday, demonstrators who camped . out for fourteen straight days gathered once again to march to police . headquarters over what they viewed as excessive force used against . demonstrators, minorities and Muslims.

Parts of it are said to incorporate timbers from the galleons of the Spanish Armada of 1588. Drake was among the commanders whose own ships harried and repelled  the Spaniards – reputedly after finishing his game of bowls on nearby Plymouth Hoe. A central pillar that forms part of a spiral staircase is apparently a mast from one of the stricken enemy vessels. Shelley Jones said of the paint plan: 'I don't think Drake would have thought very much of the idea. The place has been here for nearly 500 years and it hasn't burned down yet' Drake later lived a few doors away at the top of the cobbled street in which it still stands. Centuries afterwards, the pub somehow survived the Second World War Blitz that flattened vast areas of the city. It also survived decades of redevelopment around it. The tradition of signing the Minerva ceiling began in 1970, and resumed in 1999 after redecoration. Retreat of the Spanish Armada from England in stormy seas in 1588 . Mrs Jones, 43, who runs the Grade II-listed pub with husband Martin, 45, told the Mail: ‘The fire safety people came round and told us we needed to paint the woodwork, including the old ships’ timber and the wood-panelled ceiling. ‘We live upstairs and the paint is meant to retard the flames to give us time to escape – although to  do that, we’d have to jump from one of the upstairs windows anyway.’ Mr and Mrs Jones are now negotiating to find a way of fire-proofing the wood without damaging or masking it, possibly by using  varnish instead of paint. Devon and Somerset fire and rescue service said: ‘Safeguarding  heritage from the ravages of fire is a vital part of the protection work of the fire service.’","Woodwork of Minerva Inn in Plymouth poses a fire risk, say safety officials .

A car bomb killed 53 people and wounded 200 in central Damascus on Thursday when it blew up on a busy highway close to ruling Baath Party offices and the Russian Embassy, Syrian television said. TV footage showed charred and bloodied bodies strewn across the street after the blast, which state media said was the result of a suicide bombing by 'terrorists' battling President Bashar al-Assad. Central Damascus has been relatively insulated from almost two years of unrest and civil war in which around 70,000 people have been killed across the country, but the bloodshed has shattered suburbs around the capital. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Burning cars sit around the crater left by the huge car bomb that killed 53 people in Damascus . Rebels who control districts to the south and east of Damascus have attacked Assad's power base for nearly a month and struck with devastating bombs over the last year. The al Qaeda-linked rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra, which claimed responsibility for several of those bombs, says it carried out 17 attacks around Damascus in the first half of February, including at least seven bombings. Activists said most of the victims of the attack in the city's Mazraa district were civilians, including children, possibly from a school behind the Baath building. Casualty: Syrian security agents carry a body following the massive explosion that shook central Damascus . TV footage showed charred and bloodied bodies strewn across the street after the blast . Opposition activists reported further explosions elsewhere in the city after the explosion which struck shortly before 11 am local time. One resident in the heart of the capital heard three or four projectiles whistling through the sky, followed by explosions. At least one of them landed in a public garden in the Abu Rummaneh district, she said, but no one was hurt. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors violence via a network of sources inside Syria, said the Mazraa car bomb detonated at a checkpoint close to the Baath Party building, located about 200 metres (660 feet) from the Russian embassy. Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers carry a man who was wounded in the blast . Targets: The bomb exploded near the headquarters of the ruling Baath party and the Russian Embassy . A wrecked bus sits on the street following the car bomb attack which sent thick smoke billowing across the capital's skyline . Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted a diplomat as saying the blast blew out windows at the embassy but no employees were wounded. ""The building has really been damaged ... The windows are shattered,"" the diplomat said. The vehicle was carrying between 1 and 1.5 tonnes of explosives, Damascus Governor Bishr Sabban told Reuters. A correspondent for Syrian television said he saw seven body bags with corpses at the scene. He counted 17 burnt-out cars and another 40 that were destroyed or badly damaged by the force of the blast, which ripped a crater 1.5 metres deep into the road. Later, the Observatory reported, two car bombs exploded outside security centres in the northeastern district of Barzeh, but there were no details of casualties. Syrian TV said security forces detained a would-be suicide bomber with five bombs in his car, one of them weighing 300 kg (440 pounds). In the southern city of Deraa, where the uprising against Assad erupted in March 2011, warplanes bombed the city's old district for the first time in nearly two years of conflict, killing 18 people, activists said.

Fear gripped a large swathe of the US last night as the hunt went on for a rogue ex-police officer whose revenge killing spree has claimed three lives. Police and federal agents seeking heavily armed Christopher Dorner fear the Navy-trained survival expert and crack shot may launch a Rambo-style guerrilla war or try to go out in a blaze of glory. Dorner, 33, who was sacked from the Los Angeles Police Department in 2008 for lying about an officer he had accused of misconduct, has threatened in a rambling ‘manifesto he published on Facebook to bring ‘warfare’ to the LAPD and to avenge himself by killing officers and their families. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Rampage: Christopher Jordan Dorner is a disgraced former LAPD officer and a combat-trained former reservist in the U.S. Navy who served in Iraq . Door-to-door: A SWAT team barrels into a home in Big Bear, Calif. in search of shooting suspect Christopher Dorner . Hunting: The officers continued to search for Dorner into the night - even though a massive snowstorm was scheduled for the mountain community . Bundled up: A Los Angeles county sheriff SWAT member prepares to continue the search for Christopher Dorner in the heavy snow at the Bear Mountain ski resort . Ominously, he vowed to ‘utilise every . bit of small arms training, demolition, ordinance and survival training . I’ve been given’ and even claimed he has shoulder-launched missiles to . target any helicopters used to pursue him. Although the search for Dorner has . extended across three states and even to Mexico, police were last night . concentrating on combing the snowy San Bernardino mountains 100 miles . east of Los Angeles after Dorner’s truck was found set on fire on . Thursday afternoon on a forestry road near Big Bear. Footprints from the vehicle led off through the snow into the surrounding forest but disappeared when they got to frozen ground. Police officers spent all night . searching in sub-zero temperatures and the hunt continued yesterday, . using snowcats and armoured personnel carriers to reach mountain huts . where Dorner may be hiding. Locals were warned to stay locked in their . homes. Dorner, who served with the US Navy in . Iraq, went on the run with a small arsenal of weapons after shooting . dead a policeman and a couple connected to another former colleague. Monica Quan, a sports coach, was . killed with her fiancé Keith Lawrence as they sat in their car outside . their home in Irvine, California, on Sunday. Braved for battle: A San Bernardino County Sheriff SWAT team returns to the command post at Bear Mountain near Big Bear Lake, Calif. after searching for Christopher Jordan Dorner Friday .

Solo mission: This heavily armed, and warmly dressed, police officer is on patrol looking for Dorner . Search widens: San Diego police are on harbor patrol for Dorner. Officials in three states and Mexico are looking for him after he tried to steal a boat to sail out of the country . Scenes of carnage: This map locates sites of shootings and other incidents connected to Dorner's rampage . Miss Quan, 27, was the daughter of a . former police captain, Randal Quan, who represented Dorner in his failed . appeal against his dismissal from the LAPD and who Dorner blamed for . bungling his case. On Wednesday night, after trying to . steal a boat to escape to Mexico, Dorner drove inland, shooting at . police officers at random. In the early hours of Thursday, he . shot at two officers assigned to protect one of his suspected targets in . Corona, California, grazing one in the head. Less than an hour later, . he pulled up next to a police car waiting at traffic lights in the . neighbouring town of Riverside and ambushed the officers inside with an . assault rifle. A 34-year-old policeman was killed and his partner seriously wounded. As panicked officers tried to protect . not only Dorner’s likely targets but also themselves, innocent people . were caught in the crossfire. A mother and daughter delivering . newspapers were wounded and their pick-up truck riddled with bullets . after nervous police in the wealthy LA suburb of Torrance mistook their . vehicle for Dorner’s. Minutes later, other Torrance officers shot at . another vehicle in a second case of mistaken identity, although no one . was injured. Psychiatrists say that, unlike most spree killers, Dorner does not appear to be psychotic. A picture of the hulking, heavily . muscled African-American emerged as a single man who is amicable and . very intelligent, but highly sensitive about race issues. Dorner joined . the navy after university in 2001, undergoing extensive combat and . counter-terrorism training. In 2005, while still in the military, he . applied to join the LAPD. During police training, superiors said . he had a problem with authority but he still joined. Within months he . was called back into service by the navy and spent 13 months in Bahrain. Returning to the LAPD to complete his training, he complained to colleagues that the force was racist. Getting closer: Police are searching Dorner's burned out truck for any potential clues .

Special delivery: This is the envelope that Dorner mailed to Cooper. It arrived on February 1 - before deadly rampage . Hunting: San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies armed with Ruger Mini14 assault rifles went door-to-door hunting for Dormer . Murdered: Monica Quan (right) and her fiance Keith Lawrence (left) were shot to death in their car outside their home in Irvine. Miss Quan was the daughter of the LAPD police captain who represented Dorner when he was fired .

Riddled with bullets: LAPD inspects one of their police cars that was allegedly shot up by Dorner during a chase early today . Looking for clues: Cops check one of their squad cars after Dorner fired at them on a highway . Fully protected: Three police officers stand guard after Dorner's alleged shooting of two LAPD cops in Corona this morning . Revenge: Dorner, also a former Naval reservist, is suspected of shooting three police officers, one fatally early Thursday after the cops tried to apprehend him . Dorner's manifesto also included bizarre messages to some of his favorite athletes, actors, politicians and comedians. TIM TEBOW: You are not a good QB by todays standards, but you are a great football player who knows how to lead a team and WIN. You will be “Tebowing” when you reach your next team. ELLEN DEGENERES: Continue your excellent contribution to entertaining America and bringing the human factor to entertainment. You changed the perception of your gay community and how we as Americans view the LGBT community. CHARLIE SHEEN: Charlie Sheen, you’re effin awesome.

You are the epitome of an American and service to country. He accused his patrol partner – who . had been critical of him – of kicking a mentally ill man in the face but . an investigation concluded he was lying and he was fired. He appeared . so angry that police officials summoned armed guards to stand watch. He spent the next couple of years appealing unsuccessfully. In his 6,000-word ‘manifesto’ on . Facebook, in which he bizarrely paid tribute to dozens of his favourite . celebrities, Dorner demanded a public apology from the LAPD – a move . that police chiefs ruled out. He said he would avenge himself by killing . officers and even their families. ‘I never had the opportunity to have a . family of my own... so I am terminating yours,’ he wrote. Accusing the . authorities of misjudging a ‘sleeping giant’ he warned of warfare ‘to . those in LAPD uniform whether on or off duty. ‘Unfortunately, I will not be alive to . see my name cleared. That’s what this is about, my name. A man is . nothing without his name. Self-preservation is no longer important to . me. I do not fear death as I died long ago.’ Yesterday, as thousands of heavily . armed police patrolled the highways of southern California and  others . guarded the homes of people he vowed to attack, police chief Charlie .

A Boeing Dreamliner jet has been forced to make an emergency landing shortly after taking off on a flight from Denver to Tokyo. The United Airlines flight was diverted to Seattle as a precaution yesterday when pilots were alerted to a problem with the plane's oil filter. The incident will heap further embarrassment on Boeing, which has seen the Dreamliner get off to a troubled start by being grounded for several months thanks to overheating in its battery. Scroll down for video . In the latest of a series of setbacks for the new model, United Airlines said a Dreamliner on its way to Tokyo from Denver was forced to land in Seattle as a precaution . It is not believed that yesterday's emergency landing was connected to the battery problems previously experienced by the jet . Boeing said that it was working with United and General Electric, manufacturer of the plane's jet engines, to work out what had gone wrong . It is not believed that yesterday's emergency landing was connected to the battery problems previously experienced by the jet. The flight safely landed at Seattle airport with no further incidents. 'United flight 139 from Denver to Tokyo diverted to Seattle due to an indication of a problem with an oil filter,' United said in a statement. 'The aircraft landed normally and without incident and we are working to re-accommodate customers.' Boeing said in a statement that it was working with United and General Electric, manufacturer of the plane's jet engines, to work out what had gone wrong. Delivery line: A queue of Dreamliners waiting to be transported to customers in Washington . The 787 Dreamliner, the first carbon-fibre aircraft made by Boeing, was hotly anticipated in the aircraft industry, but its development has been plagued with troubles. The jet was launched three years behind schedule, and was first delivered to airlines in 2011. However, in January this year the entire fleet of Dreamliners worldwide was grounded after two planes were forced to make emergency landings within the space of a week. The problem was traced to the jets' lithium-ion batteries, which were only declared safe last month. The latest emergency landing will cast more doubt on the future of the 787, which faces stiff competition from the forthcoming Airbus A350. Nonetheless, airlines such as British Airways and Thomson Airlines have bought the planes in an attempt to reduce the cost of fuel.","Flight from Denver to Tokyo diverted to land at Seattle yesterday .

Split: David Cameron, pictured in Downing Street last night, faces deep Cabinet divisions over arming Syrian rebels . David Cameron is facing a serious split in his Cabinet over plans to arm the Syrian rebels, the Mail can reveal. At least six senior ministers on the National Security Council have raised concerns about handing over weapons to the opposition fighters seeking to oust dictator Bashar al-Assad. Cabinet sources say it could take 18 months of arming rebels to force Assad to the negotiating table – a bleak assessment which means Britain faces being sucked into a longterm military commitment in the world’s most combustible region. The Mail understands that Britain is set to offer military training to the rebels and is also examining whether arms can be handed over too. But a meeting of the National Security Council last month revealed deep splits in the Cabinet over whether to intervene. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, Development Secretary Justine Greening, Ken Clarke and Faith Minister Sayeeda Warsi all lined up in the ‘sceptic’ camp, voicing concerns that military involvement could be disastrous. Security sources say Mr Clegg told the meeting ‘there is no military solution’ to the war and that Britain should not act unless ‘there is a wider political strategy that’s supported by other leading powers, particularly the US’. Today Mr Clegg said a decision on whether Britain took action on Syria should be 'governed' by the United States. Speaking on his weekly LBC 97.3 phone-in, he said: 'There’s no perfect answer. If there was a perfect simple answer we would have sorted everything. What can you do if anything? 'We haven’t taken any decisions about providing arms to the moderate forces in the opposition. 'This is not a decision in any event the United Kingdom should take on our own, this is something that has to be governed by what other big powers around the world think, notably the United States.' The ‘doves’ were supported by Attorney General Dominic Grieve has also warned Mr Cameron that he would be on ‘safer ground’ if he secures backing from the United Nations – something that looks impossible since Russia, which has a UN veto, is propping up the regime in Damascus. One source characterised the Attorney General’s intervention as ‘being a bit like someone’s wife, saying: “Why don’t you think about this all the time?”’. The source said the Prime Minister ‘gets very irritated with Dominic’ and has already decided that Britain must step up its help for the rebels. ‘David got a taste for it in Libya and he thinks something must be done,’ said one source familiar with the discussions. Mr Cameron has been joined in the hawk camp by Education Secretary Michael Gove, Chancellor George Osborne and Philip Hammond. Hawks: Foreign Secretary William Hague (left) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond are backing the idea of providing lethal support . The Defence Secretary has called for any arms drops to be ‘targeted’ so they don’t fall into the hands of al Qaeda sympathisers. And he has warned that there are limits to what the Armed Forces can do. Mr Hammond was recently present when backbenchers suggested that the Tory leadership could do with ‘a small war’ to distract attention from party discontent over Europe and gay marriage. ‘It had better be a very small war,’ the Defence Secretary said. But insiders say Mr Hammond is ‘very supportive’ of the Prime Minister’s stance that arms may be necessary. Foreign Secretary William Hague has also come to the view that peace talks to resolve the crisis are ‘doomed to fail’ and is keen that plans be drawn up for military assistance to the rebels. ‘We have to prepare for the failure of diplomacy,’ a senior Whitehall source said. ‘We will try to make it work but there is little hope that it will.’ Momentum towards war was building last night when the Foreign Office said they believe the Assad regime has used chemical weapons in the civil war, which has already cost 70,000 lives. Doves: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg believes 'there is no military solution' to the war in Syria and is backed by Faith minister Baroness Warsi who is said to be against providing arms . The full Cabinet has not had the chance to discuss the issue of arming the rebels and MPs are clamouring for a Commons vote if arms are sent to Syria. Downing Street sought to play down the suggestion that the Cabinet was deeply split on the issue. Mr Cameron's spokesman told a . Westminster media briefing: 'There is complete agreement on the approach . we have been taking, which most recently led to the UK along with . France making the case for the lifting of the EU arms embargo.' The spokesman added: 'The point of . lifting the arms embargo has been to give us the flexibility to respond . differently if we think that is the right thing to do, but no decision . to provide lethal assistance has been taken.' Mr Cameron indicated yesterday that he would allow a free vote if the decision to send arms is signed off and that he would recall Parliament if the decision is made over the summer. He said: ‘I've never been someone who has wanted to stand against the House having a say on any of these issues. 'I supported holding the vote on Iraq, in my premiership when there was the issue of Libya I recalled the House as soon as I possibly could and allowed the House to have a vote. ‘But this issue does not arise at present because we have made no decision to arm the rebels.’ But senior backbenchers have warned the Prime Minister that he would lose if it comes to a vote. ‘This is an Arab problem,’ one former minister said. ‘They should sort it out. There is next to no support on the backbenches for getting involved in this war.’ Allegations: The U.N. Commission of Inquiry said conclusive findings can be reached only after testing samples taken directly from victims or the site of the alleged attacks. This image shows forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad during an operation . Worrying: The aftermath of an air strike in Qusair after the announcement about chemical weapons . Former shadow defence spokesman Julian Lewis added: ‘I think the Government would struggle to get endorsement in parliament for a policy of giving arms to the opposition in this civil war.’ In an echo of the build-up to the conflicts in Iraq and Libya, Mr Hague and Mr Cameron have begun holding private meetings with MPs to convince them that they should support arming the rebels. Mr Hague argues that failure to act will lead to a regional war sucking in Israel and Iran and fatally destabilise Syria’s neighbours Jordan and Lebanon, both of which have been inundated with refugees fleeing the war zone.","At least 6 ministers on the National Security Council have raised concerns .

These Chinese children are trainees at the Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe, and dream of performing around the world. With lessons from morning til night, and only an hour and a half off a day, their rigorous training will ensure that those who achieve their dream will be the best they can be. The children training for the Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe in China's Hunan Province spends hours each day practising contortion . Only the best and most dedicated children will make it through to become members of the independent troupe . Training for the troupe is free for talented children, and those who make it will receive a contract to perform and a monthly wage. The acrobats, based in Changsha, in southern China's Hunan Province, are run by 76-year-old troupe leader Han Keting, a former acrobat who performed for Chairman Mao. He runs a tight ship.  Earlier this year, the leader dismissed two children because he decided they weren't training as hard as the others. 'They could set bad examples,' he said. The troupe's young members, who live together in a dormitory, train each day from 8.10am to 11.30am, and from 2pm-5.30pm. Their schedule is pinned on a board in front of the training house and includes body contortion, handstand, skate rolling, kung fu, stairs, and many others. The children at the acrobatic school practise the same stunts over and over again until they are perfected . With every tendon tightly controlled, and jaws clenched with effort, two female students practise holding a handstand . As part of their training the children perform the same actions over and over again until they are perfected. Each month the difficulty level is then raised and they learn a new set of even tougher stunts. One such stunt is called the Boneless Girl, and involves the acrobat placing her chin on the floor and curling her body up behind her with her feet placed on the floor in front of her face. Mr Keting said: 'Most kids started training from eight years old, and as an acrobat they only have five years of golden time, from 16 to 20. With their neck and their jaw taking all of their body weight, it is obvious why such rigorous training is necessary . The troupe was set up by former acrobat Han Keting, 76, who once performed in front of Chairman Mao . The trainee acrobats live together in dormitories and dream of winning a paid contract with the respected troupe . Utmost dedication is required of the pupils - earlier this year two children were dismissed for not training hard enough . Each month the difficulty level is raised and the young students start to learn a new set of even tougher stunts . 'After 20 years old, their skills are becoming rusty and body is becoming stiff'. Mr Keting performed on stage for more than 40 years, and after retiring from a provincial state-owned acrobatics troupe, he established his own. He said: 'No one can perform my programme anymore, as it takes years of extremely hard training.' The respected troupe leader now has connections around the world and has taken his troupe to perform in countries including Britain, the United States, Germany, Mexico and Thailand. China's long-established Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe is well respected and performs all over the world . Learning to be an acrobat requires complete dedication, and the students train from 8.10am until 5.30pm . The patched shoes reflect the fact that money is tight for the students, but they will earn a monthly wage . Living and training at such close quarters, the students develop tight friendships with each other . This young girl is practising for a stunt called the Boneless Girl - agility is essential for these highly skilled acrobats .","Youngsters train in the hope of joining China's Fei Yan Acrobatics Troupe .

Actor Rhys Ifans is among a group of six celebrities to have launched phone hacking claims since March . Notting Hill actor Rhys Ifans and television presenter Cilla Black have launched phone hacking damages claims, it emerged today. News of their legal actions came during the 16th case management conference at the High Court in London relating to claims against News Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun and the now defunct News Of The World. Two judges heard that since the last hearing in March six new claims had been issued and six others have settled. Details of the settled cases have yet to be confirmed. Big Brother former winner Anthony Hutton is among the six newly launched claims. Cilla Black’s son Robert Willis has also launched a claim. During the hearing, Dinah Rose QC, for NGN, told Mr Justice Vos and Mr Justice Mann that more than 95 per cent of cases had been settled. She said the group had acted in accordance with its 'expressed intention' to pay fair and generous compensation to anyone whose phone had been hacked, 'and that is why the overwhelming majority of the claims have been settled'. Mr Tomlinson said the Met Police have asked for civil disputes linked to Operation Elveden, the probe into corrupt payments by journalists, to be put on hold until live investigations have been resolved. ‘The Met Police is understandably concerned about the case being progressed in this court at this time’, he said. Ms Rose said News Group will ‘firmly’ opposed Elveden claims and will expose anyone using that legal avenue to their costs if the bid fails. ‘In relation to voicemail interceptions, News Group said publicly it’s our intention to pay for generous compensation for anyone whose telephones were hacked’, she said. Big Brother winner Anthony Hutton and television presenter Cilla Black have both launched claims . News Group Newspapers, which owns The Sun, said it has settled more than 95 per cent of cases . ‘We are acting in accordance with our express intention. ‘That is not News Group’s position in relation to so-called Elveden claims. ‘We do not consider these claims to be meritorious and our intention is to resist them.’ Ms Rose said the News Group compensation scheme for victims of phone hacking is still dealing with 200 claims, but has rejected some it deemed to not stand up. She told the judges that 'unfortunately . one does have a situation where there are a number of legal firms who . have done very well indeed out of this litigation', and that there may . be 'a certain amount of ambulance-chasing going on'. Hugh Tomlinson QC, who represents the claimant group in the litigation, said there were between five and 10 so-called Operation Elveden claims. The only claim currently lodged with the court over alleged corrupt payments is from model Sarah Hannon, who featured in a Sun story about an alleged sex act on an airplane. The former advisor to supermodel Elle MacPherson dropped her phone hacking claim at the High Court last month due to lack of evidence. She may now face a hefty costs bill from News Group as a result of the aborted litigation. A date for trial of any remaining phone hacking claimants who do not settle with the newspaper group could now be heard in 2014, the court heard.

Sir John Major: The former Prime Minister has urged Conservative Eurosceptics to keep quiet . Sir John Major warned ‘irreconcilable’ Conservative Eurosceptics to keep quiet today as he warned they are undermining David Cameron’s attempts to claw back powers from Brussels ahead of an in/out referendum on Britain’s EU membership.The former prime minister described Mr Cameron’s decision to promise a referendum in 2017 as a ‘gamble’ that could lead to Britain’s exit from Europe and warned the issue had ‘come close to destroying the Conservative Party’ in the past.Calling for the Prime Minister to appoint a Cabinet minister as his ‘lead negotiator’ ahead of the referendum, even if it means overruling the Liberal Democrats, Sir John was scathing about Eurosceptic rebel MPs.He said those who believed it was ‘helpful’ for the Prime Minister to receive unsolicited advice about which powers should be repatriated, since it demonstrates to other EU colleagues the strength of feeling in Britain, were ‘quite wrong’.‘Such advice, given publicly, will undermine the Prime Minister’s negotiating position. He will be seen to be acting under political duress, rather than principle and conviction - and his hand will be weakened,’ Sir John said.In a reference to his own battles with those he infamously described as Eurosceptic ‘bastards’, the former prime minister added: ‘I know that because I have been there’.Speaking at the Chatham House foreign policy think tank in London, Sir John, making a rare intervention into contemporary politics, made a powerful case for Britain staying in the EU having renegotiated a looser, more trade-based relationship with Brussels.He said that on principle, he was not in favour of referendums in a Parliamentary democracy - but suggested Mr Cameron had had no option but to promise one on EU membership after the next election. The Prime Minister delighted Tory MPs last month when he said that if re-elected, he would seek to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU and then offer voters the first decision on membership since we entered the Common Market in 1975.‘This referendum could heal many old sores and have a cleansing effect on politics.  It will be healthy to let the electorate re-endorse our membership, or pull us out altogether,’ Sir John said. ‘At present, we are drifting towards - and possibly through - the European exit.  We need a renegotiation – and a Referendum endorsement of it.  If this is denied, the clamour for it will only grow.    ‘But it is a gamble – for the Country and for the Conservative Party.  The relationship with Europe has poisoned British politics for too long, distracted Parliament from other issues, and come close to destroying the Conservative Party.  It is time to resolve the matter.’ 'Gamble': Sir John has said David Cameron's decision to promise a referendum in 2017 could lead to Britain's exit from Europe . Sir John, who faced a damaging revolt from Conservative MPs over his decision to sign the Maastricht Treaty in the early 1990s, urged today’s rebels to give the Prime Minister space to renegotiate Britain’s relationship. ‘We need to prepare our own proposals without delay, and negotiate courteously and with understanding,’ he said. ‘This manner in which these negotiations are conducted is vital.‘If we enter them with the aggressive attitude of “give us our way or we quit”, we will fail.’  Sir John said some polls suggested that currently, voters might vote to leave the EU, and said it would not be ‘easy’ to negotiate a better deal that would satisfy people. Sir John warned that ‘rebellion is addictive’ for some Tory ‘irreconcilables’ who were so obsessed with leaving the EU that they were prepared to ‘bring down any Prime Minister’.‘Members with Conservative heads and UKIP hearts cannot be placated,’ he said. ‘Whatever is offered to them will be insufficient. They will demand more. They will only be satisfied by withdrawal.‘The Prime Minister should be prepared for the likelihood that the irreconcilable among his Parliamentarians, including ministers, will campaign for a British withdrawal.’ Defiant: Sir John urged Mr Cameron to begin renegotiation talks soon . The former prime minister urged Mr Cameron to defy Liberal Democrat objections and to begin renegotiation talks soon.‘I believe he should appoint a lead negotiator who sits in the Cabinet. If the Liberal Democrats oppose such an appointment – which is possible, since they oppose the referendum – then the Prime Minister should overrule them. On a matter of this importance, the tail must not wag the dog.’Sir John said he did not have a ‘shred of doubt’ that British interests were best served by remaining inside the EU.‘The tens of thousands of UK companies who trade with the European Union should think long and hard about the consequences of exit. So should their employees, numbered in millions. To leave, would be a jump into a void,’ he said.‘It would be a brave decision for Britain to go it alone. I bow to no-one in my pride of our country, but we should see ourselves as others see us.‘We are 70 million in a world of 7 billion, with nations like China, India, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico and Russia all rising in economic and political importance. Do we wish to become less relevant in their eyes, or face the future as a leading voice in a block of 500 million people? To leave would be to march against history.”‘Many who wish us to withdraw from Europe do so on the assumption that we could enhance our relationship with existing allies: most obviously, the United States and the Commonwealth. They are mistaken.’UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The very fact that Tories are calling out retired PMs to back up their leader shows just how weak David Cameron is. ‘Major’s speech simply corroborates the fact that UKIP are the only party who want to get Britain out of the EU. The Tories can scaremonger or try to charm people back all they like - the British voters are more discerning than that.’","PM's decision to promise a referendum is a 'gamble', says Sir John .

Facing jail: RSPCA inspectors found the second rabbit with a broken spine in the home of Bilal Yilmaz (pictured), 23, in Hull, East Yorkshire . A takeaway driver killed a rabbit by hurling it from a 40ft balcony - and smashed another against a brick wall, a court heard. RSPCA inspectors found the second rabbit with a broken spine in the home of Bilal Yilmaz, 23, in Hull, East Yorkshire - after it had been dragging itself around the home using just its front legs. The animal was so badly injured that its back legs had started decomposing while it was still alive, Hull Magistrates’ Court was told. Inspectors said the decomposing flesh smell was so strong on the living rabbit that they had to move away to avoid being physically sick before rescuing the animal, when it was put to sleep. Yilmaz - who will soon be sentenced for animal cruelty and also for assaulting his pregnant wife - laughed at police when they asked if he had hurt the animals, the court was told. One of the pets had been unable to walk for more than month due to a broken spine and femur after being thrown against the wall - and had not been taken for any treatment. RSPCA inspector Hannah Bryer said: ‘This is an horrific case. Inflicting violence on any animal is completely unacceptable. It was an appalling, callous and cruel act. ‘This young rabbit would have been powerless to do anything to protect itself and she was then left untreated for weeks before she was found. 'Doing this job, I have seen some horrendous consequences of cruelty and neglect - but this one will stick in my mind for a long time to come. ‘My heart sinks when I think about the immense suffering this rabbit will have endured at the hands of her owner - the very person who was meant to care for her.’ The second rabbit was found emaciated and . immobile inside a cardboard box covered with a plastic carrier bag after . they were called to the flat after a dispute with his partner in .

Scene: Yilmaz threw the other rabbit from a 40ft balcony on the top floor of this block of flats in Hull . Philip Brown, prosecuting, said: ‘The rabbit was emaciated and underweight. It was unable to move its hind legs and could only move by dragging itself along on its front legs. ‘Its flesh was decomposing and there was a strong, foul smell. The inspector felt physically sick and had to move away before she recovered it.’ 'Doing this job, I have seen some horrendous consequences of cruelty and neglect - but this one will stick in my mind for a long time to come' RSPCA inspector Hannah Bryer . Yilmaz claimed to have only ‘flicked’ the rabbit against a wall inside the flat after it bit him. However, a vet concluded the rabbit must have been forcefully thrown to inflict the injuries. Mr Brown said: ‘The vet said he was horrified by the degree of suffering this animal endured, especially considering the owner had inflicted the injuries and didn’t make any attempt to alleviate the suffering. 'This was a deliberate act of cruelty by the defendant, which resulted in the animal suffering for a prolonged period of time.’ Aside from the animal cruelty, Yilmaz was also said to have tried to drag his wife - also his cousin - into a car to convince her to have an abortion and also assaulted a toddler. He admitted ‘accidentally’ slapping a toddler across the face and will remain in custody until he is sentenced later this month.","RSPCA inspectors found the second rabbit with broken spine in home .

The artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet is now almost completely blind after 18 operations failed to save his sight following an acid attack earlier this year. Sergei Filin, 42,  was left with severe burns to his eyes and face when a masked attacker threw a jar of sulphuric acid in his face as he was returning home late on January 17. He flew to Germany from Moscow for treatment in March, but despite initial optimistic reports, he has now lost 95 per cent of his vision and is totally blind in his right eye. Scroll down for video . Horrifying::Sergei Filin before and after the attack which has left him almost completely blind . Career over: ergei Filin starring in Gisellle in 2000. He had previously spoken of his desire to return to work, but now the prognosis looks bleak . A spokeswoman for the Bolshoi told The Times yesterday: 'He is now blind in his right eye. The problem is that it is acid and it continues to cause damage. He has had 18 operations and I understand that some of them were very difficult.' She said that his facial burns had almost completely healed and his hair had grown back. The spokeswoman also said that he continues to speak regularly on company business to Galina Stepanenko, who has been standing in for him. The dancer: Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29, - known as 'Ivan the Terrible' for his talent for playing ballet villains - was remanded in custody until at least June 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal . The Bolshoi, one of Russia's best-known . cultural symbols, filed two reprimands against Tsiskaridze for giving . unauthorised interviews after the attack on Mr Filin. When he arrived at Aachen University Clinic, Mr Filin said he was 'full of strength and faith' that he will eventually see well enough to return to work at the famed Moscow theatre. But it appears his progress has now stalled and the prognosis for his sight is now bleak. Pavel Dmitrichenko, 29, - known as 'Ivan . the Terrible' for his talent for playing ballet villains - is accused . of paying a 'hitman' £1,080 to attack Sergei Filin after his girlfriend was snubbed for a role. But . while Dmitrichenko has admitted ordering the attack, he argues he only . wanted Filin 'beaten up' and did not sanction the use of sulphuric . acid. An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is . accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to . attack Mr Filin. In April a judge in Moscow rejected his . plea to be released on bail pending the results of a police . investigation, deeming him a flight risk. Allegations: Pavel Dmitrichenko (right) is said top have ordered the attack after his 'partner' Anzhelina Vorontsova (right) was snubbed for a role . Arrests: Alleged masked attacker Yury Zarutsky . (left) and Andrei Lipatov (right), the driver who took part in attack . on Filin, have both confessed to their involvement, police say . He was remanded in custody until at least June 18 as the probe goes on into the scandal. As the biggest scandal in the history of . Russian ballet, the case has gripped Russia as revelations exposing the . internal rifts tearing the classical dance world apart as well as a . string of murky sub-plots. Police claim Dmitrichenko  was motivated by fury at Filin for snubbing his girlfriend, 21-year-old Anzhelina Vorontsova. 'The . main reason he gave to the investigator is revenge,' a police source . told Russian newspaper Izvestia. 'Filin did not let her play leading dancing roles in the . Bolshoi.' But Dmitrichenko . - who faces up to 12 years in jail if found guilty - claimed at an earlier court hearing . that he was horrified when he realised that acid was used in the 17 . January attack on Filin. 'When I heard what happened to Sergei, I was just in shock,' he said. 'I could not believe that the man who proposed beating him up went ahead and did this thing with acid. Dancer: Sources say that Pavel Dmitrichenko may . been upset about the treatment of his Bolshoi partner Anzhelina . Vorontsova, 21, pictured above . 'I did not order harm done to this man.' However, Dmitrichenko and accomplices . evidently also hacked 16,000 emails of top Bolshoi figures as he sought . to prove that Filin demanded a percentage of fees obtained by troupe . members in TV or sponsored dancing engagements outside the theatre. It is unclear exactly when Dmitrichenko's trial will begin as police continue to investigate. Earlier this month the principal ballet dancer with the Bolshoi Theatre claimed he was being forced out of the troupe over allegations that he was part of the acid attack . Nikolai Tsiskaridze, 39, has been told he must leave at the end of the month amidst claims by Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov that he may have been involved. Crisis: General view of the hall from the Bolshoi Theatre stage in Moscow- the attack on Filin plunged the Bolshoi into a grave crisis . Mr Tsiskaridze's relationship with Mr Iksanov soured sharply after the Bolshoi director suggested that the Georgia-born dancer might have played a role inciting the attack. Mr Tsiskaridze, who has been at the Bolshoi since 1992 as principal dancer and teacher, hit back saying the manager was conducting a witch hunt against him. 'This is hounding of the sole and most famous artist of the Bolshoi Theatre,' the dancer said. The principal dancer has now been told that his contract will not be renewed when it expires at the end of June, Bolshoi spokeswoman Katerina Novikova said, but refused to give the reason for the decision.

His hair was a great deal darker than it was a few months ago – changing from auburn to its current shade of deep brown.

Will you colour it for me?” It doesn’t show up in photos, so it’s just for my own vanity.’ He has put his youthful looks down to a strict diet and exercise, as well as avoiding drink and drugs.

Hospitals may be adopting the wrong strategy for combating a notorious bug on the wards, a study suggests. Research showed that contact between patients only accounted for a minority of infections by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. diff). The new findings from a team based at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford contradict previous thinking. Until now it has been assumed that C. diff spreads through personal contact with infected patients showing symptoms. Scientists collected stool samples from almost 15,000 hospital patients and found evidence of C. diff in 4.4 per cent. Further tests identified 69 strains of the bacterium, but only 23 per cent of these could be linked to known symptomatic patients. The authors, led by Professor Tim Peto, wrote in the online journal Public Library of Science Medicine: 'In this endemic setting with well-implemented infection control measures, up to three quarters of new (C. diff) infections are not easily explained by conventional assumptions of ward-based transmission from symptomatic patients and so may not be targeted by current interventions. 'A better understanding of other routes of transmission and reservoirs is needed to determine what other types of control interventions are required to reduce the spread of C. difficile.' Even the cases linked to ward contact represented a 'major hospital-acquired infection problem' said the scientists. But the roughly 75 per cent of unexplained transmissions 'raised concern about other acquisition routes' not captured by the study. Superbug: An electron micrograph shows Clostridium difficile (long cell in blue) surrounded by purified Clostridium difficile . Other ways C. diff might be able to spread included transmission by non-symptomatic carriers, including patients' relatives and staff, or through food or animals. C. diff rarely causes any problems in healthy people, but may trigger diarrhoea and fever in hospital patients taking antibiotics. Older people are most likely to be affected. Patients usually recover with treatment but in rare cases infection can be fatal. In 2007-08, a total of 55,498 C. diff cases were reported in England.Between 2008-09 there were 36,095 reported cases, a decrease of 35 per cent.",Scientists can't explain how 75 per cent of C.diff sufferers catch the bug .

When someone falls ill in a public place, the wishful cry of help would traditionally be 'Is there a doctor in the house?!' But when the co-pilot of a Boeing 747 was struck down with a severe migraine mid-air on Monday, the crew held out no hope there might be a 'pilot on the plane'. Fortunately, their prayers were answered as one of the passengers, who works for North American Airlines, got up to reveal he was fully qualified to fly a jumbo jet. Pr-airs answered: An off-duty pilot stepped in to help land a Lufthansa 747 being diverted to Dublin Airport after a co-pilot fell ill with a severe migraine (file picture) Calm and controlled: The officer had been travelling as a passenger on the 747 when he was called on to enter the cockpit and help the captain bring the plane down safely (file picture) With the co-pilot incapacitated, the heroic stranger stepped in to help the captain safely land the plane, with 264 passengers on board, as it was diverted to Dublin Airport. The licensed Boeing 767 captain with North American Airlines had been traveling as a passenger on the Lufthansa 747 flying from Newark to Frankfurt on November 19. Flight LH403 landed safely in Dublin at about 5.30am, Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) confirmed. The co-pilot was hospitalized and the flight continued after a six-hour delay to allow a replacement crew to fly in. The plane landed in Frankfurt at 4pm local time. Earlier reports suggested that the pilot is a German national but these have been unconfirmed today. A Lufthansa spokeswoman said the man who stepped in was fully licensed to operate and fly the 747. 'In such circumstances it's absolutely normal procedure for the pilot, the flight captain, to continue to operate the aircraft,' she said. Scare in the air: The jet was flying from Newark to Frankfurt when it had to divert to Dublin Airport (pictured) 'Also, where necessary, the cabin crew are fully trained and can be called upon to read checklists back to the pilot. 'The procedures are in place for such an eventuality. But the effort of the off-duty pilot were certainly appreciated.' The Irish Aviation Authority (IAA) has been notified of the incident and has received a briefing report. The Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) of Ireland's Department of Transport has been notified and is investigating. Experts from the AAIU attended the plane after it touched down in Dublin. 'Whenever you have any sort of medical issue on board, whether it's a doctor or appropriately qualified person, that's always appreciated.

Or even the narcissist? Oliver James, a psychologist and broadcaster, has identified these three types of dysfunctional personalities among professional workers. The first, quite often bosses, compete for domination and attention and have no worries about trampling over others. Top dog: Ricky Gervais as the delusional boss David Brent in the award-winning satire on the modern workplace, The Office . Gordon Gekko, Michael Douglas's iconic character from the film Wall Street, is just the sort of Machiavellian personality that thrives in a modern work environment . The second like nothing more than to plot and scheme while the third drone on endlessly about themselves. Alarmingly, he believes there is a . fourth dysfunctional type or ‘triadic  person’ who is a combination of . all three characteristics. Such staff, Mr James warns, have a dangerous, yet effective mix of self-centredness, deviousness, self-regard and a lack of empathy which can propel them to the top of the organisations. Among the examples he gives of these 'triadics' are Gordon Gecko, the fictional trader played by Michael Douglas in the film Wall Street, whose mantra is 'greed is good'. The television series Mafia boss Tony Soprano and Russian dictator Josef Stalin are also identified in this group. Other fictional managers such as David Brent, played by Ricky Gervais in The Office, would score highly on the scale, while Lord Mandelson, the former Labour minister, is described as having Machiavellian tendencies. Research has suggested that there has been an increase in the 'triadic' conditions over the past 30 years because there are no objective criteria for success or failure in workplaces. In his book, Office Politics, Mr James warns how people who do not suffer from the disorders can lose out in the world of work and damage their emotional health unless they learn how to survive among such personalities. Donald Sutherland (left), Colin Farrell (centre) and Jason Sudeikis (right) star in the Hollywood comedy about pathological managers, Horrible Bosses . There are more than eight million people who work in offices, as well as those based in schools, hospitals and particularly television studios could also be affected. Describing psychopathic tendencies, Machiavellian cunning and narcissistic selfishness a 'dark triad', James told The Sunday Telegraph: 'This dark triad of characteristics is very likely to be present in that person in your office who causes you so much trouble. 'Whether you work in the corporate sector, a small business or a public sector job, the system you are in is liable to reward ruthless, selfish manipulation. 'The likelihood of your daily working life being sacrificed by a person who is some mixture of psychopathic, Machiavellian and narcissistic is high. If you do not develop the skills to deal with them, they will eat you for breakfast.' Mr James researched various offices to study various traits. In his book, he cites an advertising and film executive whom he nicknames 'Rat', who introduced a female colleague to another man saying, 'The last time I saw Suzy she was stark naked' The author says that partners in one elite law firm were in many cases humourless, charmless and had social skills akin to someone with Asperger's syndrome, so unaware were they of the thoughts and feelings of others. He also discloses how an investment banker got his job by fooling the interview panel at a leading American institution into believing that he was an expert in a product he knew nothing about. He then conned his socially insecure boss into believing that he was from an 'old money' background by lying about 'decadent weekends at grand and historic country houses'. James reserves some of his most scathing views for the television industry in which he has himself worked for both BBC and independent broadcasters. He said: 'Television is jam-packed with untalented people who have managed to associated themselves with successful programmes and disassociate themselves from failures.'","Psychologist Oliver James reveals the darker side of office politics .

Fears of a BBC whitewash over the Jimmy Savile scandal grew last night amid claims ‘key criticisms’ have been ‘gutted’ for ‘legal reasons’ from a review of its handling of the affair. Corporation chiefs are planning to release thousands of pages of evidence given to former Sky News boss Nick Pollard – who oversaw an independent inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation into the late entertainer’s paedophile past was shelved. But last night a source claimed ‘heavy redactions’ have been made to critical comments about BBC bosses. They added that it no longer gave ‘an honest picture’. Savile scandal: Corporation chiefs are planning to release thousands of pages of evidence given to former Sky News boss Nick Pollard ¿ who oversaw an independent inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation into the late entertainer¿s paedophile past was shelved. Mr Pollard produced his report last December, based on texts, emails and oral testimony, which found there had been ‘chaos and confusion’ at the BBC over the controversy. At the time, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten had also promised to release full transcripts of the evidence. He said the Corporation would only remove information from the documents where it was legally compelled to. But BBC insiders have confirmed the ‘worst stuff’ affecting highly-paid corporation figures has been removed by lawyers. One, familiar with the contents of the 3,000 pages, which are expected to be published on Friday, said removed passages appeared to go ‘way beyond’ any ‘narrow definition of defamatory’. The BBC had claimed it would only remove lines from the report where it legally had to, notably where the comments defamed a member of staff. Earlier this week it emerged that Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman’s scathing criticism of his senior colleagues over their handling of the Savile crisis has been struck out. Comments by director of global news Peter Horrocks are also understood to have been cut. An insider close to the process said: . ‘There are heavy redactions of criticisms of management. Most of what . people are hoping to find in there has already gone.’ However, another senior BBC source said the disclosures would still be ‘pretty unedifying’ for the corporation. Comments by director of global news Peter Horrocks and presenter Jeremy Paxman have been struck out . Others have said there are real legal issues with the evidence, but confirmed the published documents will still be deeply embarrassing for the BBC. Tory MP Mark Pritchard said: ‘The BBC needs to disclose this information if it is to restore public trust and avoid accusations of a whitewash. ‘It should not make the same mistakes as it made some months in being reluctant to release relevant information.’ It is understood there has been a ‘battle’ between the BBC Trust and the BBC’s executive body over how much to remove. The BBC Trust is said to have wanted to put in as much as possible while the management arm has been more cautious. A . spokesman said: ‘The Trust will need to be satisfied that what is . published is in line with the expectations of transparency that have . previously been set out. A BBC Spokesman said: 'We made a promise to publish all the relevant material that helped Nick Pollard in the preparation of his report, and we will do so next week. 'Other than material that has to be redacted for a strict set of legal reasons, they will be published in full.  We expect the total amount redacted to be a very small part of the whole.' Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, suggested people felt it unfair that the banks' financial success had not been shared by the public . BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten has suggested that anger at the banks over the collapse of the economy has at times been ‘infused’ with ‘envious populism’. He suggested people felt it unfair that the banks’ financial success had not been shared by the public – who were then expected to bail them out when things went wrong. He added: ‘Often the outrage has been justified; but we have to beware allowing that anger to become infused from time to time with envious populism.’ The former governor of Hong Kong also claimed politicians get more blame than they deserve when things go wrong and suggested the expenses scandal was not ‘people on the fiddle’, rather a case of the rules ‘appearing to have been stretched further than appeared fair or seemly’. Giving the Geddes Lecture in Oxford yesterday Lord Patten, the university’s chancellor, covered a range of issues, in a speech called Trust and Free Speech. Speaking about the Savile scandal he admitted the ‘really difficult questions for the BBC today’ were raised by the ‘lapses in editorial judgement’ on Newsnight and its sluggish response to the crisis. He said it was right the BBC pursues the truth about itself ‘even when it is grisly’.","Corporation chiefs are planning to release thousands of pages of evidence given to the Pollard review into why a Newsnight investigation was shelved .

The second man to walk on the moon said Nasa should abandon a plan to bring an asteroid into lunar orbit and concentrate on the Red Planet, calling progress since his 1969 mission 'slow'. Speaking at a space conference in Washington DC, Aldrin said: 'If we were moving outward from there and an asteroid is a good stopping point, then fine. 'But now it's turned into a whole planetary defense exercise at the cost of our outward exploration.' The current plan would see a Nasa robotic mission 'capture' an asteroid and bring it back to the moon's orbit in the early 2020s. Then a team of astronauts would fly to the asteroid to take samples and run tests. Nasa's Curiosity Rover is currently exploring Mars, sending back pictures from the surface and collecting samples. Aldrin, who was the lunar module pilot on Apollo 11, called for Nasa to 'commit to permanence on Mars', reports US News. 'We'd become a two-planet species,' he said. 'In Mars, we've been given a wonderful set of moons [...] where we can send continuous numbers of people.'

Costly: Greater Manchester fire service managers' navy blue shirts have been replaced by white ones, pictured, to distinguish them from firefighters - at a cost of nearly £13,000 to the taxpayer . The fire brigade has splashed out £13,000 on white shirts for bosses - so they look different to blue-shirted firefighters. Some 475 managers at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service have had their traditional navy blue shirts replaced by white ones to help distinguish themselves from the firefighters. Bosses say the change will help the public recognise a senior officer but the move has been labelled a ‘vanity project’ by firefighters, while union leaders say it is an ‘unnecessary extravagance’. Crew managers, watch managers and borough commanders posted at stations and bosses at the brigade’s Swinton HQ will have to wear the new shirts to make them stand out from their colleagues. Their five blue collared shirts and five blue t-shirts, which are worn underneath, have been taken away and replaced with five white collared shirts and five white t-shirts at a cost of £12,668 to the taxpayer. Bosses . claim the cost of the total new white kit is from an existing budget . and actually comes in £1,300 cheaper than the blue equivalent. Assistant . Chief Fire Officer Paul Argyle said: 'Fire stations belong to the . community and are proving their value to Greater Manchester more than . ever by being a hub for many groups and activities. 'Since . stations became much more open and home to larger numbers of local . groups, we realised people need to be able to identify who is in charge - . and we want it to be just as easy to spot who is in charge when crews . are out working in the community, which is now how they spend the . majority of their shifts. So this helps that too. 'The . shirts have been brought in through a staged approach. The unused blue . shirts that are returned to stores will be reused and issued to . firefighters when they next need them. Distinguishing rank: The new management shirts are similar to this one already worn by County Fire Officer Steve McGurk, pictured left, compared to the traditional blue shirts, right . 'The . new white ones are more cost effective long term. Other North West fire . and rescue services have already adopted this uniform for managers.' But the move has been criticised by firefighters who believe the money could be better spent elsewhere. One officer, who didn't want to be named, said: 'It’s just a vanity project and a waste of money. Crew managers and watch managers still go out jobs and a white shirt is just going to be impractical. They get stuck in as much as anyone else. They’ll just end up in the bin.' Another added: 'It’s a ridiculous waste of taxpayers’ money that appears to come about on a whim. Senior firefighters can already be recognised because they wear white helmets. It doesn’t make sense.' Gary Keary, secretary of the Manchester Fire Brigades Union, said: 'At a time when firefighters positions are being lost, this looks like an unnecessary extravagance.' Last year fire service bosses warned that further cuts to funding could lead to the closure of fire stations and compulsory redundancies. The authority has lost 300 uniformed posts and 100 support roles since implementing budget cuts in 2011.

Martin Sibley, 48, was found dead at his home in Colchester, Essex, hours after being questioned by police investigating an alleged sex abuse scandal . A fireman was found hanged hours after being questioned by detectives over a sex abuse scandal. Martin Sibley, 48, whose body was discovered at his home, is believed to have killed himself. The father-of-two was one of up to 100 people being questioned as part of an investigation into Essex County Fire and Rescue Service. Police are examining claims that recruits were subjected to ‘wild initiation ceremonies’ in the 1970s and 1980s. Sources claim that in some cases young men were stripped naked and sexually assaulted using a feather duster. But Essex Police refused to say whether officers spoke to Mr Sibley – who joined the service in 1989 – as a potential suspect, victim or witness. Mr Sibley was found hanged on Monday at his £200,000 home in Colchester, Essex, shortly after detectives from the force’s serious crime unit visited it to interview him. The force recently launched a wide-ranging inquiry into ‘historical allegations of serious criminal offences’ in the Essex fire service. One source close to the fire service said: ‘In the Eighties, people were directed to strip naked and people went along the line playing with feather dusters. It didn’t happen everywhere, but it wasn’t rare either. They were initiations, but they were not right.’ During his 24 years in the fire service, Mr Sibley had served across Essex. In 2009, he was awarded a long service and good conduct medal. He travelled to China four years ago to raise money for a firemen’s charity after recovering from life-threatening injuries he suffered in a motorcycle accident. Alleged scandal: Police are investigating historical claims of sex abuse within Essex fire and Rescue Service, pictured, which date back to the 1970s and 1980s . The fireman lived alone after . splitting from his wife Lynn several years ago. She was too upset to . speak yesterday as she was consoled by their daughters Holly, 18, and . Millie, 15, who live with her. Mr Sibley’s death was originally . referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, but will now . be dealt with by Essex Police. A spokesman for the force said: . ‘Police are investigating the circumstances but his death is not being . treated as suspicious at this time. ‘The force had referred his death to . the Independent Police Complaints Commission, as the man had been spoken . to by police officers shortly before his death on Monday. ‘The IPCC have considered the matter and are satisfied for the force to investigate the circumstances locally.’ Questioned: It is not clear why Martin Sibley, pictured on a charity walk in China, was interviewed in connection with the investigation . Long service: Martin Sibley worked as a firefighter for 24 years and was situated at Colchester Fire Station, pictured, when he died . Mr Sibley’s neighbour Marianna Lague, . 47, said she had been left stunned by his sudden death. ‘There had been . nothing to suggest this was coming,’ she said. ‘Martin had been in good spirits . whenever I saw him recently. He was a really nice chap. He was the kind . of person that if you needed help he would be there for you.’ Alan Chin-Shaw, of the Essex Fire . Brigade Union, said: ‘Essex firefighters have been left shocked and . saddened by the death of a long-serving and widely-respected colleague.’ Allegations of violent and bullying initiation ceremonies dogged fire services across the country in the 1970s and 1980s.

Many people who are reluctant to head to the gym joke they are allergic to exercise, but for one mother this is actually true. Kasia Beaver, 33, can't work up a sweat as an increased heart rate could spark a potentially fatal reaction. The mother-of-four is just one of a handful of people in the UK who suffer from the condition, known as Exercise-Induced Angioedema (EIA). Kasia Beaver's face swells during an allergy attack, which is usually brought on by exercise . Running for a bus or chasing after her kids after she's eaten certain foods causes her face to swell and could kill her if she went into  anaphylactic shock. Mrs Beaver, from Redditch, Worcestershire, said: 'When I get an attack, my eyes swell up and start to itch. Within five minutes, they're completely closed. It's terrifying, especially if I'm alone with the children. 'I was ice skating with my husband when I had a really bad attack. I had to use an epiPen to bring the swelling down. 'People don't believe me when I tell them I'm allergic to exercise. They think it's just an excuse to be lazy. But the truth is, I used to go the gym all the time. I was really sporty. I was a size ten.' Kasia suffered her first attack when she was in her early 20s before she fell pregnant with her first child, Jay, now 12. At first, she assumed it was an allergic to reaction to some eye shadow she'd bought off the market. Mrs Beaver used to be a size 10 (pictured aged 19, left) before her condition made it impossible to exercise . Mrs Beaver can finally enjoy walking to her local park with her children without the fear of an attack, after being put on a new medication . Mrs Beaver, who is also mother to Grace, eight, Madison, seven and three-year-old Millie, immediately stopped using the make-up but it took another three days for the swelling to go down. She said: 'One day I went to the gym with my mum. I just did a normal work-out then my eyes started feeling tight. 'Mum said they looked funny. She was really worried so she took me to A&E. They put a cold compress on my eyes and prescribed me antihistamines. 'It helped but it kept happening. I'd planned to walk everywhere to help lose my baby weight but I'd walk a few hundred yards and swell up. 'It took me years to realise that exercise was the trigger.' Doctors had also been baffled by Kasia's strange allergic reactions and tried her on a range of antishistamines. But over the year her reactions became more severe. Kasia: 'I was on the bus with my children when it suddenly swerved. The driver slammed on his brakes and the buggy tipped up. 'My eyes instantly swelled up. I had all four children with me and I didn't know what to do. The girls were crying. I couldn't see and Jay had to take us to my sister's house. 'Every time my heart rate goes up I have an attack. My sex life was null and void.' Mrs Beaver can't risk going on the cross-trainer as raising her heart rate can trigger a dangerous reaction . When an eye specialist couldn't find anything wrong with her eyes, she was a referred to a dermatologist but he also drew a blank. Mrs Beaver and her husband Mark, 35, a civil engineer, then travelled to Norwich to see an expert. She was finally diagnosed with Exercise-Induced Angioedema (EIA), which can be brought on by exercising after eating certain foods, as well as an underactive thyroid that is linked to the condition. Kasia with her husband Mark and four children. She has joined a slimming group to try and lose extra weight through her diet . She said: 'It was a relief in a way because I could put a name to it. I wasn't going mad. I'd been tested for all sorts over the years. I thought it could be hay fever, a blocked tear duct or sweat gland. 'He gave me different medications. He told me because the condition is so rare it was exploratory. None of them worked though.' Finally, thanks to a new type of antihistamine Mrs Beaver can walk to the park for the first time in ten years without having an attack. She said: 'I still can't exercise though and that does get me down. I joined a slimming group because I want to lose weight but it can only do so much. 'They think it's food related but they don't know what food it is. They've tested me for all sorts. If I knew what food it was I would stop eating it. 'I've been prescribed an epiPen in case an attack turns into an anaphylactic shock but luckily it hasn't yet. I know the signs now and stop what I'm doing because I can't risk it.' Maureen Jenkins, from Allergy UK said: 'Some people can suffer allergic symptoms such as urticaria (raised weals), rhinitis (blocked and runny nose), wheezing or gastric symptoms when they exercise. 'When it only occurs sometimes on exercise, it may be linked to eating a certain food beforehand, even though the food can be safely eaten when not followed by exercise.

'Dangerous': Ybrah Haylemaryam, who entered the country illegally from Eritrea in 2003, has been jailed for 20 years for two rapes . An asylum seeker who escaped justice after he imprisoned and raped a 20-year-old student in his flat went on to commit another brutal sex attack eight years later. Ybrah Haylemaryam, 26, who entered the country illegally from Eritrea in 2003, grabbed his first victim as she was walking home from a night out and forced her back to his home in Hull. The desperate young woman eventually managed flee after he went to the bathroom. But although the victim reported the rape in 2004, and Haylemaryam was interviewed, prosecutors said there was not enough evidence for him to be charged with the offence. Eight years later he carried out another attack on a young mother who had been on a date with him after she spurned his advances. Her baby was in the next room during the horrific three-hour ordeal. The crime led to Haylemaryam's previous case being reopened and he was charged with four counts of rape, two counts of false imprisonment and three sexual assaults on the two victims. Today, he was found guilty by a jury and jailed for 20 years at Hull Crown Court. But police believe more women may have suffered at the hands of Haylemaryam in the intervening years and appealed for any potential victims to come forward. His first victim, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, said today: 'Although I’m really happy with the sentence, I’m angry that this has happened to someone else and he has been allowed to do that. 'I was upset at the time that it wasn’t taken any further but I could understand the reasons because it was my word against his.' Now 29 and working in social care, the victim expressed her shock when she discovered during the trial that Haylemaryam was living near to her at the time of the attack. She said: 'I can’t believe he lived just a few streets away from me, that really shocked me. 'I don’t know what I’d have done if I had seen him in the street in the years after my case. I would have probably froze in my steps. 'He pestered me and all of a sudden just flipped, and the other victim described to me exactly the same what he did to me to her. I thought he was going to kill me. 'I feel lucky that I did get out, and I have got to thank the specialist support and counselling I have had from everyone. 'I hope I get a bit of closure now, but it’s the fear of someone doing that to you again that never goes away. Justice: Asylum seeker Ybrah Haylemaryam was jailed for 20 years at Hull Crown Court today . 'If he was deported, then I won’t have to worry about him ever again. I’m hoping to now move on with my life, knowing he is behind bars.' Judge Mark Bury called Haylemaryam a ‘dangerous offender’. 'You have been convicted by a jury of two sex attacks on two different women, eight years apart,' Judge Bury said. 'You pose a significant risk to members of the public, and you are a dangerous offender. '(In the case of the first victim) you took full advantage of a vulnerable victim and you were a stranger to her. 'Once inside your flat, you were aggressive to her and raped her. She was terrified, and thankfully managed to run away. 'She was very distressed in the witness box after being shown photos of the flat where the rape took place, and the memories came flooding back to her. 'The second victim’s ordeal lasted three hours, and you forced her against her will.' Judge Bury said it is unlikely that Haylemaryam will be returned to his home country of Eritrea upon his release, and could possibly be deported to South Africa. Paul Genney, defending, said that Haylemaryam was on his way to coming to terms with both rapes, which he initially denied at trial. Detective Inspector Alan Bentham said: 'Officers from Humberside Police’s public protection unit are appealing to any further women who may have been subjected to attacks from Ybrah Haylemaryam to contact them. 'Haylemaryam has been convicted of numerous rapes and sexual assaults against two women. 'We praise the victims in this case for having the courage to come forward, having been put through horrendous ordeals by Haylemaryam, who falsely imprisoned them and subjected them to violent, sexual attacks.'","Ybrah Haylemaryam, 26, grabbed student off the street and raped her in his flat in 2004 .

As a mother-of-five and wealthy entrepreneur, she knows only too well how much effort it takes to juggle demanding personal and professional roles. But Anya Hindmarch has launched a stinging attack on maternity laws – which she believes hinder rather than help women in the workplace. ‘There is a brown envelope  flashing above every woman’s  head in terms of tribunal threat,’ she declared. The ‘tricky and suffocating’ regulations could force firms to employ men rather than women, Mrs Hindmarch, 45, told MPs. The luxury handbag and accessories company which bears her name counts celebrities such as the Duchess of Cambridge as fans. Mrs Hindmarch, whose warning of the ‘brown envelope’ refers to the money which can be made from employment tribunals, has also been made one of the Government’s trade ambassadors. The laws stop bosses from insisting a pregnant employee reveal her plans for maternity leave, such as if and when she will return to work. They can ask but she is not required to answer and her company must not do anything which could be seen as pressurising her. Mrs Hindmarch made her  comments when she appeared before the Commons Business Innovation and Skills Committee. Asked by Labour MP Julie Elliott why she could not have these  types of conversation, she replied: ‘I find myself treading on eggshells and becoming hugely legal. It just feels really wrong. Maternity rules have changed dramatically in the last decade, allowing women to take up to a year¿s leave, with nine months paid, and request flexible working . ‘It would be great if you were able to have a sensible chat.

It would work much better for women if they were asked to commit to how long they will take off.’ Even if a female employee planned to take only two months off, her firm has to hire a replacement for a year to cover the maternity leave. ‘You cannot hire someone for two months and keep rehiring,’ said Mrs Hindmarch. Of her mostly female team of 50, a total of 13 had babies in 2011. But she added: ‘I think it [regulation] could end up working against women, unfortunately. ‘As a woman, a mother-of-five and an employer of a lot of women with children, it would end up making you make a choice between employing a man or a woman. ‘You probably might pick the easier route because the  regulation and consequential cost and eggshell treading would just be too onerous.’ She added: ‘I cannot say strongly enough that any more regulation will cripple this country. We are so over-regulated.’ Maternity rules have changed dramatically in the last decade, allowing women to take up to a year’s leave, with nine months paid, and request flexible working. The committee’s report into women in the workplace was published yesterday. It called on the Government to highlight companies which encourage flexible working to ‘dispel the myth’ that this is ‘problematic and cannot work’. Large firms should also publish  pay audits to highlight where large gender pay gaps exist, it added. A Department for Business spokesman said a new system of shared parental leave was replacing ‘old-fashioned and rigid’ rules. This allows working couples to choose how they share childcare in the first year after birth, he said.","Mrs Hindmarch's warning of the 'brown envelope' refers to the money which can be made from employment tribunals .

According to a report, chemists and pharmaceutical companies are rigging the price of so-called 'specials' drugs to overcharge the NHS . Drug companies and pharmacies have been accused of striking up underhand deals to overcharge the NHS millions of pounds. Pharmaceutical companies may have inflated the price of more than 20,000 drugs that are not covered by NHS price regulations. Following an undercover investigation by its reporters, the Daily Telegraph claims that the prices of the so-called 'specials' drugs - those prescribed when a patient has needs that cannot be met by normal licensed medicine - have been rigged with chemists offered backhanders to sell them. The newspaper secretly recorded representatives from several drugs manufacturers offering reporters posing as pharmacists deals on 'specials' that would see both their firms and chemists pocket additional NHS cash. The investigation found that some of the firms offered to provide invoices for some of its drugs at double the cost price. Chemists would then pass that invoice onto the NHS which would pay the inflated bill. Other companies are alleged to have offered to supply generic drugs free of charge in return for the right to supply the chain with special drugs. Another firm offered to pay an annual fee to chemists who sold their drugs. The Telegraph said that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation following its report. Scandal? The report alleges that companies are marking up the price of more than 20,000 drugs . He told the Telegraph the allegations were 'deeply concerning'. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt has said that an investigation will be launched . 'We have always been clear that NHS money should always be spent wisely for the benefit of patients. 'Any specific information received indicating or alleging fraud will be investigated by NHS Protect.' Jim Gee, a former chief executive of the NHS counter-fraud service, said: 'Behaviour of this type diverts funds from where they are intended and undermines the provision of quality patient care. 'The victims are the British people and the Government need to ensure that the NHS is better protected in future.' The drugs companies said they were looking into the claims allegedly made by their representatives, while it was reported that one firm had suspended a member of staff. A spokeswoman for Pharmarama International Limited, based in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, said it would not comment while an internal investigation was being conducted. Quantum Pharmaceutical said it was investigating the allegations and had suspended a member of staff. The spokesman added: 'We have clear and strict internal policies regarding the trading agreements that we operate with our customers, which are entirely legitimate, lawful and ethical. 'We remain fully commitment to providing a quality, value for money service to our customers and will be giving our full co-operation to the Department of Health and other regulators in the event of any subsequent industry-wide response relating to the report’s findings.' Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for drugs firm Temag told the Telegraph: 'It would be totally unrepresentative to make any suggestion that we are involved in any sort of practice to unfairly charge the NHS.'","Companies are allegedly inflating the price of more than 20,000 drugs .

Children as young as 10 are at risk of skin cancer by using sunbeds, a worrying report has found. A survey of salon operators in Missouri shows that 65 per cent would allow youngsters aged 10 to 12-years-old to use tanning beds. This is despite strong evidence that sunbed use can increase the risk of the most deadly form of skin cancer - melanoma - by 75 per cent. Children are at greater risk of doing long-term damage than adults as they have thinner, more delicate skin. Children are at greater risk from sunbeds as they have thinner, more delicate skin than adults . Sunbed use is banned among under-18s in the UK as a result, although recent research revealed teenagers are regularly flouting it. California is the only U.S state with a similar law. Meanwhile, Missouri is one of 17 states that has no minimum age restrictions on sunbed use and does not require parental consent. Co-author Lynn Cornelius, of Washington University School of Medicine, said: 'With the absence of logical age restrictions, we are failing to protect our children, who are at an increased risk of developing skin cancer when exposed to the high-intensity levels of ultraviolet light that can be received in a tanning bed.' Sunbed users are up to 2.5 times more likely to develop more common non-melanoma skin cancers, such as basal cell and squamous cell cancers. The World Health Organization has stated . that people younger than 18 should not use tanning beds, a . recommendation based on several scientific studies. Dr Cornelius says she and her colleagues at the Siteman Cancer Center  routinely see young, female, melanoma patients who report previous tanning bed use. 'Indoor tanning may seem innocuous at first,' she says. 'Due to what is called 'tumor lag time,' or the time between an exposure to a carcinogen such as ultraviolet and the development of a cancer, it may take a decade or longer for someone who has been exposed to artificial ultraviolet radiation from tanning beds to develop a skin cancer.' Melanoma on the skin: Around 62,000 people in the U.S are diagnosed with this most dangerous form each year . For the study, published online in the journal Pediatrics, researchers identified 831 indoor tanning facilities across Missouri and randomly selected and called 375 of them, posing as prospective clients. For consistency, the researchers made attempts to survey each salon twice. Operators of 65 per cent of the participating facilities said they would allow children as young as 10 or 12 to use indoor-tanning devices. Employees at 43 per cent claimed there were no risks associated with sunbed, and 80 per cent of facility operators said indoor tanning would prevent future sunburn. Both claims are false, the study notes. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has deemed ultraviolet rays from the sun and artificial tanning devices as carcinogenic to humans, equivalent to tobacco. 'Minimizing exposure to ultraviolet rays, no matter the source, lowers one's risk of skin cancer,' says Dr Graham Colditz, a cancer prevention expert at Washington University and the Siteman Cancer Center who wasn't involved in the study. 'The problem with indoor tanning is that users start very young and, unlike the sun, tanning beds are a completely avoidable cancer risk.' He added they should protect themselves from sun exposure using hats, long-sleeve shirts and suncream.","Survey revealed two thirds of salon operators in U.S state would allow kids as young as 10 to use sunbeds .

'Death wish': Paul Gascoigne, pictured during an event in Northampton on January 31, was rushed to intensive care when he arrived in America for rehabilitation . Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been rushed to intensive care, just before he was due to start treatment for alcohol addiction. The 45-year-old was too unwell to receive medical care at the American rehab centre he was booked into, raising fears for his life. Gascoigne was seriously ill last night, but was said to be out of immediate danger - and a former team-mate said he was 'recovering'. Gary Lineker had said that his friend is 'struggling'. The Match of the Day presenter wrote on Twitter last night: 'Gazza is struggling, Let's hope he can hang on in there.' Another former team-mate, one-time Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt told Sky Sports News today: 'Unfortunately over the last few weeks Paul has had a relapse, which culminated finally, last Monday, in Paul asking for help. 'By Monday afternoon he was on a plane out to Arizona to a clinic specialising in dealing with Paul's specific problems. 'The first thing he underwent was a detox, unfortunately Paul had a very bad reaction to the detox and the clinic decided that as a precaution it was best to transfer him to hospital. 'He was transferred to hospital in intensive care where they could monitor him 24-7. But I spoke to Paul's medical team in the UK this morning, they had spoken to Paul and he's recovering and hopefully soon he will be back into the clinic to continue his rehab. 'Over the years he has had a lot of support from the football family, but of course it could be a long road to recovery. Now Paul's asked for the help we can focus on getting through this.' Unwell: Gascoigne in Bournemouth shortly before a group of friends paid for him to receive treatment for his alcoholism at a clinic in Tucson, Arizona . The star flew to the U.S. last week where he was due to be treated at a rehabilitation clinic in . Tucson, Arizona. Instead, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he has . spent the past four days. According . to sources, his condition has stabilised, although it is not clear when . he will be well enough to attend his rehab course. A . group of celebrity friends – including Chris Evans, Gary Lineker and . Piers Morgan – had paid for Gascoigne to attend the clinic, which costs . about £30,000 for an eight-week stay. Since . then a number of England players, among them Wayne Rooney, have stepped . forward with offers of funds. Comedian James Corden has also donated . money. Gascoigne . ‘willingly’ flew to the States for help days after a video emerged of . him sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans. Concern: Gary Lineker, who has helped fund Gascoigne's treatment in the US, last said that his former teammate was 'struggling' But when he landed in Arizona he was pictured drinking a pint  at the airport bar, before a friend took it off him. The Cottonwood Clinic, which boasts a team of ‘highly trained clinicians’, has ‘been effective for him previously’, his management company said. Gascoigne has previously received help at . The Providence Projects rehabilitation centre in Dorset, whose . treatment director Paul Spanjar was instrumental  in sending him to the . US. Mr Spanjar called at the former footballer’s home last week after the video became public – and found him ‘in terrible shape’ at 9.30am. He said: ‘He was certainly under the influence. Physically he had really deteriorated.’ He added that Gascoigne had fallen off the wagon over the past six weeks, saying: ‘At times myself or a colleague would go round to check that he was still alive. It seemed as though he had a death wish.’ Gascoigne made 57 appearances for  his country. England manager Roy Hodgson said his captain, Steven Gerrard, has gone to the FA and ‘told them the players would like to contribute’. He added: ‘Many of them looked up to him as the star player of the day, and I can only back that up.’ In his Mail on Sunday Live magazine column today, Chris Evans writes: ‘When I saw the pictures of my old pal last week at a so-called personal appearance, even I was shocked. ‘I say even I, because I’ve seen him bad before; much worse than you might imagine. 'Paul has been on the edge for well over a decade now, although admittedly never closer than of late.’ Gifted: The former Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio and Newcastle United star is widely regarded as one of the most talented English footballers .","The 45-year-old footballer spent four days in hospital after arriving in US .

Researchers claim that a brutal slave-trader who brought captive slaves from West Africa to Colonial America is the same man whose descendants produced two U.S. presidents. George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. Historians already knew that the Bush family was directly connected to Thomas Walker, yet they were unable to figure out which was the ancestor of the Bush's. Records show there was a Thomas Walker who was a merchant from Baltimore who was in Great Britain in 1758. Looking back: Researchers claim that a notoriously vicious slave-trader who brought captive slaves from West Africa to Colonial America is the same man whose descendants produced two U.S. presidents . History of slavery: You have to go back six generations to find the ancestor that is directly linked to the present day George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush . Keeping it in the family: Over the course of 200 years it is clear to see how the former Presidents are related to their slavemaster ancestor . Archives also show Thomas Walker was a slave merchant and captain who bought and sold West African slaves in the late 1700s. However, it was only recently that a retired genealogist and a historian in Sierra Leone finally figured out the two Thomas Walkers are actually the same person. Two men helped to clear up the murky past of the Bush's. Roger Hughes, a retired newspaper editor and genealogist in Illinois has previously documented other Bush ancestors as slave owners in the United States and Joseph Opala, an American historian who has spent much of his adult life in Sierra Leone, the former British colony on the West African coast. Missing link: The ancestral link between the Bush family and the slave trade is confirmed . History: Although Britain outlawed slavery in 1833 and it was abolished in the USA after the defeat of the Confederacy in the Civil War in 1865, the transatlantic trade in African slaves continued . Supporter of African: On his 2003 visit to Goree Island, a former slave fort off the coast of the Senegal, George W. Bush denounced the slave trade as one of 'the greatest crimes of history.' Analysis of old records and signatures now provides confirmation. Walker married in 1785 at Bristol, which along with London and Liverpool was one of the three British cities highly involved in the Atlantic slave trade. He later emigrated to the United States. Scans of the two Walkers' signatures were sent experts at Yale and at UCL in London without any information on their significance. Both experts confirmed that the signatures were written by the same person. Thomas Walker married Catherine McLelland had three children, Rosetta, Thomas, and George, born between 1785 and 1797. Thomas Walker's third son was named George, and his grandson who born in 1875, was the first George Herbert Walker and it is his descendants that lead to the presidency. George's daughter, Dorothy, married Prescott Bush, and their son and grandson became the Presidents 41 and 43 of the USA. Members of the family had been previously known to own slaves, but so did 12 other presidents, including eight who were still in office. Walker and his family died year before slavery was outlawed and so his profession wouldn't have seemed out of place at the time. Imports: Thomas Walker, a slave merchant and captain who bought and sold African slaves in the late 1700s, before the Atlantic slave trade was outlawed . Many European merchants and American plantation owners grew rich on the trade that transported more than 10 million Africans to North America. It seems Walker was almost as cruel to his fellow sailors as the slaves he bought and sold. An account of his death says, 'There could not possibly have been a more inhuman monster than this Walker. Many a poor seaman has been brought by him to an untimely end.' It might explain why his own crew members held a mutiny shooting him dead and throwing him overboard during a voyage 1797. In the present day, on his 2003 visit to Goree Island, a former slave fort off the coast of the Senegalese capital, Dakar, George W. Bush denounced the slave trade as one of 'the greatest crimes of history.' 'Small men took on the powers and airs of tyrants and masters,' he said. 'Some have said we should not judge their failures by the standards of a later time. Yet, in every time, there were men and women who clearly saw this sin and called it by name.' The Bush family's spokesman in Houston, Jim McGrath, had no comment on the findings and The George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas as also not commented on the findings.","Ancestral link between Bush family and slave trade confirmed .

Emma Murphy, from Whitefield in Greater Manchester, is now calling for a public inquiry into the treatment and wants to raise awareness of the dangers to young women. Epilim is one of the registered trade names for sodium valporate, an anti-epilepsy drug also prescribed to people suffering from bipolar disorders and depression - but there is a risk of birth defects if taken by pregnant women. Campaigner: Emma Murphy with Lauren (8), Kian (3), Chloe (9), Erin (5) and Luke (7). She says all her children have experienced problems as a result of her taking Epilim . Mrs Murphy, 32, who was diagnosed with epilepsy when she was 12, has five children aged three to nine with her husband Joseph, 40. Their children - Chloe, nine, Lauren, eight, Luke, seven, Erin, five and Kian, three - all have physical and development problems including autism, deafness, cerebral palsy and incontinence. Mrs Murphy said: 'It is incredibly difficult as my children each have individual needs . and dealing with children on the autistic spectrum is particularly . challenging. My husband and I have a good routine and we're managing but . it has put a lot of pressure on us as a couple.' But she added: 'I want to know why I was never told of the risks when I was pregnant. 'Throughout my pregnancies, I was . never warned of the possible side-effects. Questions were asked about . how I was getting on with my epilepsy, but at no point throughout . consultations was I advised about the possible side-effects of taking . Epilim on the babies growing in my womb. 'I was told to continue taking . it. GPs, midwives and consultants all advised me to do so. I had . complete trust in the medical profession.' Mrs Murphy said she began to have doubts after all her children developed health problems. Mrs Murphy said doctors did not tell her about the risks of taking Epilim during her pregnancies . She said: 'Comments were always . made about their features - their eyes and noses... what I know now as . facial dysmorphic features - a symptom of FACS (Fetal Anti Convulsant . Syndrome). 'Developmentally, they were always late in reaching . milestones, particularly when it came to speech. 'During this time I was . diagnosed with depression and whenever I brought up the fact something . didn't seem right, it was a case of 'Emma you have depression, there's . nothing wrong'. 'I was made to feel I was a neurotic mum imagining . things. When I raised my concerns, I was given the brush-off.' She went on: 'When I . discovered the link with Epilim and birth defects, I actually felt . relief - I wasn't going mad after all. 'Relief mixed with sadness and . devastation that had I not taken the drug the outcome could have been so . different.' Epilim is one of the most effective drugs to control epileptic seizures. However, researchers at Liverpool University published a study this month which found that children exposed to Epilim in the womb were six times more likely to develop neurodevelopmental disorders. The researchers concluded that one in . three of the children born to mothers taking Epilim has learning . difficulties, low IQ and types of autism. ‘It is a huge medical dilemma,’ said Professor Gus Baker, an eminent neuropsychologist who conducted the research. A spokeswoman for Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Epilim, said: 'For some women of child-bearing potential, valporate may be the only effective seizure-control medication. 'However, a decision to use valporate in such women should only be taken after a very careful evaluation between the patient and her treating physician if the benefits of its use outweigh the risks to the unborn child. 'Because of the well-known risk of birth defects, valporate has not been recommended as a first-choice agent for women with epilepsy who are of child-bearing potential. As recommended by the manufacturer, women of child-bearing potential should be informed of the risks and benefits of the use of valporate during pregnancy. 'It is important to stress that stopping any anti-epileptic medication suddenly can lead to a recurrence of seizures which may be fatal.' Heartache: Karen Buck and daughter Bridget. 'I am losing my little girl. It could happen any day and every moment is precious,' said Karen . However, Mrs Murphy said that awareness in the medical profession about the side-effects of Epilim is still worryingly . absent. 'Most clinicians don't seem to know about FACS syndrome and to . this day women are unaware of the potential side-effects Epilim could . have on their babies. We urge the government to hold a public inquiry . into this matter.' Mrs Murphy founded the Independent Fetal Anti-Convulsant Trust (FACT), to raise awareness of the condition. Campaigners estimate that 48,000 children have been born to mothers in the . UK who have taken the drug since it was introduced in 1973. Of these 40 per cent - . a massive 19,200 - have developed physical or mental problems. Karen Buck's 14-year-old daughter Bridget suffers from both. Yesterday, Sue Reid reported in the Daily Mail that Bridget is expected to die in a matter of weeks and her family have signed an instruction that she must not be resuscitated. She has not been able to swallow solid food for months and can only be fed from a baby’s bottle. Her brain is so damaged she has the comprehension of a toddler and has never uttered a word. Her twisted legs are shrunken and her back is bent. She sometimes stops breathing for a minute at a time. In March 1998 Karen took Epilim to combat her epileptic fits during the pregnancy. Her daughter has needed 24-hour care every day since. Researchers found that one in three of the children born to mothers taking Epilim has learning difficulties, low IQ and types of autism . Earlier this month, the Daily Mail printed Carol Sarler’s heartbreaking account of her battle to get help for her three-year-old granddaughter Milly, born brain-damaged after Carol’s daughter took Epilim when pregnant. The cases have huge social implications, says Dr Peter Turnpenny, a consultant geneticist at the Royal Exeter and Devon Hospital who has advised mothers with children damaged by Epilim. ‘It is really tough on the families who devote their whole lives to these children, some of whom never really grow up. 'The parents are worried what will happen when they, themselves, die. ‘It is a big financial burden for the country to care for them, and we know that hundreds more babies with the same neurodevelopment problems are being born each year.’ Six years ago, the law firm Irwin Mitchell began a claim for compensation against Sanofi Aventis, the drug’s manufacturer, on behalf of 100 children whose mothers say suffered birth defects because the drug was taken during pregnancy. The case was publicly funded by legal aid through the Legal Services Commission (LSC). But in November 2010, six weeks before the trial was due to start, the LSC withdrew funding. ‘The LSC can only spend taxpayers’ money where we believe there is a reasonable prospect of success,’ it said. At the time, Sanofi Aventis expressed sympathy with the families but insisted it always issued appropriate warnings in its literature on Epilim ‘in line with developing scientific knowledge’. Under the deal struck when the court case failed, the families promised not to sue Sanofi Aventis in the future, if their £3.5 million legal costs for preparing the trial were paid for by the pharmaceutical company. Today Karen Buck is still angry about the outcome. ‘I took Bridget, in her wheelchair, to court so the drug company lawyers could see her,' she said. 'They wouldn’t even look us in the eye, and is it any wonder?’","Emma Murphy, 32, has taken the anti-seizure drug Epilim since she was 12 .

An undercover police officer who infiltrated a drug gang told a court how he was forced to jump for his life from a first floor window after a secret camera fell out his clothes. The officer, who was posing as an addict, was locked in a room and savagely beaten after his cover was blown, it is claimed. In an alleged scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, the officer, identified only as Officer Deano, claims he was exposed when a secret camera fell out of his shirt. Long way down: An undercover policeman jumped from the window of this flat in Basildon, Essex, when his cover was blown after a secret camera fell out of his shirt . Dramatic: In a scene reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's 1992 film Reservoir Dogs, the officer's cover was blown when he was interrogated by the gang and a secret camera was exposed . He said when the gang leader left the room to get a knife, he managed to force open a window and leap to safety. A trial at Basildon Crown Court, Essex, heard the officer had been buying cocaine and heroin from the gang known as The Bush Boys with a colleague between July and November last year. His cover was blown after gang members became suspicious and interrogated him at a flat in the town. Mohamed Hassan, 31, from Brockley, south London, Perry Bohm, 19, from Woolwich, and Thomas Symons, 19, from Woolwich, are all accused of being involved in the gang and of attacking the officer. Giving evidence from behind a screen to protect his identity, Officer Deano told the court the attack on November 26 last year was the most terrifying moment of his 12-year career. He said: 'I was terrified and in genuine fear for my safety and well-being. I'd been involved in numerous frightening situations, but nothing compared to the fear I felt at that moment. 'I was aware the front door was barricaded so the only exit I could reasonably consider was the window. Hideaway: The Bush Boys are alleged to have used this alleyway in Laindon as one of several spots to deal drugs . 'I went to the window and undid the handle and attempted to push the window open - to my horror it only opened two inches. 'I was desperate to get out of that situation and feared for my life so I took a couple of steps back and shoulder barged the window open. 'I climbed onto the window sill and jumped down about 12-feet onto the pavement. 'When I landed I felt a sharp pain jar up both of my shins - it was incredibly painful but by that stage I was almost in a state of blind panic. 'I sprinted as fast as I could away from that address to safety.' 'When I landed I felt a sharp pain jar up . both of my shins - it was incredibly painful but by that stage I was . almost in a state of blind panic.' Officer Deano . Officer Deano told the jury that he was rumbled when his recording equipment fell to the floor as gang members interrogated him, suspecting he might be an undercover police officer. During a struggle between the officer, the three men and the recording device fell to the floor. The officer said: 'The three lads just stopped and stared at it - it seemed like time just stood still. 'After that brief moment of stillness, one shouted: ""It's a camera... He struck me in the face and stamped on the device"".' Martyn Levett, prosecuting, said: 'They grabbed Deano's arms. Hassan punched him hard in the face, which seemed to be an indication for the other two to pile in on him. Big drop: The window that the officer chose to jump out of was around 12ft above the pavement . 'The boys landed punches on his shoulder, neck and back of the head.' The court heard that Hassan - who has been referred to as a 'controlling force' within the gang - then left the room before calling for a 'shank' - street slang for a knife. Mr Levett continued: 'These shouts for a knife were enough for Officer Deano to decide it was time he made the dramatic decision to jump out of the window and run for his life. 'Mercifully his injuries were not as serious as may have been.' The three suspects are charged with conspiracy to supply Class A drugs (namely crack cocaine and heroin), robbery of covert equipment to the value of £4,500, attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent and attempting to cause actual bodily harm. It is claimed the men bragged about their wealth by posing for pictures with wads of £1,000 in cash and spent thousands on designer clothes, accessories and holidays. When police raided the home of Aisha Aden, 24, who was believed to be Hassan's girlfriend, they found 102 receipts for Louis Vuitton and Chanel accessories paid for with cash. The court heard that the men dealt drugs from a playground, a hotel, alleyways, subways and the homes of drug addicts. The trial continues.

Tragic: Private Steven Murray, 23, died after hitting his head while larking around with a friend during training at Halton Camp near Lancaster . A soldier died after he smashed his head on a concrete floor during a drunken play-fight with a comrade at an army training camp where heavy drinking was encouraged, an inquest heard yesterday. Private Steven Murray, 23, who had been drinking vodka sneaked into the barracks, suffered a fractured skull after he was grabbed by the legs and pulled to the ground whilst wrestling with best friend James Cox, 24, in front of fellow squaddies. Despite complaining of a sore head, feeling sick and showing a cricket-ball sized swelling to his temple, Pte Murray was allowed to go bed by senior officers after insisting he wanted to sleep it off. The alarm was raised at 5.30am the following morning when colleagues failed to wake him up, noticed he was not breathing and called for an ambulance to the Halton Camp near Lancaster. Pte Murray, from East Kilbride, near Glasgow, was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead just 80 minutes later with a bleed to the brain. Blood tests showed he was almost three times the legal driving limit. The inquest heard that drinking large quantities of alcohol was 'an army way of life' among recruits, with breaches of rules allowed to go lightly punished. The tragedy occurred on June 3, 2010, after Pte Murray of the Royal Regiment of Scotland based at Catterick Garrison Camp in North Yorkshre, was 11 weeks into his training. He and fellow members of his platoon had arrived at the camp on May 31 to take part in adventure training in the Lake District including kayaking, caving and climbing. But tragedy struck after some of the soldiers - known as the 'Naughty Eight' - broke army rules and sneaked into an off licence to buy bottles of vodka whilst on their way to a kayaking exercise. A small bottle was said to have been passed round the squaddies before the exercise and the rest was hidden in army back packs and smuggled back to camp before being drunk after dinner. Cox also sneaked out of camp to get Strongbow, Stella and more vodka. At 8.30pm in a dormitory, Murray got Cox in a headlock only for Cox to grab Murray’s legs and throw him backwards causing both to tumble to the floor on top of each other. Witnesses: Private James Cox, left, was playing around with his best friend Pte Murray when the tragedy struck, eye-witness Pte Kevin Fletcher, right, told the inquest being held at Preston Coroners Court . The hearing was told there was a 'very loud bang' when Murray’s head hit the floor and he was momentarily knocked unconscious. By the time a corporal arrived he had come round and went to speak to the Platoon leader for 40 minutes. He returned complaining about a sore head and was sick but was said to have shrugged off the incident and wanted to be left in peace to sleep. Murray initially fell asleep on his top bunk, but as he was restless was moved to a mattress on the floor whilst colleagues took it in turns to watch him for the next few hours. Fatal: Pte Murray suffered a fractured skull after falling and hitting his head on a concrete floor at the Halton Training Barracks in Lancashire, his inquest heard . Cox who has since left the army after a tour of Afghanistan said: 'We were best mates all the way through training. He was a bit wild like me and he was always trying to make the lads laugh and cause a bit of mischief. 'When he was in camp he would drink anything that was there. I bought a half bottle of vodka but Murray couldn’t get served so one of the lads got him his. 'We couldn’t get a big bottle because it wouldn’t fit in our army gear. I put it straight down my boxers as we walked out. The instructors didn’t even know about it. Grief: The parents of Pte Steven Murray leave Preston Coroners Court where the inquest into the death of soldier son is taking place . 'The lads would have been on the booze as soon as they got back to the accommodation. We are the Naughty Eight who are always getting in to trouble.' He added: 'Me and Murray were always taking the p*** out of each other him calling me an English b****** and me calling him a Scottish b******. 'He got me in a headlock between his legs my head was lower than his knees. I bear hugged his legs and grabbed his a*** and we both fell backwards. 'That’s when I heard the bang from his head so I knew something wasn’t right. I didn’t lift him no higher than knee height. He came around. I can remember him saying ""I’m okay""’. He said, ""I have been hit around the head with with a bat before, I’m okay"". 'Way of life': The inquest into the death of Private Steven Murray's inquest heard, who died after a drunken play-fight at British Army Training Camp in Halton near Lancaster, pictured, head that the army encourage soldiers to drink . 'He said ""get out of my way I want to be on my own"". I let him go and lie down. He said he had always been in and out of fights all of his life. No one thought anything until he fell off the bed and he was a different colour. 'Looking back everyone can say we should have done this and that, but as a friend he was telling me to p*** off and that’s what I did.' Speaking of life in the army barracks in Catterick he said: 'Every single weekend we would get drunk, we trained all week and then get drunk. 'We knew if we got caught we would be punished, we got punished with fitness, that was a bonus for lads in the army. The army encourages us to drink it’s just the army way of life, they told us at the weekend to go out with the lads and get drunk.' Eye witness Pte Kevin Fletcher said: 'I recall Cox and Murray messing about - it was normal to have a laugh and a little play. They were were trying to touch each other’s faces - not intentionally to hurt, but just playing.' He said the pair adopted a boxing stance before grabbing each other around the upper body. Pte Fletcher added: 'It was like a bear hug type move, moving and twisting around. Cox tried to pick Murray up off his feet and lifted him about six inches off the floor. 'They were grappling with each other. I am not sure whether one person slipped or whether they both slipped together or tripped on each other’s foot. I just remember them both hitting their heads.' Concern: Private James Smith, pictured, giving evidence at Preston Coroners Court, said he was concerned about the injury but Private Steven Murray did not want to make a fuss . 'Later when Private Murray got back in bed he wanted to listen to his MP3 player. He had his headphones on, I personally asked him if he wanted a drink of water, but he said ‘no he was okay’ and said he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. He told us to leave him but we were worries about him and were checking. 'We were all concerned because he had a lump on his head, just above his temple. It was the size of a cricket ball split in two. It was a dark in colour, it looked like there was blood on the surface. I got the impression he was dazed, he didn’t know where he was when he first came around.' Fellow soldier Jake Challinor said: 'The lads were planning on having a drink when they got back and I became aware of people outside getting a bit boisterous, a bit loud as you would do when drinking.' 'It was just a little bit of push and shove, who’s the strongest type-thing. It was drunken boisterous antics - I just remember seeing Steven on the floor. It was some play fighting gone wrong. Cox has done this kind of thing before, I am pretty sure he didn’t meant to hurt Pte Murray.' Pt James Smith said: 'Steven didn’t want anyone to make a fuss. He was quite embarrassed at the time because Private Cox got the better of him. Half an hour after he said ""I’m going to get my head down now"". 'I didn’t think it was a good idea because when you have a head injury it isn’t best I know it’s not a good idea. He was brushing it off, not wanting help, telling the lads ‘I’ve had worse’.'

Pervert: Dr Michael Lok, pictured, was handed a three-year community order at Bristol Crown Court after admitting filming a boy and several men as they showered in a public changing rooms . A perverted doctor who filmed a boy and several men as they showered in a public changing room narrowly avoided jail today. Dr Michael Lok was caught with more than 20 images of naked male adults and a child which he took as they used a sports hall. He was arrested after a 15-year-old boy saw Lok taking pictures of him on his iPhone while he showered. The sickened teen told staff who informed police and Lok, 50, was quickly identified and admitted taking images of the boy. He also said he had snapped photos of several other men over the course of a month because he found them attractive. Lok, of Kingswood, Bristol, admitted one charge of making indecent images of a child and seven further charges of voyeurism. He . was handed a three-year community order, a 40-day sex offender . treatment programme, and was made to sign the sex offenders’ register . for five years. Lok was also . given a sexual offences prevention order banning him from possessing of . any camera equipment when in a public area where people could be . changing. Paul Ricketts, . prosecuting, told Bristol Crown Court: 'A 15-year-old boy went to the . changing rooms after having had a tennis lesson. 'Whilst . he was getting changed he noticed the defendant sitting there, fully . clothed. The boy noticed that, while looking into a mirror, he could see . the defendant was holding an iPhone. 'The defendant was taking pictures of the boy in the changing room. There was in effect no partition between that boy and the defendant, who was sat fully clothed.' Lok prowled changing areas at Bath University Sports Village in Bath for the month before he was caught, taking pictures of men as they showered. On the prowl: Dr Lok filmed a boy and several men as they showered in changing rooms at Bath University Sports Village, pictured. (File photo) Mr Ricketts added: 'He explained the reason he took the photographs was because he found those people attractive. 'He . said he had been taking photos for around a month and police found . there was a number of naked photographs of males in that same changing . room.' Judge Michael Roach . told Lok: 'You have let yourself and your profession very badly down by . what you have done. Spare a thought for the family of the young boy you . photographed. 'Think how . upsetting it would be for them to have their son photographed in that . way as you did on that date in December. It is thoroughly unacceptable.' Attraction: Lok used his iPhone to film the unsuspecting bathers - including a 15-year-old boy, at Bath University Sports Village, pictured, because he found them attractive, the court heard . 'The taking of photographs of other males in those changing rooms is equally reprehensible.

Surgery: Andrew Palismwe is responding well to treatment after undergoing a nine-hour operation to remove two legs at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital in Cape Town, South Africa . He was born with two extra limbs below his stomach on April 6. The condition is thought to be a result of a twin that does not fully develop. Windhoek Central Hospital neonatologist Dr Clarissa Pieper said: ‘This is a situation where identical twins are attached together as a result of a twin embryo that does not fully split, but forms two babies growing into each other. In this case, the other baby never fully developed.’ Andrew's mother Ruthy Mutanimiye said at the hospital that her son had ‘quickly responded to medication’ after a day in intensive care. She also spoke of her relief that her child received the operation that she could not afford.

Ester Paulus, a spokesman for Namibia's Ministry of Health and Social Services, said: ‘The fund was established to assist patients who do not have the means to undergo private treatment. 'We attend to every application with urgency, and currently, there are no pending application forms.’ She refused to disclose the cost of Andrew’s operation, saying: ‘No amount of money can be measured with saving a life.'","Andrew Palismwe is recovering at Windhoek Central Hospital in Namibia .

Comedian Stephen Colbert opened his TV show last night with a moving tribute to his mother, who died last week age 92. For three and a half minutes, Colbert pushed aside the conservative blow-hard he played on 'The Colbert Report' and spoke with deep sincerity about Lorna Tuck Colbert. 'If you watch this show, and you like this show, that’s because of everybody who works here and I’m lucky to be one of them,' an emotional Colbert said. 'But when you watch the show, if you also like me, that’s because of my mom.' Stephen Colbert struggled to maintain his composure on Wednesday night while paying tribute to his mother . Stephen Colbert, center, is seen here with his sister Elizabeth, left, who ran from Congress and mother Lorna, right . Colbert's voice cracked several times as he choked back tears to give the emotional tribute. On several occasions, he had to pause and look down at his desk to keep from openly weeping on camera. The 49-year-old television personality is the youngest of 11 children Lorna had with her husband James Colbert Jr., a medical school dean who taught at Yale University. She was the . matriarch of a family of 85 children, grandchildren and . great-grandchildren - most of them living in and around Charleston, South . Carolina. The Colbert family did not comment on her cause of death. An obituary said she died after a long illness. Lorna stayed at home and raised the children in Charleston, South Carolina, teaching them love and compassion. 'She made a very loving home for us. No fight between siblings could end without hugs and kisses, although hugs never needed a reason in her house,' he said. Lorna Colbert trained as an actress and gave her youngest son, Stephen, a flair for the dramatic . Lornera is seen here with her husband James and their 11 children. Stephen is the youngest, standing just right of his mother. Stephen's brothers brothers Paul and Peter - seen middle row, center - were killed in a 1974 plane crash . Colbert took last week off from taping his comedy news show to mourn his mother, who passed away on June 12. Colbert's father and two of his brothers were killed in a 1974 commercial plane crash in Charlotte, North Carolina, when Colbert  was just 10. 'I know it may sound greedy to want more days with a person who lived so long, but the fact that my mother was 92 does not diminish, it only magnifies the enormity of the room whose doors have quietly shut,' Colbert said, struggling to maintain his composure. Lorna was born in Larchmont, New York, in Westchester County in 1920 that same week, Colbert noted, 'as women got the right to vote.' She met her husband James at age 12 and made her friends cross town to ride their bicycles past his house. But, she refused to even look in his window to see if he had noticed her. Lorna grew up in Westchester County, New York, and trained as an actress before she married her husband . Lorna was born in 1920 on the same week that women in the U.S. were granted the right to vote . Colbert raised the children, but she took on many other tasks to keep her busy. Her obituary described her as 'an accomplished artist, a church leader, a businesswoman, a supporter of the arts.' Colbert may have inherited some of his stage presence from Lorna, who train as an actor. 'Singing and dancing was encouraged except at the dinner table,' he joked. 'She’d trained to be an actress when she was younger and she would teach us to do stage falls by pretending to faint on the kitchen floor.' In a 2008 interview with a South Carolina TV program, she said she said Stephen was a 'fabulous, wonderful young son.' She also said she hoped that no one took his conservative persona too seriously - because I didn't match his real personality at all. Colbert has remained close to his family and his childhood roots in South Carolina. He campaigned for his sister, Elizabeth Colbert Bush, in her losing bid to win a special election for a South Carolina U.S. House seat this fall. After his three and a half minute tribute, Colbert paused, looked away - and then turned back to the camera, having re-assumed his TV persona in an instant. 'With that... this is the Colbert Report,' he said .","Stephen Colbert spent the first three and a half minutes of his show Wednesday paying tribute to his mother Lorna Tuck Colbert .

Schoolchildren taking part in a Guard of Honour for athletes ahead of the Olympics Opening Ceremony have been told to wear Adidas shoes to avoid the risk of being turned away. The eight youngsters from John Hampden Primary in Oxfordshire have been informed they must either wear shoes made by the Olympics sponsor or have no visible branding on their trainers at all. LOCOG, the organisational committee for the games, confirmed the regulations. Children taking part in the Guard of Honour leading to the Olympic Stadium have been told to wear either Adidas or unbranded trainers . A spokesman said: '‘Young people from across the UK will form a Guard of Honour to welcome athletes ahead of the Athletes Parade. 'They have been given practical guidance on clothing, including footwear and we’ve advised comfortable, unbranded or Adidas shoes should be worn.’ Organisers have given 'practical advice' on footwear and said that only Adidas trainers, left, or shoes without clear branding on them, right, should be worn . 2,000 performers will take part in the Guard of Honour and line the route as participants make their way from the Village to the Stadium ahead of the Athletes Parade. The mother of one of the ten-year-olds due to take part said the regulations risked souring the once-in-a-lifetime event. Lucie Copcutt, 36, said: 'If they are told what to wear, it spoils the occasion. 'They should be allowed to wear what they want as long as they look smart because not every parent can afford buy Adidas shoes,' she told the Oxford Mail. Pupils at John Hampden Primary School in Oxfordshire, pictured, received the advice ahead of taking part in Friday's Guard of Honour . Olympic chiefs have already been accused of taking too heavy-handed an approach to protecting the rights of sponsors. Appearing on the Today show, Lord Coe told presenter Evan Davis he would not be allowed to wear a 'Pespi-branded' T-shirt to the event. Lord Coe, pictured, has said that spectators wearing 'Pepsi-branded' T-shirts would 'probably not' be permitted to enter stadiums . Lord Coe told him: 'No, you probably wouldn’t be walking in with a Pepsi T-shirt because Coca-Cola are our sponsors and they have put millions of pounds into this project but also millions of pounds into grassroots sport. It is important to protect those sponsors.' But asked whether he could wear Nike-branded trainers, Lord Coe said: 'I think you probably could...' His comments came weeks after organisers revealed a list of restricted items banned from the Games. Frisbees are already banned, as are long-lens cameras, Che Guevara T-shirts and vuvuzelas. Security will be tight with airport-style restrictions on liquids greater than 100ml and no more than one soft-sided bag is allowed and must fit under the spectator’s seat. IOC boss Jacques Rogge has defended the strict rules to prevent 'ambush marketing' by firms not signed up as sponsors. He said: 'We have to protect of course the sponsors, it goes without saying. You cannot ask a company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and not be protected against ambush marketing. 'But the fight against ambush marketing will be led with a lot of common sense. Everything that is in good faith will not be affected and will not be forbidden. 'If you come with a T-shirt and it is not exactly the T-shirt of the sponsor in the venue, they will not forbid you from entering the stadium.","Youngsters advised to wear 'comfortable, unbranded or Adidas shoes' for the showcase event .

A mosquito-borne disease that preys on the young and malnourished is sweeping across poverty-riven northern India. Officials are worried it could be the deadliest outbreak of encephalitis in nearly a decade. The disease has already killed at least 118 children this year, and authorities fear the death toll could reach about 1,000, said Dr. R.N. Singh of the Encephalitis Eradication Movement, an Indian nonprofit. Sweeping India: Sangita Devi stands near the bed of her son Anup Kumar, 4, who has been in hospital for the last four months receiving treatment for encephalitis in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh state, India. Encephalitis is sweeping through northern India . Deadly: Encephalitis has killed at least 118 children in what officials worry could become the deadliest outbreak in nearly a decade . While India's efforts against polio and . tuberculosis get plenty of attention, the poor farmers and day laborers . of eastern Uttar Pradesh state face an almost-silent emergency, battling . a disease that has killed thousands of children over the past eight . years. The children who survive often cannot communicate because of brain damage and stare listlessly, unable to recognize friends they played with just months before. Some are so severely disabled that their impoverished parents are told to abandon them . Many families have taken out crushing loans for treatment. Sangita Devi's four-year-old son Anup Kumar has been in a hospital for four months. 'We have mortgaged our house for our son's treatment. But there is no improvement in his condition. 'He cannot even stand now,' she said. Killer: While India's efforts against polio and tuberculosis get plenty of attention, the poor farmers and day laborers of eastern Uttar Pradesh state face an almost-silent health emergency, battling a disease that has killed thousands of children over the past eight years . Every year the monsoon fills the region's parched paddy fields, heralding the arrival of the mosquitoes that spread Japanese encephalitis from pigs to humans, devastating malnourished children with low immunity. Another strain of the disease - Acute Encephalitis Syndrome - spreads through contaminated water. Residents use the fields for defecation, contaminating the ground water. A vaccine has long been available, but the state government - which spent tens of millions of dollars building monuments to its last top politician - has failed to muster the sustained political will to focus on the communities hardest hit by the illness. The disease killed more than 1,500 children in 2005, the worst recent year. Errors: Health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis . Encephalitis is a mosquito-borne disease. It’s common in rural areas throughout Southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and the Far East. The very young and the very old are most at risk because their immune system (the body's natural defence against infection and illness) tends to be weaker. Most people infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus do not develop any symptoms, or they get only mild, flu-like symptoms. But in people who are seriously infected the virus can also cause swelling inside the brain (encephalitis), leading to increased pressure in the brain. This can cause permanent brain damage. Japanese encephalitis. The devastating disease can be fatal in around one in three people who develop these serious symptoms. Source: NHS.uk . Shocked by the deaths, Uttar . Pradesh's highest court in 2006 asked the state and federal governments . to declare encephalitis a national health emergency. 'A concrete action . plan must be drawn,' it said. That . year the government started vaccinating children against Japanese . encephalitis. The government vowed to immunize every child in the . worst-affected areas and to launch a massive drive to improve . sanitation. For a couple of years, the numbers dropped. In 2006, the . disease killed 431 children. But the crowded hospital wards of the tiny town of Gorakhpur reflect how the immunization drive has fizzled out. Last year, more than 700 children died. Health experts say the government has made repeated mistakes in the fight against encephalitis. Most of the 7.5 million children vaccinated between 2006 and 2010 were given only a single dose of a two-dose vaccine, said Singh, of the Encephalitis Eradication Movement. 'Who is responsible for the children who died between 2006 and 2010?' Singh asked. In 2010 the vaccination drive suddenly stopped because funds dried up. The sanitation drive never fully started. To make matters worse, in the 23 worst-affected districts in the state, only one hospital - the Baba Raghav Das Medical College in Gorakhpur - is equipped to deal with the hundreds of sick children. They fill its 108-bed encephalitis ward. 'By the time they reach here, it's too late,' said Dr. K.P. Kushwaha, who heads the hospital. According to hospital data, 5,136 children with encephalitis died in its wards between 2005 and 2012. This year, 118 children had died by the end of May. The figures don't include children treated at private clinics or those who never made it to medical care. Survivors who develop brain damage, common among young children, have no rehabilitation centers despite a 2011 court order telling the state government to set them up.","Encephalitis has already killed at least 118 children this year in India this year .

Anger: Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a blunt warning to the UK about the risks of arming Syrian rebels . Vladimir Putin today warned arming rebels in Syria would risk a repeat of the 'violent assassination' murder of British soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich. The intervention by the Russian President to invoke Drummer Rigby's death came after he blocked the G8 from calling for the removal of Bashar Assad to end the bloody conflict in Syria. The Russian leader refused to sign a communique at the summit in Northern Ireland which mentioned ousting the Syrian President amid claims that chemical weapons have been used against opposition forces. At a G8 dinner last night David Cameron led seven world powers . against one as he tried to shame Mr . Putin into agreeing that Syria's brutal regime must be toppled. Mr . Cameron was hoping for a show of unity over the civil war in Syria, . which has largely overshadowed the economic priorities of the summit. Over a dinner of crab and lamb at the G8 . summit, the leaders of the US, Canada, Germany, Japan, France, and . Italy joined the UK in urging President Putin to give ground. But Mr Putin rejected the idea, and issued a stark warning at a press conference to mark the end of the two-day G8 conference. In a direct challenge to Mr Cameron, . he said: 'Recently the British people suffered a huge loss. It was a . tragedy next to his barracks on the streets of London. A violent . assassination, a very brutal killing of a British serviceman. 'Clearly the opposition is not . composed all of this but many of them are exactly the same as the ones . who perpetrated the killing in London. 'If we equip these people, if we arm . them what is going to control and verify who is going to have these . weapons, including in Europe as well. 'So we call all our partners, before making this dangerous step, think about it very carefully.' Warning: The Russian President told allies to think 'carefully' before taking any decisions to provide weapons to the opposition forces . Division: Russian President Vladimir Putin has resisted demands from David Cameron and Barack Obama to back a call for Syrian President Assad to go . The decision to invoke the death of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich is likely to stir emotions in Britain . Other than Russia, members of the G8 . agreed on a five-point plan after two years of civil war in Syria. It . included a condemnation of the use of chemical weapons and a declaration . that Syria needs a 'new government' with the consent of its people. But Mr Putin has refused to sign up to a demand that Assad must go. Instead . the leaders of the world's most powerful nations papered over their . differences on Syria to agree a weaker joint position after fraught . talks at the G8 summit. The . chief communique states that the G8 nations are 'committed to achieving . a political solution to the crisis based on a vision for a united, . inclusive and democratic Syria'. It . endorses plans to restart peace talks in Geneva 'as soon as possible' and says that they should begin with both sides agreeing on 'a . transitional governing body with full executive powers, formed by mutual . consent'. Meeting: The two-day summit agreed action on trade,and tax but divisions over Syria dominated the agenda . Talks: British Prime Minister David Cameron warned Assad has 'blood on his hands' as G8 leaders threw their weight behind calls for a peace conference on Syria to be held in Geneva 'as soon as possible' Protests: Oxfam volunteers dressed as Mr Cameron and Mr Putin pose for the cameras in a call for an end to global hunger . The G8 leaders also confirmed that they are making almost $1.5 billion available in additional funding for humanitarian operations in Syria and its neighbouring countries. At a press confernce to mark the end of the summit, Mr Cameron said: 'It is unthinkable that president Assad can play any part in the future government of his country. 'He has blood on his hands, he's used chemical weapons.' Mr Cameron said the priority now was to identify people from the regime and opposition 'who can sit down and talk about a transitional authority that will take power in Syria'. 'If that can happen that opens the way to a genuine transition to a genuine Syria free from Assad, free from terror. That is what we have agreed to work towards and I think that is an important step forward.' Tense: U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland . A cold encounter: Mr Putin and Mr Cameron clashed during talks in Downing Street on Sunday . The agreement It comes after Mr Putin . ignored diplomatic protocol to publicly lambast first Mr Cameron and . later US President Barack Obama for demanding action to end the war. On . Sunday the Russian leader used a press conference in Downing Street to . warn Mr Cameron that arming Syria's rebels will put guns in the hands of . extremists who 'eat the organs' of their enemies. And last night during a G8 press conference a visibly uncomfortable Mr Putin admitted . after talks with Mr Obama that 'our positions do not fully coincide'. The White House has indicated it is now ready President Barack Obama, who visited a school in Enniskillen with Mr Cameron today, is ready to arm the opposition in Syria. Instead a joint stance which has been agreed will be formally published this afternoon. It will revive hopes that a peace conference can be convened to pave the way for a political transition in the war-torn Middle Eastern state. Mr Cameron put Syria top of the agenda at last night's summit dinner with the aim of restoring momentum towards the proposed meeting in Geneva. There had been suggestions that the other seven G8 countries could go ahead with a statement with or without Russian agreement. But Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov announced that a joint deal had been agreed. He signalled that it would not specify that Assad should step down from power and that no outcome should be declared in advance for how any transitional government wold be made up.","David Cameron used a dinner to put pressure on Russian President .

Two thirds of men who take finasteride, and who develop side effects such as low sex drive, drink less as a result of the drug . Some men who take anti-baldness drugs lose interest in alcohol, new research has revealed. Those who take finasteride (also known as Propecia) to stop their hairline receding also tend drink less alcohol after starting the medication. The research, carried out at the George Washington University, revealed that two thirds of men who take the drug, and who develop side effects such as low sex drive, drink less as a result. It showed that this side effect continues even after the man has stopped taking the medication. Finasteride is the only once-a day pill developed to treat mild to moderate male pattern hair loss. In a clinical study of 535 men taking the drug, 99 per cent had visible results - growth or no further hair loss - after two years. It works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, or DHT, which is thought to be the active hormone in hair loss. Researcher Dr Michael Irwig interviewed 83 healthy men who developed persistent sexual side effects while taking finasteride. He also collected information relating to the men’s medical histories, sexual function, and alcohol consumption before and after taking finasteride. Of the 63 men who consumed at least . one alcoholic drink per week prior to starting finasteride, 65 . per cent noted a decrease in their alcohol consumption even after they . stopped taking finasteride. Thirty-two per cent reported . no change in their alcohol consumption, and  three per cent reported an increase in alcohol consumption. This could be because the drug reduces the brain's ability to make hormones, called neurosteroids, which are linked to interest in alcohol . Live Science reports that many of the men also noted that they had a lower alcohol tolerance after taking the medication, that they felt more anxious after drinking, and that they recovered less quickly from the effects of alcohol. The researchers do not know why the drug has this effect upon people’s drinking habits. However, Dr Irwig believes that it reduces the brain’s ability to make hormones, called neurosteroids, which are linked to interest in alcohol. Previous research has also suggested that finasteride can cause permanent, irreversible, impotence. Dr Irwig found that finasteride can cause persistent sexual dysfunction, including low sexual desire, erectile dysfunction and problems with orgasms. These problems, he discovered, often did not resolve themselves when the man stopped taking the drug.","Finasteride, or Propecia, can also cause sexual dysfunction .

"By . Fiona Macrae Science Correspondent In Chile . PUBLISHED: . 13:00 EST, 13 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:16 EST, 13 March 2013 . A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, billions of stars were born. This picture  - one of the first to be taken by  ALMA – the world’s newest and most powerful telescope – shows an ancient galaxy forming stars at a breathtaking rate. During such ‘starbursts’, hundreds or thousands of stars are born a year. In contrast, our galaxy, the Milky Way only sees around just one new star a year. The first image from the ALMA telescope: This montage combines data from ALMA with images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, for five distant galaxies. The ALMA images, represented in red, show the distant, background galaxies, being distorted by the gravitational lens effect produced by the galaxies in the foreground, depicted in the Hubble data in blue. The astronomers were using only a partial array of 16 of ALMA’s full complement of 66 giant antennas, as the observatory was still under construction at an altitude of 5000 metres on the remote Chajnantor Plateau in the Chilean Andes. When complete, ALMA will be even more sensitive, and will be able to detect even fainter galaxies. For now, astronomers targeted the brighter ones. They took advantage of a helping hand from nature, too: using gravitational lensing, an effect predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity, where light from a distant galaxy is distorted by the gravitational influence of a nearer foreground galaxy, which acts like a lens and makes the distant source appear brighter. The red arcs in the image represent a distant galaxy rapidly creating stars around 12billion years ago – the light generated has only just reached us on earth. The central white dot depicts another calmer and closer galaxy. It was already known that starbursts – bright and brief periods of rapid star formation – were much more common in the early universe than today but scientists had struggled to date them. The latest images, taken by a . stunning series of radio antennae on plateau 16,400ft above the Chile’s . Atacama desert, reveal that such intense periods of stellar birth . occurred earlier in the universe than thought. Data . from more than two dozen galaxies shows that on average, the . starbursts took place 12 billion years ago, when the universe was just . under two billion years old. This is a full billion years earlier than previous studies had indicated. Two . of the galaxies are the most distant of their kind ever seen – so far . away that the light in the form of radio waves captured by ALMA started . their journey just a billion years after the Big Bang. In one of these, water was detected- the most distant observation of water in the cosmos to date. Some of the distant star-forming galaxies are as bright as 40 million million suns, the journal Nature reports. The picture was taken by capturing light emitted in the form of radio waves by gases in the galaxy and measuring  and warping  the light’s waves. By taking into account stretching caused by the expansion of the universe, astronomers can work out how long the light’s journey has taken and so place a galaxy at the right point in cosmic history. How it works: This schematic image represents how light from a distant galaxy is distorted by the gravitational effects of a nearer foreground galaxy, which acts like a lens and makes the distant source appear distorted, but brighter, forming characteristic rings of light, known as Einstein rings. An analysis of the distortion has revealed that some of the distant star-forming galaxies are as bright as 40 trillion Suns, and have been magnified by the gravitational lens by up to 22 times. Lead researcher, Joaquin Vieria, of the California Institute of Technology in the US, said: ‘The more distant the galaxy, the further back in time one is looking, so by measuring their distances we can piece together a timeline of how vigorously the universe was making new stars at different stages in its 13.7billion year history.’ The ALMA observatory, which is part-funded by Britain through the Science and Technology Facilities Council, was officially launched today.# . This picture was taken while it was still under construction and so drew on just 16 of the telescope’s 66 giant radio antennae. But when operating at full power, the resulting images should be ten times sharper than those of the Hubble space telescope. To get such pictures from a single land-based radio telescope, it would have to be ten miles wide. Researcher Carlos De Breuck, of the European Southern Observatory, said the results show that ‘ALMA is a powerful new player in the field’. Leicester University astronomer Professor Andrew Blain, who wrote an accompanying article for Nature, said: ‘With sharper imaging than the Hubble Space Telescope, and the ability to measure the different parts of a faraway galaxy independently, ALMA is starting to give us a much more complete picture of the growth and formation of our universe.’ The array of 66 telescopes is being built in Chile because it is one of the few places in the world where it is still possible to find a high, dry location unaffected by pollution from artificial light.

Dryness is particularly important as moisture in the air absorbs the radio waves the dishes are trying to capture. Speaking at the observatory’s official opening ceremony, Chilean president Sebastián Piñera, said: ‘One of our many natural resources is Chile’s spectacular night sky. ‘I believe that science has been a vital contributor to the development of Chile in recent years. I am very proud of our international collaborations in astronomy, of which ALMA is the latest, and biggest outcome.’ ALMA’s UK project manager, Professor Brian Ellison,  of the STFC's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, said: ‘The difficulty of constructing an instrument of the scale of ALMA, and that is located in a challenging environment, should not be underestimated. ‘It is a testament to the vision, skill and perseverance of all those involved that not only is construction complete, but early operation is producing outstanding science. ‘I am delighted and proud that the UK, through a variety of institutes and organisations participating at various stages of the project's development and construction, has made a large and very successful contribution to ALMA, both scientifically and technically. ‘The Apple founder, the late Steve Jobs once said that ""....every once in a while a revolutionary product comes along that changes everything.....and one is very fortunate if you get to work on just one of these in your career'. ‘The advent of ALMA will undoubtedly revolutionise our view of the Universe and for me, it represents working on a revolutionary product 66 times over.’ Dr Thomas Greve, from University College London, and one of two British scientists who contributed to the Nature paper, said: ‘Our study has shown that little more than one billion years after the Big Bang, extreme starburst galaxies in the Universe, forming stars at a rate of more than a thousand per year, were a much more commonplace occurrence than previously thought. ‘This runs counter to the traditional understanding of massive galaxies forming gradually over much longer periods of time. ‘This is a discovery that only ALMA, with its incredible observing capabilities, could have made.’ British science and engineering has benefited from £40million . of contracts from ALMA.

The chief spin doctor for bailed- out Lloyds Bank enjoys a pay package worth up to £1.3million, it was revealed yesterday. Details of the extraordinary awards paid to the state-backed lender’s corporate affairs director Matt Young emerged in a leaked memo. The full package – paid if he hits certain targets – is almost ten times the £142,000 salary paid to David Cameron. The revelation is sure to embarrass Lloyds’ Portuguese boss Antonio Horta-Osorio, who counts Mr Young as one of his closest lieutenants. The two previously worked together when Mr Horta-Osorio ran Spanish-owned bank Santander. Insiders say Mr Horta-Osorio insisted his former colleague join him when he was poached by Lloyds in 2010. The bank says Mr Young is not merely a PR man but is a key member of its top  management team who sits on its most senior executive committee. A leaked document attempts to justify Mr Young’s ‘proposed remuneration’ by  saying ‘Matthew is significantly underpaid for his current role’. It also claims that he was about to be promoted at Santander when he followed his old boss to Lloyds. The lavish package includes a £350,000 basic salary, a bonus of as much as £525,000 and a long-term performance-related shares award of £350,000. On top of this, he receives an £87,500 pension contribution – or a quarter of his basic salary – and a £12,000 car allowance. Lloyds last night refused to confirm the figures. It does not have to disclose Mr Young’s annual package because he does not sit on the board. Lloyds, which received a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008, broke into profit in the first three months of this year . But details released to the stockmarket in March reveal Mr Young is set to receive up to £940,000 in bonuses by 2016. The news sparked a furious reaction from campaigners last night. Robert Oxley, campaign manager of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Not even a spin doctor on a million pounds could paint the bank bailouts as a good deal for taxpayers. ‘Until Lloyds pays back taxpayers, and our stake is sold off, we’re on the hook for these eye-watering salaries. ‘It isn’t well-funded PR that is going to return Lloyds back to full ownership though, it’s a focus on delivering shareholders value for money.’ Mr Young is said to be one of the few people that really ‘gets’ Mr Horta-Osorio. Both men are fiercely driven, work long hours and are obsessed with detail. Lloyds' Portuguese boss Antonio Horta-Osorio has refused to bow to pressure to give up his bonus . Mr Horta-Osorio’s tendency to . micro-manage is said to be one of the reasons why he had to take two . months’ sick leave at the end of 2011 after a severe bout of insomnia. Mr Young made himself indispensible to his boss, helping to steer him through the crisis. But Luke Hildyard from the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a ridiculous amount of money for a PR man – Lloyds should be paying people to achieve value for money for the taxpayers who bailed them out, not fobbing us off with more spin.’ He added: ‘Cashiers, who face daily abuse from members of the public angry at the bankers who crashed the economy, receive  barely 1 per cent of what Matt Young is allegedly rewarded. ‘They would be more fitting recipients of Lloyds’ largesse.’ The bank, which received a £20billion bailout from taxpayers in 2008, broke into profit in the first three months of this year. But it plunged to a loss of £570million last year and its compensation bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance – which occurred before Mr Horta-Osorio joined – has climbed to £6.8billion. Unlike the bosses of the Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, Mr Horta-Osorio has refused to bow to pressure to give up his bonus, receiving a £1.5million  payment for 2012 as part of his £3.4million package, although he will only received that bonus in 2016 and it is linked to the the bank's share price after it returns to private hands. Last night Lloyds defended Mr Young’s pay. A spokesman said: ‘Matt is part of the new management team brought in to turn around the bank. ‘A significant majority of his pay is in shares, deferred and will only pay out if the transformation of Lloyds is successful over many years. ‘The new management team will only do well if the taxpayer does well.’","Matt Young is the state-backed lender’s corporate affairs director .

Dinosaurs suffered painful arthritis in their huge joints, scientists revealed for the first time today. Researchers found signs of a degenerative condition similar to human arthritis in the jaw of a pliosaur - an ancient sea reptile that lived 150 million years ago. The discovery marks the first time arthritis-like diseases have been found in fossilised Jurassic reptiles. With its huge jaws and 20 cm long teeth,the pliosaur would have been capable of ripping most other marine reptiles or dinosaurs to pieces, but this particular individual was the unfortunate victim of an arthritis-like disease . Dr Judyth Sassoon a scientist at the University of Bristol with the lower jaw of the Westbury pliosaur . A team from Bristol University examined a giant specimen of the pliosaur Pliosaurus dating from the Upper Jurassic period, which was found in Westbury, Wiltshire. The eight metre long creature had a large crocodile-like head, a short neck, whale-like body and four powerful flippers to propel it through water. It has huge jaws and teeth 20cm long - capable of ripping most other reptiles or dinosaurs to pieces - but suffered from an arthritis-like disease, they found. This caused its left jaw joint to erode, displacing its lower jaw to one side. The dinosaur is believed to have suffered with the condition for years as there are marks on the bone of the lower jaw where the teeth from the upper jaw impacted during feeding. Dr Judyth Sassoon, of the University of Bristol, who studied the skeleton, said: ‘In the same way that aging humans develop arthritic hips, this old lady developed an arthritic jaw, and survived with her disability for some time. ‘But an unhealed fracture on the jaw indicates that at some time the jaw weakened and eventually broke. ‘With a broken jaw, the pliosaur would not have been able to feed and that final accident probably led to her demise.’ A new study by scientists at the university has found signs of a degenerative condition similar to human arthritis in the jaw of a pliosaur, an ancient sea reptile that lived 150 million years ago . There are several signs to suggest the skeleton was of an old female, who developed the condition as part of the ageing process - like many humans. The pliosaurs large size and fused skull bones suggest maturity, while it is believed to be female because its skull crest is quite low. Pliosaurs are thought to have been pursuit or ambush predators, feeding on fish, squid and other marine reptiles but would also have been able to scavenge. They were at the top of their food chains so would only have had to fend off attacks from other pliosaurs. Professor Mike Benton, a collaborator on the project, added: ‘You can see these kinds of deformities in living animals, such as crocodiles or sperm whales and these animals can survive for years as long as they are still able to feed. ‘But it must be painful. Remember that the fictional whale, Moby Dick from Herman Melville's novel, was supposed to have had a crooked jaw!’ luded in fragrances. Likewise, the chemicals that make symmetrical men smell good could become ingredients in aftershave.","150 million year old 'pliosaur' shows signs of illness .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 19:55 EST, 6 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:39 EST, 7 June 2013 . Author and Playwright Tom Sharpe. Picture shows Tom Sharpe sat in his garden in Bridport, Dorset in 1985. He has died aged 85 . A sadistic, goggle-eyed policeman, a scrawny and aggressive nymphomaniac, a politician with an excruciating perversion, a busty lesbian, a mad, retired colonel and a mild- mannered academic whose world is spinning out of control. This was the interchangeable cast of a string of racy comic bestsellers that saw Tom Sharpe hailed as the successor to Evelyn Waugh and P.G. Wodehouse. Novels including Porterhouse Blue, Blott On The Landscape and Wilt were translated into rollicking TV and film adaptations. They starred top actors from David Jason to Ian Richardson and David Suchet, and comedians Griff Rhys Jones and Mel Smith. But the author, who died yesterday aged 85 at his home in Llafranc, northern Spain, insisted he wasn’t worthy to be ranked alongside the finest wits: ‘I’m not a great writer, for God’s sake. I’m just a fool.’ His novels were spattered with filthy language and even ruder sexual fantasies. The farcical plots and the bawdy humour were as English as seaside postcards or Carry On films. But Sharpe added something extra — a savage element of satire that gave his novels an appeal to all classes of reader. His books rarely varied in tone, but there was something for everyone. In the Wilt books, Sharpe’s accident-prone alter-ego Henry Wilt, consumed by sexual frustration and prone to violent outbursts, was driven round the twist by the political correctness of the Seventies. As head of the department of ‘Liberal Studies’, he was plagued by his  college’s demand for sexual equality in all his lessons, so that bricklaying had to be taught as a joint diploma with nursery childcare. Despite this cynicism, and his exasperation with every type of  British institution, Sharpe was an idealist who loathed racism and refused to be brow-beaten by the authorities. He was especially suspicious of the Army and the other uniformed forces of law and order. ‘It is a vital civil act in any society to make fun of the police,’ he said. ‘When you can’t, you’ve already landed in a dictatorial state.’ Born in Holloway, London, in 1928, his political education began young. His father, who was nearly 60, was a Unitarian minister, a pacifist and a socialist who became a fervent convert to the Nazi movement. ‘I think he must have gone dotty,’ Sharpe later mused. ‘He thought Hitler was a nice bloke.’ The author, who died yesterday aged 85 at his home in Llafranc, northern Spain, insisted he wasn't worthy to be ranked alongside the finest wits: 'I'm not a great writer, for God's sake. I'm just a fool' By the time he was a schoolboy, evacuated to Ludlow, Shropshire, Sharpe was as pro-German as his father. His ambition was to become an Obergruppenfuhrer in the Waffen-SS. But when the first footage from liberated concentration camps was shown in 1945, Sharpe was devastated. He did his national service with the Royal Marines, and was badly  bullied: ‘I was the only public schoolboy among 50 men and they were just knocking the hell out of me. Probably a good thing. I was an extremely arrogant young man.’ After taking his degree in history at Cambridge, he emigrated to South Africa, where his mother had been born. In Johannesburg he was a failed accountant before joining the government’s Non-European Affairs Department, which ran the black townships. His jobs including rent-collecting and visiting tuberculosis patients judged too ill for treatment. The squalor and degradation appalled him — and the dignity of the people moved him deeply. One patient, a 15-year-old girl, stuck in his mind for the rest of his life. The hospital refused to treat her, but her family refused to give up and, by going without their own food, they gradually nursed her back to health. Porterhouse Blue by Tom Sharpe, starred David Jason as Skullion and Paul Rogers as the Dean . Sharpe turned reporter and started photographing the townships, and wrote polemical plays. He married briefly, then divorced. Though it was impossible to stage the plays under apartheid, one was produced in London: The South Africans. It brought a swift response from the . Pretoria police, who raided Sharpe’s flat, seized and burned 36,000 of . his photos, and threw him into prison. Deported to England, he worked as a teacher for ten years in  Cambridge before publishing his first novel, aged 43. Ian Richardson played the Master. A 'Porterhouse blue' was the slang name for a stroke, brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars . Riotous Assembly was a dark and brutal farce about apartheid, inspired by a story he’d heard of an 80-year-old woman living next door to a police station, who asked the chief inspector to stop torturing suspects during the afternoon as their screams disturbed her nap.Another South African satire followed. Then came his most famous novel, Porterhouse Blue, an attack on the academic world. It followed the struggles of a head porter, Skullion, to thwart proposed reforms at a fictional Cambridge college called Porterhouse with a long and noble tradition of drunkenness, gluttony and aristocratic vandalism. A ‘Porterhouse blue’ was the slang name for a stroke, brought on by over-indulgence in the college cellars. Blott On The Landscape followed in 1975, a novel about a greedy landowner’s efforts to get a motorway built across his ancestral estates. When the TV adaptation was screened a decade later, one scene provoked uproar. Audiences weren’t ready for the sight of a naked George Cole (beloved as Arthur Daley in Minder) being whipped by Julia McKenzie, dressed as a cat. But readers couldn’t get enough of this winning mix of bawdiness and polemic. Throughout the Seventies, Sharpe produced a book a year. But after Wilt On High was published in 1984, he suffered a paralysing bout of writer’s block. He had a heart attack live on Spanish TV and was rushed into an ambulance. He was ordered by his doctors to stop smoking and it was giving up cigars, he insisted, not his weakened health, that made  writing impossible. He was said to be furious at the Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones film version of Wilt two years later. He said: 'I was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong' A six-part TV adaptation in 1987 of Porterhouse Blue, with David Jason as Skullion, brought him new fans, but he was furious at the Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones film version of Wilt two years later. ‘I was so angry about that because it was so absolutely wrong,’ he fumed. It was too broad and had lost all of its subtlety. When Sharpe and his second wife Nancy moved to Llafranc, close to Barcelona, in the late Nineties, his writer’s block slowly lifted — as did the ban on cigars. The couple had been married since 1969, and had three daughters. He produced several more novels, but the world that had so enraged him, of sexual repression and barking-mad ex-military men, was gone. ‘It is so depressing,’ he said. ‘I can’t bear it. There is no such thing as the English gentleman any more. Money rules everything.’ But he had made his mark. In 16 riotous novels, lewd and boiling with anger, he captivated the imaginations of readers, making us roar with laughter, but more important, making us bellow with him at the injustice of it all.","Author of Porterhouse Blue, Blott On The Landscape and Wilt died at home .

Eric Pickles insisted the Government should be 'very,very,very reluctant' to legislate to regulate the press . A cabinet minister broke ranks ahead of the Leveson report into media standards yesterday  to insist the Government should be ‘very, very, very reluctant’ to legislate to regulate the press. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said it was right that the media was already working towards an improved system to offer recourse to people with legitimate complaints in the aftermath of the phone hacking scandal. His intervention opens up a growing divide between the Conservatives and Labour over the future of media regulation. Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman yesterday indicated the party is backing at least an ‘underpinning’ in law for a new regulatory model. Miss Harman, who also holds the opposition brief for culture, media and sport, appeared to dismiss efforts by editors and proprietors to draw up proposals for a new regulator with greater powers to fine erring publications, including fines. ‘I think it’s disappointing of the newspapers to say we want a status quo because the status quo has failed,’ she said. Despite David Cameron’s insistence that ministers should not be seen to pre-empt the Leveson report, due next month, Mr Pickles joined senior Conservatives including London Mayor Boris Johnson and culture committee chairman John Whittingdale in opposing any statutory system. ‘I think it is really massively important to ensure we have freedom of press in this country. Some of the characteristics of the British press - it is good at exposing corruption and it is good at going to places where other press wouldn’t,’ the Communities Secretary said. ‘I think it was Thomas Jefferson who said that for a free society to operate, then the “river of a free press had to flow without restriction”. ‘I think, given that the press are looking towards finding ways, the end result of offering a good way that people who have a legitimate complaint can find recourse, then that is right. ‘We should be very, very, very reluctant to take on legislation. It’s a balance and my view is that we should always balance in favour of a free press.’ Mr Pickles’ remarks, to the Sky News Murnaghan programme, were seen as the clearest indication yet of the Cabinet’s thinking on the Leveson report. His public intervention was all the more surprising, given that the Prime Minister urged Tory cabinet colleagues at a private meeting last Thursday not to say anything that might be taken as pre-empting the government’s response. Miss Harman, speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, insisted that there had to be some kind of statutory underpinning because the Press had failed to reform itself. Labour leader Harriet Harman spoke on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday . ‘I don’t think self-regulation could be, should be given another chance. And obviously Lord Leveson has heard a great many revelations from the McCanns, the Dowlers, the Watsons,’ she said. ‘It’s clear that business as usual cannot sustain. There is not a proper press complaints system which ensures that where the press get it wrong, the individual can complain and it will be independently looked at.’ She added: ‘We don’t want any inhibition on press freedom. I mean I’ve been in opposition long enough to have a view that if the government were to control the press, I mean that’s terrible. I’ve always argued for press freedom. ‘But I think that... we may need a statute to underpin a truly independent press complaints system, a bit like the independent system that deals with complaints against solicitors, so that it’s independent of government but also you don’t have them judging their own cases.’ Miss Harman claimed there was ‘every possibility of getting cross-party agreement’ on the issue. ‘I mean we need to have a cool head here. We need to look at what Leveson proposes and hopefully take it forward if it’s sensible and proportionate, but the status quo is not acceptable,’ she added. Lord Black, chairman of the Press Standards Board of Finance, told peers last week that it would be possible to bring in a new, tighter form of independent regulation within three months, but statutory legislation would take three years, and might face a legal challenge. Professor Brian Cathcart, of Hacked Off, a campaign for press reform, said: ‘We welcome Labour’s clear and unequivocal commitment to support what Lord Justice Leveson proposes, as long as it is sensible and proportionate. ‘Labour recognises, as we do, that after fifty years of failed self-regulation and the revelations of the last 12 months, the status quo is simply no longer an option. ‘Victims of hacking, harassment and bullying by national newspapers now hope that the Government will seek cross-party agreement for the establishment of a new independent regulator, underpinned by statute. The days of newspaper editors acting as judge and jury over their own misdemeanours are over.’","Eric Pickles's intervention opens up growing divide between Tories and Labour over future of media regulation .

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Face of the brand: George Zimmer seen in a Men's Wearhouse commercial before being fired . Zimmer starred in his first Men's Wearhouse commercial in 1986, in which he first coined his instantly recognizable 'I guarantee it' line in his gravelly baritone voice . Zimmer, 64, issued the following statement: 'Over the last 40 years, I have built The Men’s Wearhouse into a multi-billion dollar company with amazing employees and loyal customers who value the products and service they receive at The Men’s Wearhouse. 'Over the past several months I have expressed my concerns to the Board about the direction the company is currently heading. 'Instead of fostering the kind of dialogue in the Boardroom that has, in part, contributed to our success, the Board has inappropriately chosen to silence my concerns by terminating me as an executive officer.' Men's Wearhouse gave no reason for the abrupt firing of Zimmer, who built Men's Wearhouse from one small Texas store using a cigar box as a cash register to one of the North America's largest specialty men's clothiers with 1,143 locations. Men's Wearhouse really took off in the 1980s after Zimmer started staring in his company's TV commercials . According to Business Week, Men's Wearhouse targets the common man, with 'the neatly displayed clothes in Zimmer's stores [being] designed to cater to the unpretentious guy who wants to do as little as possible to maintain his wardrobe.' The business currently has more than 1,200 stores under the Men's Wearhouse, Moores, K&G and Tux brands, employing 15,261 people. Zimmer, . who handed over his CEO title to Douglas Ewert in 2011, was the . company's personable, down-to-earth face, his slogan a cultural . touchstone. He was known for his usual style of . corporate management, which was regarded as cutting-edge by some and as unorthodox by . others. In June 2004 spiritual guru Deepak Chopra joined the company’s board. Some executives wondered what value he would bring to the company, but Zimmer argued that he would contribute ideas on social responsibility and team-building. The exit of Zimmer won't entirely . delete him from the brand's image though, as the company has more than . 500 hours of footage of him and the legal rights to continue to use him . image, analysts told Buzzfeed.com. Zimmer opened the first Men's Wearhouse clothing store in Texas in 1973 and grew it into a business including more than 1,200 stores . George Zimmer was born in New York City to a Jewish family. After attending grade schools in Scarsdale, New York, he received an A.B. in Economics in 1970 from Washington University in St. Louis. Upon graduation, he worked as a substitute teacher before joining his father in the clothing manufacturing business. In 1971 he worked as a purchasing agent and salesman in Hong Kong for six months for his father's coat manufacturing business. In 1973, he and his college roommate opened the first Men's Wearhouse store in Texas, which sold $10 slacks and $25 polyester sport coats, in Houston. His personal car was a van with the company logo on the side and clothing racks in the back. The company aired its first TV commercial in the 1970s when commercials for clothing were rare. Zimmer starred in his first commercial in 1986, in which he said the 'I guarantee it' line in his instantly recognizable gravelly baritone voice. Men's Wearhouse kept expanding, . focusing on large markets where business was sluggish to take advantage . of lower real estate costs. It also expanded beyond sports coats and . trousers to casual sportswear in the 1980s and then went into the tuxedo . rental business in 2000. The company went public in 1992, and the company has been cited by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 best companies to work for.

The Spaniards already boast some of the weirdest festivals in the world, such as the bull running of Pamplona and the world’s biggest tomato fight, but this one definitely tops the list. The annual Jarramplas Festival in Piornal involves hundreds of villagers attacking a man dressed in a devils mask with 15,000 turnips. The best part? No-one really knows why. A young man from the village is selected to be the 'Jarramplas' - the scape goat - and dresses up in a costume made from colourful strips of fabric, donning a devil-like mask with great horns and nose. Turnip tradition: People throw turnips at the 'Jarramplas' as he makes his way through the streets beating his drum during the Jarramplas Festival in Piornal, Spain . Strange custom: The bizarre annual holiday sees a male villager dress up as devil-figure Jarramplas and run through the streets of Piornal whilst he is pelted with turnips . Turnip target: The Jarramplas' costume is made from hundreds of colourful strips of fabric and he wears a big mask with horns and a snout as he runs through the village banging a drum . The Jarramplas then enters the . streets, banging his drum to call out the villagers who gather in their . hundreds with armfuls of turnips. They chase the Jarramplas around the . village, continuously pelting him with the rock-hard root vegetables at . every possible chance they get. It is a centuries long tradition and is celebrated every January on Saint Sebastian Day in the . village in Extremadura, western Spain which has just over 1,500 . inhabitants. There are several theories behind the Jarramplas tradition, most point to a connection between the festival and punishing cattle thieves. Five-a-day: Although the origin of the festival is undetermined, the vegetable pelting symbolise the expulsion of everything bad . Nowhere to run: As is tradition, the crowd has cornered the Jarramplas outside the local church where they furiously throw the rock-hard turnips . Topsy turn-y tradition: Every year hundreds travel to the little village in Extremadura, which has 1,500 inhabitants, to pelt a man in devil costume with big root vegetables . Theory is that the pelting of the . Jarramplas with turnips originates in the punishment and expulsion of a . cattle thief by American Indians, witnessed by the first conquerors. Another is that it mirrors the punishment of the cattle-thieving giant Cacus by Hercules in Greek mythology. However, in modern times, Jarramplas is a devil figure and the turnip throwing symbolise the expulsion of everything bad. The Jarramplas Festival is not the . only odd celebration in Spain - and surprisingly not the only one which . involves throwing vegetables. Lads game: The part-takers in the turnip-throwing is predominantly young men who compete in throwing the most turnips the hardest . Feeding the beast: The village imports 14,000 turnips every year to throw at the Jarramplas . La Tomatina is an annual food fight . in Bunol, Valencia which sees thousands of people travel from all over . the world to thrown tomatoes at each other.

A Cairo court today ordered the government to block access to the video-sharing website YouTube for 30 days for carrying an anti-Islam film that caused deadly riots across the world. Judge Hassouna Tawfiq ordered YouTube be blocked for carrying the film, which he described as ""offensive to Islam and the Prophet (Muhammad)."" He made the ruling in the Egyptian capital where the first protests against the film erupted last September before spreading to more than 20 countries, killing more than 50 people. A Cairo court today ordered the the Egyptian government to block access to YouTube for one month after the video-sharing website carried an anti-Islam film last year.  Muslims from all backgrounds waved . placards last year in cities across the world in protest at YouTube and Google refusing to take the video down . The ruling, however, can be appealed and, based on precedent, might not be enforced. The 14-minute trailer for the movie 'Innocence of Muslims' portrays the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, a central figure to Islam, as a religious fraud, womaniser and pedophile. It was produced in the United States by an Egyptian-born Christian who's now a US citizen. Egypt's new constitution includes a ban on insulting 'religious messengers and prophets.' Broadly worded, blasphemy laws were also in effect under former President Hosni Mubarak prior to his removal in a popular revolt two years ago. Human rights lawyer Gamal Eid said the decision to ban YouTube stems in large part from a lack of knowledge among judges about how the internet works. Activists say this has led to a lack of courtroom discussion on technical aspects of digital technology, leaving cases based solely on threats to national security and defamation of religion. 'This verdict shows that judges' understanding of technology is weak,' Eid said. 'The judges do not realise that one wrong post on a website does not mean you have to block the entire website.' Angry: Kashmiri Muslim students shout anti-American and . anti-Israeli slogans during a protest against a low-budget US film that . depicts the Prophet Mohammed in Srinagar in September . Eid, who is executive director at The Arabic Network for Human Right Information, said the government should file an appeal and make it clear to judges that, at most, only specific pages on websites should be blocked. His group released a statement saying that the decision to block YouTube is counterproductive, citing thousands of videos that seek to promote a better understanding of Islam and the Prophet Muhammad on the website. YouTube's parent company, Google, declined requests to remove the video from the website last year, but restricted access to it in certain countries, including Egypt, Libya and Indonesia, because it said the video broke laws in those countries. At the height of the protests in September, YouTube was ordered blocked in several countries, including Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah issued an order blocking all websites with access to the anti-Islam film in the conservative kingdom. Lawyer Mohammed Hamid Salim, who filed the case against the Egyptian government, alleged the film constitutes a threat to Egypt's security, adding that YouTube refused to remove the film despite its offensive content. Protesters in Cairo scaled the US Embassy's walls and brought down the US flag in the first demonstration against the film last year. More than 3,500 British Muslims, some from as far afield as Glasgow, waved banners and chanted slogans outside the search engine's UK headquarters to demand the company removes the film from the internet in October. Anger: Barricades were erected as thousands of Muslims marched with banners bearing an array of slogans .","14-minute film trailer released on video-sharing site last September .

A couple and their five children lived in this stomach-churning filth - sharing it with up to 14 mastiff dogs. Occupants Louisa and Joe Roylance were eventually kicked out of the house in Gosberton Risegate, Lincolnshire, owing £7,000 in unpaid rent after legal action by owners Midge Clayton and partner Richard Douville. Squalor: The home of Midge and Dick Clayton after it was vacated by their tenants, leaving £8,000 in damage . Horror: The Claytons in front of the family home they built. The tenants left with arrears of £7,000 . Staggering: Five children and 14 large dogs lived in these bleak conditions . Unhygienic: The kitchen was filled with discarded food containers and the house had no hot water . The house stank of dog faeces and urine and rotting food, detectable from outside . They found five years' worth of mess and £8,000 in damage inside their house. The air was filled with the sickening stench of dog faeces, urine and rotting food and hundreds of flies were swarming in the kitchen. Two of the four bedrooms had been turned into kennels and dog mess was caked on the walls and floor. Vile: The fridge was smeared in dirt and rotting food . Other rooms were torn apart and black bags filled with rubbish and dirty clothes were left piled in heaps four feet high. Outside, the rear garden was filled with waste from the big Dogue de Bordeaux mastiffs and the front had been turned into a tip . Miss Clayton, a mother-of-three who is recovering from breast cancer, said: 'I've cried buckets. 'When we built this home it was lovely. 'Our children are heartbroken - we had such good times here. We thought we were letting it to another family with children who would love it, too. 'But they have destroyed it. I can't believe people live like this.' Miss Clayton, 61,  a palliative care nurse, and Mr Douville built the house in 2001 as their family home. They tried to sell it five years ago when Midge underwent a knee replacement and needed to move into a bungalow. The couple priced it at £270,000 but it failed to sell and they decided to rent it out instead. They imposed a limit of four dogs on the tenancy agreement as the utility room had already been fitted out for their own dogs. Joe Roylance, 55, and his 35-year-old wife moved into the property in 2008 with their four daughters aged between eight and their mid-teens and a teenaged son. But in January this year Miss Clayton and Mr Douville discovered they had 14 dogs living there and started trying to get them out. The Roylances refused to pay their rent and whenever Midge and Richard called they refused to see them or made themselves scarce. Nauseating: One of the 14 mastiff's food bowls, left filled with mouldy food . Kennel: Even the cupboard under the stairs appears to have been converted into living space for the dogs . Trashed: The extensive damage will cost £8,000 to fix. Even the insides of cupboards and drawers were caked with filth . Grime: Filthy clothes were strewn all over the house . The couple started a six-month legal battle that cost them £2,000 which resulted in a possession order in April. They got the nightmare family out a month later. Miss Clayton said: 'We've had people come and look at the house, step inside and come back out again and throw up on the lawn because of the smell. 'The irony is we are dog people and we know how difficult it is to rent a property with pets. 'We told them they could have four dogs as there were kennels in the back. 'We advertised the house in a dog magazine and we were completely taken advantage of. They destroyed our home. 'We never dreamed it was their intention to breed dogs - at one point there were 14 here.' Bin bags were filled to the brim and then simply left on the carpet . Smeared: The front door and exterior walls were covered in mud, probably from the dogs . Discarded: A torn and stained mattress in a bedroom . A dismantled bed and what appears to be sawdust in one of the rooms . Mr Douville, 60, a taxi driver, questioned how the house was able to get into such a state as social services visited the property during the Roylances' stay. He said: 'What we can't understand is how the children lived in this house. I was disturbed to see the dogs lived there, let alone their kids. 'In all those months we were in contact with social services trying to get them out of the house they must have been living in pure squalor. 'We could never see inside because they had the curtains closed so when we finally gained access I was horrified. The smell, the dirt - it clings to your skin. Mess: The garden covered in dog faces and plastic sheeting. It is believed the dogs were being bred there . The front of the house was also strewn with waste, including a tyre and cardboard boxes full of rubbish . 'In the bathroom the clothes were piled up four foot high and in the utility room it was 18 inches deep in rubbish and dirt. I have literally been shoveling it out of the house. 'The kitchen is destroyed and chewed by dogs and the carpets are ruined. 'The boiler hasn't been serviced or used since 2010 so they were living without hot water and heating for all that time - no wonder it is in such a state.' He added: 'I can't believe social services went in and thought the place fit to live in. 'They paid rent up until January so we never thought it was a problem. When we saw Louisa out and about she would look presentable. 'Unbelievably social services said I was intimidating the children by going around and asking for rent money. 'I don't know how they said that with a straight face - what is intimidating is the Third-World squalor they have been living among.' Richard and Midge, who have seven grandchildren, now fear they might be forced to sell their own bungalow to repair the damage.","Tenants caused £8,000 in damage to the Lincolnshire property .

Ambition: Devout Christian Alan Gendreau is hoping to become the first gay professional football player in the NFL . The lack of gay role models in sport is an issue which still draws criticism and shame for teams around the world. However, one man is hoping to change all of that for the NFL by becoming the first gay professional football player. Devout Christian Alan Gendreau is now a free agent and is hoping to join a team as its kicker. Hailing from Florida, he was a kicking machine for the Middle Tennessee state's Blue Raiders. As a successful team member, the 5-foot, 10-inch athlete also felt accepted by his teammates. And he's now hoping to achieve the same thing on the biggest stage of all. Speaking to OutSports, as reported by the Huffington Post, he said: 'I just want people to know that you can still be who you are and the best you can be and still be gay. 'I want people to know that it is ok. That would be my biggest goal in doing all of this.' The kicker graduated last year and knows it would be difficult to get into the NFL this year. He is currently a free agent and only the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers are looking to draft a kicker this year. If and when he does make the NFL, however, Gendreau would be the first gay professional football player. He would also be the first professional player to enter the league openly gay. Talented: Alan Gendreau was previously a kicking machine for the Middle Tennessee state's Blue Raiders . It recently emerged that about four current football players are in talks to come out in the future. The NFL has met with gay rights groups recently to discuss policies to end homophobia and discrimination. It is likely that the first, openly gay football star will earn millions in endorsement deals.

Quit: Chris Huhne, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court today, as he announced he would resign as an MP having pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . Chris Huhne has today quit as an MP after he pleaded guilty to making his then wife take his speeding points so he would not be prosecuted. The former Energy Secretary had until this morning denied a single charge of perverting the course of justice, but now faces a likely jail sentence and the end of his political career. 'Having taken responsibility for something I did ten years ago, the only proper course of action for me is now to resign my Eastleigh seat in Parliament, which I will do very shortly', he said outside Southwark Crown Court. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he was 'shocked and saddened' by Huhne's conduct but had 'taken the right decision in resigning as an MP'. The disgraced politician called his party leader last night to warn him that he would now plead guilty and leave parliament. He faces between six and 12 months in prison, experts say. Vicky Pryce, 60, still denies the offence on the grounds of marital coercion, using archaic legislation to avoid conviction claiming Mr Huhne, 58, forced her to act on his behalf. Standing in the dock next to his ex-wife, Liberal Democrat Huhne asked to hear the charge against him again having denied it last week, but this time he replied 'guilty'. He 'should be under no illusion' about the type of sentence he faces, the judge said after his change of plea. Mr Justice Sweeney said: 'I'm going to grant you unconditional bail again. 'I will deal with your sentencing on a date to be notified. 'It is essential that you attend on that date and as Mr Kelsey-Fry has foreshadowed you should be under no illusion whatsoever as to the sort of sentence that you are likely to receive, understood?' Scroll down for video . Moment: A sketch from court today shows Chris Huhne next to his ex-wife Vicky Pryce in the dock at Southwark Crown Court as he told the judge he would now plead guilty as his partner Carina Trimingham (centre right) watched in the background . Trial: Lib Dem MP Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimmington arrive . at Southwark Court for the first day of his Trial today, where he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice . Scrum: Chris Huhne and his partner Carina Trimmington arrive at Southwark Crown Court for the first day of his trial, just before he made his shock guilty plea . Mrs Pryce is still going to face trial, which will start at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow. The couple separated after 26 years of marriage in 2010 after Mr Huhne admitted he was having an affair with his PR adviser Carina Trimingham, 46, who was in the public gallery. Months later the extraordinary allegations emerged in two Sunday newspapers provoking a firestorm of controversy. Huhne's departure from the Commons is the latest humiliation in a tumultuous fall from grace that began when allegations over the speeding penalty surfaced early in 2011. He was only narrowly beaten by Mr Clegg for the party leadership in 2007, and was still regarded by many as the Deputy Prime Minister's natural successor. Huhne received a severance payment of around £17,000 when he resigned from the Cabinet last February. However, Downing Street insisted today it was a matter for him whether he returned the money. Mr Huhne intends to voluntarily . remove himself from the Privy Council after pleading guilty to . perverting the course of justice, the Liberal Democrats said. In the past disgraced ministers such as Jonathan Aitken and John Profumo have also voluntarily given up their membership. Denial: Vicky Pryce, the ex-wife of Britain's former energy secretary Chris Huhne arrives at Southwark Crown Court today and denied the charge claiming her ex-husband forced her to take the points . Exit: Mr Huhne gets into a cab outside the court having admitted his guilt and his intention to resign as an MP with the judge warning he may face jail . Huhne's exit raises the prospect of a major coalition clash in the by-election for his Eastleigh seat. Chris Huhne’s guilty plea follows . months of legal wrangling in which the MP unsuccessfully tried to have . the case thrown out, it can now be revealed. The MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, who . announced his resignation on the steps outside Southwark Crown Court . following his dramatic admission, fought to get the charge dropped for . almost 12 months. His defence barrister John Kelsey-Fry QC had argued that the prosecution case was ‘gossamer thin’. Mr Kelsey-Fry had tried the stay the . proceedings as an abuse of the court process of the court, claiming . police investigations had not been ‘thorough, rigorous and . conscientious’. He also appealed to the judge to . consider the difficulties Huhne faced due to the passage of time, lack . of documents and negative publicity. He said Huhne could ‘not sensibly’ be expected to remember the events of 2003 and that key documents . ‘demonstrative to the truth in a fundamental respect of this case’ were . no longer available. The barrister described media . coverage in the wake of the allegations and in anticipation of a trial . as having been ‘extreme, prolonged and across all media forms’. Mr Justice Sweeney rejected the . applications to dismiss the charges saying it was his judgement that . ‘there is a case to answer’. The Lib Dem MP had a majority of 3,800 at the 2010 general election, but it is viewed as a key target seat for the Conservatives if they are to get an overall majority in 2015. There is also the prospect of UK Independence Party (Ukip) leader Nigel Farage making another run for Parliament. He previously stood unsuccessfully in the seat. Party sources said Ukip would be fielding a candidate in Eastleigh and Mr Farage would consider the situation, adding that the constituency was 'very close to his heart'. The Labour party played down the prospect of making any progress in the Eastleigh, pointing out it is 258th on its list of target seats. A source close to Ed Miliband said: ‘We recognise this is an uphill struggle but as a one-nation party we fight in every seat and campaign in every part of the country. We intend to campaign hard against both coalition parties."" 58-year-old Huhne strongly denied the claims when he was charged by prosecutors last February, and repeated the denials in court as recently as last week. Wearing a dark coat and green tie, the Liberal Democrat MP arrived arm in arm with his partner Carina Trimingham. Mr Huhne, who gave his constituency address in Eastleigh, Hampshire, to the court, stood down from the Cabinet last year to fight the charge. The events which led to the case date back to March 12, 2003 when Mr Huhne’s car was caught by a speed camera on the M11 near Stansted Airport. He was accused of trying to cheat justice by stating that Mrs Pryce was at the wheel instead of himself when the offence took place.Mrs Pryce, a former Government economics advisor, accepted the fine and three points on her licence. Mr Huhne is represented by John Kelsey-Fry QC, one of the country’s most sought after barristers whose clients have included Harry Redknapp and Steven Gerrard. The multi-millionaire politician is the owner of an extensive property portfolio, including homes in London and Oxford. Mother-of-five Mrs Pryce, of Clapham, south-west London, is represented by Julian Knowles QC, a member of the same chambers as Cherie Blair. The trial, overseen by Mr Justice Sweeney, was expected to last up to two weeks. Both defendants are on unconditional bail. Chris Huhne is one of the most ruthlessly ambitious politicians in Westminster, even in a world where modesty is a taboo. With multiple careers including journalist, economist, City high flyer, MEP, economist and cabinet minister, he considered himself infinitely better qualified for every job in Westminster. He used to joke that he would not take a junior job at the Treasury because they have plenty of economists ‘and some are even better than me’. Defiant until the end, even friends called him ‘rhino-hide Huhne’. But after two failed attempts, he hoped it would be third time lucky in his hopes of winning the Liberal Democrat leadership. Instead his luck ran out, and his political career lies in tatters. 1954 Born 2 July in west London to businessman father, Peter Ivor, and actress mother Ann. 1972 Gains a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford . 1977 Starts career as a journalist, working for The Economist, The Guardian, The Independent and The Independent on Sunday.

Ninety-one people including doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals have been charged with committing $430million in Medicare fraud in seven U.S. cities, Attorney General Eric Holder said on Thursday. An investigation coordinated by the U.S. Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services uprooted alleged false billing schemes involving $230million in home health services, over $100million in mental health services, and $49million from ambulance transportation. Charges range from healthcare fraud and conspiracy to wire fraud, kickback violations, identity theft and money laundering. The number and cost of the alleged fraud makes it the largest bust of its kind, Mr Holder said. Scroll down for video . Serious charges: Dr Robert Kolbusz in Chicago, left, and Dr Joseph Megwa of Dallas, right, were among those indicted for Medicare fraud . Health and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, second right, Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, second left, FBI Associate Director Kevin Perkins, right, and HHS Inspector General Daniel Levinson listen . Mr Holder . said in a news conference today that the case reveals an alarming trend . of criminal attempts to steal billions of taxpayer dollars for personal profit . The frequency with which Medicare fraud happens – and its scope – is alarming. The strike force team charged 107 doctors, nurses, and other licenced medical care professionals in May 2012 for schemes totalling more than $452million in false billing. There was another takedown by the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT) in 2011, involving 115 defendants in nine cities. They were charged with more than $240million in false billings, according to reports. The government has taken significant steps to prevent such fraud. For instance, the Obama administration’s Affordable Care Act has required several new requirements –such as teaching senior citizens to identify and report fraud, as well as putting in place fraud detection systems. The FBI names Medicare fraud between three and 10 per cent of all health care billings, according to independent website The Medicare Newsgroup. It is estimated by the organisation that fraud costs between $16billion-$55billion, part of the $590billion Medicare system. 'Today’s enforcement . actions reveal an alarming and unacceptable trend of individuals . attempting to exploit federal health care programs to steal billions in . taxpayer dollars for personal gain,' he said. Assistant Attorney Lanny A. Breuer agreed, adding: ‘Today’s coordinated actions represent one of the largest Medicare . fraud takedowns in Department of Justice history.’ He continued : ‘We have made it one of the Department’s missions to hold . accountable those who abuse the Medicare program for personal profit. Medicare . Fraud Strike Force operations targeted health care workers in seven . cities – Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los . Angeles, and Miami. According to Mr Holder, one doctor alone was writing 33,000 prescriptions for some 2,000 patients between 2006 and 2011. Dr Joseph Megwa, who practices in Dallas, allegedly signed off these documents without reviewing them, causing $103.3million in false billings. According to the Dallas Morning News, the 58-year-old’s alleged defrauding was the costliest. The doctor, who works at Raphem Medical Practice in Arlington, was indicted on conspiracy and health-fraud. The Justice Department alleges that he helped patients in their homes while he was instead travelling abroad. Bilked: Doctors, nurses and other medical professionals in seven different cities allegedly bilked $430million out of Medicare, the largest fraud of its kind . Two nurses, Ferguson Ikhile, and Ebolose Eghobor, were indicted along with the doctor. The three remain in federal custody. Similarly, dermatologist Dr Robert Kolbusz of Chicago was charged with falsely diagnosing his patients and billing Medicare for treatments that were not given, the Chicago Tribune reported. Seven individuals in Houston were . charged for giving kickbacks of cigarettes, coupons, and food to . Medicare recipients who would in turn just watch TV or play games . instead of receiving the services that were billed to Medicare. 'Today's enforcement actions reveal an alarming and unacceptable trend of individuals attempting to exploit federal health care programs to steal billions in taxpayer dollars for personal gain.' -Attorney General Eric Holder . It allegedly led to $158million in fraudulent billing. The announcement marks the latest case in a concerted crackdown against Medicare fraud by an inter-agency Medicare fraud strike force. In Miami alone, 33 suspects were arrested and charged with fraud of more than $200million, according to NBC Miami, though little else is known about those charged in the city. Mr . Breuer said that owners and . operators at one Miami psychiatric hospital gave cash kickbacks to . owners of assisted living facilities in order to obtain more patients. They then billed the social insurance . plan more than $67million, often for services that were never offered, . or patients they never actually had. Mr Breuer added that these 33 medical . professionals then billed Medicare for the cash they used as kickbacks . for their false patients. Mr . Holder condemned the fraud as one that ‘siphons precious taxpayer . resources, drives up heath care costs, and jeopardizes the strength . of the Medicare program.’ He added: ‘They also victimise the most vulnerable members of society, including elderly, disabled, and impoverished Americans.’ The . strike force was created under the healthcare reform law as a means of . curbing waste, fraud and abuse within the $590billion Medicare program . that provides healthcare benefits to nearly 50million elderly and . disabled beneficiaries.

"By . James Chapman . UPDATED: . 09:10 EST, 9 January 2012 . David Cameron is drawing up explosive plans to force an early referendum on Scottish independence. The Prime Minister is preparing to call the bluff of Scotland’s nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond by changing the law to allow him to go to the polls – but only if he dares to do so within the next 18 months. Mr Cameron said yesterday a referendum should be held ‘sooner rather than later’, adding: ‘I don’t think we should just let this go on year after year.’ But his move brought criticism from north of the border today when Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Cameron is 'seeking to interfere' with the democratic rights of the Scottish people by trying to impose conditions on the format and timing of an independence referendum. Call my bluff: Prime Minister David (left) could change the law to allow Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond (right) to hold a referendum . Amid growing alarm in London that support is inching upwards in Scotland for the break-up of the 300-year-old Union with England, the Government will publish legal advice this week suggesting a poll ordered by Holyrood could only be ‘consultative’. For the result to be legally binding on the UK government, Westminster will have to agree – though it would be unthinkable for Parliament simply to ignore a ‘yes’ vote. Mr Cameron is now planning to amend the law to allow a binding referendum, but within a fixed time period. The Government will also launch a consultation with the Scottish people on the wording of the referendum. A question of timing: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond wants to hold a referendum on the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, when he hopes nationalist feelings will be running high . The move is a huge gamble, which some . fear may backfire if Mr Salmond is able to claim Westminster is trying . to dictate to Holyrood. The Scottish leader is plotting to hold a referendum in 2014, to coincide with the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, Scotland’s most famous military victory over England, and the country’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, when he hopes nationalist sentiment will be at its peak. And speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish people had 'overwhelmingly' voted the SNP into power in Holyrood last year, returning the nationalist party with a majority. She said there was 'clarity' north of the border about the SNP commitment to hold the referendum in the second half of the Parliament. Reports suggest the Government in Westminster is considering offering the Scottish Parliament the chance to hold a legally binding referendum but only on the basis of a simple yes or no question and if it is held within a certain timeframe, thought to be 18 months. 'This is a blatant attempt to interfere in the decision that is really one for the Scottish Government in terms of the timing of the referendum and for the Scottish people in terms of the outcome. 'We were elected on the basis of our commitment to have a referendum in the second half of this parliamentary term. 'This is about Westminster seeking to interfere. Going it alone: Scottish MPs at Holyrood could run a legally binding referendum on whether to split from England . 'We said very clearly in the election . that our immediate priority if elected would be to seek to strengthen . the Scotland Bill, currently going through the Westminster Parliament, . to give the Scottish Parliament important economic job-creating powers, a . referendum on independence in the second half of this parliamentary . term.' Ms Sturgeon said 'most people' in . Scotland listening to Mr Cameron would only hear a London-based, . Tory-led Government trying to intervene on Scottish decision-making. The Scottish Nationalists also hope . voters will be angry after several years of spending cuts implemented by . an ‘English’ government. While . polls suggest a majority of Scots want to maintain the Union with . England, support for independence is creeping ever higher. There are . also fears that Mr Salmond wants to try to ‘rig’ the referendum with a . confusing question – probably offering more options than a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Voters could also . be given the choice of ‘devo max’, in which Scotland would be granted . much greater financial freedom but would remain within the UK. Mr . Cameron said yesterday: ‘The uncertainty about this issue I think is . damaging to Scotland and Scotland’s economy, because you have companies . and other organisations asking “well what’s Scotland’s future? Is it . within the United Kingdom or not?” That’s damaging.’ The . Prime Minister said the United Kingdom was ‘one of the most successful . partnerships in the history of the world’ and should be fought hard for. ‘It would be desperately . sad if Scotland chose to leave the United Kingdom and I will do . everything I can to encourage Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom . because I think that is the best for all our economies, Scotland . included, and all our societies,’ he said. ‘Let’s not drift apart. I think he . [Alex Salmond] knows the Scottish people at heart do not want a full . separation and so he is trying to create a situation where that bubbles . up and happens whereas I think we need some decisiveness so we can clear . up this issue. ‘I don’t think we should just let this go on year after year... My view is that sooner rather than later would be better.’ Government . sources suggested the new Scotland Bill, which is still making its way . through parliament, may be amended to allow Holyrood to run a legally . binding poll – but include a ‘sunset clause’ setting a time limit. Lib . Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, who represents a . Scottish seat at Westminster, said: ‘Scotland cannot afford – literally . cannot afford – a long period of dithering and delay from Alex Salmond, . because what that will cost is jobs and growth in the Scottish economy.’ A spokesman for Mr . Salmond said: ‘The Scottish Government achieved an overwhelming mandate . from the people of Scotland to hold the referendum in the second half of . this parliamentary term, and that is exactly what we will do.’ According . to the latest poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori last month, 38 per cent of . Scots now favour independence – three points up since the summer.","Change in law could make referendum binding - but only if held within a fixed time period .

Under pressure: Trade minister and former HSBC boss Stephen Green faced serious questions last night over an email and Ed Miliband says he should face Parliament . Trade minister Lord Green faced demands to explain to Parliament what he knew about money laundering at HSBC when he was chairman of Britain’s biggest bank. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the former bank boss must appear in the House of Lords to answer questions after documents came to light suggesting he was warned about money laundering when he ran HSBC. An email published as part of a US Senate probe confirmed that Lord Green was made aware of serious allegations of wrongdoing in January 2005 by HSBC’s former compliance chief, David Bagley. Mr Bagley, who quit on Tuesday, told Lord Green that staff in the bank’s Mexican subsidiary forged paperwork designed to help prevent money laundering. Mr Miliband said: ‘What happened at HSBC is shocking. Lord Green must come to the House of Lords and answer questions, frankly, about what he knew and when he knew it.’ On Wednesday, Labour failed in an attempt to force Lord Green to come to Parliament to answer questions. An urgent question tabled by Labour’s leader in the Lords, Baroness Royall, asking for a statement in the House of Lords about the Trade minister’s activities at HSBC, was rejected by Lords Speaker Baroness D’Souza. But Labour sources said that they would  try again. The Labour leader added claims of wrongdoing at the London-based banking giant, where the peer was chief executive and chairman before being brought into Downing Street by David Cameron in 2010, had 'appalled' people. Lord Green is facing pressure to quit . because he was chairman of Britain’s biggest bank when it was doing . business with drug gangs and banks linked to terrorism. Mr Miliband pointed out today that, although the Commons is now in recess, the House of Lords was still sitting so could grill him. Labour's leader in the second chamber was writing to her opposite number Lord Strathclyde insisting that Lord Green should come to face peers, he added. Mr Bagley has raised allegations that . ‘senior persons within the compliance function fabricated records of . certain mandatory anti-money laundering meetings’. The . forgeries were designed to hoodwink local regulators into believing the . division’s safeguards were stronger and more efficient than they were. Mr . Bagley also warned that HSBC’s American division had accepted . $2.9million (£1.8million) from clients in the military dictatorship of . Burma, in contravention of US sanctions. He said there was ‘little doubt’ that this breached sanctions and warned of a ‘significant risk of a financial penalty’. The email is censored, preventing disclosure of who the transaction was for. Lord . Green asked Mr Bagley on several occasions to investigate what measures . the bank’s subsidiaries were taking to prevent wrongdoing. But weakness in the bank’s oversight, particularly in its US and Mexican subsidiaries, persisted for years afterwards. Discovery: An email published as part of a US Senate probe confirms Lord Green was made aware of serious allegations of wrongdoing in January 2005 by former HSBC compliance chief, David Bagley . US regulators were so alarmed by HSBC’s inability to prevent money laundering that in October 2010 they ordered it to improve ‘multiple aspects’ of controls to prevent money laundering. HSBC has been linked to  terrorist organisations al-Qaeda, Hamas and the Taliban and is also accused of violating US sanctions on Burma, Cuba and Syria. Labour said Lord Green, who left HSBC in 2006 and is now one of Chancellor George Osborne’s closest advisers on banking, had ‘serious questions’ to answer. Chris Leslie, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, called on Lord Green to explain what he knew about the scandal, set to cost HSBC up to £640million in fines. He said: ‘Stephen Green . . . has serious questions to answer about what he knew and when.’ The wording of the statement is a pointed echo of Mr Osborne’s controversial comment that Labour’s Ed Balls had ‘serious questions to answer’ over the Libor rate-rigging scandal. A senior Downing Street source said David Cameron was standing by Lord Green. The source added: ‘There is no appetite for him to cease being a trade minister.’","Labour leader says although Commons in recess Lord Green should be hauled in front of the Lords .

When a couple were asked to look after their next-door neighbour’s cat, they were only too happy to oblige. Nigel Gibbs, 66, and wife Marjorie, 67, helpfully cleared mouldy food from the fridge, emptied the cat litter and even did some vacuuming as well. But when former soldier Sean Tierney, 66, returned to his home in Llandudno, Wales, he was livid – convinced they were interfering. Lucky to survive: Line dancer Nigel Gibbs (left) and his houseproud wife Marjorie (right) were stabbed in a Rambo-style revenge attack by a crazed pensioner who went berserk because they had cleaned his flat . And when he heard Mr Gibbs using a . power saw to do some DIY outside the apartment block, he went berserk. Armed with a combat knife, Tierney confronted Mr Gibbs and told him: . ‘I’m going to teach you a lesson’ before stabbing him in the chest. As Mr Gibbs, a keen line dancer, tried . to escape, Tierney burst into his home, stabbing Mrs Gibbs several . times as she called emergency services for help. Tierney, who was said . to have ‘staring eyes like a zombie in a film’, shouted ‘Die m***** . ******!’ as the operator listened, powerless to help. The devoted couple who had just moved to the Welsh seaside town after living in California for 15 years were rushed to hospital fighting for life and were said to be lucky to survive the attack. Later when Tierney was arrested and interviewed, he told police how he had been 'wound up' by Mr Gibbs who was nicknamed 'Tex' by friends due to his stint in the U.S. He told officers: 'It had to happen, he won't give up creating problems for me, mechanically sawing deliberately without informing me of all the noise, so he's just a wind up, so he had to go.' 'Like a zombie': Former soldierSean Tierney was furious when hefouind out the couple had thrown some mouldy food from his fridge, emptied the cat litter and vacuumed his house . Today, as Tierney began a life sentence after admitting attempted murder, Mr and Mrs Gibbs who have since quit their home vowed to put the attack behind them by telling one another every day how they much loved each other. 'We are both positive people and wish to put the incident behind us, but the attack has affected our confidence,' they said in a statement. 'We would not like Sean Tierney to be able to inflict such pain on any other person and we will not let him ruin our lives. We both feel lucky to be alive.' The couple who have been together for 46 years were said to have been a 'caring and lovely' couple who often helped their neighbours with gardening and housework. Mr Gibbs formerly of Oswestry, Shropshire worked as a salesman for a telecoms company in Saudi Arabia before moving with his wife to California in 1986. He worked for a car firm in Newport Beach and later at garage door company in Los Angeles. It is believed he retired in 1990 and the couple returned to the UK in February last year and moved into the flat in Ffordd Dulyn, Llandudno. Initially the couple were friends with Tierney who lived in the flat above but trouble began in August last year after they agreed to look after his cat while he went away to an air show and he returned to find his home had been tidied. Mold Crown Court was told Tierney, who was dismissed from the military when he was in his 20s, had 'got it into his head that his neighbours were interfering or changing his way of life.' and 'snapped'. Mr Gibbs was using the power saw outside the apartment block when Tierney suddenly put the combat knife to his face and told him: 'I'm going to teach you a lesson' before he stabbed him in the chest. He tried to flee the attack but Tierney then aimed for Mrs Gibbs's throat as she was inside her flat calling for help. She put her right arm up to protect herself described how she almost lost her hand. She escaped by jumping out of a bedroom window and was bleeding profusely from the wounds to the chest, wrist and abdomen. After the attack Tierney left a phone . message for a friend in which he told how he had 'just killed those two . bastards downstairs' before being arrested by armed police following an . hour long siege of his flat. Mrs Gibbs is still awaiting further surgery, and said her life will never be the same again. Screamed for her life: Mrs Gibbs was repeatedly stabbed by Tierney as she dialled 999 for help . She had three stab wounds to her right breast, one to her abdomen, a very deep wound to her right wrist and a wound to the thumb. She underwent emergency surgery on her liver and a major wound which went through her diaphragm and penetrated the chest and lung. In a victim impact statement the couple said loved socialising, especially square or line dancing and had planned to take up ballroom dancing. But since the knife attack Mrs Gibbs had not regained the movement in her right hand. She told how she had a visible deep scar across the wrist and took 20 tablets a day for the pain. She was conscious of the scars she had all over her body, from the actual knife wounds and the surgical intervention which saved her life. 'Every day I feel the pain and the trauma of the stabbing,' she said. 'I had always been such a strong person but I am now living on my nerves.' She is now unable to wash her hair herself, dress, walk or dance. She struggled to sleep and sometimes witnessed her husband having nightmares. Scene: Tierney went berserk after returning to his house (red door, far right) to find the couple had cleaned . The couple had recently moved to the Welsh town of Llandudno after living in the U.S. for 15 years . Her husband said that he suffered nightmares and flashbacks and relived being stabbed and running for his life. Mr Gibbs who suffered a badly damaged right lung was not able to walk upstairs without losing his breath and they could no longer go dancing. It had affected his confidence and he was now more introverted. He had suffered a lung infection at Christmas and annual lung capacity tests showed that his lungs had deteriorated by some 20%. Their lives had changed dramatically and he was now constantly looking after his wife, who had been severely affected. He suffered nightmares and flashbacks and relived being stabbed and running for his life. Tierney must serve a minimum of 15 years before being considered for parole. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC told him: 'You destroyed your victims' lives. 'They will never regain the happy days that they had been enjoying in their retirement until these dreadful events'. Nigel and Marjorie Gibbs enjoyed an active social life in California, where they lived for 15 years . The couple have since quit their home in North Wales following the brutal attack by neighbour Sean Tierney . After the case, Det Insp Iestyn Davies of North Wales Police said: 'Sean Tierney stabbed Mr and Mrs Gibbs for no apparent reason and it is due to their strength and determination, together with the skill of the medical staff that they have survived. 'Tierney armed himself with a combat knife with the intention to kill Nigel and Marjorie and very nearly achieved his aim. At the time of the attack one neighbour Wendy Jones, 44, said: 'They are such lovely . people who were out to help anybody. They have done so much for me and this is so sad. 'We are all just in shock about what has happened. I have cerebral palsy and cannot drive so they have given me lifts and just recently took me to buy a digital camera because I was going on holiday to visit a friend. 'They have also cooked meals for me when I have been feeling low, they have done so much. They really looked out for me and other people on the estate, they are very caring people.

"Norfolk coroner William Armstrong . recorded Ms Creegan was unlawfully killed and Mr Didier committed suicide . By . Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 09:19 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:28 EST, 29 January 2013 . Inquest: American John Didier killed his partner Annette Creegan, then spent a week on board a river cruiser with her daughter before drowning himself . An NHS worker killed his partner in a planned attack then spent a week on board a river cruiser with her daughter before drowning himself, an inquest has heard. The body of hospice nurse Annette Creegan, 49, was found naked, strangled and weighted down in the River Bure on the Norfolk Broads last September following a major police search. The body of her partner, John Didier, 41, was found nearby and evidence suggests he drowned himself by tying dumbbells to his limbs and jumping overboard, the inquest at Norwich Coroner's Court heard. A search was launched after a river worker alerted police on September 1 to the discovery of Ms Creegan's 13-year-old daughter alone on a boat moored near isolated Salhouse Broad. When she was interviewed, the girl said they had arrived for a holiday on the Broads on August 25 and the following day she woke to find her mother was not there. Detective Constable Christina Stone told the inquest: 'They had moored the boat at about 5.30pm on the Friday. 'The following day she woke up and Mr Didier told her that Annette had left. 'She had no access to a mobile telephone and no means of getting off the boat so stayed there over the following days. 'Six days later she woke up and there was no sign of Mr Didier and she was rescued by a passing Broads ranger.' Ms Creegan's elderly mother and two brothers attended the inquest along with Mr Didier's brother and sister-in-law who travelled from his homeland in the US. The inquest heard Mr Didier's body was found later on September 1. He had drowned and was found immersed in water, weighted down with two 17.5kg dumbbells tied to his feet and two 15kg weights tied to his wrists, pathologist Ben Swift said. Ms Creegan's body was found in the water nearby the following afternoon. Mr Swift said she was naked and her hands had been tied behind her knees with cable ties. She was weighted down with a 30kg dumbbell and had been strangled. The decomposed state of the body suggested she had been in the water for about a week. Bruises to her fists suggested she had tried to fight off Mr Didier but there was no evidence of sexual abuse. Investigation: Police examine the Broads pleasure boat involved in the tragedy at Horning in Norfolk in September . Clues: Detectives investigating the deaths of a couple on the Norfolk Broads took a large amount of evidence from the boat where Didier spent a week after killing his partner . Investigation: Police are believed to have removed a blood stained sheet, lengths of cable and cable ties from the boat discovered tied up to a tree last September . Reliving the moment he found the girl alone, Broads Authority ranger Andrew Ellson said he noticed the boat moored in the secluded spot several days earlier. He was returning from a routine patrol when he decided to approach it. He said: 'The curtains were closed and the motor was running. I knocked on the side of the boat and the window opened. I saw a young girl who told me she was by herself.' Detective Inspector Gary Bloomfield said a thorough investigation was carried out. He added: 'I'm confident in saying John Didier had killed Annette and then taken his own life a number of days later. 'It seems he had in some way planned the events of that week. 'There was no evidence he was mentally impaired and it was a deliberate decision to kill Annette then drown himself.' Probe: Police also searched Ms Creegan's home in Mitcham, Surrey, as part of the investigation . Outside the inquest, he added that officers had found no evidence of any tension in the relationship and Mr Didier's motive remained unclear. On the night of her mother's death, the girl slept undisturbed and did not hear any argument. The boat was not locked but was surrounded by marsh and woodland with no footpaths so she felt unable to leave. There was no evidence she or Mr Didier left the boat following Ms Creegan's death and no one else had been on board. The family hired the Le Boat cruiser from nearby Horning and were familiar with the area from previous holidays. They had stocked up on food and the girl was fed throughout the week. It is thought Mr Didier bought the weights and cable ties with the intention of murdering Ms Creegan before leaving Surrey, Mr Bloomfield said. Mystery: Police guard the scene on the Norfolk Broads between Wroxham and Salhouse where the pleasure boat was found . Norfolk coroner William Armstrong recorded a verdict that Ms Creegan died as a result of unlawful killing, probably on August 25. He recorded a verdict that Mr Didier committed suicide on either August 31 or September 1. He added: 'What a grotesque irony that this happened in the idyllic setting of the Norfolk Broads - what a contrast between the calm serenity of the waters and this dreadful tragedy.' Ms Creegan, born in Balham, worked as a community nurse for the Trinity Hospice charity in Clapham Common, south-west London, while Mr Didier, originally from Kettering, Ohio, had worked in IT for the NHS but was unemployed at the time. Afterwards, Mr Bloomfield said: 'I hope that today's inquest has answered some of the questions about what happened on Salhouse Broad and we continue to offer the family support at this difficult time. 'I would also like to offer my condolences to the family of John Didier.' Both families declined to comment as they left the inquest. The girl is being cared for by family.","John Didier, 41, killed nurse Annette Creegan, 49, before committing suicide .

'At the time we wondered what had happened because on Sunday police were out on the street.' Today Lancashire Police said officers wanted to trace the injured man's movements between 2.30am, when he left Vogue nightclub, in Rawtenstall and 3.30am when he arrived at the suspect's house a few streets away. Lancashire Police, who received a phone call at 3.36am, said it was not yet clear if the injured man had slipped or been pushed. He was treated at the scene by paramedics before being taken to the Royal Salford Hospital with head injuries where he was in a critical condition yesterday. An investigation is under way and officers are trying to piece together what happened. Det Insp Vinny De Curtis of Lancashire Police said: 'We are investigating the possibility that this man may have gone into the address mistakenly, thinking it was a different house. Hurt: The clubber is in a critical condition in Royal Salford Hospital (pictured) after falling down a flight of stairs at the property . 'We are trying to piece together his movements leading up to his arrival there to try and establish exactly what has happened. 'We believe that the man was in Vogue nightclub in the town up until around 2:30am and we are trying to piece together his movements between leaving the club and arriving at the house on South Street. 'He was wearing a short sleeved white T-shirt, burgundy chinos and grey shoes when he was last seen at the nightclub so if anyone was in the area between 2.30am and 3.30am and thinks they may have seen him, or someone fitting that description, then I would urge them to contact the police.'

Punishment: Village elders who shaved a teenage girl's head after she was kidnapped because she'd made herself 'too attractive' Village elders who shaved a teenage girl's head after she was kidnapped by her uncle as his new bride have told police in central India their punishment was fair because she'd made herself 'too attractive'. The 18-year-old girl had been snatched while she was shopping in Chikhla, Madhya Pradesh state, and elders say they cut off her hair to make her 'less of a temptation.' The girl was subjected to the hair cutting ritual in front of the elders despite pleading with them and telling them that her uncle had kidnapped her from the village market. Whilst the girl protested - the men in the crowd shouted insults at the 18-year-old. Her 53-year-old uncle who is married with two children of his own was forced to walk around the village wearing a garland of shoes, a sign of disrespect in India and a 'grinding stone' attached to his chest as his punishment. The police confirmed that in total 16 elders are being investigated for being part of the group who gave out the 'punishment' to the girl. Thirteen of those have been arrested and the other three are still being searched for by the police. A police spokesman said: ""We are investigating an alleged assault. 'A number of people have been arrested and we are still tracking others down. We are treating this allegation of assault very seriously and will then decide what action to take.' Police only intervened when they were . tipped off after the girl's family spoke out against the so called . 'panchayat' punishments - - a form of 'tribal government' - which choose . elders  from the local community to govern the community. Investigation: 16 elders are being investigated for being part of the group who gave out the 'punishment' to the girl. Thirteen of those have been arrested . However many villagers protested yesterday against the police investigation in front of the Superintendent of Police, claiming the villagers action is justified as it is 'tradition'. Traditionally in some Indian regions these panchayat assemblies settled disputes between individuals and villages, and in many often remote areas the tradition lives on. In some cases the Panchayat's decision is even legally binding and cannot be overturned.","The 18-year-old girl was snatched while shopping in Madhya Pradesh .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 06:00 EST, 27 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 27 December 2012 . Mystery: Codebreaker Gareth Williams was found dead in his London flat in August 2010 . The MI6 codebreaker who was found dead inside a holdall probably locked himself inside the bag, according to police. An inquest into the death of Gareth Williams found that he could have been the victim of foul play, as the coroner expressed doubts that he could have locked the bag himself. However, Scotland Yard detectives investigating the case discovered that it is possible to lock the type of holdall he was found in from the inside, and now say it is likely that no one else was involved in Mr Williams' death. The body of the codebreaker, who was on secondment to MI6 from GCHQ, was discovered in a bathtub in his flat in Pimlico, central London, in August 2010. Coroner Fiona Wilcox ruled earlier this year that it was unlikely Mr Williams could have locked himself into the red North Face holdall which contained his body and whose keys were also locked inside the bag. Experts testified that they had tried to lock themselves inside the bag more than 400 times, and said even famed escapologist Harry Houdini would have had difficulty doing so. But just a few days after Dr Wilcox delivered her verdict, a retired sergeant revealed that the feat was in fact possible, casting doubt on the assertion that someone else must have been involved in Mr Williams' death. Police refined the experiment to mirror the exact way the bag had been locked - and agreed that Mr Williams could have secured the holdall himself, according to the Daily Telegraph. In addition, detectives do not believe there is any evidence of forced entry which could suggest that the codebreaker was murdered. Locked: Mr Williams' body was found inside a red North Face holdall similar to this one . 'They have been unable to find any trace of anyone who should not have been in the flat and every reason to believe that Gareth may have climbed into the bag himself and been unable to get out,' an inquiry source told the Telegraph. Police are now apparently planning to inform the coroner of their belief that Mr Williams died alone. Dr Wilcox initially dismissed the idea that the spy could have been the victim of 'auto-erotic activity' - but detectives say there is no other plausible explanation for his death. The mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Williams' death sparked speculation that he could have been assassinated by the security services. His MI6 colleagues did not report him missing for a week, and failed to hand over key evidence from their office, which raised the possibility that they could have been involved in a cover-up. Investigation: Police have denied that foul play was responsible for the codebreaker's death . However, others pointed to an apparent interest in bondage and cross-dressing as a more likely explanation for his death. Mr Williams was once found by his landlord tied to his own bed wearing only underwear, while he apparently kept £20,000 worth of women's clothes in his flat. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police declined to confirm the detectives' latest findings, saying: 'This remains an active investigation and officers continue to explore a number of lines of inquiry. 'Officers retain an open mind in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Williams.'","Investigation finds Gareth Williams could have locked himself in bag .

"Attacks have topped national agenda since gang rape of Delhi student . By . Jill Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 07:38 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 23 April 2013 . Insight: Rtunjya Gujral says that curfews, personal guards and daily fear are now part of women's lives in her homeland . A 14-year-old blogger has spoken about the impact a recent string of rape attacks have had on the lives of Indian girls. Rtunjya Gujral, who lives in Gurgaon, near Delhi, says that curfews, personal guards and daily fear are now part of women's lives in her homeland. Sexual assaults in India have been increasing for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda. The brutal attack sparked outrage about the treatment of women in the country and has made females more aware of the danger they face. 'The women of Delhi once used to be . independent and free. But since the fatal gang rape case in December, I . see insecurity and fear in everyone,' Rtunjya explains. 'I know people who have since placed . curfew hours for their daughters, and some have even appointed . bodyguards for their security, even my own father,' she wrote on a blog for NDTV. She explained that the guard appointed by her father . accompanies her everywhere including when her mother drops and picks her up from school and when she is meeting her friends. 'Even though I want my independence back, I am scared to go out alone without one of my parents,' explains Rtunjya. Sexual crimes against women and children are reported every day in Indian newspapers, and women often complain about feeling insecure when they leave their homes. 'On numerous occasions, I have caught . grown men staring at me, making me extremely uncomfortable, and I . wouldn't know what to do about it, so I was left with no choice but to . avert my eyes,' Rtunjya says. Anger: Indian schoolchildren and teachers shout slogans as they carry placards during a demonstration against the rape of a five-year old girl . Attack: Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack . Rape is the one of the most common crimes against Indian women. So common, in fact that there is a euphemism coined for the public sexual molestation of women. In reference to the biblical 'Eve', 'Eve teasing' implies that women are responsible for the behaviour of their attackers. Rape victims rarely press charges because of social stigma and fear they will be accused of inviting the attack. Many women say they structure their lives around protecting themselves and their daughters from attack. New Delhi is the rape capital of India with a rape reported on average every 18 hours. Government data show the number of reported rape cases in the country rose by nearly 17 percent between 2007 and 2011. The teenager says she found out about the Delhi gang rape victim when she was having dinner with her family. 'I was shocked out of my wits. I didn't know someone could do something that barbaric to anyone.' After the 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist died in December from injuries sustained during the rape, several well-known figures in India caused outrage by suggesting it was her fault. Rtunjya says the ignorant comments 'angered me to no limits.' She explains that when she asked her mother how anyone could be so heartless, she replied 'Yeh India hai, beta. Nobody cares here.' Last week a five-year-old girl was raped and tortured before being left for dead in New Delhi - one of two suspects appeared in court today accused of the heinous crime. 'When I heard what that man did to her, I started crying. I was disgusted, how could anyone do that to such a small child?' asks Rtunjya. An 11-year-old girl is also being treated at the same hospital, having suffered serious internal injuries when she was gang-raped last August. Rtunjya is concerned that the media circus which is currently surrounding the rape of the child will die down soon and violence against females will continue. Since the  bus gang-rape incident dozens of rapes cases in India - against both Indian women and tourists have been highlighted. The attack forced India to confront the reality that sexually-assaulted women are often blamed for the crime, forcing them to keep quiet and discouraging them from reporting it to authorities for fear of exposing their families to ridicule. Activists say passing new, strong laws is not . enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice . system crack down on crimes against women. Change: Activists say passing new, strong laws is not enough, and that the government must ensure that police and the justice system crack down on crimes against women. Publicity: Rape has been a problem in India for many years, but the fatal gang rape of a woman on a New Delhi bus has pushed the issue to the top of the national agenda . Clashes: Police have been criticised for using heavy handed tactics against demonstrators who are demanding better protection of women following the brutal bus gang rape . Women face daily harassment across . India, ranging from catcalls on the streets, groping and touching in . public transport, to rape.

During the doldrums of the football year, the Miami Dolphins cheer squad has taken upon itself to spread joy and goodwill among football fans, with a video of themselves miming a cheesy pop song. The video comes after last year's 'cover' of Carly Rae Jepsen's 'Call Me Maybe', during which the bikini-clad cheer squad mimed along to the song wearing, well, not much really.

It remains to be seen whether other cheer squads will pick up the gauntlet thrown down by the plucky Dolphins and Saints cheer ladies this year. It's also unclear whether or not the cheerleaders had convened to decide on this year's cover or if both teams just have impeccable taste in music.

A mother jailed for life over the death of her toddler son sobbed as appeal judges finally ordered her freedom today. Kimberley Hainey, 38, had been told yesterday that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Edinburgh was ready to overturn her conviction for murder. But that left judges with a problem - because Hainey had also been given a seven year prison sentence for trying to cover up the murder, a charge which included the words 'being conscious of your guilt.' Kimberley Hainey (right), 38, has had her conviction for murdering her toddler son Declan (left) quashed by appeal judges . Authorities said the Declan's body was mummified when it was discovered in March 2010 when he would have been 23 months old . The legal conundrum was solved today . when defence QC Edward Targowski asked permission to lodge a late appeal . against the charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Advocate depute Andrew Miller replied: . 'The Crown does not oppose receipt of an additional ground of appeal in . relation to charge two and does not seek to resist the ground of . appeal.' Judge Lord Clarke said this was 'a proper exercise of your discretion.' He then told Hainey that in the circumstances the cover-up charge was also quashed, as well as the murder charge. A trial at the High Court in Glasgow . at the end of 2011 heard how the mummified body of little Declan Hainey . was found in a squalid flat in Bruce Road Paisley.

Hainey's trial heard the toddler was left on his own in wet and dirty nappies at his home while his mother went out drinking with friends or stayed at her boyfriend's house for days at a time . The six-week trial at the end of 2011 heard how Hainey had kept family, neighbours and social services at arms' length, not allowing them to get close to the little boy . By the time doctors were able to examine the tot, it was impossible to tell how he died. Hainey was found guilty, by majority, . of wilfully ill-treating and neglecting him, failing to provide him with . food and drink and failing to seek medical attention. The charge alleged that Hainey had 'by . other means to the prosecutor unknown, caused unnecessary suffering and . injury to the health of said Declan Hainey, whereby he died and you did . murder him.' 'The court has come to the conclusion . that the conviction of the Appellant (Hainey) of the murder of her baby . son, Declan... must be quashed.' Lord Clarke . Hainey came to the Court of Criminal .

A climber and his faithful dog have perished in Arizona after they appear to have been attacked by killer bees as he scaled a cliff. Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says that 55-year-old Steven Johnson, a counselor with some 30 years experience hiking and climbing was found dead, hanging 70-feet from the ground in his climbing gear in the Santa Rita Mountains on Monday night. The cause of death has not been determined yet, but officials said that Johnson was covered in bee stings when he was found while his dead dog was discovered at the top of the cliff. The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says 55-year-old Steven Johnson (pictured) was found in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson late Monday . Johnson was last seen Friday when he went hiking, and friends became worried when he didn't go to work on Monday. Sheriff's Lt. Raoul Rodriguez says Johnson may have disturbed bees by hammering a spike into the cliff. Search and rescue teams found both Johnson and his dog dead in the Santa Rita Mountains on Monday night . Rodriguez of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office . said the 55-year-old man was found hanging from his climbing gear on a . cliff near Mount Hopkins . 'He had anchored himself to the wall as . he was going down so he was actually anchored and he must have been . attacked and was not able to climb back up or go back down,' said Rodriguez. He said Johnson's dog had also been attacked by bees and was found dead nearby. Johnson is described as a father, climber and friend, who was well-liked throughout the climbing community in Southern Arizona. 'It's devastating news for the Tucson community, for sure, he was a very prolific climber in Tucson,' said John Mavko, who works at Rocks & Ropes, a climbing facility that was frequented by Johnson. Deputies of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Department and its search and rescue unit found Johnson’s body Monday at 6:30 p.m.. The Pima County Medical Examiner’s Office will conduct an autopsy on Wednesday to determine the cause of his death. Killer bees have become a problem in the south west of the country, especially in cities like Phoenix and Tuscson which have programs to destroy them for public safety. However, despite their fearsome reputation, Dr. May Berenbaum, a professor and department head at the University of Illinois' Department of Entomology and one of the country's leading bee experts said that public information is the key to limiting fatalities. 'When bees sting, it's always in defense. They're not cruising the neighborhood to make trouble,' said Berenbaum. 'They're not kamikaze, intent on their own destruction. They sting if they perceive a threat on their own home.' However, Berenbaum's description of an African bee attack to ABC News makes for disturbing reading. Once stung, the bee releases a pheromone that attracts other bees to attack - which is why most African bee attacks are in swarms.

A video posted on the Facebook page of a British-trained doctor appears to show victims of a Syrian regime assault on Aleppo foaming at the mouth and showing symptoms consistent with a chemical weapons attack. Experts believe that chemical weapons may have been dropped on Kurdish residents of Aleppo's Sheikh Massoud region during an attack which saw two babies and a woman killed earlier this month. It is thought that the April 13 assault may have been in revenge for residents' decision to defect to support the rebels. Scroll down for video .

Revenge: Syrian rebel fighters standing amid sandbags in a damaged section of the Umayyad Mosque complex. It's thought the April 13 assault was in retaliation for Kurdish backing of the rebels . VIDEO: WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Claims that the regime has regularly used banned materials against rebels were also made by Israeli general, Brigadier General Itai Brun, according to the Daily Telegraph. The video was posted on the Facebook page of British-trained doctor Niazi Habash, who treated some of the Aleppo victims. He said that they displayed symptoms of chemical exposure including foaming at the mouth, constricted pupils and difficulty breathing. Warning: President Bashar al-Assad had been warned by Western leaders that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line' They were treated using chemical weapons antidote Atropine, Dr Habash claims. Experts claim that their injuries appear to be similar to those suffered by victims of an attack on Khan al-Assad, near Aleppo. In the April 13 assault, 15 people were injured. Four-month-old Yehia, 18-month-old Abu Bakr Younis and adult Ghadeer Neddaf all died from their injuries. The most likely chemical to have been used is sarin according to former British Army specialist and director Hamish de Bretton-Gordon. He told the Telegraph: From what we've seen and the descriptions of the containers being dropped from the air, it certainly seems that the regime is using sarin in an unprepared state in these attacks. 'But, as in the Tokyo subway bombings, sarin does not need to be weaponised and placed in missiles to kill. 'It is still lethal when people are exposed to it.' US President Barack Obama and Western leaders had warned Bashar al-Assad that using chemical weapons would be crossing a 'red line'. But the latest claim that such weapons have been deployed by the regime is the fourth in recent months. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last week that a soil sample taken from Khan al-Assad had tested positive for a chemical agent.

Mr Hague said that the UK will try and tear up an EU arms embargo next month so that weapons can be supplied to Syrian rebels and said that both Britain and France want to be able to 'take urgent action' should future atrocities take place. The UK will send 34 vehicles, including five armoured 4x4s and 20 sets of body armour to those seeking to overthrow dictator Bashar al-Assad. But critics warned that arming the rebels will be especially problematic because many opposition groups have been hijacked by Al Qaeda supporters. The Obama administration opposes directly arming Syrian opposition fighters, in part out of fear that the weapons could fall into the hands of Islamic extremists. And Syria's president al-Assad warned the West will pay a price 'in the heart' of Europe and the U.S. for their alleged backing Islamic fundamentalists in his country's civil war. Deadly: Three people, including two children are said to have been killed in the attack on April 13, 15 more were injured . The European Union's security chief has also warned today that young Europeans fighting alongside rebels to bring down President Assad, will be 'radicalised' and could pose a 'serious threat' to national security when they return home. It is feared some will become members of groups with links to al-Qaeda before launching terror attacks at home. Syria is thought by the CIA to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons and both the rebels and Assad's regime have accused each other of using them. Fears have grown in recent months for the safety of the stockpile, thought to include sarin and mustard gas that can be deployed using aircraft, ballistic missiles and artillery rocket. It is also believed that Syria has attempted to develop more toxic nerve agents. Sarin is a more sophisticated successor to Zyklon B which was used by the Nazis in the extermination of millions of Jews in Hitler's death camps. It is like some farm pesticides but does not occur naturally and cannot occur naturally. Saddam Hussein used it in the late 80s against Kurdish rebels and it was behind the death of the entire population of Halabja. United Nations agents destroy chemical weapons stockpiled by Saddam Hussein in 1998 . It is so toxic that a drop the size of a pin prick is enough to kill and it is heavier than air so it hovers close to the ground maximising casualties. Fumes from the colourless, odourless liquid last longer the warmer the environment so the constant 25°C on Tokyo's subway provided the perfect condition. Sarin attacks the vegal nervous system and victims die within minutes either through respiratory failure or a heart attack as they choke on their own mucus or saliva.","The video was posted on Facebook by British-trained doctor Niazi Habash .

Barred: The popular black cat plays with staff at the Stratford sorting office, but bosses want the animal out . A stray cat adopted by posties is to be evicted because Royal Mail bosses believe it breaches health and safety guidelines to have an animal on the premises. The black Tom has visited Stratford-upon-Avon's sorting office every day for the past five years, putting a smile on the . faces of staff - just like Postman Pat and his beloved companion . Jess. He has been adopted by 100 staff but is facing a workplace ban after managers ruled he was a risk, adding it was not 'ideal' having a cat around . Royal Mail staff have fed and cared for him since 2008 and say the feline, who they just call 'Cat', has become part of the team. Almost 1,000 people have joined a Facebook group called 'Save Our Cat' in less than a week, and inspired on Twitter, with . #savethestratfordcat trending. A postman who has worked there for 13 years, who wanted to remain anonymous 'because we could probably lose our jobs for this', said: 'We can't see the reason why he has to go because he doesn't harm anyone. It's pathetic. It is a pointless exercise, why are they trying to do it?' Another worker, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'The area manager came in and said ""the cat has to go for health and safety reasons"". 'We are all angry and upset. It is health and safety gone mad. The cat does not do anything wrong. Everyone has a bond with the cat. He is part of the team and the furniture, he has done five years service. He is ours. He gets lots of fuss and cuddles and has even got its own ball and stash of food'. Friend: The cat, known as 'Cat', is shown here on the sorting office's steps, but he is about to be rehoused . A third staff member added: 'He has been there longer than most of the managers so how can they possibly demand its eviction? He does not get in anyone's way or cause problems, it just sits around. He's here when we open up at 3.30am and he's usually the last to leave at night. 'We are in uproar. It is our cat. It is ludicrous'. Postwoman San Smith posted on the Facebook page: 'Save the Cat, he was with me through my interview in the chair beside me, please save the cat :)' Alexander Gibbons, who works at the sorting office, said: 'Postman Pat has a cat on delivery. Together, we will save this poor b*****. Look how cute he is! :)' Kerry Bambridge, another postal worker, said: 'Save our cat! If it makes a difference ill get the tipex out so he's white too and call him Jess!' (sic) Relaxed: The popular cat has visited every day for the past five years, and eats and sleeps on the premises as the postal workers love him . Cherylyn Pitcher said: 'It's never Postman Pat without Jess', while Sharon Brown posted: #Come on fellas, we can do this, beat the royal mail nd save the cat' (sic). Royal Mail confirmed they were looking for a sanctuary that would take in 'Cat' and a transport cage appeared at the depot earlier this week. A Royal Mail spokesman said: 'Although this stray cat has become a . regular visitor to the good natured postmen and women in our sorting . office, we will be speaking to a local animal welfare charity to find a . suitable permanent loving home for the stray.' Sad: Despite a campaign by staff and local people, bosses are said to have brought this cat transporter in, ready to move the stray cat on . Home: The cat wanders in freely but Royal Mail want it stopped and the cat moved on as soon as possible . But the employees think the owner lives nearby the depot and say it would be wrong for Royal Mail to re-home the helpless puss. 'We gave him a collar but it was taken off. We tried to find a home for him but he has never wanted to go home,' another said. Local people have condemned Royal Mail with many saying 'shame on them' over the red-tape madness. Kado Crocker said: 'What a shame that H/S are getting rid of this cat. Don't they know he could keep vermin down.

"By . Sean O'hare . PUBLISHED: . 12:33 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:23 EST, 12 April 2013 . Zuckerberg has launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research . Teaming up with other Silicon Valley leaders, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has formally launched a political group aimed at revamping immigration policy, boosting education and encouraging investment in scientific research. Zuckerberg announced the formation of Fwd.us (pronounced 'forward us') in an op-ed article in The Washington Post yesterday. In it, he said the U.S. needs a new approach to these issues if it is to get ahead economically. This, he wrote, includes offering talented, skilled immigrants a path to citizenship. 'We have a strange immigration policy for a nation of immigrants, Zuckerberg wrote. 'And it's a policy unfit for today's world.' The move comes as a bipartisan Senate group is expected to roll out on a comprehensive immigration bill in the coming days. Zuckerberg's goal echoes the proposed legislation. He said he wants 'comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.' Of Jewish extraction, Zuckerberg's interest in immigration stems from the fact that his own great-grandparents arrived as immigrants via Ellis Island, to America, coupled with his experience teaching entrepreneurship at an after-school program. In the article, he explained how his students put together business plans, made their products and got an opportunity to sell them. 'My great-grandparents came through Ellis Island. 'My grandfathers were a mailman and a police officer. 'My parents are doctors. I started a company. 'None of this could have happened without a welcoming immigration policy, a great education system and the world’s leading scientific community that created the Internet' During this period he asked one of his students, whose family are from Mexico, what he wanted to go on to do do. He responded that he wasn’t sure that he’d be able to go to college because he didn't have any immigration documentation. Zuckerberg found that many students in his community were in the same situation; they moved to the United States so early in their lives that they have no memories of living anywhere else - yet couldn't progress through the education system. At the top of the Fwd.us website it explains in bite-sized facts just why immigration is important to the future of America and reminds users that: '40 per cent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children' and that '57% of engineering grad students are immigrants. Many will have to leave if we don’t pass comprehensive immigration reform.' Zuckerberg also calls for higher standards and accountability in schools and increased focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and maths. Today's knowledge and ideas-based economy, the 28-year-old Harvard dropout wrote, is very different from the economy of the 20th century that was based on natural resources, industrial machines and labour. Fwd.us, Zuckerberg said, was created 'to build . the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, . innovation and investment'. Screen grab of the Fwd.us website . ● Comprehensive immigration reform that begins with effective border security, allows a path to citizenship and lets us attract the most talented and hardest-working people, no matter where they were born.● Higher standards and accountability in schools, support for good teachers and a much greater focus on learning about science, technology, engineering and math.● Investment in breakthrough discoveries in scientific research and assurance that the benefits of the inventions belong to the public and not just to the few. Fwd.us, he said, was created 'to build the knowledge economy the United States needs to ensure more jobs, innovation and investment.' Also backing the group are tech leaders such as LinkedIn Corp.

A Tempest Is brewing in Shakespeare’s hometown after a historic building at the cottage where his wife spent her childhood was turned into a snack kiosk. The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, responsible for the upkeep of the cottage, gutted the Grade I listed thatched barn earlier this year without planning permission. The barn in Shottery, Stratford was used as a pea shed in the early part of the last century until it was converted into a snack kiosk and cafe for tourists in April. The thatched building, pictured, is part of the Grade I listing but the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust claim they did not realise it had the classification which required building consent . Shakespeare's wife: A barn on the farmhouse site, pictured, where Anne Hathaway lived as a child was converted into a snack kiosk without proper planning permission . But an investigation into the building work has revealed that the trust, who is responsible for the upkeep of the Shakespeare houses in and around Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, failed to apply for planning permission to change the use of the barn. The site of the cottage which includes the barn in question was where Ms Hathaway lived as a child and where Shakespeare courted his future bride. 'New information': The barn, which was used as a pea shed in the early part of the 20th century, became a snack kiosk, pictured, in April. A trust spokesman said the Grade I listing was 'new information' Council request: After failing to apply for planning permission, the trust has been requested by Stratford District Council to apply for retrospective planning permission, which if refused will mean the building, pictured with new renovations, will have to be returned to its original state . Part of the site: The barn, pictured, is considered inside the site of the 12-bedroom cottage, which was built in the early 1460s, and so Grade I listed . Roy Steele, programme manager for the trust, said today that the shed was converted because they did not know it was Grade I listed. He said: ‘We have been requested, in effect, to put things right by putting in a retrospective planning application. ‘The fact the pea shed was Grade I listed was new information. ‘The shed is not a Tudor building and was probably erected sometime in the first half of the 20th century. ‘In April, we were confident that we wouldn’t need a planning application.’ Shakespeare, right, is believed to have courted his future wife Ms Hathaway, left, at the historic farmhouse . But it was revealed that the trust violated planning laws when Stratford District Council informed them that because the shed was inside the site of the 12-bedroom cottage which was built in the early 1460s and so part of the curtilage listing. This meant it was subject to the same strict planning restrictions as Grade I listed properties. The Grade I classification means the building is of exceptional interest, sometimes even considered to be internationally important. While the grade does not mean the building cannot be altered, it does require building consent within government planning guidance. The council ordered the trust to apply for retrospective planning permission. The trust has until November 5 to make a final application before the matter goes before the council’s planning committee. If the council rejects the application, the trust may be forced to transform the shed back to its original condition. A spokeswoman said: ‘If the claimant loses their planning application the council could force them to convert the building back to its original state before the building work took place.’ The plans: When the trust did the planned renovations, pictured, they were 'confident' they did not need planning permission. They now have until November 5 to make a final application for retrospective planning permission . Anne Hathaway lived in the farmhouse in Shottery, Stratford as a child and it is believed that Shakespeare courted her there. She married him in November 1582. It is believed that at the time of their marriage, Ms Hathaway was 26-years-old and pregnant and Shakespeare was just 18-years-old. It appears that the couple conceived the child out of wedlock and so rushed to get married despite the fact that marriages were not traditionally performed at that time of the year. Some historians speculate that the marriage was an unhappy one and that the couple were forced together by the pregnancy. She had two daughters and one son. Six months after their marriage, their first daughter Susanna was born. Twins Hamnet and Judith followed in 1585 but Hamnet died when just 11-years-old. Four years later, Shakespeare wrote Hamlet, a play which has been suggested to have been inspired by his grief at loosing his only son. It has been claimed that one of Shakespeare's sonnets, number 145, makes reference to Ms Hathaway with the words 'hate away' as a possible pun on 'Hathaway' and another line: 'And saved my life', in Elizabethan pronunciation, would have been indistinguishable in pronunciation from 'Anne saved my life'. Ms Hathaway died in 1623, aged 67-years-old, and is buried next to Shakespeare's grave inside Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon.","The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust gutted a Grade I listed barn on the site of Anne Hathaway's cottage without proper planning permission .

NHS Trust boss Phil Morley was happy to shed his dignity for an office exercise campaign video, swapping his suit and tie for a Superman costume. But his good intentions backfired when footage showing him warming to his new role was leaked on to the internet. Scroll down for video . Phil Morley, chief executive of Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has been ridiculed for taking part in a staff video which sees him don a . Superman outfit and dance to Is This The Way To Amarillo? What was meant to be a light-hearted stunt to encourage staff to take care of their own health, as well as that of patients, has sparked a fierce online backlash after it was leaked on the internet . The £175,000-a-year hospital chief . executive was shown dancing through the corridors to Is This The Way To . Amarillo dressed in a headband and blue superhero suit, complete with . red cape. The three-minute video, described by . NHS staff as 'patronising' and 'embarrassing', was intended only for the . trust's employees, but the film was uploaded to YouTube. As a result Mr Morley, head of Hull . and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, has been the subject of an . online backlash and branded an 'out of touch egomaniac'. The video begins with a 'stressed' Mr Morley at his desk, wearing a shirt and tie, trying to answer several phones at once. After taking a call on a mobile phone . bearing the Superman 'S', he spins around in his chair and turns into an . overweight version of the comic book hero. He starts to sing and wave his arms to . the Tony Christie hit and leads smiling staff in a dance down the . office corridors and stairs. Mr Morley's stunt has been likened to The Office's cringeworthy David Brent, played by Ricky Gevais, dancing at the office Christmas party . Mr Morley's trust is currently having to make savings of £100 million and has already made 250 people redundant - it was previously criticised for sending three bosses on a £5,500 week-long trip to the U.S. The film, made to promote Workout at Work Day last Wednesday, shows Mr Morley juggling tasks and answering calls at his office as captions ask 'Busy? Tired? Tense? Aches? Pains?' The short film was made to promote . Workout At Work Day last Wednesday, but the chief executive was slammed . online for 'suggesting chair dancing and chair exercises are what is . needed to improve morale and reduce stress'. Comments included: 'What an idiot! Is . this what our taxes are being used for?' Another said: 'There's . something seriously wrong with this man … being paid £100k and more to . be an idiot.' One disgruntled NHS employee wrote: . 'Cannot believe he thought this was a good idea, staff morale at its . lowest, people having to reapply for jobs, understaffed wards, need I go . on. Get in the real world and stop patronising the hardworking . workforce.' The video then shows him spin round in his chair and magically transform into Superman - complete with Lycra outfit and bright red boots - before Is This The Way to Amarillo? starts to play . He is then seen dancing around the hospital with other members of staff. Mr Morley has defended the video saying it was designed to encourage staff to think about keeping fit while working . And another labelled his performance 'painfully cringey, embarrassing and degrading'. The trust stressed that the video took 15 minutes to film and was made internally, at no extra cost. Mr Morley said he was asked by the physiotherapy team to help promote the campaign. It aims to encourage workers to be more active to combat stress and avoid problems such as back pain. He said: 'The idea was to create . something quirky and memorable to encourage staff to think about how . they can keep themselves fit and healthy while at work and I felt it was . a worthwhile project to be involved with. 'Whether people loved the event or . hated it, the health and wellbeing of trust staff is vital to us as an . organisation and to our patients, which is why we are keen to invest . both time and effort in this area.'

A couple who spent a decade trying for a baby and endured seven stillbirths and miscarriages have finally had a healthy baby girl. Last year Sara Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch and baby Mabel was born in April. Despite being born three months prematurely, she has now been able to go home. Mrs Sills, 39, from Skellgate, North . Yorkshire, said: ‘My husband Chris and I call Mabel our ""rainbow baby” because after riding a . hard storm, there is always a rainbow, so she is definitely a miracle . and she means the world to us all.’ Sara and Chris Sills, both 39, went through seven miscarriages and stillbirths over a period of ten years before Mabel was born in April this year . Over the past ten years, Mrs Sills tried time and again to successfully carry a baby, but faced the agony of losing each of her seven babies - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda. Each of these pregnancies only survived up to 24 weeks so the couple faced a desperate wait to see if Mabel would survive. Mrs Sills, a former nursery nurse, said: ‘I didn't know anything about stillbirths and miscarriages until we went through it. ‘I would be fine and then sometimes I would have bleeds and sudden pains and my waters would just go. ‘I would then be in labour for weeks where I was prone to infection, and it proved too much for all of the babies. After her seventh miscarriage, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch which strengthened her cervix enough to enable her to carry Mabel . Mabel was born three months prematurely weighing just 1lb 6oz and spent the first two months of her life in hospital . ‘Nothing can prepare you for a stillbirth. It's the silence that is the worst part. ‘Knowing you have been through a pregnancy, means you expect to have a baby at the end of it. You can't explain how hard it is. ‘Watching Chris was the hardest part because there was nothing he could do.’ Mr and Mrs Sills were already parents to Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10, but felt they should keep trying for a fourth baby. ‘We always wanted a big family. We wanted four children and so we thought it was something we were meant to do so kept trying,’ said Mrs Sills. Mr and Mrs Sills say that they call Mabel their 'rainbow baby' because 'after riding a hard storm, there is always a rainbow' When Mrs Sills was carrying Mabel she was put on bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital in an attempt to stop her waters breaking too early but she still went into labour when only 25 weeks pregnant . ‘At first we decided not to try again but then we just couldn't. Some people think it's strange that we kept trying but if we hadn't we wouldn't have Mabel here today.’ Despite having a normal birth with Stefan, both Katie and Lily were born prematurely but went on to become healthy children. After . the series of miscarriages, Mrs Sills was fitted with a cervical stitch, a procedure known as a tracheloplasty, which helps to strengthen the cervix and helps prevent . premature labour. She . said: ‘I was put on pure bed-rest at Sheffield Children's Hospital and . spent most of my pregnancy there in the hope it would stop my waters . breaking. ‘I went into labour with Mabel at 25 . weeks but I managed to hold on to her for another two weeks and she was . born by caesarean section. The couple, who also have three older children - Stefan, 19, Katie, 13, and Lily, 10 - were desperate to have a fourth baby because they had always wanted to have a big family . They say they will always remember the seven children they lost - Samuel, Nathaniel, Emmanuel, Ruben, Gabriel, Rose and Matilda. Mabel is pictured with her sisters, Lily, 10, (left) and Katie, 13, (right) ‘Mabel was delivered in a sack of fluid which was popped when she was born to make the birth less traumatic.’ She was born in April, weighing 1lb 6oz, however the family's fight was not over yet. Mr Sills, 39, a training consultant, said: ‘We spent weeks by her bedside, praying that she was going to survive. ‘The . fact that she had been born alive was a step forward for us and we . weren't prepared to let her go after all we had been through. ‘We . watched parents taking their babies home every day and we just dreamed . of the day we could take Mabel home. I think we always worried it would . never come.’ Now back at home, the family say they will never forget the seven members they lost. Mr and Mrs Sills say that on each of the stillborn children's birthdays they will light a candle to remember them . Mrs Sills said: ‘We will always remember our other children. We are always talking about them - it's healthy for the children. ‘We have special boxes and teddies that we have bought for each of them and on their birthdays we will light a candle to remember them by. ‘We buy them all cards and balloons which we let off into the sky as a way of reaching out to them, and at Christmas we put their decorations on the tree to remember them by. ‘A baby is still a baby, which I carried and won't forget just because they're not with us today. ‘We would not wish anyone to have to go through what we have been through, but we are pleased we kept trying. ‘She's a little miracle and we will never take forget how lucky we are.’","Sara and Chris Sills, both 39, from Yorkshire lost 7 babies over a decade .

Doctors say that if he had not landed on the roof of an adjacent building - which prevented him falling a further two storeys - they have no doubt he would have been killed. Mr Stilwell, who is on a working holiday in New Zealand, fell from a neighbour's 15th storey balcony in an impossible attempt to lower himself to the balcony of his own apartment on the 14th floor. He had found he was locked out of his high rise apartment and decided to ask his upstairs neighbour if he could go onto her balcony and drop down to his own. The neighbour, Geraldine Bautista, 28, said Mr Stilwell, who was 'a little bit tipsy', woke her up at two o'clock in the morning. 'I wasn't scared of him,' she told the New Zealand Herald. 'He just requested ""Can you please let me jump off from the balcony. I will not bother you, just let me use your balcony."" 'I never thought he would really do . that. In my mind I thought ""OK, I'll just let you see that it's really . impossible."" I didn't think he'd jump because it's really scary.'

But Mr Stilwell was determined to . jump - as she soon found out. He walked through Miss Bautista's flat and . out onto her balcony, which is about 3ft wide and before she could . react he had one leg over the railing. 'I . asked him ""Are you all right? It's unsafe to jump over the rail. He . never said anything…I grabbed his hand and then at that time he fell . down. 'I . thought I was dreaming. It happened so fast; it happened in seconds. I . couldn't even scream for help. He was like a paper falling from here.' 'He . can't remember anything about the fall,' said Mr Thomas, who spoke to . his friend briefly yesterday. 'He's a very lucky man.' Mr Thomas said the two of them had been on a night out with fellow travellers when Mr Stilwell became separated from them and went home alone. 'He'd had a fair bit to drink,' said Mr Thomas, 'but I was only 10 to 15 minutes behind him when I headed home.' He recalled that when he and a third flatmate reached the front door of their apartment block they were met by police searching for identification for the seriously injured man. 'This isn't typical behaviour of him,' said Mr Thomas. 'He's normally the sensible one out of all of us.' Medical experts are astonished at Mr Stilwell's survival. St John medical director Dr Tony Smith said survival from such a great height was 'extraordinary'. Party game: Tom Stilwell, pictured right with a friend on a night out, suffered a broken neck, back and wrist . 'We've seen patients in Auckland who have had their falls broken by awnings over windows, umbrellas, those sorts of things,' he said. 'But the roof this young man fell on to would not have prevented serious injury. From that sort of height you can have injuries to everything and anything. Survival from falls of that height are extraordinarily unusual.' Being under the influence of alcohol would not have relaxed the body to the point that serious injury would not occur, said Dr Smith. 'It's like being in a car crash. If you're going to hit something at speed, relaxed or not is not going to make much difference.' Mr Stilwell's friends said they have been told by doctors that if he continues to make progress he might be able to leave hospital in about a week to 10 days.

The driver (not pictured) had a three-piece inflatable penile implant fitted by surgeon Dr. Thomas J. Desperito . A jury on Monday cleared a doctor of negligence in a lawsuit filed by a Delaware truck driver who underwent a penile implant procedure and ended up with an erection that lasted eight months. 'We're stunned,' attorney Michael Heyden said as he left the New Castle County courthouse, where his client Daniel Metzgar, 44, of Newark, was suing urologist Thomas Desperito of Wilmington, Delaware. In April 2010, four months after the procedure was performed, Metzgar experienced swelling and went to a hospital, where he underwent testing. Before going to the hospital, Metzgar had been unable to reach Dr Desperito. The doctor's lawyer argued that hospital staff who performed tests were unfamiliar with penile implants and were not properly trained to do them. Therefore, the results from the tests, including images showing swelling, did not prove negligence. Metzgar and his attorney during the one-week trial described the frequent discomfort and daily embarrassment he experienced after the procedure - including trouble riding a motorcycle, wearing normal clothes and joining family social events. 'I could hardly dance, with an erection poking my partner,' Metzgar told jurors at the start of the trial. 'It's not something you want to bring out at parties and show to friends.' Metzgar's stepson Alexander King, 18, described a once close relationship that grew distant after the procedure. King felt uncomfortable having friends over and noticed his stepfather stopped showing up at school and sporting events. 'I was - I'm sorry - highly embarrassed,' he testified during the trial. The device was ultimately removed in 2010 after tubing punctured Metzgar's scrotum. He received a replacement implant from another doctor. The prosthesis was eventually removed in August 2010, after tubing from the device punctured his scrotum during a family trip to Niagara Falls . The surgical implant most often used involves an inflatable device; two cylinders are placed in the penile tissue and these are connected to a pump in the scrotum. When a man wants to have sex, he squeezes the pump in the scrotum and the cylinders are filled with fluid kept in a reservoir in the abdomen. Penile implants can be: . Penile implants are not usually available on the NHS and inflatable implants are typically expensive. The doctor's lawyer, Colleen Shields,  Shields, acting for the . doctor, had told the court how that her client advised the patient to have the . prosthesis removed after he complained of an infection and that . the erection wasn’t going down, four months after the implant was . fitted. Ms Shields claims that despite the warning, Mr Metzgar did not act for months following the April 2010 visit. A penile implant is an inflatable device consisting of two fluid-filled cylinders which are surgically inserted into the penis and connected to a separate reservoir of fluid, and a pump which lies under the skin of the scrotum. The mechanical pump is squeezed to push fluid up the cylinders and, once full, the penis becomes rigid — a process that takes between five and ten seconds. The erection remains until the deflate button is pressed. A penile implant can be used as  a long-term solution for men with severe erectile dysfunction problems caused by a wide range of conditions including diabetes, prostate cancer surgery, Peyronie's disease and age-related vascular disease. Metzgar had no comment on the jury verdict. Ms Shields, said, 'We think the jury reached the appropriate verdict'","Daniel Metzgar, 44, had the surgical procedure in 2009 but claimed it was botched in a medical malpractice lawsuit .

Junk food manufacturers are still bypassing rules on advertising unhealthy products to children and fueling the UK's obesity epidemic, a new report has claimed. The World Health Organisation has called for tighter regulations after it said that attempts to crack down on children being targeted by TV advertising by British regulators have fallen short. Although there are tough rules protecting youngsters from being targeted by such advertising during children's TV programmes, there are no restrictions on shows such as ITV's Britain's Got Talent and the X Factor. Vulnerable: Despite a crackdown by regulators, children are still being targeted by junk food marketing, according to the World Health Organisation (file picture) Research shows that those programmes are widely enjoyed by young viewers. Youngsters are also increasingly being targeted on social media websites, through mobile phones or through 'advergames' on food company websites. According to The Guardian, the WHO calls for further regulations to be put in place across Europe to stop children being targeted by marketing promoting foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt. Zsuzsanna Jakab, regional director of WHO Europe, said: 'Policy must simply catch up and address the reality of an obese childhood in the 21st century. 'Children are surrounded by adverts urging them to consume high fat, high sugar, high salt foods, even when they are in places where they should be protected, such as schools and sports facilities.' Only five countries in Europe - Denmark, France, Norway, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden - have fully implemented EU rules on restricting marketing to children but the UK has done more than many nations. Popular with children: Although there are advertising restrictions preventing certain types of adverts during children's television programmes, there are no rules relating to shows such as Britain's Got Talent . Broadcasting regulator Ofcom has said that junk food advertising during children's television programmes dropped by almost 40 per cent between 2005 and 2009. There has been an increase in junk food advertising at other times of the day, however. But cutting out television advertising does not go far enough to protect young people, says the report. In 2009, online advertising overtook television advertising in the UK and with two thirds of five to seven year olds and 85 per cent of eight to 11 year olds accessing the web through home computers, they are susceptible to seeing junk food adverts. Many food companies are now said to be developing websites that appeal to children and feature games advertising their products and there is no restriction on the use of cartoon characters such as Kellogg's Tony the Tiger to promote products.","World Health Organisation calls for tighter regulations to be introduced .

The Big Bang theory was coined in the 40s - but physicists still puzzle over whether it even happened. Frederick Hoyle, the astronomer and physicist who coined the term, 'Big Bang,' much preferred the idea that the universe might have existed forever. Now two mathematicians claim to have 'proved' that it didn't - it might not have an end, but the universe definitely had a beginning. Big Bang? Two mathematicians argue that although the universe may NOT have an end, it definitely did have a beginning - and they have the maths to prove it . The universe IS expanding - so it can't simply have 'sat still' forever. But some mathematicians thought it perhaps worked on a 'cycle' The future might be eternal, but the past is not, claim the mathematicians from Tufts University. 'One of the most basic questions in cosmology is whether the universe had a beginning or has simply existed forever,' say  mathematicians Audrey Mithani, Alexander Vilenkin. 'It was addressed in the singularity theorems of Penrose and Hawking, with the conclusion that the initial singularity is not avoidable.' The universe IS expanding, which fits with the theory of an 'initial singularity' - an infinitely dense object that exploded into the Big Bang. This is measurable from Earth - and so the universe can't simply have 'sat still' since the beginning of time. However, three theories allow the universe to expand without requiring a 'beginning'. 'There are, however, three popular scenarios which circumvent these theorems: eternal inflation, a cyclic universe, and an 'emergent' universe which exists for eternity as a static seed before expanding,' say Mithani and Vilenkin. The pair mathemtacially analysed the three scenarios and found that eternity cannot exist in our expanding universe. There WAS a beginning, whether or not it was the Big Bang. 'We have addressed three scenarios which seemed to oer a way to avoid a beginning,and have found that none of them can actually be eternal in the past,' say Mithani and Vilenkin. Put simply, the future could be eternal, but the past cannot. Albert Einstein: He was right about the expansion of the universe . Of the three 'theories' of an eternal universe, the mathematicians say, 'Two of these scenarios are geodesically incomplete to the past, and thus cannot describe a universe without a beginning. The third, although it is stable with respect to classical perturbations, can collapse quantum mechanically, and therefore cannot have an eternal past.' 'Mithani and Vilenkin point to a proof dating from 2003 that these kind of past trajectories cannot be infinite if they are part of a universe that expands in a specific way. They go on to show that cyclical universes and universes of eternal inflation both expand in this way. So they cannot be eternal in the past and must therefore have had a beginning,' says MIT's Technological Review, which reported the research. The expansion of our universe seems to bear the signs of a Big Bang-type event, in the form of 'waves' seen in galaxies. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are . clumped together into walls and filaments, with giant voids between. These structures grew out of subtle variations in density in the early . universe, which bore the imprint of “baryon acoustic oscillations” -- . pressure-driven acoustic (sound) waves that passed through the early . universe. Billions of years later, the record of these sound waves can still be read in our universe. ‘Because . of the regularity of the ancient sound waves, there’s a slightly . increased probability that any two galaxies today will be separated by . about 500 million light-years, rather than 400 million or 600 million,’ said Eisenstein. In a graph . of the number of galaxy pairs by separation distance, that magic number . of 500 million light-years shows up as a peak, so astronomers often . speak of the ‘peak separation’. The position of this peak depends on the . amount of dark energy in the universe. But measuring the distance . between galaxies depends critically on having the right distances to the . galaxies in the first place.","Three theories of 'eternal' universe all wrong claim mathematicians .
