"McDonald's has paid out $700,000 to members of the Muslim community after one of its franchise restaurants in Michigan falsely advertised its food had been prepared according to Islamic dietary laws. A Muslim Detroit resident, Ahmed Ahmed, claimed he bought a chicken sandwich in . September 2011 at a Dearborn McDonald's but found it was not halal - . meaning it did not meet Islamic requirements for preparing food. The restaurant is one of two in Dearborn which sells halal products to cater for an area with one of the nation's largest Arab and Muslim communities. Settlement: A Muslim customer claimed he was served a non-halal meal at this McDonald's in Ford Road, Dearborn, Michigan, where they advertise halal Chicken McNuggest and McChicken sandwiches . Mr Ahmed then approached lawyer Kassem Dakhlallah who together conducted an investigation before launching a class-action lawsuit on the ground the franchise sold non-halal food 'on many occasions'. McDonald's and Finley's Management agreed to the tentative $700,000 (Â£442,000) settlement, with the money to be shared by Mr Ahmed, a Detroit health clinic, the Arab American National Museum in Dearborn and lawyers. Ahmed's attorney, Mr Dakhlallah, said that he is 'thrilled' with the preliminary deal that's expected to be finalised on March 1. Halal approved: Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches are two of the dishes served at the Detroit restaurant that are advertised as being halal . McDonald's and Finley's Management deny any liability but say the settlement is in their best interests. The Detroit area is home to about 150,000 Muslims of many different ethnicities and the two McDonald's branches advertise that they . exclusively sell halal Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches. Islam dietary guidelines state that meat must be prepared in a certain way before it can be eaten. Allah's name must be pronounced over the meat as thanks during the slaughter process, which can only be done with a swift incision to the animal's throat. The animal must then be allowed to drain of blood as it is considered harmful for humans to consume. The animal must never see another being slaughtered nor can it see the blade being sharpened. Halal literally means 'permissable' in Arabic and is used to describe types of actions that are acceptable under Islamic law. So when referring to food, Halal meat means food that has been prepared in accordance with the laws of Islam. They have to get those products from an approved halal provider where God's name has been invoked before an animal providing meat for . consumption is slaughtered. He said there was no evidence of . problems on the production side, but Mr Dakhallah alleges that the . Dearborn location on Ford Road sold non-approved products when it ran . out of halal. Mr Dakhlallah said he was approached by Mr Ahmed over the issue, and they conducted an investigation. A . letter sent to McDonald's and Finley's Management by Mr Dakhlallah's . firm said Mr Ahmed had 'confirmed from a source familiar with the . inventory' that the restaurant had sold non-halal food 'on many . occasions'. After they . received no response to the letter, Mr Dakhlallah said, they filed a . lawsuit in Wayne County Circuit Court in November 2011 as part of a . class action. In the . settlement notice, Finley's Management said it 'has a carefully designed . system for preparing and serving halal such that halal chicken products . are labelled, stored, refrigerated, and cooked in halal-only areas'. The company added it trains its employees on preparing halal food and 'requires strict adherence to the process'. He said although Mr Ahmed believes McDonald's was negligent, there was no evidence that the chain set out to deceive customers. 'McDonald's from the very beginning stepped up and took this case very seriously,' Mr Dakhlallah said. 'They made it clear they wanted to resolve this. They got ahead of the problem.'","Two McDonald's restaurants in Detroit advertise halal Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches .

"A grandfather died as he saved his 15-month-old grandson's life by stopping him falling to the bottom of a 30ft well. Duan Shuyo, 59, grabbed hold of youngster Lu as he plunged through a crack in the ground during a night-time walk and rescued him with his dying breath. He died while stuck holding the toddler but continued to hold him in his 'death grip'. Rescuers pull the body of Duan Suuyo free after he died while stopping his grandson from falling through a well . The grandfather grabbed the youngster by the shoulders as he slipped down but was pulled in to the gap and became wedged .

They had gone for a stroll near the family home in Shenzhuang, Henan province, central China, to cool off from the 35 degree temperatures. As they were walking, Lu slipped into the gap next to the well. His grandfather grabbed hold of the boy by his shoulders and was then pulled into the hole head first until his chest was wedged in the gap. Lu, who is just 15-months-old, was finally rescued after a night of being trapped in the gap . The little boy survived with only a minor scratches and bruises and now recovering with his parents . Paramedics believe he had died of a heart attack in the night during the ordeal. However, a muscle spasm and rigor mortis meant that he still held onto the boy. Police say Lu survived the fall with minor cuts and bruises and is now recovering with his parents. 'His grandfather literally saved him with his dying breath,' said one.

Oceanside Police Chief Frank McCoy says Seau's girlfriend reported finding him unconscious with a gunshot wound to the chest Wednesday. McCoy says lifesaving efforts were unsuccessful. Dozens of people were seen gathering outside Seau's home as news of his death spread. Families showed up with flowers and fans wearing Chargers jerseys waited to hear more news. At one point, his anguished mother Luisa Seau came outside to speak to reporters and fans. With tears streaming down her face, she cried: 'Take me, not my son - but it is too late... I don't understand ... I'm shocked.' Overcome: Junior Seau's shaken mother Luisa cried out and had to be held by family members after she learned of her son's death . Sportsman: Seau played in the NFL for 20 seasons with three teams: The San Diego Chargers, left, Miami Dolphins, right, and New England Patriots . The NFL has reached a $765 million settlement in August over concussion-related brain injuries among its 18,000 retired players, agreeing to compensate victims, pay for medical exams and underwrite research. Plaintiffs included Junior Seau (pictured here with George W Bush), who suffered from CTE . Why Seau decided to take his own life is a mystery to those who new him best - especially his mother, who said that he gave her no indication of a problem when she spoke to him by phone earlier this week. 'He's joking to me, he called me ""a homegirl,""' she said. His ex-wife told U-T San Diego that he had texted her and each of their three children 'I love you' on Tuesday night. Tiaina Baul 'Junior' Seau was born on January 19, 1969 in American Samoa. After his family moved to Oceanside, California, Seau excelled in both football and track and field at Oceanside High School.

"While the true meaning of Christmas is often lost among the festivities, youâd expect a government tree to bear some relevance to the occasion. But no ornament can be seen with the word âChristmasâ, âJesusâ, his picture or a nativity scene on the 63ft Sierra White Fir outside the U.S. Capitol. However what is easy for people to view standing near the tree's base in Washington D.C. is an ornament with the phrase: âI love President Obamaâ.

The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the tree and told Cybercast News Service there is no policy or restrictions on themes or ornaments. But it could not confirm whether there are any ornaments about Christmas or Christ - or any other elected officials in addition to Barack Obama. Congress has decorated a Christmas tree outside the Capitol every year since 1964 and it has been cut down from a National Forest since 1968.

The tree has one ornament referencing Psalm 19 with the words âMore precious than Goldâ, but this does not directly reference Christmas. Other ornaments include tributes to Disneyland, Hollywood and the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, reported Cybercast News Service.

"Using a robotic arm equipped with a camera, archaeologists have found human bone boxes and an inscription that reads 'Divine Jehovah, raise up, raise up' in a 1st Century Christian burial chamber beneath a tower block in Jerusalem. They believe that this is proof the site is the final resting place of Jesus. However, other scholars remain highly sceptical of the find. The inscription is on a limestone box known as an ossuarie - with another such box carrying a drawing of a fish with a stick figure in its mouth which is believed to refer to the story of Jonah and the Whale - one of the very first biblical stories. Discovery: A fish is carved upon the lid of the 1st century burial tomb which archaeologists believe proves they have located the resting place of Jesus . Development: The tower block built above the tomb complex after its discovery in the 1980s . The find is 200ft away from an earlier discovery known as the Jesus Family Tomb, which caused a huge amount of controversy after it was uncovered in the 1980s. Archaeologists then claimed it contained ossuaries inscribed with names associated with Jesus's family. That discovery sprouted amazing theories including one that maintained Jesus had been buried there alongside Mary Magdalene who he had married and raised a family with. However many leading theologians and archaeologists rubbished such claims as being completely unfounded. The Jesus Family Tomb was only . examined briefly before protests by Orthodox Jews, concerned about the . disturbance of a grave site, ended the excavation. It was then sealed up, and a tower block built over it. However . James Tabor, a scriptural scholar at the University of North Carolina . at Charlotte and documentary filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici were determined . to continue the research. The . pair obtained permission from the Israeli government in 2010 to use the . robotic arm to drill holes allowing them to explore the surrounding . area. This led to the discovery of a . separate chamber which they named the 'Patio Tomb', as it sits almost . directly below the patio of the building. It was inside the Patio Tomb that they found the inscriptions. The . pair claim the inscriptions discovered inside the patio tomb greatly . increase the likelihood that the 'Jesus Family Tomb' is indeed, the . resting place of Jesus. Lettering: The four line inscription in Greek has been translated as 'Divine Jehovah, raise up, raise up' Magic moment: The team uses a remote control camera attached to this robotic arm to probe into the burial chamber . They argue believe both tombs are part of the same complex which may have been the property of Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to the gospels, buried Jesus. One of the limestone ossuaries carries a Greek inscription calling on God to 'rise up' or 'raise up' someone. Another shows the image of a fish with a stick figure in its mouth which Tabor has suggested could represent the prophet Jonah. Mr Tabor said: 'This inscription has . something to do with resurrection of the dead, either of the deceased in . the ossuary, or perhaps, given the Jonah image nearby, an expression of . faith in Jesus' resurrection. Belief: Dr James Tabor is certain the inscription has something to do with resurrection of the dead . In the earliest gospel materials the 'sign of Jonah,' as mentioned by Jesus, has been interpreted as a symbol of his resurrection. Jonah images in later 'early' Christian art, such as images found in the Roman catacombs, are the most common motif found on tombs as a symbol of Christian resurrection hope. In contrast, the story of Jonah is not depicted in any first century Jewish art and iconographic images on ossuaries are extremely rare, given the prohibition within Judaism of making images of people or animals. The tomb in question is dated prior to 70 CE, when ossuary use in Jerusalem ceased due to the Roman destruction of the city. If the markings are Christian, the engravings represent the earliest archaeological record of Christians ever found. So the engravings were most likely made by some of Jesus' earliest followers, within decades of his death, predating the writing of the gospels. 'If anyone had claimed to find either . a statement about resurrection or a Jonah image in a Jewish tomb of . this period I would have said impossible -- until now,' Tabor said. 'Our . team was in a kind of ecstatic disbelief, but the evidence was clearly . before our eyes, causing us to revise our prior assumptions.' The . publication of the academic article is concurrent with the publication . of a book by Simon & Schuster entitled 'The Jesus Discovery: The New . Archaeological Find That Reveals the Birth of Christianity.' A . documentary on the discovery will be aired by the Discovery Channel in . spring 2012. The findings and their interpretation . are likely to be controversial, since most scholars are skeptical of . any Christian archaeological remains from so early a period. Adding . to the controversy is the tomb's close proximity to a second tomb, . discovered in 1980. This tomb, dubbed by some 'The Jesus Family Tomb,' contained inscribed ossuaries that some scholars associate with Jesus . and his family, including one that reads 'Jesus, son of Joseph.' Coffin: One of the bone boxes or ossuaries uncovered after the discovery of the nearby Jesus Tomb in the early 1980s . Filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici examines a section of a nearby tomb in 2007 . 'Context . is everything in archaeology,' Tabor pointed out. 'These two tombs, . less than 200 feet apart, were part of an ancient estate, likely related . to a rich family of the time. 'We . chose to investigate this tomb because of its proximity to the . so-called 'Jesus tomb,' not knowing if it would yield anything unusual.' He added in an interview to ABC News: 'We have one tomb that has the bones of Jesus and 200 feet away, people celebrating his resurrection. They're able to put this together in a way that maybe people today haven't considered.' The bible tells how on the evening of the crucifixion, Joseph of Arimathea asked Pontius Pilate for Jesus' body. Mosaic Law states that a person hanged on a tree must not be allowed to . remain there at night, but should be buried before sundown. Joseph wrapped Jesus' body in a linen cloth and laid it in a tomb. The book of John tells how Joseph was assisted in the burial process by Nicodemus, who brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes and included these spices in the burial cloth as per Jewish customs. Among the approximately 2000 . ossuaries that have been recovered by the Israel Antiquities Authority, . only 650 have any inscriptions on them, and none have inscriptions . comparable to the team's finds. Less . than a dozen ossuaries from the period have epitaphs but, according to . Tabor, these inscribed messages usually have to do with warnings not to . disturb the bones of the dead. In contrast, the four-line Greek . inscription contains some kind of statement of resurrection faith. Tabor noted that the epitaph's complete and final translation is uncertain. The first three lines are clear, but the last line, consisting of three Greek letters, is less sure, yielding several possible translations: 'O Divine Jehovah, raise up, raise up,' or 'The Divine Jehovah raises up to the Holy Place,' or 'The Divine Jehovah raises up from.' 'This inscription has something to do with resurrection of the dead, either of the deceased in the ossuary, or perhaps, given the Jonah image nearby, an expression of faith in Jesus' resurrection,' Tabor said. The ossuary with the image that Tabor and his team understand to be representing Jonah also has other interesting engravings. These also may be connected to resurrection, Tabor notes. On one side is the tail of a fish disappearing off the edge of the box, as if it is diving into the water. There are small fish images around its border on the front facing, and on the other side is the image of a cross-like gate or entranceâwhich Tabor interprets as the notion of entering the 'bars' of death, which are mentioned in the Jonah story in the Bible. Other scholars, however, have poured cold water over Tabor's claims. Mark Goodacre, an associate professor of religious studies at Duke University, told ABC News that the fish engraving is actually no such thing. He said: 'When is a fish not a fish? When it has handles, matching handles. It's a vessel. It's a vase. It's a vase that looks like many of the ones that you'll find in the early Roman period.' He added that there is no firm evidence relating to Jesus in either tomb.",Adds weight to sensational theory that Jesus was buried with Mary Magdelene and had family with her .

"They are one of the most recognised symbols of the festive season, emulated in nativity plays all over the world and whose imagery adorns the front of millions of Christmas cards. However the three wise men who presented the newborn baby Jesus with gold, frankincense and myrrh could have been larger in numbers if a new interpretation of an ancient document is correct. An eighth-century script has been translated into English for the first time . and throws an incredible new light on the Christmas story. Nativity scene: The imagery of the three wise men has been recreated on Christmas cards all over the world . The translation of the mysterious 'Revelation of the Magi' describes how the three wise men actually numbered over a dozen and came from a faraway land, possibly China. The Magi was the term, used from at least the fourth century BC, for ancient stargazers who were able to read and manipulate the fate foretold in the skies. The script also reveals how it was Jesus himself who was the famous star followed by the Magi. Brent Landau, a Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Oklahoma, spent two years translating the eighth-century text from its original Syriac. The document has been held in the Vatican for 250 years and the story is thought to have been first told in the late second, or early third, century. This takes it back to possibly just 100 years after Matthew wrote his Gospel - the only one to include the story of the Magi. Matthew never mentions how many the Magi numbered; they are described as three wise men simply because there were three gifts. You might need a bigger cast: The latest revelation could change the face of nativity school plays across the world (file photo) There could have been several scores of them, according to the new translation. The authors of the document claim it was penned by the Magi. However experts do not believe this to be the case and say it could have been written by their descendents, as it carries detailed accounts of their prayers and rituals. Professor Landau thinks the sect that . wrote it identified with the mystics. The story tells how the Magi were descended from Adamâs third and righteous son, Seth. It says they came from a semi-mythical place called Shir, which is on the eastern edge of the world - where modern-day China is. Prof Landau said: 'The story says that . Seth passed down a prophecy that at some point a star would appear that . would signal the birth of God in human form. 'The Magi waited thousands of years, passing down the prophecy and then the star appeared where the Magi were. 'It transformed into a small luminous human being who was Christ himself in a pre-existent, celestial form. New light: The document has been held in the Vatican (pictured) for 250 years and the story is thought to have been first told in the late second or early third century . 'It is saying that Jesus Christ and the Star of Bethlehem are the same thing and Jesus Christ can transform himself into anything. 'The star guides them to Bethlehem and into a cave where it transforms into a human infant who tells them to go back and be preachers of the Gospel. 'Later the Apostle Thomas turns up and baptises the Magi and tells them to go into the world. 2nd/3rd century: Original story written . 8th century: Current manuscript produced . - For a millennium, it is unclear where the text was - . 18th century: a collector finds the manuscript - written on a parchment made from animal skin- in a Turkish monastery . It was given it to the Vatican library and archived away into obscurity . 1927: The Vatican publishes the text into Syriac (a dialect of Aramaic used by Christians in the Middle East ) but it is again overlooked and forgotten . 2000s: Harvard Divinity School scholar Brent Landau finds the document and spends seven years translating the text from Syriac to English . 'The story does say that the Magi brought gifts to Jesus, but interestingly the text never tells us if they are the familiar gold, frankincense, and myrrh.' Prof Landau said it is unknown who wrote the text but added: 'Somebody was really fascinated by the wise men to have created this big, long story and tell it from their perspective. 'The Revelation of the Magi is part of the Christian Apocrypha and was written in the Syriac language that was spoken by Christians from Syria through Iran and Iraq. 'There might have been a community who were using the Magi or its persona to get its religious perspective across. 'There are many details of strange rituals, praying and silence. There is a description of a sacred mountain and purification at a sacred spring. 'The detail is so great I wondered if it was the communityâs actual practices that were being described. 'There is much in the Revelation of the Magi which is not self evident why it is there. 'Nobody knows where Matthew got the story from so along with Matthewâs Gospel this is as close as you can get to the Magi.' In terms of the text itself, very little is known about its origins. It is unclear who wrote it or when, though academics think it is an 8th century manuscript written from a story from the second or third century. After, it is unsure where the text was for a millennium until a collector stumbled across it in a Turkish monastery in the eighteenth century. The collector then transferred the document, written on Vellum, a type of parchment made from animal skin, to the Vatican Library. It was then lost, archived away in Syriac until a Harvard student, Brent Landau, spent almost a decade translating the text.",Eighth-century script claims the ancient 'Magi' stargazers came from 'as far away as China'
"Senior Tories rallied round Theresa May last night after she revealed she has been diagnosed with a form of diabetes that will require daily injections for the rest of her life. The Home Secretary said it had been âa real shockâ when she was told last November that she had Type 1 diabetes, which carries an increased risk of heart attack and strokes. Tory colleagues praised her courage for speaking out on the issue, and said it would make no difference to her work â or her rumoured ambition to stand for the Tory leadership one day. Two stone lighter: Theresa May arrives at the Glamour Women Of The Year Awards ceremony at Berkeley Square Gardens in central London in June 2010 (left), and is pictured (right) at her home in Berkshire last week . Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft said the illness âwill not hold her backâ and revealed that he is also a sufferer. In the message on Twitter he said: âDiabetes will not hold Theresa May back. It didnât for me and shouldnât for her. I remain a fan.â Mrs May, 56, said she had spoken out following speculation about her rapid weight loss in recent months â which some observers had claimed was the start of a makeover campaign to prepare for a possible future leadership bid. In February this year the Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, tweeted: âA bit worried about Home Secretary. She is looking a bit thin these days. A new diet or pressure of work?â In an interview with the Mail on Sunday yesterday Mrs May admitted she âwasnât best pleasedâ with Mr Vazâs âunfortunateâ intervention. She added: âI thought it actually rebounded on him rather than anything to do with me. Support: Former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft (pictured in 2010) said the illness 'will not hold her back' and revealed that he is also a sufferer . âI thought it was unfortunate that he . felt he wanted to make those sorts of comments. He does have diabetes, . heâs mentioned it in Parliament, so I will be interested to see what the . next thing he chooses to say will be.â Fashion statement: A 2011 choice by Mrs May at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester . The Home Secretaryâs illness could mean the end of the most famous heels at Westminster. Mrs May is renowned for her love of shoes â particularly ofÂ  all things leopard print â and her often-daring outfits are always smartly accessorised by killer heels. But diabetes causes high blood sugar levels which encourage bacteria, so that any minor cut or blister can quickly become infected and develop into an ulcer â and the feet are particularly vulnerable. Some doctors advise patients not to wear overly high heels or pointed shoes as this puts undue pressure on the feet. Instead they are encouraged to wear comfortable shoes preferably with cotton socks to help cushion the impact. But Mrs May is adamant her signature sling-backs will not get the boot. She told the Mail on Sunday: âI have to say the advice [doctors] give on shoes does not necessarily include kitten heels. Iâve not been banned from wearing them.â Her love of footwear emerged at the Tory conference in Bournemouth in 2002 when her Â£110 Russell & Bromley ponyskin kitten heels caused a sensation. But one pair shouldnât cause too much of a problem â the leopard print wellies she wore to the conference in 2009. Mrs . May explained that she embarked on her diet and fitness regime before . discovering she had diabetes, which can also cause weight loss. She has . lost almost two stone in the last 18 months, shrinking down to between a . size ten and a 12. The . Home Secretary, the bookmakersâ favourite to succeed David Cameron as . Tory leader, was initially told she had Type 2 diabetes, like 90 per . cent of all three million adults in the UK with diabetes. However further tests revealed it was . actually Type 1, which is more usually diagnosed in teenagers and which . leaves patients with a greater risk of strokes and heart disease. The revelation comes at a time when Mrs Mayâs popularity within the Tory parliamentary party is at a high, following the successful deportation of hate preacher Abu Qatada and the first signs of success in bringing down immigration. But she put paid to rumours that her weight loss was a sign of a planned leadership bid. âThis was not some great Machiavellian plan, because there is no leadership bid,â she said. âWe have a first-class leader and a first-class Prime Minister and long may he continue.â Tory MPs yesterday said the illness would make no difference to Mrs Mayâs ambitions. Mark Reckless, a member of the home affairs committee, said: âThere is no reason why it should get in the way of the great job she is doing. It is good that she is being open about it as it will help raise awareness.â Fellow Tory Glyn Davies said: âIt must be a shock and it will have to be managed. My message would be â now carry on being a top Home Secretary.â Mrs May also insisted the illness, which requires her to administer twice-daily injections to herself, would not affect her ability to carry out her gruelling workload. âThe diabetes doesnât affect how I do the job or what I do,â she said. âItâs just part of life, so itâs head down and get on with it.â She went on: âIt was a real shock and, yes, it took me a while to come to terms with it. Iâm a little more careful about what I eat. And thereâs obviously the injections, but this is something millions of people have. Iâm OK with needles, fortunately. âThereâs a great quote from Steve Redgrave who was diagnosed with diabetes before he won his last Olympic gold medal. He said diabetes must learn to live with me rather than me live with diabetes. Thatâs the attitude.â","Her Type 1 diabetes carries an increased risk of heart attack and strokes .

"The late Lilly Pulitzer's name is synonymous with bold tropical prints. Now, as her showstopping Palm Beach home is given a $3millon price cut, it is clear to see where she got her inspiration. The 1.4acre estate, which comprises 9,000sq ft of living space across a four-bedroom house, a three-bedroom 'casita' and a two-bedroom pool house, was the home of the fashion designer for over 30 years until her death earlier this month. It has been for sale since January 2011 at $11.5million, but last week that figure was chopped to $8.5million. Designer style on discount: Lilly Pulitzer's home has been for sale since January 2011 at $11.5million, but last week that figure was chopped to $8.5million . The Pulitzer look: Faded prints and palm trees adorn furniture both indoors and outdoors . The agent selling the property is Pulitzer's daughter, Liza, who admits she hopes the new owners do not simply buy it for the land, and destroy the family home. 'It's the largest (non-waterfront) Estate Section lot,' she told The Palm Beach Daily News. 'We're marketing it at land value. When it goes, there wonât be another interior lot of this size' She added to the New York Observer: 'We would hate to see the house torn down, but the house is not landmarked.' Family home: Pulitzer and her second husband, Enrique Rousseau, purchased the plot in 1980 for just $565,000. The various accommodations on the site were built in 1983 . The property was initially put on the market because Pulitzer was finding its upkeep a challenge. Style legend: Lilly Pulitzer, pictured at fashion week in 2004, died this month at the age of 81 . She told the Wall Street Journal at the time: 'It's just magnificent, but I'm old and I'm cranky and I can't keep it up the way it should be.' Pulitzer and her second husband, Enrique Rousseau, purchased the plot in 1980 for just $565,000. The various accommodations on the site were built in 1983. The decor and gardens are typical of the designer's style. Faded prints and palm trees adorn furniture both indoors and outdoors, while tropical landscaping and the pool make for a sensational backdrop. 'We were very Cuba,' Pulitzer wrote in a book about herself and Rousseau. Lilly Pulitzer launched her business in the 1950s - by accident. She was socialite . with time to spare and a wealthy husband who owned citrus groves, so . she started a juice stand on a busy shopping street. She needed dresses in tropical prints . (no dowdy aprons for Lilly!) that would hide stains. The loose, . sleeveless cotton shape that came to be known as the shift was perfect . for the task and local climate. 'I designed collections around . whatever struck my fancy . . . fruits, vegetables, politics or peacocks! I . entered in with no business sense. It was a total change of life for . me, but it made people happy,' Pulitzer told The Associated Press in . 2009. 'Her clothes were transporting,' said . Adam Glassman, creative director of O, The Oprah Magazine. 'You . automatically think of Palm Beach, or sunny California in a Slim Aarons . photograph.' Style signature: Lilly Pulitzer, pictured in her Lilly shift in 1965. She became known for cheeky prints and easy cuts that women across America loved . Fashion darling: Pulitzer pictured in 2002 after her spring 2003 catwalk show in New York . The . brand was purposefully inclusive, said Janie Schoenborn, now the vice . president of creative communications of Lilly Pulitzer's former company. Gilded by Lilly: Pulitzer's designs became popular for baby showers, weddings, and garden parties . 'If someone is wearing the same print, . you high five them! I don't want to use the word ""club,"" though, because . that seems exclusive. Anyone who is happy and wants to have a good time . can come to our party.' Schoenborn said Lilly Pulitzer occupies a . unique spot in the fashion world. 'It's so not fashion-y, but it is . fashion because it has such a strong point of view.' 'The look is colorful, it tends to be . preppy - it's an iconic American look based on a lifestyle that's based . around these prints,' Glassman said. Pulitzer . also paved the way for today's popular lifestyle brands, including Tory . Burch, Tibi and Milly, and even Ralph Lauren, Glassman added. It . was a different business than the avant-garde catwalk designers showing . in Europe during the '60s. It was about loyalty and longevity instead . of drastic swings of the pendulum. Then-first . lady and fashion plate Jacqueline Kennedy, a former schoolmate of . Pulitzer, wore one of the shifts in a Life magazine photo spread, . confirming the look's legitimacy. Pulitzer . retired from the day-to-day business in 1993 after a rough patch in the . Eighties era of power dressing. But the company and its hallmark prints . have returned to profitability. Sales . of the brand were strong in the earnings period that ended Feb. 2, . according to parent company Oxford Industries' report. Revenue increased . 26per cent to $29.1 million.

"Dispute: According to claims filed at the High Court, a company owned by Lord Sugar is suing its lawyers for more than Â£1million . Alan Sugar is suing his own lawyers for allegedly botching a property deal which ended up costing one of his companies more almost Â£1million, it has emerged. Amsprop, a property company owned by the Labour peer, has filed a claimed at the High Court asking for at least Â£1.3million in damages from the solicitors Kingsley Napley. The documents claim that the company was forced to pay jewellers Longmire Â£970,500 to give up the lease on their location in New Bond Street, Central London. Longmire - which specialises in cufflinks - occupied 10 New Bond Street, with Swatch - the watch seller - next door at 10A. But Amsprop wanted to stop Longmire's lease so they could combine the two properties and let them both to Swatch, according to the Evening Standard. Amsprop, the papers said, launched a claim to deny Longmire a new lease in April 2012. The documents claim Kingsley Napley advised Amsprop to change its plans to maximise their chances in the courts. However, it is also claimed that the solicitors failed to disclose documents relating to Amsprop's original plans for the redevelopment, and also made a mistake by not delaying the court battle in light of new developments in the case. The papers go on to explain that a judge found that Longmire was entitled to a new lease, forcing Amsprop to pay them Â£970,500 in order to give up its right. 'As a consequence of the defendentâs negligence and breaches of duty, Amsprop has suffered loss and damage', the claim says. Amsprop is seeking the full costs of the Longmire settlement as well as another Â£326,379 in costs and legal fees. A Kingsley Napley spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are disappointed that this case is being progressed. We deny the claim and will vigorously contest it'. Amsprop describes the property at the heart of the dispute as: 'An . attractive period building constructed in 1877', and boasts of its prime Mayfair location. As well as the two residential units, the building has office space on the first and second floors, a flat on the third floor and another residential space spanning the fourth and fifth floors. Exclusive: The claims relate to a property deal over 10/10A New Bond Street, pictured here with former tenants Longmire jewellers . The average property on New Bond Street is worth around Â£8.5million, according to property site Zoopla. Lord Sugar's property empire is a key strut of his wealth, and reportedly made the entrepreneur more money than the computers for which he is famed. Earlier this year Amsprop sold a large plot of land near Stansted airport in Essex. It made a hefty profit on the land, which it bought for Â£1.6million in 1998. Part was sold to a farmer in 2013 for Â£5million, before home developer Bovis took the rest for Â£7.5million. Other notable deals include the sale of a block of property in Oxford Street, Central London, for Â£77million and the IBM building on the South Bank for Â£120million. The Sunday Times Rich List recently pinned Lord Sugar's wealth at Â£900million, Â£560million of which comes from Amsprop's portfolio, managed by his 42-year-old son Daniel.","Papers filed at the High Court show dispute over jewellers' lease .

"Bubba Watson defeated Tim Clark on the first hole of a play-off to win the WGC-HSBC Champions on Sunday after an extraordinary finish to the Â£5.4million event in Shanghai. Watson was two shots clear with three holes to play, only to bogey the 16th and run up a double bogey on the 17th after failing to escape a greenside bunker at the first attempt. That dropped the Masters champion one shot behind playing partners Clark and Rickie Fowler, as well as the final group of Graeme McDowell, Hiroshi Iwata and Martin Kaymer. American Bubba Watson (above) won the WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai, China on Sunday . Watson celebrated wildly after holing a superb bunker shot on the 18th for eagle, which took him into a play-off . Watson then drained his putt for birdie in the play-off in front of a packed crowd on 18 to seal a dramatic victory . Clark looked in pole position when he hit his third shot to the par-five 18th to four feet and saw Fowler find the water and Watson a greenside bunker. However, Watson then amazingly holed his bunker shot for an eagle and Clark's birdie was only good enough to leave the pair tied on 11 under, with the final group needing to birdie the last to join the play-off. Kaymer's chances disappeared when his approach flew over the green into the water, while McDowell and Iwata missed from 18 and 12 feet respectively. It was not a good day for overnight leader Graeme McDowell (left) who shot one-over par to finish tied third . Rickie Fowler (centre) playing in his trademark orange, went round in 70 for two-under, also finishing third . Clark and Watson returned to the 18th for the play-off and Watson found the same greenside bunker with his second shot after Clarke had hit his third to around 20 feet. Watson was unable to repeat his heroics from the sand but after Clark had left his birdie attempt short, the left-hander holed his birdie putt to seal victory.","Bubba Watson beats countryman Tim Clark in a play-off for victory .

"The adoptive parents of missing North Carolina teen Erica Parsons appeared in court on Wednesday as they face more than 75 charges of fraud. Casey and Sandy Parsons are accused of continuing to collect benefits for their adopted niece after her disappearance. They plead not guilty to the charges in Greensboro Federal Court. Erica was 13 years old when she was last seen in November 2011, but wasn't reported missing until July 2013 when her 20-year-old adoptive brother informed authorities of his sister's absence after getting into a fight with his parents. The Parsons continue to claim that they sent Erica to live with her 'Nan', though the girl's biological mother says no such grandparent exists. Scroll down for video . Charged: Sandy (left) and Casey (right) Parsons appeared in federal court on Wednesday to face more than 70 charges of fraud for continuing to receive benefits after their adoptive daughter's November 2011 disappearance. They plead not guilty . The charges against the Parsons are not related to Erica's disappearance, but their actions after she went missing. Federal prosecutors say the Parsons continued to collect several benefits intended for Erica, including a $634 monthly check for adoption assistance. The Parsons are also accused of receiving state funds for Erica's Medicaid, Social Security and food. Additionally, prosecutors say the Parsons lied on their income tax returns by using different identities to make up false dependents. Gone: Erica Parsons was 13 years old when she was last seen in November 2011. However she wasn't reported missing until July 2013. A picture of a younger Erica on the left, while on the right shows about what she would look like now . According to the indictment, Erica was home-schooled, had hearing problems and learning disability. Adoptive mother Casey Stone Parsons faces 76 charges including theft of government funds, making false statements regarding healthy care matters and aiding the filing of a false tax return. Her husband Sandy Wade Parsons faces 49 charges including conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States and theft of government funds. Investigation: The scene outside the Parsons' old home after Erica was first reported missing in July 2013 by her 20-year-old adoptive brother . The Erica Parsons case has continued to baffle investigators, and she has never been found. The Parsons have insisted that they were not worried about her safety because they believed she was with 'Nan' - even though it later emerged that both of Erica's biological grandmothers were in fact dead. The missing teen's biological mother Carolyn Parsons spoke out against the couple's claims, saying she will not give up looking for her daughter, who is now 15. Lying? The Parsons told police last summer that they thought Erica was living with her grandmother. The girl's biological mom Carolyn Parsons (above) says no such grandmother exists . 'I'm in somebody's nightmare and they will not wake up and let me out,' she previously told WBTV. Casey and Sandy's lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that it was Carolyn who introduced Erica to 'Nan', adding: 'That's who brought Nan to them and probably knows who Nan is.' But Carolyn said: 'Nan and Irene don't exist. The only two people that know the truth are the only two people that won't give the truth.' She also said she had not wanted to hand her daughter over to her in-laws, but felt she had to because she was unable to bring up the child properly. 'No mother wants to have children and just give them up,' she said. 'I didn't want to. She didn't deserve the life that I had.' Carolyn says she has not seen Erica since January 2011, 10 months before she went missing. A polygraph test carried out on Sandy Parsons was found to be 'strongly deceptive' when he described how he had nothing to do with her disappearance.

They do not want to trouble the cruise liners of the high seas, nor do they want to populate the plunge pool which leads to the Championship. John Carver has urged the club to make a managerial appointment becuase the club are in danger of drifting . Caretaker boss Carver has publicly stated his desire to take on the role on a permanent basis . Alan Pardew said goodbye to Newcastle to take charge of Crystal Palace earlier this month . And that, essentially, is why Alan Pardew chose to go overboard. The new Crystal Palace boss hinted at as much this week, talking of âbattles wonâ and âbattles lostâ with owner Mike Ashley, at the same time referencing âtight financial marginsâ and the âslow progressâ policy in place on Tyneside. Perhaps Ashley should be applauded for surveying the seas and deciding that any attempt to pirate the big boys could see his club drown in misplaced ambition â even pursuit of silverware in the cup competitions is viewed as a threat to staying afloat. But supporters â and Pardew, it seems â have had enough of this Magpie mandate. Carver himself is a fan. But the caretaker boss â who wants the job on a permanent basis â should be careful when he talks of redirecting his black-and-white ship towards the top of the Premier League - for he'll soon be walking the plank with any suggestion of a European voyage. Fabricio Coloccini puts his gloves during training on Thursday ahead of the Premier League game with Chelsea . Davide Santon kicks the ball as Yoan Gouffran tries to close the Italian down during training on Thursday . âSuccess for this club is to get as high up the table as we can. We finished fifth a couple of years ago and that was fantastic. So why canât we push fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth?â he said, refreshingly. âThereâs all this talk about they (the club) are happy to sit in the top 10. No, go as high as you can. Set your marker as high as you can and, if you get there, what an achievement. âWeâve proved weâre capable of that and there was the recent run of six wins on the bounce as well.â Carver admits that Saturday's trip to league leaders Chelsea and next Saturdayâs visit of Southampton are serving as a âjob interviewâ for himself. But what he says off the pitch is perhaps as important as what his players do on it. Former Lyon manager Remi Garde has been linked with the vacant position at Newcastle . Carver has warned Newcastle that the club is in danger of drifting if an appointment is not made swiftly . He has, however, advised managing director Lee Charnely to avoid a scenario whereby the search for a new head coach drags on. âIâve been in this situation before and if you donât do something about it in a short space of time you can end up drifting,â he said. âAnd what this football club canât be doing is drifting, so a decision has to be made sooner rather than later, for everybodyâs benefit. âThe dressing room is settled at the moment but the longer it goes on it can become unsettled. Iâve been in this situation and it can affect people. You canâ t just let it drift. You have to make a decision.â Former Lyon boss Remi Garde remains the frontrunner to take charge. Carver says he would be happy to work under any new appointment, but also believes he himself boasts the credentials to remain in control of his hometown club. Ryan Taylor, who has only made three appearances for the club this season, stretches during training . Star man Moussa Sissoko, who has been linked with a move away, keeps his eye on the ball . When asked if he was the right man to lead Newcastle in the long term, Carver said: âWhy not? People ask me what my qualifications are â well, Iâve got the UEFA Pro Licence and thatâs a starting point. âIâve worked with some of the best people in the game, Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby (Robson). âIf the club said to me, âtake it to the end of the seasonâ, then Iâd be prepared to do the job, no danger of that. I have enough belief in myself and enough time until the end of the season that theyâd say to me then, âyouâve done a good job, keep the jobâ.â To keep the job, Carver must run a happy ship. Right now, however, it is beginning to seep a little water and the mood on the terraces during the FA Cup defeat at Leicester was one of mutiny. Carver, then, is right â an appointment has to be made. For drifting can very quickly turn to sinking the longer a ship remains rudderless.","Alan Pardew left Newcastle to join Crystal Palace earlier this month .

"It was a case of let the brush see the boot for Paddy McGuinness at Bolton's training ground on Friday. The Take Me Out host and former Phoenix Nights star came good on a pledge he made before Wanderers' 2-1 win over Blackburn on Boxing Day. McGuinness, a Bolton fan, tweeted: 'If @EmileHeskeyUK comes off the bench today and scores for us I'll personally clean his boots! C'mon Bolton!!!!' Paddy McGuinness with his brush and Emile Heskey with a spanking clean pair of boots . Bolton tweeted this picture of the Take Me Out host trying to get Heskey's boots sparkling . Paddy gets to work on Heskey's boots in front of the laughing striker and Bolton boss Neil Lennon . The comedian shares his thoughts as his honours his pledge made on Boxing Day . Heskey did indeed score - the equaliser from Eidur Gudjohnsen's pass - and the comedian made it clear he would honour his pledge. The day after the match he posted on Twitter: 'For those asking about my bet, cleaning @EmileHeskeyUK boots. I'm a man of my word, just waiting for a date from the club. Keep u posted.' And on the day he could not hide his excitement, saying: 'Just getting organised, got to go & settle a bet. Time to clean the big mans @EmileHeskeyUK boots! Off to @OfficialBWFC training ground.' Heskey slides in to score Bolton's equaliser against Blackburn on Boxing Day . And, in front of a laughing Heskey and Bolton manager Neil Lennon at Euxton, he did indeed scrub the big striker's boots, which will be worn in Saturday's FA Cup tie at home to Wigan. And afterwards he told his followers: 'There you go, a man of my word. @EmileHeskeyUK boots, spotless!!!' Heskey agreed, saying: 'He did a good job. All the mud was gone. 'They're my only pair, so I'll definitely be wearing them tomorrow.' Mind you Paddy, you did make Emile of it (sorry). Bolton, meanwhile, have given a trial to MVV Maastricht's 22-year-old Dutch defender Nick Kuipers.","Paddy McGuinness said he would clean Emile Heskey's boots if striker scored for Bolton against Blackburn on Boxing Day .

"Scientists believe we are one step closer to creating an artificial mind. IBM has announced a new programming architecture for chips inspired by the human brain. The company claims the chips could pave the way for smart sensor networks that mimic the brainâs capacity for perception, action, and thought. San Diego-based Qualcomm is planning to launch the first ever commercial chip inspired by the human brain. The chip's memory functions as synapses would in the brain, the processors as neurons and communication as nerve fibres . One day, it could allow computer scientists to develop a machine with a brain that is even more intelligent than that of humans. IBMâs said its new programming architecture will allow developers to design applications for these brain-like chips once they released. âArchitectures and programs are closely intertwined and a new architecture necessitates a new programming paradigm,â said Dr Dharmendra Modha, the principal investigator for the project at IBM Research. âWhile complementing todayâs computers, this will bring forth a fundamentally new technological capability in terms of programming and applying emerging learning systems.â The computers we use today were designed decades ago for sequential processing according to a pre-defined program. The brain consumes the same amount of power as a 20 watt light and occupies the volume of a two-litre bottle . Although they are fast and precise ânumber crunchers,â our computers struggle to deal with real-time processing of the noisy, voluminous, big data produced by the world around us. In contrast, the brain- which operates comparatively slowly and at low precision- excels at tasks such as recognising, interpreting, and acting upon patterns. Overall the brain, consumes the same amount of power as a 20 watt light bulb and occupying the volume of a two-litre bottle. A computer uses 99 per cent of its volume for cooling and powering, and only one per cent to process information . In August 2011, IBM demonstrated a building block of a novel brain-inspired chip architecture based on a scalable, interconnected, configurable network of âneurosynaptic cores.â The chipâs memory functions as synapses would in the brain, the processors as neurons and communication as nerve fibres. These chips attempt to replicate and improve the brainâs ability to respond to biological sensors and analysing vast amounts of data from many sources at once. To achieve this, the researchers developed a highly scalable functional software simulator of a cognitive computing architecture comprising a network of neurosynaptic cores. Alongside this they created a digital neuron model which acts as the main information processing unit. The company claims that within this, a network of such neurons can sense, remember, and act upon a variety of different situations. IBM, in collaboration with Cornell University and iniLabs, has been awarded $12 million in new funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to advance the research for this part of the Systems of Neuromorphic Adaptive Plastic Scalable Electronics (SyNAPSE) project. The project is part of the same research that led to IBM's announcement in 2009 that it had simulated a cat's cerebral cortex, the thinking part of the brain, using a massive supercomputer. Using progressively bigger supercomputers, IBM had previously simulated 40 per cent of a mouse's brain in 2006, a rat's full brain in 2007, and one per cent of a human's cerebral cortex in 2009. Eventually IBM wants to build a chip system with ten billion neurons and hundred trillion synapses. If you've only just got used to talking to your phone, get ready for a major change. In December, IBM revealed its predictions for the computer we will all be using in 2018 - and it believes they will have all five senses, and will communicate with us in radically different ways. 'Infrared and haptic technologies will enable a smart phone's touchscreen technology and vibration capabilities to simulate the physical sensation of touching something,' the firm said. 'So you could experience the silkiness of that catalog's Egyptian cotton sheets instead of just relying on some copywriter to convince you. 'Itâs amazing when you look back over the 60+ years of the computing revolution and see how far we have come in such a relatively short time,' said IBM's Bernard Meyerso.","New programming architecture will allow developers to design applications for brain-like chips that are currently in development by IBM .

"Sometimes, as anyone who has ever come into contact with Chelsea's manager Jose Mourinho will tell you, sorry seems to be the hardest word. Sadly Watford's former chairman Elton John was not here to witness Jose Mourinho's public apology for digging out the referee on TV over his failure to award Chelsea a second-half penalty. It probably helped that they scored anyway after Diego Costa's shot had been charged down and Loic Remy twisted inside the area to score their second. The nation should be grateful for small mercies, though. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho's referee apology following Chelsea's 3-0 win over Watford .

Mourinho did not say sorry to those he insulted after claiming that a campaign was being waged against Chelsea when they slipped up at Southampton and were beaten 5-3 at Tottenham, but we cannot expect every thing. 'We had a big penalty in our favour and I was speaking with the referee and I want to apologise for my earlier comments to TV because what he did was great refereeing. 'He was saw that it was a penalty, he was going to give a penalty, but he saw the ball was going to Remy and he waited a couple of seconds. 'He told me that if Remy did not control the ball or if the ball goes over the bar or the ball was lost then he would have given a penalty. So it was good refereeing. 'I was complaining but it was good refereeing by Kevin. So I apologised.' Thankfully Remy scored because the fall-out from yet another perceived injustice would have been too much for even the most one-eyed Chelsea fan to stomach after the past few days. Something has rattled Mourinho's cage of late, but the twinkle in his eye has returned after Chelsea finally broke down Slavisa Jokanovic's team. He made eight changes to the side beaten at White Hart Lane, giving captain John Terry, Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas, Thibaut Courtois and the rest of the gang the day off after their chasing in north London. Even then it took a double substitution at half time, replacing the woeful Andre Schurrle and the ineffective Oscar, with the energy of Diego Costa and Willian to make the difference. 'Sometimes we don't have good performances and I needed some guarantees of winning,' added Mourinho. 'To have Willian and Diego was important to us.' It certainly was because Mourinho is becoming increasingly irritable in the dug out. For varying reasons Remy, Oscar and even Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro got it in the neck during a frustrating first half.

Everytime Chelsea ventured forward there was traffic, with five yellow shirts racing across Watfordâs defence and four more buzzing around in midfield. Eventually, the lights turned green. Willian scored the opener in the 58th minute, curling the ball beyond Bond from the edge of the area. It was a quality strike. Chelsea turned the screw, adding to their lead through Remy and adding a third in the 72nd minute when Kurt Zoumaâs deft header beat Bondâs outstretched fingertips. This was rough on Watford. Jokanovic had a gameplan to suffocate Chelseaâs forward-thinking players and to hope his isolated forward Troy Deeney could do something special in attack. He had a couple of first half chances, both easily taken by Petr Cech, and faded after the break when Chelsea stepped up the pace. âOur plan was to stay in shape and make some counter-attacks,â admitted Jokanovic. âIf we scored it could have changed everything. âIf Deeney had scored it could have changed something, but it is a good experience.

"CLICK HERE for all the stats, heat maps and goals from Sportsmail's Match Zone . It must be tough for supporters of Sheffield Wednesday to come to Manchester City. Historically, these clubs were equals, northern football powerhouses with roots and popularity sunk deep in the working-class culture of the industrial age. In the modern era, though, Wednesday know they can never ever be Cityâs equal again. UEFAâs Financial Fair Play rules have seen to that. City secured their new-found status on the back of Middle East cash just before Michel Platini and his friends slammed the door shut on everybody else.

Bookings: Palmer . Manager: Manuel Pellegrini 7 . Referee: Michael Oliver 6 . Man of the match: James Milner . So this is, to an extent, all that is left for clubs such as Wednesday, afternoons when they travel in hope and pray for a brief reminder of what life was like when their team were in the top division and their magnificent stadium hosted FA Cup semi-finals and matches in the European Championship. Thankfully, football still provides an occasional avenue for dreams and glory, so on Sunday they poured over the Pennines in their thousands to support Stuart Gray and his team. The odds and the mathematics were against them. Having lost 7-0 here to City in the Capital One Cup as recently as September, Wednesday required an eight-goal swing to go through. Remarkably, they looked as though they may do it for a while. There were 51 minutes between Atdhe Nuhiuâs terrific opening goal and James Milnerâs equaliser. In the away end, they enjoyed every one of them. Ultimately, it wasnât to be. A merited draw and a replay beckoned but the depth of Cityâs squad eventually hauled them through and sent Wednesday home with nothing. The impact of City substitutes Samir Nasri and David Silva could not be ignored and Milnerâs toe-end in the second minute of injury-time gave City a victory they barely deserved. âI am relieved,â said their manager Manuel Pellegrini afterwards. âWe played very badly but we found another gear in the last 20 minutes.The FA Cup means a lot. We will try to win it. âI have said before what I think about James Milner. He is very useful. He always plays with 100 per cent commitment and intensity. I am very happy for him and also as itâs his birthday.â Given the manner in which City had struggled for consistent superiority in recent Barclays Premier League games here against Burnley (2-2) and Sunderland (3-2), Gray perhaps felt that if Wednesday could grab something early then it would at least make for an interesting afternoon. That is exactly what happened. The move ahead of the opening goal was started by central midfielder Kieran Lee in the 15th minute as he played a lovely, purposeful ball down the right flank into the path of the breaking Stevie May. With only big centre forward Nuhiu in the penalty area, the chances of a breakthrough still appeared slim but the Austrian dropped off intelligently as he anticipated a low cross, and when the ball arrived he side-footed it confidently to Willy Caballeroâs left and into the net. Sheffield Wednesday's Atdhe Nuhiu scores the surprise opener for his side against Manchester City at the Etihad in the FA Cup . Nuhiu shoots at the Manchester City goal after 14 minutes at the Etihad to put Sheffield Wednesday 1-0 up on Sunday . Sheffield Wednesday took a surprise 1-0 lead against Manchester City on Sunday at the Etihad in the FA Cup . Behind the goal at the other end of the stadium, they celebrated vigorously. Their team were ahead. This is what they had come for. If City were not exactly stunned, they were unsettled. For a while their discipline and composure deserted them as they railed at referee Michael Oliver in response to some of his decisions. Sometimes they appeared to have a point and at others they didnât, but by losing discipline City only played into Wednesdayâs hands. Wednesday rarely looked like breaking through again but nor did a City goal feel imminent, either. Fernando should have done better than head a corner over when unmarked in the 21st minute, while Yaya Toure and Frank Lampard drove low shots wide. Ultimately, City had to wait until the 66th minute for their equaliser and when it came it owed much to the substitutions made just a few minutes earlier. One replacement, Nasri, began the move with a ball inside to another, Silva, on the left side. And when Silva made a cute pass inside the full back to play Milner in on the angle, the England midfielder was smart enough to find the gap between Chris Kirklandâs legs and thus the far corner. After that, the traffic all moved one way and Wednesday could only try to hang on. A save from Kirkland to deny Silva in the first minute of injury-time seemed set to earn Wednesday a replay. Then one more raid to the byline from the energetic Jesus Navas saw the winger find Milner inches ahead of a sea of yellow, and his touch sent City into round four and Wednesday back to the reality of life in the Championship. âI thought we had a replay against the champions,â said Gray. âBut City showed us respect by sending on Silva and Nasri and tired minds cost us in the end. I am very proud of the players.â Nuhiu runs away in celebration after putting the ball beyond goalkeeperÂ Willy Caballero to gain a 1-0 lead against Manchester City .

"Former referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember . Refereeing chiefs have hit back at criticism sparked by Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll by publishing statistics that claim standards have never been higher. Despite a number of horrendous mistakes which blighted Barclays Premier League matches over the Christmas period, Professional Game Match Officials Ltd tried to make a case that 95 per cent of major decisions are correct. Last week Poll highlighted several game-changing gaffes and called for refereesâ chief Mike Riley to be sacked. Poll was supported by former PGMOL head Keith Hackett, who branded the current officials the âworst we have ever seenâ and named four top-flight referees he thought should be axed . Referees' chief Mike Riley (pictured) tried toÂ hide officialsâ poor performances behind statistics . Keith Hackett watches a game at Oakwell (left) and during his days as a top-flight referee (right) On a day when Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was charged by the FA for comments made after Cesc Fabregas was wrongly shown a yellow card for diving against Southampton, the PGMOL tried to hide their officialsâ poor performances behind statistics. And in a bid to undermine their critics, PGMOL argued standards had improved since Hackett left five years ago. As well as showing refereesâ fitness has got better, the figures claimed accuracy on major decisions was up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent, penalty-box calls were 98 per cent right and offsides had increased in accuracy to 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent when Riley took charge in 2010.Premier League managers, players and fans will find it hard to believe these figures. Andre Marriner, pictured with Everton's Leighton Baines, is one of four officials Hackett wants stood down . Mike Jones discusses a decision with Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini at St Mary's . Mike Jones awarding Liverpool their first penalty in the 2-2 draw at Anfield, when Raheem Sterlingâs cross struck Wes Morgan in the face, left Leicester manager Nigel Pearson dumbfounded and calling for the use of video replays. Also on New Yearâs Day, Swansea boss Garry Monk said officials should suffer for bad performances following the 1-1 draw at QPR.Rangers keeper Rob Green somehow escaped dismissal despite clearly handling the ball outside his area, while Wayne Routledge was sent off for his reaction to Karl Henryâs late tackle. Taylor was the official once more and Swanseaâs Routledge had his red card rescinded. Gabriel Agbonlahor and Paul Konchesky had red card decisions overturned in December, after confusing calls by Lee Mason and Craig Pawson respectively. In light of this, Poll said standards had âsunk to their worst level that I can rememberâ and Hackett cited âover 20 major errorsâ during the Christmas period. He called for Jones, Mason, Andre Marriner, and Chris Foy to be stood down. Poll added last night: âThese stats will provide little succour for the millions who have watched games scarred by poor decisions. Itâs typical of Mike Riley, an accountant by profession, to hide behind statistics. People would think more of him if he came out from behind his statistical smokescreen and faced his critics. I believe these stats to be flawed as they donât record non-decisions. For example, Rob Greenâs handball wonât be included as the referee played on instead of giving a free-kick.

"The circus that is Blackpool was taken up a notch on Friday morning when two players were turned away from training after refusing to sign paltry new contracts. Teenagers Henry Cameron and Mark Waddington both rejected professional contracts worth Â£200-a-week at Bloomfield Road. Midfielder Cameron has now agreed terms on a two-year deal and is expected to be on the bench for the Saturday's Championship clash with Millwall. Mark Waddington (left) tussles for possession with Aston Villa's Jack Grealish during FA Cup tie . Waddington has made three appearances for the Championship strugglers this season . But the players' initial rejection was met with a frosty reaction from the Seasiders, who told the pair to go home when they arrived at Squires Gate to train ahead of the Millwall match. Sportsmail understands chairman Karl Oyston â under investigation by the FA for labelling a fan a âretardâ - told them they will be sent back to the youth team unless they accept. Blackpool still risk losing Waddington for a minimal amount when his youth contract runs out at the end of the season. Dom Telford has turned down a professional contract and is now training with the youth team . Henry Cameron was turned away from training after rejecting the offer of Â£200-a-week . But, perhaps more gallingly for the club, striker Dom Telford has also opted against penning professional terms after being offered the same measly amount. Telford, who scored an equaliser on his debut against Rotherham United on December 28, was made to train with the youth team on Friday. A host of Premier League and Championship scouts are due to watch all three during the Under 18 fixture against Oldham on Saturday, given the trio are unlikely to feature for Lee Clark.","Mark Waddington and Henry Cameron rejected professional contracts .

"For a panel debating tax issues, economist Richard Murphy ought to be the perfect candidate. Not at the BBC. Instead, Newsnight bosses chose fashion blogger Poppy Dinsey, 25, and Mr Murphyâs junior female colleague, Ellie Mae OâHagan â all in the name of gender equality. Yesterday Mr Murphy, 54, a chartered accountant and the head researcher at the Tax Justice Network, branded the decision to leave him off the programme as âstraightforward discriminationâ. Scroll down for video . Debate: Fashion blogger Poppy Dinsey, centre, was invited by BBC's Newsnight to discuss tax avoidance by large corporations alongside Mr Murphy's junior colleague Ellie Mae O'Hagan and Bill Dodwell of Delioitte . And even Miss Dinsey, who is best . known for posting photographs of herself in revealing outfits on her . blog, said she was surprised by the decision, saying she believed she . was chosen because she ticked the âyoung, female boxâ. Mr Murphy said Newsnight researchers . contacted him while preparing Thursdayâs programme, on corporation tax, . because they wanted to use some of his extensive studies on tax . avoidance by major companies. But when he offered to appear on the . panel he was told it would not be possible because it would âupset the . gender balanceâ. Instead, he had to sit at home and watch Miss OâHagan . talk about his own research. To make matters worse, alongside her was Miss Dinsey, an economics graduate and founder of the âWhat I Wore Todayâ website. It features daily shots of her in outfits including plunging tops, bikinis, and, once, a Playboy bunny costume. Before ThursdayâsÂ  show, she tweeted . that she was heading to the studio straight from a waxing salon, joking . that she was going from âwaxes to taxesâ...âI feel very Legally Blonde.â She added: âWhenever I donât know the answer Iâll just refer people to my amazing âspecially threaded for Newsnightâ brows.â In the event Miss Dinsey appeared a little nervous on air, giving composed if slightly rambling answers when asked by presenter Gavin Esler whether it was wrong for major firms to pay comparatively small amounts of tax. Snubbed: Richard Murphy says he was discriminated against for being a man . The two women were joined by Bill Dodwell, head of tax policy at accountancy firm Deloitte. Before the debate, Mr Esler interviewed Treasury minister David Gauke. According to Mr Murphy,Â  the showâs researchers told him he couldnât appear because Mr Dodwell had been chosen to put the multinationalsâ view and, due to the BBCâs strict âgender balanceâ rules, theyÂ  needed a woman â Miss OâHagan â to put the opposing argument. Mr Murphy said: âItâs an utterly absurd situation where Newsnight will overlook a story about paedophilia but obsess about gender balance rules. âThey were so desperate to have a woman they took someone less expert over someone more expert, and the person who had done the investigation and developed the techniques was deliberately not allowed on air. This is straightforward discrimination.â âWe are a tiny campaign. I do all the work â thereâs no credible alternative to talk about this kind of investigation. âEllie Mae OâHagan did quite a good job but sheâs not an accountant. She just talked about my work.â Miss Dinsey, a graduate of University College London, said she was also surprised by the decision not to invite Mr Murphy on the programme and said she had not been told about the selection criteria. She added: âIf he was willing to be on it and wasnât invited it was a bit mean. I was having a bit of a laugh with my friends about being on it. âThere are certainly opportunities that I get for being a young businesswoman that young businessmen donât get. âI believe you should get the best person for the job, whoever that is. On a programme like Newsnight it should be the best person to speak on the subject.â A BBC spokesman said: âNewsnight aims to have a varying range of voices. We contacted Mr Murphy to see if he could recommend other experts in this field to broaden the discussion. âWe are sorry if he was disappointed not to have been asked to appear in this particular programme.â The show focused on how the 19 biggest firms in Britain were paying as little as 3 per cent tax. Experts estimate the Exchequer is missing out on Â£3.3billion in potential revenue.","Richard Murphy claims he has been discriminated against by BBC's Newsnight .

"Brides who dream of a glitzy rock star-style wedding venue need look no further for the perfect location. Former Police singer Sting and his wife Trudie Styler have opened up their vast estate in Tuscany for weddings and private parties. But Sting's loss of privacy comes at a price -Â  his six cottages housing 50 guests will cost seven thousand euros (Â£6,000) a week each to rent. Rock star home: Sting and his wife Trudie Styler have opened the doors of their Tuscany estate to weddings and private parties . Idyllic: The villa in Tuscany which was once owned by a Duke before he sold it to Sting and Trudie . Wine cellar: Sting promotes the  wines on his estate which boast a large swimming pool and huge chess board in the garden . Up to 200 partygoers will be able to enjoy the 900-acre Italian estate's attractions which include a large swimming pool, a giant chess board in the garden, bee hives and its own, woods, lake and kitchen garden. Il Palagio, the couple's 16th century villa, which is 45 minutes southeast of Florence in the Chianti region, produces wine, olive oil and honey. Guests will be able to dine in the wine cellar which is lined with 'enormous ancient barrels' says the Italian estate agency Immobiliare. 16th century villa: Sting bought the estate, which was run down, in 1999 . Celebrity couple Sting and Trudie: The decision to rent out their cottages  may have been prompted by a new property tax . Cultured: The 900-acre grounds boast a lake, woods, a five-acre kitchen garden and bee hives . Since buying the run-down estate in 1999, Sting has renovated property and bought more land from the previous owner, Duke Simone Vincenzo Velluti di San Clemente. He put a 10ft statue of Buddha in the chapel at the main house. Sting's decision to open the doors of his home to the public may have been prompted by new property tax laws introduced by the hard-pressed Italian government. Immobiliare spokesman Andrea Polo told the Daily Telegraph: I don't know how much money you can make selling honey, but with the new tax Sting will have been handed a huge housing tax bill last year. 'It is a lovely property, so it is clear the place will be in demand. String is so unconventional and doesn't live in an ivory tower so he might show up at your event.' Rock star setting: The Il Palagio villa was built in the 16th century and produces honey, wine and olive oil . On Sting's website,wines like When we Dance are promoted along with Thousand Flowers honey and the property's Il Palagio olive oil.

"A vain Malaysian man who ordered a penis enlarger online was stunned when the device was delivered - a magnifying glass! To add insult to injury the magnifying glass came with an instruction that would at least prevent the man from causing injury to himself. It read: Do Not Use in Sunlight. A Malaysian man identified only as Ong has complained after he spent the equivalent of Â£100 on a penis enlarger online, but was sent a magnifying glass worth just Â£5 instead . The victim of an elaborate scam, which cost him the equivalent of Â£100 for a Â£5 magnifyer has been named only as Ong, the chairman of Malaysia's customer complaints bureau, Mr Seri Michael Chong, told The Star newspaper. 'As you can imagine, he is feeling rather disgruntled,' said Mr Chong. The deflated and embarrassed customer has not come forward to reveal who he ordered the penis enlarger from. 'The unfortunate gentleman is just one of many who have fallen victims to these kind of misleading scams,' Mr Chong said. 'Men and women are equally vulnerable to these scams. Three people lost a total of more than Â£15,000 to these scams this year alone.' The man has refused to come forward and name the company he bought the enlarger from. Lawyers say he is unlikely to get his money back due to the dubious nature the business . Online tricksters, he said, lure their victims by selling their products at a low price and very often the items never get to their customers. Lawyer Alex Kok said that unsatisfied customers who wished to sue online criminals would find it difficult to do so due to the dubious nature of the business. 'It is especially hard if there is no proof of purchase, such as receipts.

"Sasha and Malia Obama are big fans of Beyonce and Jay Z but neither of the girls have any interest in politics, their parents have revealed. 'They love Jay Z. They love Beyonce. Sasha is still a One Direction fan, although I think Malia has become a little less into boy bands,' Mrs Obama said in a joint interview for People Magazine. 'They've gotten to know Beyonce, and she has always been very sweet to them,' Mr Obama added. How embarrassing: Mrs Obama told how sometimes the girls shy away from introducing their dad to their friends because he can be too formal or ask too many questions . Though the girls were not present for the interview, which was excerpted online, they appeared to be the only ones picking pop culture favorites as the President remained diplomatic when asked who he would rather spend the day with: Duck Dynasty or Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. The question was a loaded one- since Mr Obama has previously criticized Keeping Up With The Kardashians and called Kanye 'jacka**' after the rapper interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance speech. The women: Mr Obama said that he is surrounded by 'opinionated, strong, tall women' (seen together at a Christmas event on Sunday) Any old grievances were ignored, however, when President Obama was talking to People. 'The Duck Dynasty family seems like a pretty fun bunch, so I can see how that would be pretty fun. Kanye's music is outstanding, though. I've got a lot of his stuff on my iPad. If it was a concert, then I might not mind listening to him,' Mr Obama said. He may have been trying to avoid a skirmish with Kanye but incidentally ended up on a landmine as the timing of this article is a bad one for the Duck Dynasty clan. Patriarch Phil Robertson was quoted today as bashing gay men and lesbians in a recent interview and GLAAD has called for an apology. While the celebrity connections that come with the presidency undoubtedly prove popular with the first daughters friends, the same doesn't always translate for the President himself. 'Malia had friends over, and there was a question about whether she was going to even introduce them (to her dad), because sometimes he gets a little formal, asking them about school and interests. She says ""I donât know if my friends can handle that."" But she said that you actually did quite well,' Mrs Obama said. 'I acquitted myself well. I did not embarrass her,' Mr Obama said. One thing that the entire family gets on board with is their light-hearted criticism of their father. 'Look, I've got three opinionated, strong, tall women, and if they get together, they can have fun about my ears or being too loud or how I dress,' he said. He does credit his daughters for being the ones to introduce him to social media tools, even though his administration and campaigns have touted their prowess for years. 'Technology is an area where they still help us old fogies out. You know, Instagram, Vine, those are all things that I first heard from them,' Mr Obama said. Up on the trends: Sasha and Malia, seen here at their father's second inaugural, were reportedly the ones to introduce the President to Instagram and Vine . The Obamas were interviewed as part of the magazine's Most Intriguing issue, and they did touch on heavier subjects like the NSA surveillance program and the beleaguered health care roll out but only briefly. He said how he was both 'frustrated' about the Snowden disclosures that prompted him to make an awkward call to German chancellor Angela Merkel after it was revealed that records of her phone calls were collected, and he found the sign up process for healthcare.gov 'frustrating'. One thing that he did seem upbeat about was the prospect of having more good news to report when he meets with People Magazine again next year- though even that promise will leave many upset. The White House Press Corps are currently in a public battle with the administration due to their restrictive access guidelines that prevent regular interviews with the President and forbids photographers from attending largely ceremonial events that they were previously invited to cover. 'These so-called private events include meetings with world leaders and other visitors of major public interest â just the sorts of activities photojournalists should, and used to, have access to,' Santiago Lyon, the director of photography for the Associated Press wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times.","Barack and Michelle Obama talked about their daughters love of Jay Z and Beyonce who he said has been 'very sweet' to the girls .

"A French media firestorm has been circulating claims that Barack Obama and Beyonce are dangerously in love. It came as Francois Hollande, Franceâs head of state and a well-known love cheat, arrived in America on an official state visit without his now-ex partner, ValÃ©rie Trierweiler. Rumours of an affair between the American president and the superstar singer- both of whom are married- were first made on Europe 1 radio station this morning. Scroll down for video . Go-to singer: President Obama is an open fan of Beyonce as well as her husband Jay Z and they have served as fundraisers for his presidential campaigns . Close: She was chosen to sing America the Beautiful at his second inauguration . They led to denials from the Washington Post, who were said to be preparing to break the incredible story. Kristine Coratti, director of communications for the newspaper, said: âI can tell you that itâs falseâ, adding âThe Washington Post does not produce articlesâ of this kind. But Pascal Rostain, the photographer who last month took photographs of Mr Hollande secretly visiting a Paris love nest on the back of moped and wearing a crash helmet, spoke of the alleged relationship. He said revelations of any kind of affair between Mr Obama, 52, and Beyonce, 32, would send shockwaves around the world. Main squeeze: Beyonce also sang the First Couple's first dance at his 2009 inauguration . Beyonce performed âAmerica the Beautifulâ at Obamaâs inauguration in 2009 and the pair are firm friends. 'You know, at this moment, in the United States, thereâs something huge which is about to happen,â Mr Rostain told interviewer Jean-Marc Morandini. âIndeed, it will come out tomorrow in the Washington Post. We cannot say that it is from the gutter press - a supposed liaison between President Barack Obama and Beyonce. I can assure you that the world will talk.â Mr Rostainâs claims were reported by a range of respected media in France, including Le Figaro and Le Point. Solo: The rumor comes as French President Francois Hollande arrived in America Monday for a state visit (seen here with Deputy US Chief of Protocol Natalie Jones) Guy trip: President Obama met him at Andrews Air Force Base and the pair traveled to Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's house in Virginia for a tour . Mr Rostain was the first to know for sure that Mr Hollande was cheating on his first lady, Valerie Trierwelier, with the actress, Julie Gayet. Referring to Mr Obama and his wife Michelle, Mr Rostain said: âFor the first time, there are still images or televised ones of the Obama couple becoming a bit distant. âOne can legitimately pose questions. We were told the same thing by the pictures of Hollande and Trierweiler.â Questioned about the Obama-Beyonce claims later today, Mr Rostain said they were a 'joke'. Split: Hollande's visit comes on the heels of his break up from his longtime partner Valerie Trierweiler after it was discovered that he was having an affair with a younger actress . Firestarter: Photographer Pascal Rostain is the one who caught the French President on a motor scooter going to visit his mistress . The 20 year age gap between Mr Obama and Beyonce is almost the same as that between Mr Hollande, 59, and Ms Gayet, 41. Mr Obama is a well-known fan of the singer, having invited her to perform at numerous occasions, including at Michelleâs 50th birthday party at the White House last month. There have also been rumours of increasing tensions in the Obama marriage, although Beyonceâs marriage to rapper Jay Z, 44, is said to be rock solid. In recent weeks an alleged affair between former president Bill Clinton and celebrity beauty Elizabeth Hurley turned out to be made up.

"It is a mammoth deal that secures his status as Liverpool's talisman for many years to come. Raheem Sterling, at the age of 20, is about to put pen to paper on a staggering contract worth Â£25million over the next five years. But where does the England star rank among the hottest young properties in the big European leagues? We count down our top 10. 10. Jetro Willems (PSV Eindhoven and Holland) The most experienced member of our list, Willems was barely out of school when he started playing in the Eredivisie with Sparta Rotterdam. A move to PSV Eindhoven proved a springboard for the 20-year-old left-back and he is now a regular for the Holland national team too. Indeed, at 18 years and 71 days, he was the youngest player ever to feature at a European Championship finals in 2012. Willems in action for Holland in a recent Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia in Amsterdam . 9. Max Meyer (Schalke and Germany) The latest absurdly talented attacking midfielder to come along the German conveyor belt, Meyer has inevitably drawn comparisons with Mario Gotze. The Schalke man, 19, credits the close control and movement required in futsal, which he played as a youngster, for his progress. Meyer is an important cog in the Schalke team and has 68 appearances for them, as well as a cap for Germany. Max Meyer celebrates a goal for Schalke in their Champions League match with Maribor this season . 8. Ross Barkley (Everton and England) Only 21, Barkley has established himself as a mainstay in the Everton team and as a regular for England too - and don't expect him to budge anytime soon. The midfielder possesses that rare blend of strength, pace and technique that allows him to take games by the scruff of the neck and he's demonstrated that quality time after time. He is closing in on 100 competitive Everton appearances and has won 10 caps for his country though there are suggestions a big-money move could be afoot. Ross Barkley embarks on another bustling run for Everton against Hull City on New Year's Day . 7. Saul Niguez (Atletico Madrid and Spain) Tipped to become the next great Spanish midfielder, Saul came through the ranks at Atletico Madrid having joined the club from neighbours Real aged 14. But it was a loan spell at Rayo Vallecano last season that was the making of him and their better-than-expected 12th-place finish in La Liga was in no small part due to his influence. Capped by Spain to Under 21 level, Saul is an uncompromising tackler with quick wits and a very good reading of the game. Saul Niguez celebrates scoring for Atletico Madrid in a La Liga game with Deportivo La Coruna . 6. Mateo Kovacic (Inter Milan and Croatia) A man very much on the radar of the leading Premier League clubs, the versatile Croatian international Kovacic, 20, has already seen and done a great deal. He played 73 times for his first club, Dinamo Zagreb, before arriving at San Siro in 2012 and has since clocked up 73 more games as an important member of the team. His career has seen him flit between defensive and advanced midfield positions but with his accomplished dribbling and passing, he is adept at both roles. Mateo Kovacic (left) takes on PSG's Marco Verratti during a recent friendly match in Morocco . 5. Hakan Calhanoglu (Bayer Leverkusen and Turkey) At the age of just 20, Calhanoglu is regarded as the best free-kick taker in Europe and he has certainly been illuminating the Bundesliga with his set-piece prowess. He left struggling Hamburg for Bayer Leverkusen in the summer in a deal worth Â£12m and has already found the net seven times in both domestic and European competition. Calhanoglu is so highly rated, Germany wanted him to represent them but he chose the country of his parents, Turkey, and has so far collected five caps. Free-kick master Hakan Calhanoglu playing for Bayer Leverkusen this season . 4. Gerard Deulofeu (Sevilla, on loan from Barcelona, and Spain) A young man who needs no introduction to Premier League fans following his highly impressive loan spell with Everton last season. Deulofeu, 20, was shipped out again by Barcelona at the start of the summer - this time to Sevilla - but many were quick to question why Luis Enrique had not kept him. His speed and direct style of attack mark Deulofeu, who can play on the wing or further forward, as an exciting player to watch. Gerard Deulofeu was a hit at Everton when on loan from Barcelona last season . 3. Adrien Rabiot (Paris Saint-Germain and France) One of the hottest properties on the continent, Rabiot is wanted by a host of top Premier League clubs after struggling to hold down a place in the PSG side. It's a frustrating situation for the highly-regarded 19-year-old midfielder, whose command on the pitch, skill and incisive passing are more mature than his years. Capped by France up to Under 21 standard, Rabiot is likely to make the step up if he can gain regular football, potentially in England. PSG's Adrien Rabiot (right) playing against Inter Milan in a friendly match in Marrakech last month . 2. Raheem Sterling (Liverpool and England) Blessed with a magnetic touch and lightning pace, Sterling was a dynamic part of Liverpool's brush with Premier League title glory last season and is arguably English football's greatest hope for the future. Still just 20, Sterling seems to have accomplished an awful lot already, with over 100 appearances and 18 goals for Liverpool, and 13 caps for his country. And his achievements are being noticed - Sterling won the Golden Boy Award for the best young player in Europe last month. Raheem Sterling won the Golden Boy award recently for being Europe's best young player . 1. Munir El Haddadi (Barcelona and Spain) It's clear that Barcelona feel the time has come for Munir, their 19-year-old wonderkid, and they have used him in several matches this season. As he had demonstrated time after time in Barcelona's youth ranks, the La Masia prodigy boasts fleet of foot, speed of thought, bags of confidence and a willingness to shoot at goal. That is now being unleashed on defences in La Liga and the Champions League, with many glittering years likely to be ahead of him.

"A former Marine changed his plea to guilty today on the first day of his murder trial after admitting to strangling his wife and dumping her body in a river. Caleb Crew, 26, appeared in court on Monday morning for the first day of his trial in Fairfax County, Virginia and told the judge that he wanted to change his plea to guilty for first-degree murder. Crew, who served in Afghanistan, had confessed to killing his wife Andrea Crew, 31, and throwing her in theÂ Occoquan River last year. Scroll down for video . Caleb Crew pleaded guilty in a Virginia court on Monday morning to strangling his wife (pictured left, with their two young daughters) and throwing her body in a river . Friends said that the ex-Marine had been abusive towards his wife, a Colombian native and the mother of their daughters, aged four years old and 11 months old. In July 2013, police received a 911 call from the family home in Fairfax where Mrs Crew said that her husband poured motor oil over her,Â News 4Â reported.

Mrs Crew had suffered domestic violence at her husband's hands before she was murdered . The Marine admitted he then strangled his wife with his tie in a parking lot, telling her 'goodbye', the Washington Post reported. He dumped her body in the woods and later that night went back to put her body in a bag, weighing her down with dumbbells and granite. He threw her in the river along the interstate. He reported his wife missing to police the following day. Her body was found in the river by a person on a boat a week later and Crew was arrested.

The panel released their full judgment on December 21 and revealed that Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, admitted to twice telling Leicester supporters to âf*** offâ after the defeat in the East Midlands. 'We considered the player's previous record and concluded that he is an habitual offender against the laws of the game, and one for whom there needs to be a deterrent to combat a clear pattern of offending, both on and off the field,' read the judgement. 'The player is without doubt an exceptionally talented individual, but he has an appalling disciplinary record, both on and off the field.' In his time at London Irish the fullback was banned for five weeks for a dangerous tackle on Bath's Tom Biggs . The England star was also suspended from the Saxons squad after being arrested for an alleged assault . Armitage faced a disciplinary hearing for this dangerous high tackle on Scotland's Chris Paterson .

"It took less than 24 hours for Stuart Lancasterâs cautious optimism about the fitness of his players to be dimmed after it emerged that Joe Launchbury will miss next yearâs RBS 6 Nations following spinal surgery. The 23-year-old lock, a pivotal member of the England squad when fit, must have his operation on Friday to correct the nerve problem in his neck which has caused discomfort for several months. Launchbury missed the autumn internationals and had hoped a period of extended rest would cure the debilitating injury. But Wasps director of rugby Dai Young revealed on Sunday that this recovery was behind schedule, raising the spectre of surgery. Joe Launchbury (right, in action against New Zealand in July) will undergo neck surgery on Friday . Lunchbury's injury is understood to be similar to the one sustained by Dan Cole last season . Launchbury will miss England's Six Nations campaign in a blow to Stuart Lancaster . Those fears were confirmed on Thursday when Wasps announced the 20-cap star will have a âroutine decompressionâ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc which has caused him to lose power in his arm. Young said: âAs you would expect, this is a frustrating time for Joe, but the most important thing in all of this isnât rugby, itâs Joeâs long-term health. We have consulted specialists in this field and they have recommended surgery as the best option to get him back to full fitness for the long term. âJoe is in good hands. He is being looked after by one of the worldâs leading surgeons and he will have the full support of the Wasps and England medical teams during his rehabilitation period.â Launchburyâs recovery is expected to take between three and four months, making it is possible he will not play again this season. The news came a day after Lancaster learned of Lions prop Alex Corbisieroâs imminent return to action for Northampton. The 20-cap star will have a âroutine decompressionâ of a nerve in an attempt to cure a bulging disc . Launchbury has not played for Wasps since November due to his neck problem . Chris Robshaw: captain out for four weeks with âstingerâ shoulder injury. Joe Launchbury: out for up to four months with neck surgery pending. Brad Barritt: lengthy lay-off with calf injury. Ed Slater: lucky if he plays this season (knee). Tom Croft: horrendous run of injuries with setback after setback. Tom Johnson: neck injury is keeping him sidelined. Manu Tuilagi: groin injury proving hard to shake off. Will Fraser: back injury causing Saracen problems. Recently returned:Â Geoff Parling (concussion), Mako Vunipola (back, knee), Tom Youngs (shoulder), Dan Cole (neck surgery). Back soon: Alex Corbisiero (shoulder surgery). Launchburyâs injury â understood to be similar to the one suffered last season by England prop Dan Cole â raises more questions about the high number of neck injuries sustained by rugbyâs top stars. Some believe those most proficient at âjacklingâ for possession over the ball are especially vulnerable because their necks are exposed at the breakdown. Another injury causing concern â concussion â looks to have also ruled Ireland fly-half Jonny Sexton out of action until at least February. The Racing Metro star has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November and French newspaper LâEquipe reported on Thursday that he has been suffering headaches and nausea ever since. After consulting a neurologist, it has been decided Sexton â who was also knocked unconscious in last seasonâs final Six Nations clash against France and was sidelined for several weeks â should not play until February 14 at the earliest. That makes the Lions No 10 certain to miss Irelandâs opening game against Italy but with such a notoriously difficult injury to asses, there are fears Sexton could be out for even longer. Racing coach Laurent Labit said: âAs long as Jonny Sexton doesnât feel 100 per cent, we cannot take any risks.â Sexton has not played since suffering a head injury playing for Ireland against Australia in November . It has been reported that Sexton will be able to take part in non-contact training, although strict return-to-play protocols say a player can only return to non-contact training 24 hours after becoming symptom free. Sexton has struggled to settle at Racing following his move to Paris last summer and will return to Leinster at the end of this season, with New Zealandâs world-record points scorer Dan Carter confirmed yesterday as his replacement. Carter â who will earn close to Â£800,000 a year â predicts the move will be an âawesome experienceâ, while Racingâs millionaire owner Jacky Lorenzetti denies the 33-year-oldâs wages are excessive because of his enormous marketing potential. âCarter will be the best-paid player at Racing but also the least expensive because of the economic benefits,â Lorenzetti said. Meanwhile, European champions Toulon are considering suing the two Leicester Tigers supporters whose testimony led to Delon Armitage receiving a three-month ban on Wednesday. Sexton looks certain to miss Ireland's Six Nations opener against Italy, but is in danger of missing even more . Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal was incensed by the length of the ban, imposed after a three-man disciplinary panel found the former England full back guilty of verbally abusing fans following Toulonâs European Cup defeat at Welford Road 12 days ago. âWe arenât discounting the eventuality of going after these two supporters in court for false testimonies,â said Boudjellal. âThis is an extraordinary decision which rests only on the allegations of two opposition supporters, whose objectivity we can legitimately put in doubt. âThere is no formal proof, no official document, not even television pictures, to attest to the veracity of these testimonies.â","Joe Launchbury will have neck surgery on Friday on advice of specialists .

"Steven Gerrard has told LA Galaxy that he isnât going to America just to sit on the beach when he quits Liverpool and moves to Major League Soccer this summer. The Galaxy confirmed Gerrardâs signing on Wednesday following his decision to turn down the offer of a contract extension and leave Liverpool after 17 years. Gerrard has admitted that he would have signed a new deal if one had been offered to him earlier in the season, and his former Anfield teammate Danny Murphy said that the clubâs treatment of their captain âstinksâ. Sportsmailâs mock-up of how Steven Gerrard could look in the colours of LA Galaxy . Gerrard discusses his future move in a video interview with LA Galaxy . The Liverpool captain insists he has not moved to the MLS for a 'holiday' but to continue winning medals . However, the 34-year-old midfielder is already looking to the future and insists that he is joining the five-time MLS champions to help them win more trophies rather than soak up the sunshine in California. âFootball is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years,â said Gerrard. âIâm not going over there for a holiday or to enjoy myself. Iâm going over there to win, and if I win and play well, then my life becomes more enjoyable. âI still feel like a player. I still feel like I can perform for a number of years, so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality â a team that is used to winning but also a team thatâs got people that want to win in the future.

Thatâs how I want to finish my career, so they are the reasons I chose LA Galaxy. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team.â Gerrard admitted, however, that the lure of life in Los Angeles played a big part when it came to choosing the right move for his wife Alex and their three young daughters after so long on Merseyside. âThereâs obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are located as well,â he said. âThat will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. âThe big challenge is going to be settling in. Iâve lived in Liverpool all my life. Iâm a Scouser through and through. I love my city, I love my roots. But, you only get one life. Itâs important to try different things and itâs also a big thing for my children too; to give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well.â The Reds icon admitted that he was a 'Scouser through and through' and would have to adapt to a new lifestyle . Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment . Gerrard assured Liverpool fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club . Gerrard also offered hope to fans still reeling from the news of his departure, saying that he will be back at Anfield in the future. He added: âMy message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season â and hopefully come back. âThatâs the message: my relationship with Liverpool doesnât end in the summer. In fact, it will never end.â However, Murphy believes that Liverpool and manager Brendan Rodgers should have tried harder to keep Gerrard, and suggested that it was always their intention to let him leave. âLiverpool let it get to November or December before they offered him anything,â Murphy told talkSPORT. âThat says to me that the club and Brendan were already thinking about him moving on. It stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that. We saw the same thing with Chelsea and Frank Lampard. Clubs say, âWe have offered him a new dealâ, but itâs always on reduced wages. âItâs not how you should treat someone who has put their all into a club.â My next team is going to be La Galaxy. I'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that's the team I will join at the end of the season. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. The talks Ive had with them are very positive, they basically told me what I wanted to hear. They told me about the winning mentality of the club, their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so I will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there. There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are locateed as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. It's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch and then hopefully I can enjoy it off the pitch as well. The big challenge is going to be settling in, I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through. I love my City. I love my roots. But, you only get one life, it's important to try different things and experiences and it's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well. It's perfect timing for this new challenge. I'm really excited and looking forward to it, but I've still got a few things that I've got to try and achieve before I go so my focus is on that. There will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move. It's the right time for a new challenge, a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too. I'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the US. I've watched a lot of their games and I also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and I've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career I believe the timing is right to move on. I still feel like a player, I still feel like I can perform for a number of years so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that's got people within there that want to win in the future. I know the players have got a winning mentality, they've proved it over a number of years. Having spoken to the manager, Bruce Arena, and also the people above him - they're very aggressive and they want success and that's what I want. That's how I want to finish my career so they are the reasons that I chose LA Galaxy. I'd like to think I've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager, the CEO and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how I see myself. I'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis. I like to try and find consistency. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team. What I can guarantee is that I will go there and work hard and I will make sacrifices and be dedicated to perform at a consistent level and hopefully play my part in success for this team. Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years. I'm not going over here for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I am going over here to win and if I win and play well then my life becomes more enjoyable. My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. It's been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season. And hopefully come back - that's the message, my relationship with Liverpool doesn't end in the summer. In fact it will never end. For the new team I am going to, I will come over there with the same attitude which 110 per cent every day - be professional, makes sacrifices and try and contribute. I like to think I'm a team player and I will play my part to try and help the team.","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will leave Anfield for LA Galaxy in July .

"Tarbuck spent 11 months on police bail, during which time he was unable to work . Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck has said accusers in sexual assault cases should be named, after his harrowing ordeal when he spent nearly a year on police bail. The entertainer said he had suffered the 'worst year imaginable' since his arrest in April 2013 as part of the Â£2.7million Operation Yewtree triggered by Jimmy Savile's abuses. Tarbuck spent 11 months on police bail, during which time he was unable to work. But in March he was told there would be no charges over an allegation of child sex abuse in the 1970s made by six individuals. Tarbuck, said he was relieved that his name has been cleared, but disturbed that those who pointed the finger at him remain anonymous while he was held in a blaze of publicity. In an interview with the Sunday People, he said: 'What can you do? The only thing that annoyed me, other than the lies, the total lies, is that they remain anonymous and no one knows who they are. 'It upset me. It upset my family. It was a lot of stress, but you do find out who your friends are at a time like that. 'You wake up at seven o'clock in  the morning with a knock on the door and there are 14 policemen up your drive and you've gotta go, ""What?"" 'One day when I write it out people won't believe it and will say, ""It wasn't like that, was it?"" I'll say, ""Yes it was."" It was blatant, total lies.' Tarbuck said a group of women 'jumped on the bandwagon' after his arrest became public last year. 'They claimed I had made inappropriate sexual advances during Top of the Pops in 1963, he said. 'Not only have I never met these women, I have never appeared on Top of the Pops â which in any event didn't start until 1964. 'I would think on certain areas it's a witch-hunt. Maybe there has been a bit of a witch-hunt. And why? Is it envy? Is it greed? Is it illness? Is it mistaken identity? I don't know.' Scroll down for video . Jimmy Tarbuck pictured outside the London Palladium in 1969 - he will return to the venue tonight . Now, with his name untarnished, Tarbuck will mark a triumphant comeback on tonight's London Palladium show. And it has a special place in his heart, as it was the stage from where he hosted Saturday Night at the London Palladium for two years from 1965. He said: 'It's just a thrill walking on that stage. You're playing in the Premier League and the Palladium is that - it doesn't get any better than that. 'The Palladium is the most famous theatre in the world.' The Liverpudlian comedian said he had suffered the 'worst year imaginable' but will make a comeback at the London Palladium tonight . Known for his gap-toothed grin, broad Liverpudlian accent and love of golf, 'Tarby' began his showbusiness career aged 18 as a member of a touring rock and roll show and then as a Redcoat for a Butlins holiday camp in Brighton. After leaving school at 15 his first jobs were as a mechanic and sweeping the floor of a ladies' hairdresser. He recalled: 'It was a brilliant way to meet girls.' Tarbuck was classmates with John Lennon at Dovedale Junior School in Liverpool. He claimed the former Beatle once spiked his drink with speed. The entertainer's first taste of mainstream success came in 1964, when he presented It's Tarbuck 65! on ITV. He went on to host numerous quiz shows, including Winner Takes All and Full Swing. In the 1980s, he hosted Sunday night variety shows Live From Her Majesty's, Live from the Piccadilly and Live from the Palladium. He was awarded an OBE for services to showbusiness and charity in 1994. Operation YewtreeÂ was launched in October 2012 after Jimmy Savile, who died aged 84 in 2011, was exposed as a predatory paedophile who abused hundreds of victims. David Lee Travis - The former Radio 1 star  was given a suspended sentence of three months for indecently assaulting a woman in 1995 last month. At an earlier trial, he was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault, alleged to have taken place between 1976 and 2008. William Roache - The Coronation Street actor was cleared  of sex charges dating back to the 1960s. He always maintained his innocence and blamed hysteria after the Jimmy Savile scandal for 'money-grabbing' women who falsely accused him of sex offences. Gary Glitter - The former pop star was arrested on October 28, 2012, on sex abuse allegations.Â The convicted paedophile was charged with six counts of indecent assault, one of unlawful sex with a girl under 13, and one count of administering a drug to obtain sex.

Wilfred Deâath - The former BBC producer was arrested on November 11, 2012 on suspicion of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but was released without charge after a woman withdrew a complaint against him. The 76-year-old has blasted police for being âoverzealousâ, pursuing âspuriousâ claims, and failing âlamentablyâ to stop Jimmy Savileâs reign of terror while he was still alive. Jim Davidson - The comedian was arrested on January 2 last year on suspicion of sexual offences, but the  Big Brother winner was later told he would not face further action.

"Convicted sex offender Dave Lee Travis was unrepentant as he was spared jail â claiming a Â£1million investigation had failed to prove he was a âsexual predatorâ. The disgraced DJ, 69, showed no remorse as he said his conviction for molesting a young researcher at the BBC had left him âmortified and disappointedâ. He ignored calls for him to apologise to his victim. In a defiant speech outside court Travis, who has called the case a celebrity witch-hunt, appeared to suggest the guilty verdict was the result of prosecution mud-slinging. He said: âWith millions of pounds of taxpayersâ money, thousands of hours of police resources, the judge accepted today that the Crown had failed to prove their case against me â namely that I was a sexual predator. Scroll down for video . Dave Lee Travis and his wifeÂ Marianne arrive at Southwark Crown Court, where the former radio DJ was given a sentence of three months in prison suspended for two years . Travis was found guilty of groping a researcher in her 20s behind the scenes of the Mrs Merton Show . Travis (pictured leaving court) was found guilty of groping researcher's breasts for 10-15 seconds after he saw her smoking and said 'your poor little lungs' âI have always worried, as have my close family and friends, that if the prosecution threw enough mud at me, some of it might stick. âWhile I am relieved I have been able to prove that I am not a sexual predator, I am mortified that I was convicted of one count. And it is of little comfort to me that I was acquitted of so many others.â Former Top Of The Pops presenter Travis, who could have faced a maximum two-year jail sentence for indecent assault, was given a three-month sentence suspended for two years. Judge Anthony Leonard, QC, told Southwark Crown Court Travis had taken advantage of his status as a âwell-known media personalityâ to molest the 22-year-old researcher on the Mrs Merton Show in the belief âshe would not make a fussâ. The woman, now a successful TV personality in her own right, said she was âsubjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of workâ which left her âparalysed with fearâ. Travis has protested his innocence throughout the trial and tried to dismiss other women who claimed they had been groped by him as âfantasists and liarsâ. The Mrs Merton researcher said she had found suggestions that she was courting fame or seeking a financial pay-out particularly hurtful. Speaking outside court, Travis said he was 'mortified' and 'disappointed' that he had been found guilty . He added: 'Those close to me, including my wife Marianne (right) who has been by my side the whole time, we all know the truth and I am grateful for that' He also attacked his prosecution, which he said had cost the taxpayer 'millions' and used thousands of pounds of police resources . Judge Leonard said Travis had used his celebrity status and large frame to intimidate his victim. The victim told of her horror at the attack in an impact statement read to the court: . âI was a naive and trusting 22-year-old when I was subjected to an unprovoked and terrifying physical assault at my place of work. 'I was too paralysed with fear to confront my assailant but immediately told my boss. âI feel lucky, I was psychologically robust enough to deal with the distress, thanks largely to the support of my friends and colleagues. âI have coped by using humour as a defence mechanism. But remembering the incident still takes me back to feeling like a scared, vulnerable young woman. 'Being called a liar and fantasist and being forced to relive the events of the past has been painful. I was particularly horrified at the defendantâs allegations that desire for attention or financial greed motivated me. âI have sought to preserve my anonymity and have no intention of claiming compensation now or in the future. I simply wanted to tell the truth and was prepared to go through this unpleasant process to that end. âI am grateful I have always been believed by those who know me, and the members of the jury also appreciated I was telling the truth.â He told him: âAt over 6ft tall you towered over herâ¦ You pinned her up against the wall and started to touch her rib cage and slid your hands up over her breasts and her clothes, and started squeezing them. You left your hands there for several seconds. âShe said that, with you looming over her, she felt scared and when she got away she was shaking and a bit beside herself. She described her feeling of being violated.â The BBC now faces being sued by a number of women who claim Travis assaulted them during his 30-year career with the corporation. He could also face civil law suits, including one from a woman who claims he attacked her when she was a âpre-teenâ in the 1970s. Travis, who was tried under his real name David Griffin, was cleared earlier this year of 12 indecent assaults dating back to the mid-1970s, including an alleged assault on a 15-year-old girl. That jury failed to reach verdicts on alleged attacks against two other women and prosecutors decided he should face a retrial on those charges plus a third count of indecent assault against the Mrs Merton researcher, who had come forward during his first trial but was too late to be added to the charges. At the second trial he was convicted of that 1995 indecent assault, found not guilty of indecent assault on a second woman and the jury was hung on the other allegation, which was formally recorded as a not guilty verdict. Travis, who was not ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register because the indecent assault was committed in 1995, before the register was introduced, left court hand-in-hand with his wife Marianne, 66. Travis was first arrested in October 2012 under Operation Yewtree, Scotland Yard's Â£3million investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of allegations against the late DJ Jimmy Savile. Sentencing Travis, JudgeÂ Leonard said the DJ's offence was of a 'different order' to other high profile convictions under Operation Yewtree . The court heard that Travis assaulted the woman in 1995 after appearing on the Mrs Merton Show (pictured) Max Clifford was sentenced to eight years in jail after being convicted of eight counts of indecent assault as part of Operation Yewtree . Dave Lee Travis is the third celebrity scalp to be claimed by sex crime inquiry Operation Yewtree. The 69-year-old was the fourth figure with links to the entertainment industry to be arrested as part of the investigation, which has now seen a total of 17 people questioned by police. The operation came in for criticism after its first two attempted prosecutions, against Coronation Street actors William Roache and Michael Le Vell, both ended with not guilty verdicts. However, in April this year the investigation secured its first conviction after Max Clifford was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on teenage girls, and sentenced to eight years in jail. During the trial the prosecution claimed the celebrity kiss-and-tell publicist took pleasure in degrading teenagers after he promised to make them Bond girls or TV stars. Rolf Harris was the second celebrity figure to be convicted after he was found guilty of 12 counts of indecent assault in June. He was jailed for five years for assaulting girls aged between seven and 19 over the course of three decades in the Sixties, Seventies, and Eighties. On the first day of his trial, Harris put on a confident display - singing Jake The Peg and explaining how he invented the wobble board - but was eventually undone after admitting he had found one of his 13-year-old victims attractive. Entertainer Rolf Harris is also serving time behind bars after being found guilty of 12 indecent assaults . Operation Yewtree was launched in the wake of claims made against late DJ Jimmy Savile, who was exposed as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British history after an ITV documentary. So far eight people - including comedians Jim Davidson and Freddie Starr - have been told that no further action will be taken against them, and another three, including broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, remain on police bail. The other six have been charged. As well as the three convictions, former pop star Gary Glitter and ex-Radio One DJ Chris Denning are facing prosecution in separate cases. Driver David Smith was due to face trial but died before he could do so.","Dave Lee Travis sentenced to three months in jail suspended for two years .

"Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe, who is reported to be suffering from a series of health problems after having a heart attack . Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe was last night reported to be at death's door after a series of health problems including a heart attack. The 68-year-old serial killer, who murdered 13 women and tried to kill seven more, is said to be suffering a severe cough and struggling to eat and sleep at Broadmoor. A source said: 'If he doesn't improve, he's not got long left'. Sutcliffe was given 20 life sentences in 1981 for his killing spree between 1975 and 1980. The killer used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England. Sutcliffe, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, has now been locked up at the maximum security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire for 30 years. He made a bid for freedom in 2010 but a judge ruled he should never be released and should die in custody. Sutcliffe suffers from diabetes and his health started to deteriorate last year when he went to another hospital for a hernia operation. He then suffered a heart attack due to the stress of the procedure, The Sun reported last night. A source said the killer was now angry at Broadmoor staff as he had been waiting nearly two months to see a specialist about a hacking cough. The unnamed source said: 'He's in a bad way due to this cough. It's extremely severe. He's having difficulty eating and sleeping, and if they don't do something about the cough, it could bring another heart attack. 'He's angry with the staff and said he can't go on much more. 'He knows that not taking his medication will cause his blood pressure to go up and he knows how dangerous that is. He's said I'm not well, I'm not good at the moment. He's complained dreadfully about things. He thinks they are just not bothered.' The paper also said Sutcliffe had told a friend: 'Everything is being a struggle, even writing letters has been a big battle â everything's one big effort. 'The situation is bad. I have refused my medication yesterday and today.' And speaking about his cough, the murderer said: 'It's doing me a lot of harm. My chest aches, it's no good for my heart with the angina, you know. When I am coughing, I'm not eating. It's horrible.' A television documentary on the secure hospital was broadcast on Wednesday night, but paranoid schizophrenic Sutcliffe had declined to be involved. The Sun's source also said Sutcliffe was staying in an individual room with a bed, access to email, a TV and desk he uses to write to penpals. According to a source, Sutcliffe is staying in an individual room at Broadmoor, pictured, with a bed, access to email, a TV and a desk where he writes to penpals . The source said: 'He gets at least 30 letters per week and has lots of visitors.' It was also reported that Sutcliffe was now a Jehovah's Witness. The source said: 'He thinks that Armageddon will come and one day we will all live on paradise on Earth. 'He also thinks that when he dies all will be forgiven because he has faith and belief.' A hospital spokesman said: 'Broadmoor Hospital will not comment on any matter that would breach our duty to maintain patient confidentiality.'","68-year-old is suffering a series of health problems after having heart attack .

"Ryder Cup star Patrick Reed has vowed to learn from his mistakes after issuing a full apology for his foul-mouthed outburst on the opening day of the WGC-HSBC Champions Event in Shanghai. Reed is set to be fined by the PGA Tour after being caught on camera not only swearing at himself, but also using language which could be interpreted as homophobic. Television commentators apologised after Reed was clearly heard saying 'Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t,' after a bogey on the first hole, his 10th of the day, during Thursday's first round. Patrick Reed (above) faces punishment from the PGA Tour for his foul-mouthed outburst in Shanghai . The outburst was picked up television microphones after Reed made a bogey on his tenth hole . The 24-year-old later apologised for his 'unacceptable' choice of words via Twitter and was similarly contrite when speaking to reporters following his second round on Friday. 'Today I felt like I handled myself pretty well and yesterday I did not,' Reed said. 'Yesterday I made a stupid error, that's for sure. (I'm) sorry for definitely the words that I said and everything that went on on number one, which was my 10th hole. (It) never should have happened. Golf is a gentleman's game. 'Unfortunately it happened to me and all I can do is just learn from it and move on, and hopefully continue playing well and keep giving fans something to watch. Reed has vowed to learn from the incident and admits he has had temper issues on and off the course . Reed puts the outburst down to his passion for the game, but conceded he must keep his emotions in check . 'I'm young and growing up, I had temper issues, on and off the golf course. I live and die through every shot. I love the game so much and I expect perfection, but no one is ever going to be perfect in this game. It's just one of those things that I have to learn how to deal with and know how to handle and when I do a good job on it, I definitely play better. It got the best of me this week. 'The passion I have for the game is never going to change. It's just if I'm ever going to get upset at myself, especially after a Ryder Cup and at the level of golf I'm playing nowadays, you can't have outbursts. Unfortunately I did and happened to be on camera and it just happened.' Reed was often seen reacting to the crowds at Gleneagles while playing in the Ryder Cup in October . Masters champion Bubba Watson revealed Reed had shown him the incident and noticed how clearly the outburst had been picked up on television. 'I said, ""Well, we always learn something out of everything situation. So we obviously learned the microphones are pretty good over here,''' Watson joked.","Patrick Reed heard on TV saying 'Nice f****** three-putt you f****** f****t'

"Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell maintained his brilliant form at Sheshan International to remain in command at the halfway stage of the Â£5.4milllion WGC-HSBC Champions event in Shanghai. McDowell, who won all three of his matches in Europe's victory over the United States in September, carded a second successive 67 to lie 10 under par, three shots ahead of Gleneagles team-mate Ian Poulter. The 35-year-old Northern Irishman fired five birdies and no bogeys and has now played his last 11 rounds at the venue in 49 under par after finishing third in 2011 and again 12 months ago. Graeme McDowell  hits his tee-shot on the third hole during the second round of the WGC-HSBC Champions . The Northern Irishman leads the prestigious tournament by three shots at the halfway stage . McDowell putts on the 18th green, where he made par, at the Sheshan International Golf Club on Friday . Poulter, who was runner-up to Dustin Johnson last year and won the title when it was staged at Mission Hills in 2012, birdied four of his last five holes to match McDowell's 67. And double Masters champion Bubba Watson went one better with birdies at all five of the closing stretch in his 67 to finish six under alongside Japan's Hiroshi Iwata, whose 65 was the best score of the week so far. McDowell won the US Open in 2010 but has yet to win one of the WGC events and told Sky Sports 4: 'It would be very special. The WGC's are a special tier of events, there's no doubt about that and this has always been one I had my eye on. This one and Doral (venue for the WGC-Cadillac Championship) are the two golf courses I feel I perform well on. Ian Poulter is making a rare appearance this year at the top of the leaderboard after two good rounds . American Ryder Cup star Bubba Watson enjoyed a stunning run of birdies to close his round . 'But this is a world-class field. They are bunching up behind me and I have to get out there tomorrow and keep the pedal down and position myself for Sunday and give myself a sniff on the back nine.' Asked to explain his remarkable scoring at Sheshan, McDowell added: 'I think it's the fact you don't have to hit it a long way, you have to be accurate and I like these greens. I read them well here, this course is always so well presented and I just enjoy playing it. 'I didn't play as well as I did yesterday. I missed a lot more fairways, which is a big key on this golf course. You must find fairways to have a chance out there. I got lucky a couple of times and I made some good saves. 'It wasn't my best ball-striking round but I hung in there and I'm right where I want to be going into the weekend.' In contrast, Poulter was delighted with his performance in his second tournament with new Titleist clubs as he looked to put an injury-plagued campaign behind him. Hiroshi Iwata of Japan plays his second shot on the picturesque eighth hole during the second round . Jonas Blixt of Sweden plays out of trouble after hitting into the trees alongside the eighth hole . Sergio Garcia's partner Katharina Boehm watches . 'It was great. I played very, very solid,' said Poulter, who has slipped to 44th in the world rankings. 'Probably the best I've played all year, which is very exciting. 'It was a little frustrating the first 13 holes that I was missing chances, but four birdies in the last five holes, chances started to go in at the end, and I'm very happy. 'I played with Graeme in the last round last year and he likes this golf course and played well, and I've had success around here as well. So if you're within six shots, then you've got a great chance on Sunday.' Watson was just level par for his round after 13 holes but produced a brilliant finish with five birdies in a row, which included using his four wood to 'chip' in from the fringe on the 17th after a more orthodox chip in on the previous hole. 'It was a struggle,' said the left-hander, who finished eighth last year. 'I hit some good shots but couldn't make some putts. Hit some bad shots and made some putts. And then to finish that strong, it was a great round of golf, or great last five holes I guess you could say. 'It's kind of like where I was last year. I was hanging around right there going into the weekend so I look forward to the challenge. Hopefully I can play a little better this time on the weekend.' World No 2 Adam Scott had closed to within one of McDowell with four birdies in his first six holes, but ran up a quadruple-bogey nine on the eighth after a wild hook into the trees ended in an unplayable position and his fifth shot was stymied by a large rock in front of the green. The former Masters champion also double-bogeyed the ninth and dropped another shot on the 11th, but eagled the 14th and birdied the 16th in an eventful 72 that left him eight off the lead on two under.","Graeme McDowell leads HSBC Champions by three shots .

"Apprentice star and Celebrity Big Brother runner-up Luisa Zissman rigged an online vote to win a popularity contest, it has been claimed. Miss Zissman, 26, scooped the National Reality TV Award for Best Female Personality last year, beating rivals including Apprentice rival Leah Totton, former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh and I'm A Celebrity contestant Helen Flanagan. But it has been claimed that she employed an IT company to bombard an online voting form with automatic submissions and ramp up her total. Scroll down for video . Victorious: Luisa Zissman, left, pictured in September holding her National Reality TV Award for Best Female Personality . Under fire: A worried-looking Miss Zissman was spotted out in central London today after the claims emerged . In total, 4.5million votes were submitted across all the categories of the online competition, which was followed by a star-studded awards ceremony in London. She swapped messages with web firm seo77, who also ran a website for her, asking them to 'start the vote thing' ahead of the award, according to the Sun. An account belonging to the company later replied saying: 'Gave you a little hand. Ran it for three days. Do you want the vote details?' Miss Zissman later replies 'I won!!!! Will pay you in the morning.' 'Exchange': Miss Zissman exchanged the above messages with software firm seo77, according to the Sun. The left conversation took place before the awards and the right one afterwards, it is claimed (Not actual screen shots - images recreated using text from real messages exchanged) Overjoyed: The star posed happily with her award after the ceremony, telling fans 'thank you all so much!!!!' Rivals: Miss Zissman beat both Helen Flanagan, left, and Apprentice co-star Leah Totton, right, to win the prize . Topped: Former Made in Chelsea star Millie Mackintosh also lost out on the Best Female Personality prize . The alleged scam by seo77 involved . setting up a 'bot' program, which would be capable of generating . hundreds of bogus names and email addresses a minute. The technology would potentially have been able to tip the vote in Miss Zissman's favour, though the organisers of the awards have claimed their security software would stop any attempts. The reality TV star, who caused . controversy with her steamy interactions with rapper Dappy while on . appearing in Celebrity Big Brother, has well-established rivalries with . the other award nominees. The . mother of one fought her way to the final round of The Apprentice . against Leah Totton. But she lost out when Alan Sugar decided that her . baking business was less worthy of investment that Miss Totton's . proposal for cosmetic surgery clinics. She . has also clashed with former Coronation Street star and I'm a Celebrity . contestant Helen Flanagan, particularly over their much-flaunted . figures. Internet experts have influenced high-profile polls in the past by employing 'bot' software. The programs allow millions of automatically-generated entries to crowd out genuine votes and force a victory. The online version of TIME magazine's Person of the Year award is a frequent target. In 2009, a cult internet figure named Moot, who founded controversial message board 4Chan, topped the poll. He beat Gordon Brown and Barack Obama. Likewise, North Korean dictator Kin Jong-un won the 2012 poll by a margin of more than 2million votes thanks to an army of fans employing bots. While using such software is almost always against the rules of individual competitions, it is not illegal. In a recent interview with ZOO magazine, Miss Zissman floated the idea of facing her rival in a 'boob-off' after both have appeared in a series of scantily-clad photoshoots. She said: 'Apparently Helen Flanagan had the nerve to say that Iâm not classy... Every time I see a picture of her, her t**s are out.' 'Donât get me wrong â Iâve got no problem with that â but mine are better than hers anyway. Theyâre the best five grand I ever spent! Maybe we should have a boob-off.' However, Miss Zissman flatly denied that any attempts to influence the vote were made. She angrily denied the claims on Twitter, and alleged that seo77 were vengeful after she stopped employing them to run the baking business for her IT company. She later accused seo77 of making the allegations to get publicity, Tweeting: 'Does the fact this company are getting loads of publicity promoting themselves not tell anyone anything?constantly plugged at my expense!' In a statement sent to MailOnline, seo77 appeared to confirm the bot scam, and say they are sure that it worked. A spokesman said: 'seo77 can confirm that on client instruction, we designed and implemented a bot system which was programmed to automate votes in favour of one particular nominee shortlisted for the NRTV Awards 2013. 'Although we are confident that the nominee would have won the award regardless, it is our firm belief that the program was effective and certainly assisted our client in their endeavours.' The company also said it would normally keep such practices secret, and has launched an investigation into how the details emerged.

"Roman Catholics whoÂ  support traditional marriage and oppose gay rights are not bigots, a High Court judge declared yesterday. Mr Justice Sales said those who follow religious beliefs long established across Europe âcannot be equated with racist bigotsâ. Rather, he said, these Christian views âhave a legitimate place in a pluralist, tolerant and broadminded societyâ. Defeated: A Catholic adoption agency has been told it cannot turn away gay couples if its wants to keep its charitable status (file photo) His comments came at the end of a . four-year legal battle by the adoption society Catholic Care against . equality laws making it place children with gay couples. Despite his call for tolerance, Mr Justice Sales rejected the claims of the Leeds-based agency. His ruling means it will now abandon its 100-year-old adoption service, which found families for ten children every year. The judge told the Upper Tribunal that Parliament has madeÂ  discrimination against gayÂ  couples against the law. He added that the agency could not show weighty reasons why it should be an exception to this.

"Alleged kidnapper of Abigail Hernandez, Nathaniel Kibby, appeared in court today where prosecutors told the court that his shipping container had three sections - but would not describe the third area. Kibby was charged last month with snatching the teenager as she walked home from high school in October. Abigail, 15, returned home last month. The 34-year-old former machinist kept his head down as he entered court in Ossipee, New Hampshire today in handcuffs, wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and carrying a stamp addressed letter in his top pocket. Kibby's defense attorney sparred with prosecutors over evidence at the accused's trailer park home and shipping container. During arguments,Â Assistant Attorney General Jane YoungÂ revealed  the container is in three sections with the middle part being the largest. Scroll down for video . Nathaniel Kibby is escorted into court for a hearing Wednesday Aug. 6, 2014, is Ossipee, N.H. Kibby is charged with kidnapping 14-year-old Abigail Hernandez as she walked home from high school last October . Kibby is escorted into court for a hearing on Wednesday in his orange prison jumpsuit with a stamped and addressed envelope in the top pocket . An FBI investigator at Kibby's property in New Hampshire where the shipping container can clearly be seen in the background . According to the Boston Globe, 'the court is aware of' the third part of the container but she would give no other details because the investigation is ongoing. MailOnline revealed last week that the shipping container may have had three separate, sound-proofed rooms. One neighbor was even asked whether he thought Kibby could have dug a tunnel from his trailer to the container. The resident, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline last week: âThe FBI have been asking lots of different questions and they all seem to come back to the same couple of things. Have we ever seen him burning anything, or digging. âThey asked me about digging and burying twice and they specifically asked whether he would have been able to dig a tunnel from the container to the trailer. âIt seems very strange and makes you wonder what they think he was doing in there. I knew the guy and unfortunately I sometimes saw him on social occasions, but I tried to avoid him as much as possible. He was a strange man. âI know people who have been in that container and they say it was split into three rooms. He did a lot of work back there. It was sound proofed as far as I know. âI have heard he kept Abby in there for the whole winter. It would not surprise me. There is a lot of noise round here, with kids screaming and shouting, so it is possible no one would have heard anything, especially if it was sound proofed. He was always going back there. No one thought anything of it.' Defense attorney Jesse Friedman asked on Wednesday for the judge to block the prosecution's attempt to remove Kibby's mobile home and a shipping container. In court papers filed on Tuesday, Mr Friedman argued he needs to keep all the evidence preserved because he has so little information on why his client was arrested. Mr Friedman is asking a judge to secure all evidence, including medical records from exams of Abigail, phone and text records, investigative notes and blood, saliva and other bodily substances. He wants the protection extended to evidence collected at Kibby's home in Gorham and the town house Abigail Hernandez shares with her mother in nearby Conway. Kibby is charged with a felony count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison if he's convicted. He's being held on $1 million cash bail. At a hearing on Wednesday,prosecutors argued that it's impossible to safeguard the trailer and storage unit without posting a 24-hour guard at the site and that by securing them offsite they will be better preserved. Kibby is charged with a felony count of kidnapping, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison if he's convicted . In court papers, state Attorney General Joseph Foster said leaving the home and storage unit where they are would attract the curious and possibly vandals. Assistant Attorney General Young described the level of interest in the Hernandez case as 'macabre', according to the Globe. The state said it will make every effort to preserve the other items listed in the defense papers. Abigail disappeared on October 9, and for nine months the only trace of her was a letter she wrote to her mother. She returned home on July 20 but the circumstances of her return are just as mysterious as those of her disappearance. Police stand guard outside the trailer park home of Kibby in Gorham. Prosecutors have asked that the home be moved to a secure area because of the 'macabre' level of interest in the case .

"Lord Sugar has been accused of homophobia after asking a Twitter user who insulted him when he planned to 'come out'. The Apprentice star responded angrily when William Bridges aimed a tweet at him which read: '@Lord_Sugar you are thick as s***'. The 66-year-old retorted with asking the man when he 'planned to come out' after referring to Bridges' Twitter profile picture, in which he was pictured with a friend. The ex-Spurs chairman tweeted: 'Your twitter pic. When are you 2 coming out?'. War of words: The Twitter row descended into a bitter flurry of insults from the businessman . He then branded him a 't***' and called another Twitter user a 'dimwit' when they accused him of being homophobic. The Labour peer agreed with people who said others were needlessly trying to make it into a row over sexuality. He called another Twitter user a 't***' for saying that they were 'disappointed' that the entrepreneur had used 'sexuality as an insult'. Lord Sugar called followers who accused him of homophobia a 't***' When one person said the insult was homophobic, Sugar replied: 'you dimwit refer to original insult from sender before you stand high and mighty'. Despite the outraged responses to his insult, the TV presenter remained defiant and refused to apologise. The original Twitter user who had insulted him has now deleted his account. It's not the first time that the businessman has come under fire for his Twitter account. In October Lord Sugar was investigated by police after being accused of posting a racist Twitter message. The outspoken entrepreneur and Apprentice star posted a photograph of a crying Chinese child to 3.2âmillion Twitter followers, joking that the youngster was upset after being told off for leaving Appleâs iPhone production line â a reference to the Asian factories where the phones are made. The tweet prompted a single complaint to the Metropolitan Police from a Twitter user, who referred to the Labour peer as a âvile racistâ. Police contacted the complainant twice, urging her to make a statement at a police station, which she eventually did, and yesterday police confirmed that officers from Merseysideâs Hate Crime Investigation Unit took several days to decide whether a crime had been committed by the Labour peerâs tweet. However, the remark was in the end classed as a âhate incidentâ â which means no further action will be taken, although details will be kept on file.","Apprentice star responded angrily when William Bridges aimed a tweet at him which read: '@Lord_Sugar you are thick as s***'

"On the face of it, Jenny Hastings looks like she has everything â a celebrity husband, a comfortable lifestyle, two talented children, and the slender figure of a twenty-something, the result of her years training as a swimmer and triathlete. But the reality is that Jenny, the wife of Scottish rugby icon and Sky Sports commentator Scott Hastings, has spent the past two decades struggling with periods of mental illness which, although brief, have had a devastating impact. Now both husband and wife have decided to break years of silence about the debilitating condition â including revealing the extraordinary moment just a few months ago when Jenny attempted to kill herself by eating a bag of peanuts, imagining her nut allergy would lead to a rapid death. Scroll down for video . Laughing themselves back to happiness: Scott and Jenny share a light-hearted moment at home . Jenny has even been driven to undergo controversial electric shock treatment â ECT â in a failed bid to cure her depression. And she admits that in her distress she has tried to âmarry offâ her husband to friends, believing he would be happier with someone else. At their home in Edinburgh, she says: âWe come from a generation that didnât talk about the âD wordâ, so Iâve never felt able to talk about it publicly before. It was too personal and I felt too vulnerable. âI felt people would judge me if they knew and, at my worst moments, I felt useless enough as a wife and mother, even as a human being, without anyone adding to it. âPeople have said: âJennyâs got everything, why on earth would she be depressed?â âBut the reaction to my âcoming outâ has been absolutely amazing. I canât believe how kind and supportive people have been. Iâm touched by the love Iâve been shown.â But just four months ago her depression reached a terrible nadir. As she quietly explains: âI bought a bag of mixed nuts in Marks and Spencer, drove to South Queensferry and parked up the car, before eating a peanut. Iâd left no suicide notes. No explanations. I just wanted to die and end it all. Legend on the pitch: Scott Hastings in his rugby heyday playing for Scotland . âIâm absolutely ashamed looking back, now that Iâm well again, at what I almost did to Scott and our children. But at the time I thought I was doing them a favour and they would be better off without me.â Itâs clear the couple have developed a black sense of humour on the subject. Indeed, Jenny struggles to control her laughter as she describes how, after sitting in the car for hours with no reaction, she decided to drive home. She recalled: âBut when I reached the house, I started to be violently sick. I went into anaphylactic shock. Scott grabbed the EpiPen adrenaline shot and injected me in the leg. We didnât know if we were using it properly, so he stabbed me in the other leg to make sure. âThen the doorbell rang. But it wasnât the paramedics â it was the delivery man with the new bike Iâd ordered. Honestly, you couldnât make it up.â Her problems seem to have started with a bout of post-natal depression after having her second child. But she believes the latest trigger for was turning 50 in May and the prospect of âempty nest syndromeâ as their daughter, now 18, prepared to leave school and go off to university. Jenny says: âI was in it again before I realised and all I can think of was it was a landmark birthday and Kerry-Anne was about to leave home. Sounds crazy that that would do it, right? But this time, it was the worst ever. I was in a very dark place, full of self-loathing.â It was Scott, 49, a former British Lion and one of Scotlandâs most capped rugby players, who cautiously suggested she should make her depression public, and they are speaking out in the hope it will help others feel less alone about the condition. His first experience of the illness was in 1996 when he went off with the Scotland squad to New Zealand on a six-week tour and came back to find Jenny âin bitsâ, unable to cope with newborn Kerry-Anne and their young son, Corey, then three. Suicide attempt: Jenny tried to kill herself by eating a bag of peanuts, imagining her nut allergy would lead to a rapid death . He adds: âIn the beginning, I donât mind saying now, I found it embarrassing when she was diagnosed with a mental illness. It was such a taboo subject.â Jenny is clearly hearing this for the first time and asks incredulously: âDid you? Youâve never told me but then, I suppose, how could you?â The rugby star replies: âIt wasnât the kind of thing I was going to start talking to anyone about. No one talked about mental health then. Thankfully weâve come a long way but we could still go so much further.â It may have become easier to talk about, but dealing with Jennyâs manic bouts at home â sheâs had five in total â when they are in full flow can still be challenging. Scott adds: âItâs like a slide, you canât stop it. She goes off the edge into the precipice. It doesnât matter what you say, thereâs no pulling her back from it. She withdraws from life. She doesnât like going outside and worries about everything.â Scott, who nowadays runs a sports marketing and hospitality agency, laughs as he recalls how Jenny tried to âmarry him offâ during her latest breakdown this summer to two of her friends because she thought he would be happier with someone else. Embarrassed, Jenny explains: âI didnât see how he could love me any more in the condition I was in, so I thought he should find someone else. He just looked at me like I was crazy, which I was.â After a short spell in hospital after her suicide attempt, Jenny agreed to try six sessions of electroconvulsive therapy two months ago in the hope she would be one of the 93 per cent of people suffering from depression whose condition improves. The idea of treating a psychiatric illness by passing a jolt of electricity through the brain is one of the most controversial in 20th Century medicine, with critics branding it barbaric and ineffective. Jenny says: âI was desperate. The hardest part was that every time I came round, I was an absolute blubbering mess. I felt like I was being traumatised more than ever. I wouldnât put anyone off it. It works for some people, just not for me.â For now, sheâs content with life again, helped by the fact she has finally been given an official diagnosis of depression after a complete review of her case history. She says: âIâm proof to anyone going through this that you can get better if you get the proper support. Scott has been a real rock for me. âAnd for me, this time feels different. I never say never and itâs early days but Iâm quietly confident Iâm not going back to that dark place again and the fact Iâm able to talk about it for the first time ever, gives me a new confidence that everythingâs going to be all right.â","Jenny Hastings has spent years struggling with devastating mental illness .

"Graeme McDowell insisted he was relishing the challenge after his domination of the WGC-HSBC Champions came under serious threat in Shanghai. Two ahead after the opening round and three in front at halfway following a second successive 67, McDowell was four shots clear of a star-studded field late in the third round at Sheshan International on Saturday. However, the former US Open champion then bogeyed the 17th in a round of 71 to finish 11 under par, one ahead of Japan's Hiroshi Iwata and two ahead of Ryder Cup team-mate Martin Kaymer and Masters champion Bubba Watson. Graeme McDowell is one-shot clear after round three WGC-HSBC Champions at Sheshan International . The Northern Irishman's three-shot lead narrowed on day three but he's 'excited about the challenge' Kaymer's 66 was the lowest round of a cold, damp day, while Iwata birdied two of the last three holes for a 68 in his first appearance in a WGC event. McDowell wears gloves on a cold, wet day in Shanghai as he holds onto his lead . Watson had been McDowell's closest challenger when he birdied the second and third and then almost holed his approach to the 603-yard eighth hole for an albatross, but missed the eagle putt from five feet and had to settle for a birdie. The left-hander then made a costly mistake on the 10th when his simple approach to the green plugged in a bunker, from where he could only blast out to 40 feet and three-putt for a double bogey. But after dropping another shot on the 12th, Watson birdied four of the last five holes, marred only by a three-putt bogey on the 17th. 'I played reasonably solid today,' said McDowell, who has yet to win a WGC title. 'I thought conditions were a little bit more difficult, colder, obviously a little bit of overnight rain made the golf course play a little bit longer. 'I didn't quite score as well as I did the last couple days but really gave myself some confidence from a ball-striking point of view that I can get the job done tomorrow. McDowell thought he played 'reasonably solidly' in difficult conditions despite his lead diminishing . While not matching his previous day's efforts, McDowell takes confidence into the fourth round . Japan's Hiroshi Iwata, the world No 127, is in second and making his presence known . 'And let's be honest. Yes, I had a three-shot lead overnight and it's only one now, but I'll take this position any week that you offer it to me, a one-shot lead going into the last round on a golf course that I enjoy. 'I am excited about the challenge tomorrow and really looking forward to it. 'It would be huge to win but I can accept whatever happens. I feel like I am turning the corner from a lot of points of view, mentally, physically and in my personal life a lot of good things are going on. 'I am excited about another opportunity to win a golf tournament. If it happens I will be very happy, if not things are moving in the right direction.' Germany's Martin Kaymer shot a third day 66, the lowest round of a cold and damp day in China . McDowell admitted had never heard of nearest challenger Iwata before this week, but the world number 127 revealed he is quite well known in his native Japan. 'I'm kind of relatively short tempered, so I always focus not to get too angry at myself,' Iwata said. 'I believe I'm doing pretty good at that at the moment, so I just want to keep that going.' Asked if he usually got angry quickly, Iwata added: 'I'm pretty famous for that in Japan.' US Open champion Kaymer could be McDowell's biggest threat given his record at the venue, the German shot a closing 63 on his way to victory three years ago and also holds the course record of 62. In an up and down day, Bubba WatsonÂ birdied four of the last five holes to be tied for third on nine-under . 'Finally I could make some putts today, that was nice,' the 29-year-old said. 'The first two days I played really well but the putter was a little cold. 'Today I make a couple mid-distance putts, only one bogey so I think I put myself in a good position. 'Obviously you need a little help from Graeme in order to win, but I'm playing really well and that's all I can do.' World number 10 Rickie Fowler and South African Tim Clark are three off the lead on eight under par, with last year's runner-up Ian Poulter and Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen another shot back. Poulter had been in second place at halfway but could only manage a third round of 72.","Graeme McDowell one-shot in front for final round of Sheshan International .

"Guillermo Rigondeaux survived a scare in Osaka to retain his world titles as Hisashi Amagasa retired on his stool at the end of the 11th round.

Amagasa was dropped in the ninth session and his face was battered and bruised by the time he failed to emerge for the final round. Guillermo Rigondeaux (left) is congratulated by Hisashi Amagasa after his win in Osaka. The Cuban claimed victory and retained his WBO and WBA belts after the Japanese fighter retired at the end of the 11th round . Rigondeaux, who has fought just 15 times as a professional, is among the finest pound-for-pound fighters in the world but his apparently fan-unfriendly style meant this bout was not broadcast in Europe or the United States. The two-time Olympic champion has fought just twice this year having been dropped by American broadcaster HBO following his defining victory over Nonito Donaire in 2013. Amagasa came into the fight having lost five of his 34 contests and was a far cry from the calibre of opponent Rigondeaux is desperate to face in the shape of fellow champions Leo Santa Cruz, Carl Frampton and Scott Quigg. Rigondeaux aims for Amagasa's midriff with a left-handed punch during the bantamweight bout . And the 29-year-old struggled to deal with the Cubanâs speed and elusiveness in the opening rounds. Rigondeaux, who lives in Miami after defecting in 2009, was in complete control at the halfway point before Amagasa threatened to produce an almighty shock. He dropped the champion with a right to the chin before celebrating as if he had won the fight. Rigondeaux was up quickly however only to return to the canvas seconds later. Rigondeaux doles out the punishment to Amagasa during the fight in Osaka, Japan . That appeared to be from a push rather than a punch but the referee signalled a knockdown, despite the visitorâs protests. The bell for the end of the round brought a dramatic 30 seconds to a close but normal service was resumed in the next round. And in the 10th, a straight left dumped Amagasa on the floor. He too was quickly on his feet but the end was nigh. With his face grotesquely swollen, the challenger battled on until the end of the penultimate stanza before calling it a day.","Guillermo Rigondeaux beat Hisashi Amagasa on TKO after 11th round .

"Mauricio Pochettino has backed Harry Kane to handle the pressure of carrying Tottenhamâs assault on the top four. The 21-year-old has had a stunning season, netting 15 goals and, significantly, has been the clubâs driving force in a run of seven games unbeaten in all competitions. Heâs scored six goals in that run and played a major role in leading Spurs to fifth in the Premier League. With an England call up likely, the challenge for the striker will now be managing expectation s. Tottenham striker Harry Kane is mature enough to handle the pressure this season, says Maurico Pochettino . The new Spurs manager has been credited with giving Kane the chance he deserved up front this season . But Pochettino insisted on Friday he has no concerns about Kane enduring the pressure of his success. He said: âHarry is young and he can handle this moment. Yes, I think he is mature. He is young but mature and the process was the right process to arrive in this moment. I think Harry is clever and he knows how to manage the pressure.â The subject of pressure and the wider teamâs mental toughness has been prominent in Pochettinoâs debut season. Their abject record against leading sides was held up as an example of that fragility, though the 5-3 demolition of Chelsea will surely go some way to instilling confidence in the side. Kane (tussling with John Terry) has proven he possesses the sort of physical attributes to succeed . Erik Lamela (right, pictured on New Year's Day) is still injured and won't play against Crystal Palace . Pochettino, whose side face Crystal Palace on Saturday, believes that win could prove essential in the chase for a Champions League spot. He said: âIt is important to stop this idea. We must now believe we can beat sides like Chelsea. It was more than just one victory. It was a victory for getting belief into our tactics and the way we want to play.â It remains to be seen how active Spurs are in the transfer market this month. The signs are that there will be movement, having signed Southamptonâs head of recruitment Paul Mitchell, but Pochettino attempted to play down those prospects. He said: âWe are happy with our squad and our players. I donât think there will be many changes. There are many rumours in this period but we donât comment.â Ryan Mason and Erik Lamela are both injured and will not face Palace.","Harry Kane has been Tottenham's standout performer this season .

"Chris RobshawÂ returns to action on Saturday insisting his damaged shoulder will not be a problem. The 28-year-old flanker has been sidelined for a month after almost dislocating his shoulder in Harlequinsâ European Champions Cup clash with Leinster just a week after finishing Englandâs gruelling autumn campaign. It was feared Englandâs captain would need surgery, therefore ruling him out of next monthâs Six Nations. Chris Robshaw feared he would miss the forthcoming Six Nations because of a shoulder injury . Robshaw sat out Harlequins' clash with Northampton at a sold-out Twickenham in December . Robshaw hurt his shoulder just a week after leading England to victory over Australia in November . But intensive rehabilitation has seen Robshaw avoid going under the knife and enabled him to face Leicester in the Aviva Premiership this weekend. âThere was some concern initially and I went to see a number of specialists to get their views on the right way to go,â Robshaw told Sportsmail. âI hyper-extended the ligaments quite badly and they were stretched quite a long way. But weâve gone through all the correct procedures and they should be fine for this weekend. The first couple of days after I suffered the injury were painful but fortunately it settled down quite quickly after that and that gave me a much more positive mind-set. The 28-year-old flanker is set to return to action with Quins against Leicester Tigers on Saturday . 'The first couple of days after I suffered the injury were painful but fortunately it settled down quite quickly after that and that gave me a much more positive mind-set.

But there's only so much you can do in the gym and I'm raring to go.'

"Nick Easter has urged England to create a 'destructive force' by pairing Steffon Armitage with captain Chris Robshaw for their assault on this year's World Cup. Former England number eight Easter believes head coach Stuart Lancaster must 'go down that route' and end Armitage's Test exile to boost the host nation's hopes of glory. England have continued to overlook Armitage since his 2011 move to Toulon, sticking to their rule of not selecting overseas-based stars. Toulon's flanker Steffon Armitage (right) runs with the ball against Montpellier, with the back-rower in line to be given special dispensation to feature for England at the World Cup despite playing in France . The RFU is understood to be ready to invoke the exceptional circumstances clause in that ruling to hand 29-year-old Armitage a World Cup call at number eight. The five-cap back-rower could then operate alongside flanker Robshaw, leaving the England captain's Harlequins team-mate Easter predicting a mouth-watering combination. 'That would be a real destructive force to have not one but two of that type of player in the back-row,' Easter told PA. 'I think you've got to go down that route, you've got a great opportunity in England. And yeah it might be frowned upon, but South Africa had to succumb to it and bring players back. And it is a one off for the World Cup, and it's a great opportunity. Armitage could be paired alongside captain Chris Robshaw, with former England No 8 Nick Easter believing the pair would form a 'destructive force' at the upcoming World Cup . 'It certainly suggests that if you're going to bring someone like that in then they are more than likely going to be in the squad.' Robshaw is expected back shortly after a month on the sidelines with shoulder trouble, after managing to avoid surgery that would have threatened his Six Nations participation. Toulon's Armitage will not be considered for Six Nations selection, but England coach Lancaster is still considering drafting him into the summer's World Cup training squad. Armitage's long-mooted return had initially hinted at a straight fight for the openside flanker berth with captain Robshaw, but his club switch to number eight raises the prospect of the two working in tandem. Armitage's move to France to play his club rugby means he has won just five caps for England since 2009 . 'You've got to have your best players available, and if other guys are upset by it then their mental mindset is not right,' said Easter. 'They should be thinking 'bring on the challenge and the competition' and just hope they've got enough to prove themselves worthy of a place in the squad. 'Steffon has obviously played the majority of his rugby at flanker, but has performed very well at number eight at Toulon this season. 'He's one of the best breakdown exponents in the world and I think England would certainly benefit from having him and Chris (Robshaw) in there together.'","Steffon Armitage could feature for England at 2015 World Cup .

"Ron Vlaar has been ruled out for up to six weeks through a knee injury to effectively end any chance the Dutch international might move clubs this transfer window. The Aston Villa captain had surgery on Wednesday and could miss as many as seven games as he recovers. Vlaar has struggled with injuries this season, mainly through problems with his calf, and came back from the World Cup with Holland nursing a knee complaint. Ron Vlaar has been ruled out for up to six weeks with Aston Villa after injury against Crystal Palace . Villa manager Paul Lambert (centre) expects his captain to remain at the club during this transfer window . Vlaar impressed during the World Cup after a string of good performances for Louis van Gaal's Holland . Louis Van Gaal had looked to bring him to Manchester United this January but any potential move is now likelier in the summer, when Vlaarâs contract expires. The 29-year-old was forced off early in the recent match against Crystal Palace and has not trained since. Villa manager Paul Lambert said: 'Itâs just a little meniscus thing and It looks like he will be out for between four and six weeks. Hopefully itâs not too bad. Itâs certainly not as bad as it could have been. 'Even if he wasnât injured I was confident (of keeping him this window).

"If Houston Texans defensive end JJ Watt doesnât win the MVP award this year, there wonât be anyone more disappointed than Anthony 'JJ' Tarantelli. The seven-year-old peewee football player has modelled his game after the NFL star and he plans to play in the league just like his idol. Anthony detailed his exploits on the football field to in a letter to Watt and also sent the 25-year-old his autographed No 99 jersey so he would be able to âknow me when I am a famous NFL player.â Watt, who is unfazed by competing against crafty quarterbacks, aggressive offensive linemen and even other defensive players while serving as a tight end, was impressed by what young Anthony had to say. âThis kid has some guts... I like it,â Watt wrote after posting a copy of the letter and a picture of Anthonyâs jersey on his Twitter account. The 2012 Defensive Player of the Year may like the guts he sees from Anthony, but Watt has certainly shown some intestinal fortitude of his own this NFL season. Will it be enough to win him an MVP? Watt has 16.5 sacks, 10 pass breakups and 64 total tackles this season to go along with three forced fumbles, an interception and five touchdowns. The scores havenât all come on defense as Watt has caught three TDs as a tight end, but even his two defensive scores (one on an interception return and the other on a fumble recovery) are equal to the number of times Bernard Pierce, a running back for Sundayâs opponent the Baltimore Ravens, has reached paydirt this season. JJ Watt has had a tremendous season with the Texans on both sides of the ball . Houston would not even be close to its 7-7 record without Watt and he likely is the most valuable player to his team in the truest sense of the word. Unfortunately there have only been two defensive players to receive the award (New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1986 and Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle Alan Page in 1971) and a quarterback or running back has walked away with an MVP trophy for 27 consecutive seasons. For his part, Watt says it doesnât matter to him. âThat's for people like you to decide, not me,' Watt told MMQB'. 'I can't change any voters' minds, and I don't think I should try. I don't care, actually. It doesn't matter to me. âIf people vote for me, great. But to politic for it, no. Please vote for me? No. People who play don't get to decide who wins, nor should they. I want to be deserving, but not because I politicked for it. My play on the field is all that should matter. Nothing else.â Only time will tell if Watt will walk away with the award. If he doesnât, it may be a long time until another defensive player even comes closeâ¦ possibly until around the year 2030 when Anthony Tarantelli is terrorising the league.","Anthony Tarantelli sent 25-year-old Watt a letter and an autographed game jersey .

"Burnley defender Kevin Long has signed a new contract days after being ruled out for the rest of the season with a serious knee injury. The 24-year-old was given his Premier League debut at Newcastle last Thursday after captain Jason Shackell suffered an early calf injury but was carried off the pitch 20 minutes later having landed awkwardly. Clarets boss Sean Dyche confirmed on Monday that Long had ruptured his cruciate ligament, an injury that is likely to keep him out for around nine months. Defender Kevin Long (right) has signed a new deal at Burnley keeping him at the club until 2017 . Long, who joined Burnley as a 19-year-old, only had a contract until this summer but he will not have to worry about his future after putting pen to paper on a deal that will keep him at the club until June 2017. Dyche said: 'He'll be looked after, as we do with our players. He just got bumped in mid-air and landed awkwardly and that was it. But we'll certainly make sure his recovery goes well.' The news of Long's injury came on the same day Sam Vokes scored his first goal since recovering from his own ruptured cruciate ligament, earning Burnley an FA Cup third-round replay against Tottenham next week.

"Diego Costa has made a storming start to life at Chelsea and Alexis Sanchez has hit the ground running at Arsenal, but what about the players that Premier League clubs are regretting bringing in? Here, Sportsmail takes a look at 10 summer signings who have flopped. Mario Balotelli, Liverpool . Â£16m from AC Milan . The most obvious candidate for biggest disappointment of the season so far, 'Mad Mario' hasn't had it his own way on his return to England. Brought in by Brendan Rodgers as a replacement for  Luis Suarez, the former Manchester City striker has played 758 minutes in the Premier League without scoring while looking disinterested. Liverpool have struggled without Suarez and the injured Daniel Sturridge this season, and Balotelli's ineptitude on the pitch and attitude off it have done nothing to help their cause. Mario Balotelli has yet to score in the Premier League this season after his Â£16m move from AC Milan . Eliaquim Mangala, Manchester City . Â£35m from Porto . When Manchester City signed dominant French centre back Mangala in what was the fifth-biggest transfer of the summer, many thought the champions had fixed their only weakness. But the 6ft 2in destroyer has struggled to adapt, and has been targeted by so-called lesser teams, especially when captain Vincent Kompany isn't alongside him. He admitted the Premier League was tougher than he ever expected, in an interview withSportsmail's Ian Ladyman last month. 'I would say that playing against Chelsea back at the start wasn't particularly a typical English game, it's the sort of football I'm more used to.' Eliaquim Mangala, pictured against Southampton in November, has admitted he has struggled in England . Brown Ideye, West Brom . Â£10m from Dynamo Kiev . West Brom have built their reputation as a relatively prudent side in the Premier League, so when they splashed Â£10million on a striker, you expect him to fire immediately. But that just hasn't happened for Brown Ideye, who Alan Irvine admitted he hadn't watched before spending the money on him. The 26-year-old has scored two goals in 13 games in all competitions and has been linked with a January switch with Sunderland and Newcastle possible destinations. Brown Ideye (No 9) was signed for Â£10m by West Brom despite Alan Irvine not seeing him play before . Facundo Ferreyra, Newcastle . On loan from Shakhtar Donetsk . Somewhat of a mystery man in English football, the Shakhtar forward was tipped to shine at Newcastle, with Ukrainian fans bemused as to why he was let go. But the Argentine, nicknamed 'Chucky' has been limited to a handful of Under 21 appearances, and even a change of manager isn't likely to have a baring on his future at St James' Park. Facundo Ferreyra was tipped to shine but has yet to make a Premier League appearance for Newcastle . Rio Ferdinand, QPR . Free transfer from Manchester United . Harry Redknapp insisted on Queens Park Rangers signing the experienced defender in the summer after his contract at Old Trafford ran down. However, after Ferdinand struggled at the start of the season, Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker have been preferred in central defence. Ferdinand has been fulfilling his punditry duties but this looks likely to be his last season in the Premier League. Rio Ferdinand (left) has struggled at QPR, while Hatem Ben Arfa had his loan spell at Hull City cut short . Hatem Ben Arfa, Hull City . On loan from Newcastle . At his best, Hatem Ben Arfa is a winger who can trouble even the best defences. But he is most often  a sulky trouble-maker who frustrates his manager. Steve Bruce didn't see enough from the France international, who believes he can one day win the Ballon d'Or, during his stay at the KC Stadium and cut short his loan. Newcastle rejected the chance to have him back too, terminating his contract, and Ben Arfa has now penned a deal at Ligue 1 side Nice. Michel Vorm, Tottenham . Â£3.5m plus Gylfi Sigurdsson as Ben Davies also moved from from Swansea to Spurs . Holland international Vorm would have been high up on managers' lists when considering a new No 1 after impressing over two seasons in Wales. But he has yet to make a Premier League outing for Spurs and has instead had to settle with a place on the bench and Europa League appearances. Michel Vorm is a talented goalkeeper but has had to settle for cup outings for Tottenham . Emmanuel Riviere, Newcastle . Â£6m from Monaco . Newcastle raided Ligue 1 again to sign the French striker, but despite impressing at Monaco, Riviere hasn't scored in 11 Premier League games. The 24-year-old struggled to lead the line on his own and has been left in the dark by Papiss Cisse and Ayoze Perez this season. Newcastle spent Â£6m on Emmanuel Riviere - who was highly rated in France with Monaco . Georgios Samaras, West Brom . Free transfer from Celtic . The Greek striker once went two years without scoring an international goal despite featuring regularly. So it is perhaps not a surprise that he has yet to hit the target for the Baggies. Georgios Samaras was cheaper than Brown Ideye for West Brom but has still flopped in the Midlands . Mauro Zarate, West Ham . Undisclosed from Velez . 'He wasn't good enough,' Sam Allardyce replied when asked why Zarate had not featured more for the Hammers, who has now moved on loan to QPR. The former Birmingham and Lazio frontman seemed to settle in well at the start of the season, but with Andy Carroll returning and Stewart Downing on form, it was obvious the Argentine wasn't going to get the opportunity he craved. Sam Allardyce admitted Mauro Zarate 'wasn't good enough' for West Ham and he has left on loan for QPR .","Mario Balotelli hasn't scored a Premier League goal for Liverpool .

"Leicester City are edging closer to the signing of Andrej Kramaric with the Croatian striker undertaking a medical at the club on Tuesday. Kramaric, 23, arrived in Leicester for the next stage of his Â£9million deal from Rijeka after Chelsea fell behind in their bid following an inability to offer the player a place in their squad next season. Nigel Pearson is keen to bolster his squad in the January transfer window to battle against Barclays Premier League relegation and getting the deal for Kramaric would represent a coup. Rijeka striker Andrej Kramaric is having a medical at Leicester City ahead of completing a Â£9million move . Kramaric has 28 goals in 31 games for Rijeka this season and two goals from four caps for Croatia. The arrival of the forward will aid the Foxes' firepower this season as they look to climb off the bottom of the Premier League table.

"John Carver has hit back at suggestion Newcastle United deliberately fielded a weakened team in the FA Cup third round - and insists his conscience is clear. The Magpies caretaker boss made seven changes for last Saturdayâs 1-0 defeat at Leicester City and has since come in for heavy criticism from supporters and former players, including Alan Shearer. Newcastleâs hierarchy have previously gone on record in downgrading the importance of the cup competitions and fans were suspicious that Carver had been instructed to pick a team which did not include star players such as Moussa Sissoko and skipper Fabricio Coloccini. Newcastle United boss John Carver watches on during a training session on Friday . Carver has defended his team selection during Newcastleâs FA Cup third-round defeat at Leicester City . Moussa Sissoko wasn't involved - despite impressing for the Magpies in recent weeks . Carver, though, says that he - on the advice of medical staff - selected the XI which performed so poorly at the Kind Power Stadium. âI would like to put the record straight,â he said. âI have not had a conversation with Mike (Ashley, the owner). I had a conversion with Lee Charnley (managing director) late on Friday night. âI said to Lee âthis is the team that is playing tomorrowâ. That is a fact. I then told him âthese are the reasons why this is the teamâ. âHe was a little bit surprised, I have to be honest. I picked the strongest team I could. So I have clear conscience of that.â And Carver - who is hoping to replace Alan Pardew on a permanent basis - says he felt sick when the fitness concerns were relayed to him. Tim Krul's (left) return to action on Thursday will come as a huge boost to Newcastle boss Carver . The Holland international watches the flight of the ball during a behind-closed-doors friendly against Celtic . Ryan Taylor also stepped up his recovery from injury as he looks for a imminent return to first-team action . 'I took medical advice from the doctor. I actually physically felt sick when he told me about Colo, Moussa and Daryl Janmaat,â he explained. âNow he is the expert in this field and I have to trust his judgement. Moussa has a tight right hamstring and weâre not going to force any player with a problem to play. âI went on enough about how important I think the FA Cup is. You donât think I will harp on like that because I want to win it and then all of a sudden make the decision that these guys wonât play. I made that decision for the right reasons.â All of those missing at Leicester, however, are expected to feature at Chelsea on Saturday.

Midfielder Jack Colback didn't make Newcastle's 18-man squad as they were dumped out of the FA Cup . Carver insists that there were genuine fitness concerns with a number of players before the Leicester game . And Carver has been boosted by the return to fitness of goalkeeper Tim Krul, who he rates as one of the best in the Premier League. âIt will be a tremendous boost for everyone,â he said with Krul having been out since November. âYouâve got to have confidence in the person whose behind you and weâve conceded a lot of goals recently, so to have Tim between the sticks would be massive. âHeâs up there with Courtois and De Gea and for me.â Meanwhile, Shola Ameobi will not be returning to the club.

"Glenn Hoddle has ruled himself out of the running to become Newcastle United's new head coach - insisting he is 'enjoying' the challenge of trying to keep Queens Park Rangers in the Premier League. The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea manager has been touted as a possible replacement for Alan Pardew at St James' Park. Newcastle are currently without a head coach following Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace last week, with John Carver due to take charge of the team when they face Chelsea on Saturday as he has done for the previous two matches. Glenn Hoddle has distanced himself from the head coach's role at Newcastle United . The Magpies are looking for a new boss following Alan Pardew's departure to Crystal Palace . Newcastle have failed to win a game since Pardew left and were knocked out of the FA Cup on Saturday . And Hoddle's coaching attributes have ensured he has been mentioned as a contender for the Magpies hotseat. But Hoddle, who has been out of management since he left Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006, has revealed that he is content with his role as first-team coach under Harry Redknapp at QPR for the time being. Speaking toÂ Zapsportz.com, a website Hoddle co-founded, the former Southampton boss said: 'There has been a lot of speculation. The media have been chasing me for a reaction to being heavily linked to the vacant Newcastle job. 'All I am prepared to say is that I'm really enjoying the challenge of trying to keep QPR up this season. John Carver has been in temporary charge of Newcastle and will be in the dugout against Chelsea . Hoddle has not managed a side since Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2006 . 'Although I have never shut the door on management I'm happy doing what I'm doing now with QPR.' Hoddle has denied that any approach has been made by Mike Ashley, Lee Charnley or anybody from the Newcastle hierarchy - and insists he is not interested in such a role at this time. Newcastle are believed to be considering a wide variety of potential candidates for the role, including former Lyon boss Remi Garde, Saint Etienne head coach Christophe Galtier and ex-Mainz manager Thomas Tuchel. Mike Ashley is searching for a new manager to replace Alan Pardew at St James' Park . Derby County boss Steve McClaren has also been linked to the role, although he too has distanced himself, insisting he is happy at the iPro Stadium.

I've enjoyed working with Harry and the team - and I've enjoyed working with Harry and the staff.

"Leicester City have announced the signing of veteran goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer from Chelsea on a free transfer. The 42-year-old has joined on a one-and-a-half year deal and is likely to go straight into the team with regular number one with Kasper Schmeichel absent with a foot injury. Schwarzer was third choice at the Blues behind Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech and had not played for the west London club this season. Mark Schwarzer holds up the goalkeeper jersey of his new club Leicester after penning an 18-month deal . Schwarzer has left Chelsea for the Foxes after nearly 18 months on a free transfer . Leicester's first-choice goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel (right) is currently out injured with a broken foot . In Schmeichel's absence Ben Hamer has filled the void - with the Foxes conceding seven goals in five games since. Schwarzer's experience will prove vital to the East Midlands outfit who sit four points adrift from safety at the bottom of the table. The former Australian international's departure from Chelsea also indicates that Petr Cech is likely to remain at Stamford Bridge until the end of the season at least. Cech has been linked with a January move away from west London after losing his place to Courtois in goal; but that possibility looks remote as Jose Mourinho's side continue to fight on four fronts for silverware. Schwarzer is hoping to get more first-team action at relegation threatened Leicester . Schwarzer explained his reason for choosing to sign for the Foxes telling the club's official website: 'Automatically, when I got here, I got a great buzz and feel about the club. 'The opportunity to work with Nigel Pearson, who I played with back at Middlesbrough, and to be more involved and play more football. 'At Chelsea I didn't play a lot and the last six months has been the toughest part when I haven't been involved at all at times.

The Norwegian indulged in fist-pumping celebrations in front of the travelling supporters after goals from Emilio Izaguirre and Stefan Scepovic hauled them within a point of leaders Aberdeen.

However, inspired by an excellent display from contract rebel Kris Commons, Deilaâs men offered evidence that genuine competition might yet bring out the best in them. The Parkhead boss viewed the display as the ideal response after dropping five points in their previous two Premiership outings. âAberdeen have done very well, winning nine of their last 10 games,â he said. âItâs hard to cope with that but we have. âWe are back on track again. We are going to continue winning games and if Aberdeen do the same then it is going to be a tight race all the way to the end. âBut we are going to do our job. We can speak at the beginning of April, with six or seven games left, about who is challenging for the title. The 28-year-old celebrates after giving the Bhoys a half-time lead at Rugby Park . âIt was a good performance, particularly in the first half, and we scored two good goals. It was a very good answer from the players. âI believe in them and this performance shows what is in the group.

'Today we had a better tempo and created the chances we needed to win the game.â Virgil van Dijk was again watched by Sunderland scouts at Rugby Park, but Deila will be anxious to retain his key men for what promises to be an intriguing run-in.

And he expressed hope that extended agreements can yet be reached with both the 31-year-old and loanee John Guidetti, who dropped to the bench last night. âEspecially in the first half, Kris was very good â as was the team,â said Deila. âHe worked very hard.

If he does that, he is a very important player for us. âThe contract situation with Kris is the same as with Guidetti and all the others. We are talking together and we will see if we can get agreement. âI donât think it is so much closer with Guidetti. We will see. He is going forward with everything but the final message is still some days away. âHe had a good attitude when he came on the pitch tonight. We know what he can do and he is an important player for the team. âIt is just a little break for him. We know we are going to get John back on the best level again.â Deila also insisted he had no issue with Kilmarnock rejecting a request from Celtic to be allowed to train on their artificial pitch ahead of the match. âWe asked the question if we could train here,â he added. âIf they say no to that, it is their call. I donât think so much about it. âFor me it is no problem. I had plenty of experience of these kind of pitches in Norway. I think we showed we can play on it.â Meanwhile, Celtic have joined West Ham and QPR in tracking Hamiltonâs Â£2million-rated left-back Stephen Hendrie after John Collins watched the 19-year-old during the Lanarkshire sideâs 1-0 win at St Johnstone on Sunday.","Celtic got their title bid back on track after a comfortable 2-0 win over Kilmarnock on Monday night .

Manager Ronny Delia believes Celtic's title bid is now back on course .
The Bhoys are a point behind leaders Aberdeen with a game in hand ."
"Here's something for Ronny Deila to ponder during his Celticâs week-long training camp in Gran Canaria. If his side are to go and win this seasonâs title with the expected degrees of comfort and entertainment, can he really do without Kris Commons? The 31-year-old made his first league start since November and injected a different dimension of invention compared to the recent toils of the Parkhead outfit. Celtic defender Emilio Izaguire (left) fires from close range to give Celtic the lead against Kilmarnock . The 28-year-old celebrates after giving the Bhoys a half-time lead at Rugby Park . Kilmarnock: Samson, Barbour, Ashcroft, Connolly, Chantler, McKenzie, O'Hara, Hamill (Pascali 80), Johnston (Muirhead 35), Eremenko, Magennis . Subs:Â Cairney, Brennan, Syme, Splaine, Hawkshaw . Bookings: Connolly, Hamill . Celtic: Gordon, Matthews (Fisher 75), Ambrose, van Dijk, Izaguirre, Brown, Biton, Johansen, Commons, Henderson (McGregor 85), Scepovic (Guidetti 82) Subs: Zaluska, Griffiths, O'Connell, Thomson . Goals: Izaguirre (36), Scepovic (72) Bookings: Commons, Izaguirre . Referee: Kevin Clancy (Scotland) He endured an extraordinary level of misfortune when it came to actually putting the ball in the net â twice striking the woodwork and seeing numerous other efforts blocked â but was unquestionably the driving force behind a collective performance far more convincing than the relatively slender scoreline suggests. Goals from Emilio Izaguirre and Stefan Scepovic eventually sealed a victory that pulled Celtic back within a point of leaders Aberdeen - with a game in hand - as they prepare for what now appears an ill-timed mid-campaign break. The Dons could well be four in front again by the time the champions return from the Canary Islands, having used SPFL dispensation to postpone this weekendâs meeting with St Johnstone. Whether Commonsâ future will be any clearer by that point remains to be seen. With his contract due to expire in the summer, talks over an extension have stalled on the length and structure of the deal. Neil Lennonâs Bolton Wanderers are among the clubâs circling. Here, though, was strong evidence that he still has so much to offer. Replacing him would be a mightily difficult challenge. When it comes to sculpting something out of nothing, to providing a sudden injection of adrenaline for supporters, Celtic have no-one to compare. Celtic midfielder Stefan Johansen (left) is stopped in his tracks by a strong challenge from Mark Connolly . His meagre level of deployment by Deila this season remains baffling. True, he isnât the kind of supreme athlete who can always press with the intensity the Norwegian wants. But the positives he harbours surely outweigh any negatives. Kilmarnock would certainly he happy to see the back of him. This was an evening of regular discomfort for Allan Johnstonâs side, who can only feel thankful not to have conceded more. They remain seventh, two points adrift of St Johnstone as they attempt to claim a top-half finish. There was an unfamiliar air to the Celtic line-up selected to take to the artificial surface â a pitch they had been denied access to train on in the build-up to the match. In the end, though, much of this match bore the look of a run-of-the-mill session. Youngster Liam Henderson was included, while Deila demoted John Guidetti to the bench after previously turning psychologist in an attempt to nurse the previously prolific Swede through a five-game goalless streak. That decision meant a third Premiership start for Serbian striker Scepovic, still seeking to convince in the wake of his summer Â£2.3 million switch from Sporting Gijon. There was also a slot for Commons - last in an opening selection for the Europa League dead rubber against Dinamo Zagreb - in what may or may not prove to be his final appearance for the Parkhead club given the transfer window is now open. Celtic winger Kris Commons strikes a fierce left-footed effort on goal during the opening 45 minutes . Perhaps, though, this was Deila considering horses for courses. Commons netted a hat-trick here for Celtic last March. Kilmarnock looked well aware of his threat as he was dumped to the sodden surface inside 30 seconds following a collision with Lee Ascroft. A follow-up from Jamie Hamill a couple of minutes later had Deila waving his arms in protest. Commons would indulge in a spot of retribution later in the half with a late challenge on Hamill that earned a yellow card from Kevin Clancy. Yet it was his creative talents that truly caught the eye in a first half Celtic utterly dominated. He looked entirely like a man with a point to prove. In fact, the only surprise came when he wasnât actually involved in the opening goal that finally arrived nine minutes before the break. It was still a thing to admire. Izaguirre bolted down the left flank, got the ball back via Stefan Johansen and finished beautifully off the outside of his boot. Not bad at all. The strike was a reward for almost constant pressure. Johansen was the first to threaten when played through but seemed to be waiting for a written invitation. Mark Connolly nipped in to intercept before incurring a booking for angrily disputing the resulting corner. Kilmarnock midfielder Lee Ashcroft (left) looks to put in a challenge on Johansen (right) Henderson had a shot bravely blocked by Ross Barbour before Commons took over. A snapshot from 25 yards struck the junction of post and bar. Another effort was dragged wide after set-up play from Johansen and Scepovic. Quick feet then shifted him away from Lee Ashcroft to fire narrowly over, before clipping the bar again following a fluid move that featured Henderson, Nir Bitton and Adam Matthews. There was still time for one more ahead of the interval, when he took a pass from Henderson to thrash in an effort that was beaten out by Craig Samson. Commons must have spent the break wondering quite how his name hadnât entered the scoresheet. The sound of sombre reflection surely filled Kilmarnockâs dressing room. Johnston had started with Alexei Eremenko behind Josh Magennis and two wingers. It was bold but painfully open. The only test they offered Craig Gordon was a Magennis header from an Eremenko free-kick that the Celtic goalkeeper safely clutched down low. It seemed, therefore, to be a tactical decision when Johnston replaced his namesake Chris with Robbie Muirhead after 34 minutes. Bhoys defender Virgil van Djik commands possession with Kilmarnock's Ross Barbour in close attention . A rasping low drive from Jamie Hamill that zipped just beyond Gordonâs right-hand post gave the home fans a flicker of excitement as the second half got underway. Commons, however, was soon back in the saddle. A scalpel-like through-ball found Henderson, who should have done better than an attempt that was neither a cross nor a shot. The former Derby man then turned neatly inside the area, but his power-packed drive was deflected too high for another corner. While the single-goal margin somehow remained in place, there were always going to be nervy moments for Celtic. Muirhead supplied one via a dipping effort that was expertly tipped away by Gordon. That anxiety was finally dispelled with 19 minutes remaining. Johansen delivered a corner that Ambrose headed on, with Scepovic claiming the final touch.","Celtic secure 2-0 win at KilmarnockÂ on Monday night .

"Derby County have expressed an interest in Aston Villa misfit Darren Bent, with Steve McClaren hoping to take him on loan until the end of the season and end his Villans career for good. The 30-year-old striker has been on loan at Championship strugglers Brighton & Hove Albion where he scored two goals in five games. He missed their victory over Fulham on Monday night after being ruled out with a groin strain and the expiry of his loan means he is now back with Villa. Darren Bent is a loan target for Derby County after returning to Aston Villa from Brighton & Hove Albion . The striker scored twice in five appearances for Brighton before leaving the field with an injury . Bent moved to Villa Park in January 2011 for a club-record fee of Â£18million but has fallen out of favour . Bent is paid Â£65,000 a week by Villa but Derby would only contribute a fraction of that. Brighton paid around Â£20,000 of his wages but the Rams would look to reduce that even further. The striker cost Villa Â£18million when he signed in January 2011 for a club-record fee. Derby want a goalscorer to bolster their promotion push and Bent appears to fit the bill. They have failed in offers for Ross McCormack at Fulham and have asked about PEC Zwolle striker Tomas Necid, who is on loan from CSKA Moscow. They may face late competition from Crystal Palace but Bent is keen on joining up with former England manager  McClaren in a bid to revive his career. Derby have already failed in an offer to bring Fulham striker Ross McCormack to the club . They are also interested in Czech Republic striker Tomas Necid .","Darren Bent is wanted by Derby County on loan for remainder of season .

"Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny deserves his place as Arsenal number one, according to double winner Bob Wilson. The Poland international has found his position under the spotlight this week following reports he was caught smoking in the showers after Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, when his errors played a part for both goals. It has been suggested the player will be fined around Â£20,000 for his alleged misdemeanour, and it remains to be seen whether the 24-year-old will be back between the posts for Sunday's Barclays Premier League game against Stoke at the Emirates Stadium after he was replaced by Colombian David Ospina for last weekend's FA Cup tie versus Hull - a move always planned by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger. Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was fined Â£20,000 for smoking in the showers at Southampton . Szczesny's father Maciej Szczesny, meanwhile, insists his son should not be singled out for Arsenal's defensive shortcomings, declaring centre-half Per Mertesacker 'showed the agility of a rhinoceros' as the team let in the first goal at Southampton. Wilson - who made more than 300 appearances for Arsenal and helped them win the 1971 Football League and FA Cup double before returning to the club as a goalkeeper coach - believes Szczesny should not be ostracised for one high-profile poor performance. 'Wojciech deserves to be the Arsenal number one at this time,' Wilson said in an interview with the London Evening Standard. Szczesny left his goal unattended as Southampton opened the scoring during the defeat on New Year's Day . 'Ospina looked pretty good at the World Cup and he looked fine in the Hull game. He made a couple of really good catches and made one save low down, but that is all he had to do. It wasn't a serious test. 'What niggles me about this recent criticism (of Szczesny) after the Southampton game is that if people go back four days to the West Ham game (on December 28), his performance was so good he won us the three points. 'If you are looking for incidents to blame him, put the first goal at Southampton against him, fine, but don't start arguing with me about the second goal because it was not his fault. David Ospina started Arsenal's FA Cup victory against Hull City on Sunday and didn't disappoint . 'Any goalkeeper will tell you, lying on the floor with the opposition closing in on you, you make contact and you have no chance to get any leverage on it. It could go anywhere as a result of a situation not of his making. 'He did not have his best game, but most ex-keepers would say the last thing you want to do with your number one goalie is give him a rest. If I was goalkeeping coach there now and Arsene was asking me, I would say, ''don't drop him.'' 'Every goalkeeper makes mistakes. I spend a lot of time with David Seaman and all anybody asks him was, 'what happened with Ronaldinho (against Brazil at the 2002 World Cup) and Nayim? (in the 1995 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup final). 'The people in the know should recognise who is the best goalkeeper there (at Arsenal).' Bob Wilson (right) used to be Arsenal's goalkeeper coach, in training with David Seaman and Arsene Wenger . Wilson, the 73-year-old who retired from his Arsenal role in 2002, but remains involved at the club and promotes charity work for the Willow Foundation, understands all too well how testing a career as the last time of defence can be. 'It shouldn't affect you, but sometimes it does because you aren't in the best place,' he said. 'Wojciech seems to be a very confident, phlegmatic boy. A problem has cropped up here and he has to remain totally focused. 'The only time I can give a similar example was after we had won the double, I got carried off in the semi-final of the 1972 FA Cup and was out for six or seven months. Wilson has backed Szczesny to regain his form and confidence after the defeat at Southampton . 'I came back the following season and we lost 5-0 at Derby. Every newspaper said, ''this is the end of Bob Wilson.'' My kids came back from school crying because the other kids had said, ''your Dad is useless.'' 'The next game was Tottenham away. We won, I had a blinder and my place in the team was assured. 'You must never believe you are anything less than good enough and always think you are better than the guy challenging you. Wojciech needs to keep his confidence high.' Wenger is expected to step up efforts to bring in some much-needed defensive cover as the January transfer window continues, with St Etienne captain Loic Perrin and Villarreal's Gabriel Paulista reported targets.","The Arsenal keeper lit up a cigarette after 2-0 loss at Southampton .

"Cardiff City will return to playing in their traditional blue home kit after club owner Vincent Tan agreed to the move following pressure from fans. Tan had been at the heart of Cardiff's controversial rebrand from blue to red, with the Malaysian businessman believing the colour would bring good fortune. But fans voted unanimously on Thursday at a meeting to have the club return to their original colours, and Cardiff will now play in blue when Fulham visit in the Championship on Saturday. Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan controversially changed the club colours from blue to red in 2012 . Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman (centre) and chief executive Ken Choo at the announcement . Dalman (second right) and Choo (right) pose with fans after announcing they are to switch back to blue . As well as reverting back to blue kits, the club are also planning to redesign the club badge featuring a bluebird as the primary focus. Tan had told Sky Sports as recently as Christmas Day that 'Cardiff will stay red' and that he would take no notice of protests planned by supporters' groups against the re-branding and the threat of thousands of season tickets not being renewed. The club owner controversially changed Cardiff's kit colour to red in 2012, as well as replacing their traditional badge featuring a bluebird to a Welsh Dragon. Nicknamed the Bluebirds, the club had been playing in blue since it became known as Cardiff City 1908. The club owner's decision came after he called a meeting at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday where club officials consulted a cross-section of fans. Tan was not present at the meeting himself, but Cardiff City manager Russell Slade was, and he was full of praise for the club's fans who attended. 'People were able to say what they thought and they said it an eloquent and intelligent way,' said Slade. 'It was received very well from everyone at the football club and I thought it was a giant step. 'If ever that was a big step that was it and it would be nice if we were in blue on Saturday. This is a fantastic opportunity to build a new platform and put the bricks in place to rebuild and start again.' Cardiff currently play in a red kit with a red dragon on the club badge . The club used to play in blue home kit and the club badge was emblazoned with a bluebird . Cardiff have slipped to 12th in the Championship after going five games without a win but Slade believes changing the colour and the crest could provide the momentum necessary to make a charge for the play-offs in the second half of the season. 'If you're going to be successful in any business, any football club, you need everyone pulling together as a unit,' Slade said. 'Only that way can you sustain success. You might have a modicum of success in the short term but if you want long-term success you need unity.' The Christmas and New Year period has given me time to reflect on the events of the last year. Spending time with my family had a profound effect upon me. My mother, Madam Low Siew Beng, a devout Buddhist, who attended Cardiff City Football Club to watch them play, spoke to me on the importance of togetherness, unity and happiness. Cardiff City Football Club is important to me and I wish to see it united and happy. With the guidance, blessing and influence of my mother, I asked my Chairman, Mehmet Dalman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Choo for their advice and to consult with a good cross-section of the fan base.This meeting took place last night, when some seventy representatives of our supporters were present. My thanks and gratitude to those who gave up their evening and time to be there. I am informed that this was a very productive and frank exchange of views, but all with the same objective to strengthen our Club. These views were also added to by a large number of emails that were sent to the Club over the last 24 hours from our wider supporter base. To paraphrase John F. Kennedy, 'Let us never compromise out of fear. But let us never fear to compromise.' My wish is to unite and make the Club successful and in order to achieve this I fully support the Boardâs decision to implement the following changes: . 1. Starting from Saturday, 10 January 2015 and until the end of this season, our home kit shall be Blue. Our Away Kit shall be Red. I would like to thank the Football League for their approval to facilitate my request. 2. For the 2015/16 season, Cardiff Cityâs home kit colour shall be Blue. Our Away Kit colour shall be Red. 3. The Club badge will be redesigned to reflect the dominance of the Bluebird, while celebrating the proud history and heritage of the Club. I also wish to incorporate elements representative of my culture and beliefs, which I hope are respected. 4. As the Chairman has explained, the debt to equity resolution is not straightforward. We will deal with this in due course, with all decisions made in the best interest of the Club. 5. For the 2015/16 Season, Non Price Freeze Season Tickets will be reduced and Price Freeze Season Tickets shall be adjusted accordingly to match these prices.I very much hope these steps will bring unity, success and happiness to our Club. The challenge ahead for us is enormous and I truly believe we will overcome these obstacles as a united Club. I believe with divine blessings, Cardiff City Football Club will achieve great success.

"Cardiff City will discuss a proposed return to blue at a board meeting on Friday. Owner Vincent Tan has been at the heart of Cardiff's controversial rebrand from blue to red in 2012, with the Malaysian businessman believing the colour would bring good fortune. Tan told Sky Sports as recently as Christmas Day that 'Cardiff will stay red' and that he would take no notice of protests planned by supporters' groups against the re-branding and the threat of thousands of season tickets not being renewed.

However, Tan called a meeting at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday where club officials consulted a cross-section of fans. Tan was not present but chairman Mehmet Dalman said:Â 'It was great, a very balanced and very professional meeting, . 'It was time to bridge the gap with our supporters. I think Vincent will give this a great deal of consideration. 'It's very clear what came out of the meeting. There was a strong feeling that the club should return to blue, but there was also an understanding that Vincent likes red and that should be respected. 'He [Tan] will listen and he will consider. Vincent Tan saved the club when it needed saving. He will never leave this club in the lurch,' Dalman added. 'This was a very good evening for Cardiff City.' Around 70 people were in attendance and speakers included fans, councillors, MPs and business leaders. Fans unanimously voted for a blue home kit and the return of a prominent bluebird badge. They were also happy to accept a red away kit. Cardiff currently play in a red kit with a red dragon on the club badge . CEO Ken Choo said the respect shown to Tan at the meeting could be a significant factor in any decision to revert to blue and Dalman suggested the inclusion of a red dragon on any new Bluebird badge would be a respectful gesture to the owner. Cardiff supporters' groups hailed the positive atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium meeting and welcomed the possibility that the club's traditional colours could soon be restored. Supporters' Trust chairman Tim Hartley said: 'We were really glad that Mehmet called the meeting and there was a great cross-section of people there, representing not just the fans and their representatives but also the business community in Cardiff, a sponsor, an MP and a councillor. 'It was a unanimous vote - and Mehmet called for the vote - on the blue and everyone said we need to return to blue to bring back unity to this club. 'We are hoping that the board meeting will actually decide to tell Vincent Tan that, ""We've had an experiment, you tried it and it didn't work"". 'There's unanimity to go back to blue for the benefit of this club. 'The business case is there, the community case is there and we will say, ""The supporters will follow you and we will be united behind the club if you return to blue with the bluebird on the crest"".' The club used to play in blue home kit and the club badge was emblazoned with a bluebird . Sian Branson, of supporters' group Bluebirds Unite, said: 'I think we can show Vincent Tan how great we can be as fans and how great this football club can be. 'They asked me, ""What do you think the atmosphere would be if we want back to blue?"" I said: ""You won't see a party like it in this city."" 'We'll have a march and I'll walk up the front of that march with a banner saying: ""Thank you Vincent Tan"" if we go back to blue. 'We've still got to wait but I'm positive.' Vince Alm, of the Cardiff City Supporters' Club, thanked Tan for listening to the views of fans. 'We want to be united and pushing forward and we feel going back to blue is the best way of getting fans back in the ground,' Alm said. 'We're very respectful of the investment we've had off Vincent Tan but we talk about spirit and we want to show the passion of Welsh people as one.'","Cardiff City changed their branding from blue to red in 2012 .

"Eidur Gudjohnsen sauntered towards goal, intelligently cutting a ball with the outside of his right foot and there was Emile Heskey, expectant at the back post, to slide in. No, this wasnât a re-run of Premier League Years circa 2004, but the modern day Championship. It was with that move that this derby changed. Bolton, sporting a front two with a combined age of 72, somehow dragged themselves ahead and won a game they had no right to. Heskey, on for his debut at half-time, changed the complexion, showing just why Neil Lennon took the plunge and signed him on a short-term contract pre-Christmas. He equalised before Darren Pratley plundered home the winner in a derby befitting its Boxing Day billing. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats Bolton 2-1 Blackburn . Emile Heskey (bottom left) scored on his Bolton debut to equalise against Blackburn . Bolton (4-3-1-2): Lonergan 7.5; Vela 6, Dervite 6, Mills 6, Ream 6; Chung-Yong 6, Danns 7, Pratley 7; Gudjohnsen 7 (Trotter 76 - 6); Feeney 6.5 (Wheater 88), Hall 6 (Heskey 46 - 8) Subs not used: Bogdan, Moxey, Spearing, Clough . Blackburn (4-4-2): Steele 6; Henley 6.5, Hanley 6, Duffy 6, Olsson 7; Cairney 6 (Gestede 69 - 6), Evans 7, Tunnicliffe 6, Marshall 7 (Dunn 87), Rhodes 6.5, King 7 (Conway 75 - 6) Subs not used: Eastwood, Kilgallon, Varney, Williamson . Referee: Craig Pawson 5.5 . Att: 23,203 . Star man: Emile Heskey . And while this is another vital three points in Boltonâs quest to arrest the gap with the top six - they are also eight unbeaten - it was the combination of the two wily old strikers which really caught the imagination. Heskeyâs last goal in English football came for Aston Villa in August 2011 - ironically against the same opposition, who actually had him on trial just over a month ago - and it took him just 14 minutes on his return to find the net. âIâve got two old age pensioners playing for me,â Lennon grinned. âA lot of people were laughing behind our backs bringing these guys in. âOnly Gudjohnsen could see that pass and Heskey was awesome. I wasnât expecting that from him if Iâm honest. Heskey was a huge influence on the way we played.â Even so, this was a game Gary Bowyer left disgusted not to take anything from. Blackburn were the better side for lengthy spells and will rue the amount of missed opportunities once Josh King gave them a lead. Rudy Gestede hit a post, so too did Jordan Rhodes, while the clubâs top scorer somehow conspired to flash wide after giving Andy Lonergan the eyes one-on-one. Heskey is mobbed by his team-mates after making a dramatic start to life at his new club . Heskey accepts the applause after bagging Bolton's first goal of the afternoon . Ben Marshall drew a stunning one-handed save from the Bolton goalkeeper as they failed to capitalise on their dominance. It had looked so comfortable for Rovers. Rhodes went up for a high ball, got a shout from King and ducked underneath, allowing his strike partner to race clear. Still 40 yards from goal, he had plenty to do but rounded the goalkeeper and slotted in the opener amid cries for offside. After the break, however, they struggled to get to grips with the combination of Heskey and Gudjohnsen, the former equalising before Pratley smashed past Jason Steele. âIt shouldâve been done at half-time - itâs as simple as that,â Bowyer said. âLonerganâs man of the match, isnât he? You look at the chances we had.â Blackburn will feel aggrieved not to have equalised, but this rain-sodden afternoon belonged to a man who had long been forgotten.

"Louis van Gaal has been telling Manchester United's players to think of beating Stoke City while they are in bed. United will make it eight wins from 10 matches on Thursday if they beat Stoke at the Britannia Stadium. The idea of travelling to Staffordshire for a lunch-time kick-off on New Year's Day may not appeal to many people - particularly those who enjoyed a heavy night seeing in the new year. Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal wants his players to 'dream' before Stoke City clash . Wayne Rooney has flourished in a number of roles under the Dutchman since his arrival . But Van Gaal is relishing the opportunity of gaining ground on Manchester City and Chelsea, who play Sunderland and Tottenham Hotspur respectively later in the day. The Dutchman took little notice of Chelsea and City's slip-ups last weekend - United themselves failed to take advantage as they drew at Spurs - and the Dutchman insists only his players will decide whether they become genuine title contenders in the coming weeks. 'You have to always do it by yourself and not depend on results of the opponent,' the United manager said. 'You have to be busy with yourself, with your preparation, and the imagination of the game. 'All the players have to do that - dream of the game already, you have to play the game already in your bed.' Van Gaal takes his United side to the Britannia Stadium to face Stoke City on New Year's Day . Although United sit in third position after a nine-match unbeaten run, Van Gaal is yet to see a completely satisfactory performance from his team. The 3-1 win Boxing Day win over Newcastle United had the hallmarks of a victory from the Sir Alex Ferguson era, but Van Gaal was still not totally happy. Van Gaal is so demanding that he says he has enjoyed just a single 'perfect' performance from one of his teams during his 27-year career. And that came 20 years ago when he coached an Ajax team containing the likes of Edwin van der Saar, Edgar Davids and a 19-year-old Patrick Kluivert to a 2-0 Champions League win at Real Madrid. 'That was a perfect game - the only one in my eyes,' Van Gaal said. Robin van Persie (battling with Hugo Lloris) has found himself in among the goals again . 'I have not achieved that with Manchester United.' The fact that United dropped points at Spurs thanks to Hugo Lloris' brilliance, and at Villa Park, where the hosts played the final 25 minutes with 10 men, still rankles with Van Gaal. 'In the last three games - Aston Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham - we should have had nine points,' the former Barcelona manager said. 'Then, we would (have) four more points and we would be only six points (behind Chelsea).' Reflecting on his first five months in England, Van Gaal said he had been taken aback by the support he had received from United fans despite the club's stuttering start. 'I have never had the experience that when you lose or draw at home that the fans still applaud you, showing their belief in you. Never,' Van Gaal said. 'In Barcelona, (they wave) white handkerchiefs. In Bayern, they whistle. In Amsterdam, Ajax, they are shouting for someone else. United are also beginning to see the best of Colombian striker Radamel Falcao . 'Here, they stand up, and applaud. Unbelievable. That's why I'm thanking the fans because they were very important in my first six months.' Adnan Januzaj and Ander Herrera could return from illness and injury respectively for the Stoke match and Angel di Maria may feature after Van Gaal played down the seriousness of a pelvic injury. 'He's coming back. It's not serious,' Van Gaal said. Chelsea's Eden Hazard was subjected to a rash challenge by Phil Bardsley when the Blues went to Stoke last week, but Van Gaal is sure the officials will not let Thursday's match turn ugly. The United manager added: 'I think the referee is the most important man on the pitch always in relation to tackles. 'He has to allow it or not. We have Michael Oliver and I think he is a very good referee.' Van Gaal moved to praise referee Michael Oliver, who will take charge of the game at Stoke .","Manchester United face Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on Thursday .

"The infamous 'Chosen One' banner that celebrated David Moyes' arrival at Manchester United looks set to be auctioned off for charity. The banner took pride of place in the Stretford End last season after Moyes was anointed as United's manager by his illustrious predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson. However, after a traumatic tenure that lasted only nine months, the banner was taken down and is now lying in an Old Trafford storage room. The 'Chosen One' banner is displayed at Old Trafford during David Moyes' reign in charge . 'The Chosen One banner is still in a storage room at Old Trafford,' Andrew Kilduff of fansâ group Stretford End Flags told the Daily Telegraph. 'United have actually told us that it needs collecting as it belongs to us, but we just havenât got round to it yet. 'The National Football Museum had been keen to have it, but they havenât been back in touch, so we will probably look to auction it for charity now. 'We have auctioned a couple of banners in the past - we raised Â£2,000 for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâs charity by selling one of his - so it would be nice to do something similar with the Chosen One.' Sportsmail has learned that the group also turned down a Â£2,000 offer for the banner from a United supporter just after Moyes was sacked by the club in April, while there has also been mischievous interest from rival fans. The banner became a serious bone of contention as the Moyes' reign disintegrated in the second half of last season and many fans wanted the group to remove the sign before the Champions League home game against Olympiacos in March. A general view of the banner at Old Trafford which is now set to be auctioned off for charity . 'We raised the money for the banner quicker than any of the previous ones,' Kilduff added. 'Because Sir Alex Ferguson had asked for the fans to back David Moyes, this seemed a good way to do it. 'It was also unveiled for a home game against Chelsea so there was a bit of dig at Jose Mourinho in there as well. 'I donât think David Moyes ever liked it and, when fans began to call for it to be removed, we planned to hold a vote the day after the Everton game in April, but David was sacked the same day, so the decision was made for us.'

"Of all the questions asked of the new regime at Manchester United recently, those concerning a new contract for David de Gea are among the most pertinent. Since Sir Alex Ferguson shut his office door behind him for the last time 18 months ago, the United goalkeeper has perhaps been the clubâs most important player. Now De Gea has a recognised No 2 to compete with, in keeping with the modern trend in the Barclays Premier League. Instead of Scandinavian makeweight Anders Lindegaard, De Gea will soon have a three-time Champions League winner and Spanish international watching him from the substitutesâ bench. Victor Valdes (left, in action against Manchester United in 2011) will challenge David de Gea at Old Trafford . De Gea faces a fight on his hands to keep new signing Valdes at bay . Certainly the De Gea/Victor Valdes dynamic will be an interesting one over the coming weeks. Valdes has only recently recovered from a serious knee injury but has not signed an 18-month contract at United just to pick his nose â to steal a memorable Lindegaard quote â and his relationship with manager Louis van Gaal and goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek is one that stretches back to the day 12 years ago when he was given his debut at Barcelona. Valdes will seek to play over the coming weeks but the wider issue â that of De Geaâs own future in Manchester â remains unclear; his current contract expires at the end of next season, with Real Madrid known to be interested. United chief executive Ed Woodward and De Geaâs agent Jorge Mendes have already spoken and it is understood that official meetings are now planned to accelerate the process. Mendes is a friend of the club, but is a friend of Real Madrid, too. Madrid need a replacement for Iker Casillas, who is will be 34 in May, and De Gea is the outstanding candidate by far. For United, the issue is clear and it is odd that they have not secured one of the worldâs most valuable goalkeepers on a long-term deal already. Woodward says he is ârelaxedâ about the issue, but the lure of Madrid is understandably strong for De Gea, and United can only hope that the expressed preferences of his family prove significant in the weeks to come. Certainly, when Sportsmail spent time talking to former coaches and childhood friends of De Gea in October, the indications were that both the player and his parents are content in Manchester. That has not changed. The Spaniard has established himself as the first-choice keeper at United . In truth, dad Jose and mum Marivi, who live with De Gea in the city, now enjoy a stress-free English lifestyle and have little desire to see De Gea return to the spotlight of the Spanish game. As one source close to the family said: âThey are super-happy in Manchester. If it was all up to them, they would prefer for him to stay here. âIn Spain, there would be huge pressure. You have four newspapers per day devoted to Real and Barcelona, invading your privacy. To replace Iker Casillas for both Spain and Real Madrid â can you imagine the scrutiny he would face?â Van Gaal has no doubts about Valdesâs quality. Indeed, Hoek spoke glowingly about him last summer. Victor Valdes (centre) watches Manchester United play Chelsea at Old Trafford back in October .

He will challenge De Gea and that is how Van Gaal wants it. Just this week Valdes has been looking for accommodation in Wilmslow, where he will join the enclave of Spaniards that includes Juan Mata, Ander Herrera, Bojan Krkic and De Gea. An 18-month contract seems generous for a player who has only just recovered from such a serious injury and that would appear to suggest there was some competition from elsewhere for his signature; a more Machiavellian view would be that United are merely covering themselves in case De Geaâs contract talks donât go well. There have been suggestions that United are prepared to make the Spaniard the best-paid goalkeeper in the world in order to keep him. They may well have to.

"Aston Villa captain Ron Vlaar has played down talk of a move to Manchester United after claiming they would have contacted him if they were interested. Vlaar was a mainstay in Holland's defence under United manager Louis van Gaal at the World Cup in Brazil, prompting speculation that the pair could be reunited at Old Trafford. However, despite United's continuing problems at the back, 29-year-old Vlaar insists there has been no contact between himself and the club with the January transfer window about to open.

Speaking to Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, he said: 'I've never heard from them. If a club had really wanted me, I would have noticed. That has not been the case.' The Holland international was also publicly courted by Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in the summer - much to the annoyance of Villa boss Paul Lambert who has since insisted that none of his star players will be allowed to leave in January. âTheyâll (Vlaar and Fabian Delph) not go anywhere in January,â said Lambert. âItâs my say. The way January works, if somebodyâs worth something you may as well put another 15 zeroes on the end of it. Price is inflated. 'Even if anybody came in you would never let them go cheap or anything like that.â Asked if any sum could prise either player away, the Villa manager said: âNothing, no.â United manager Van Gaal has had to patch together a defence following a spate of injuries . United are understood to be interested in Mats Hummels, although a January deal is unlikely . United's defence has been beset by injuries this season with Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo all being sidelined - forcing Van Gaal to put his faith in inexperienced youngsters likeÂ Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair. The Red Devils are prepared to spend in January, although primary targets such as Borussia Dortmund's Mats Hummels are unlikely to be available until next season.

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger insists Inter Milan have not made a serious bid for Lukas Podolski, whilst maintaining he wants the forward to stay. The Serie A club are trying to land the Germany forward next month, but Wenger - who revealed Danny Welbeck is a doubt for the Gunners' clash against Southampton with a thigh injury - says their interest is laughable. Podolski is open to leaving but Wenger said: 'I want and hope he stays. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger wants to keep hold of Inter Milan target Lukas Podolski . Podolski, pictured after scoring against Anderlecht, has scored three goals in Europe so far this season . 'That is a joke. Inter Milan is not serious. They talk, there is only talk.' Podolski is yet to start a Premier League match for Arsenal so far this season. The 29-year-old has netted three Champions League goals this term, with the 2014 World Cup winner firing a double in Arsenal's 4-1 win against Galatasaray. He also scored a crucial winner away at Anderlecht, which dug the Gunners out of a hole. Wenger would like him to stay at the Emirates Stadium and rejected the idea that he would benefit from a loan spell away. Wenger, pictured with Podolski after the FA Cup final, does not believe Inter are keen on signing the forward . 'Podolski is a player of Arsenal Football Club and I want him to stay,' said the Arsenal boss. 'Apart from that, what it is to be professional is that as long as you are somewhere, you give your best to justify your wages and your love for the club. 'I hope so (that he will still be here at the end of January), yes. 'I don't really doubt in some positions (situations) where players need experience (they should go out on loan), but that is not the case for Podolski. 'For players who need practice because they are at a very young age, like Yaya Sanogo it is not impossible.' Podolski has scored 31 times in his 82 matches as an Arsenal player - but he has been a substitute for 27 of those appearances.

"Arsenal remain unconvincing in many areas and yet this was a day to savour for Arsene Wenger as four team above his dropped points and his players produced the sort of character they are usually accused of lacking. Two goals in three minutes just before half-time were enough to clinch victory at West Ham and, although more clinical finishing would have given the score-line a healthier glow, they have emerged from two London derbies in three days with six points. Wenger smiled with satisfaction and hailed his players for their resilience and durability, especially having played for 40 minutes with 10 men against Queenâs Park Rangers on Boxing Day.

'We had a solid, combative and united performance from the first to the last minute,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We made more chances and deserved to win the game - a positive, committed and direct game. Everyone did their job well. We were a bit jaded and had to dig deep.' Santi Cazorla opened the scoring from the spot, having reclaimed penalty duties from Alexis Sanchez who stole them against QPR and missed, and Danny Welbeck pounced for the second as West Ham were distracted by referee Neil Swarbrickâs decision to award the penalty. Swarbrick had not endeared himself to the home crowd in the fifth minute when he ruled out Alex Songâs splendid volley because Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate were offside. The penalty multiplied their anger but both decisions were understandable - even though Allardyce took issue with the offside in a big way, complaining about inconsistencies and a goal scored against his side by Romelu Lukaku at Everton in November. Once the win was in the bag, even Wenger admitted his surprise that the goal did not stand. Kouyate pulled one back after the break and Arsenal wobbled at the back and goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny struggled under the high ball. Substitute Enner Valencia almost levelled in a late scramble but, equally, the visitors should have extended their lead from one of many chances they carved open on the counter-attack.

Arsenal have now won 11 games at West Ham, more than any other side in Premier League history. It was West Hamâs eighth Premier League defeat in a row to Arsenal . West Ham goalkeeper Adrian produced a string of saves to thwart Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Sanchez and Cazorla, while Welbeck, having scored his first goal for nearly a month, dragged a couple of decent chances wide of the target. For a change, the win was not about Arsenalâs precision in attack but their determination and courage at the back, helped by Laurent Koscielny, back for only his second appearance during nearly three months of problems with his Achilles tendons. Koscielny is always a solid presence, but others stepped up too in this department. Per Mertesacker produced one terrific clearance, heading behind for a corner as Andy Carroll loomed over him, and Francis Coquelin, making his first Premier League start in nearly two years, added bite in midfield. In fact, Allardyce can be flattered by the team Wenger selected because the Arsenal boss rarely tinkers on account of the opposition. Coquelin was brought in alongside Mathieu Flamini to fight for the knock-downs won by Carroll in the air. Arsenal finished the game with the only six senior defenders in the first-team squad all on the pitch. 'We need to be stable defensively,' said Wenger. 'Weâve missed important players at the back. 'I felt Coquelin played well. He tired but in the first half in was very influential. It was a gamble but his passing was quick and sharp through the lines.'

With Kevin Nolan and Mark Noble on the bench, Alex Song was West Ham captain against the club he left for Barcelona in 2012, but he played most of the first-half like someone too desperate to prove a point, often caught in possession while over-elaborating. Song was more commanding after the break and did start the match by lashing a sweet volley into the net. He chose not to celebrate â unlike Allardyce who pumped his fists in the air â but there was a flag up and referee Swarbrick ruled it out. Kouyate and Diafra Sakho were offside and jumped out of the way of the ball in front of Szczesny. It seemed like a good decision but, itâs true, on another day it might have been allowed. Arsenal went ahead four minutes before the interval when Winston Reid tripped Cazorla as he ran at goal and the Spaniard scored, sending Adrian the wrong way from the spot. Danny Welbeck (second right) can hardly miss from four yards as Arsenal almost immediately double their lead . While Welbeck (second left) goes on the score sheet it is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (right) who gets much of the plaudits . Welbeck celebrates the goal, his 12th for the season, with a two finger salute . For the second, Mathieu Debuchy eluded Kouyate and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain ran the ball to the line before cutting a low cross into the centre where Welbeck slid in behind James Tomkins. Kouyate struck early in the second half, climbing above Debuchy to meet a cross from Tomkins, the centre-half who found himself on the right wing and skipped past Cazorla as if he wasnât there. It offered hope, but that is where the fight-back ended and Arsenal have won their last nine against West Ham. A win at Southampton on New Yearâs Day and Arsenal will be back in the top four. 'I always had belief,' said Wenger. They are 13 points behind leaders Chelsea and expect key players like Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey back next month. They couldnât, could they?

"Cesc Fabregas believes referee Anthony Taylor 'did not have the best game of his life' after booking the Chelsea midfielder for diving during Sunday's draw at Southampton. Jose Mourinho was adamant Chelsea should have had a potentially match-defining penalty early in the second half when Fabregas went down under pressure from Matt Targett. Instead of a spot-kick, however, referee Taylor deemed it a dive and booked the infuriated Spain midfielder - part of a what manager Mourinho believes is a growing 'campaign' against his side. Chelsea star Cesc Fabregas said that referee Anthony Taylor was not at his best in the game at St Mary's . Fabregas smiles and holds his hands up in disbelief as referee Taylor holds his yellow card for simulation . The Spaniard cannot contain his emotions as he is shown a yellow card after apparently diving in the box . 'There was definitely contact,' Fabregas said on chelseafc.com. 'I don't think the referee had the best game of his life but we're all human and a bad day at the office can happen to anyone. 'That's it, let's not talk more about it, we have to talk about football.' After the Barclays Premier League leaders' run of five successive wins in all competitions was ended with a 1-1 draw at Southampton, Mourinho claimed Chelsea are the victim of a diving campaign which is costing them points. 'In other countries where I worked before, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be a front-page scandal because it is a scandal,' the Chelsea boss said following the match. Replays show that contact is made with Fabregas as he controls the ball past the oncoming Matt Targett . A reverse angle shows that Targett's right leg makes contact and appears to trip the Chelsea midfielder . 'I think it is a scandal because it is not a small penalty - it is a penalty like Big Ben. 'In this country - and I am happy with that, more than happy with that - we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result. 'I am happy that it is this way, with respect for the referee. He made a big mistake like I make, like the players make sometimes.' Chelsea have found themselves at the heart of the simulation debate in recent weeks, with Diego Costa and Willian booked for supposedly taking a tumble in the win against Hull. Jose Mourinho is clearly unhappy with the decision after seeing one of his players booked for simulation . After that match Tigers boss Steve Bruce compared a Gary Cahill dive as 'like something out of Swan Lake' and West Ham manager Sam Allardyce accused Branislav Ivanovic of going down 'looking for a penalty' on Boxing Day. Asked if the Cahill and Ivanovic incidents had influenced referees, Mourinho retorted: 'They are not incidents, they are not incidents. 'Of course [it has influenced the referee]. That's a campaign, that's a clear campaign. 'People, pundits, commentators, coaches from other teams - they react with Chelsea in a way they don't react to other teams. 'They put lots of pressure on the referee and the referee makes a mistake like this. We lose two points, Fabregas earns a yellow card.' Mourinho made those comments to the BBC and let loose again in the post-match press conference. The Portuguese said this has been an issue since the first day of the season, when Costa was wrongly booked for a dive against Burnley, and called for a change to the system. 'The double punishment is something unbelievable,' Mourinho said. 'Anthony [should go to a] screen, see that he has made a mistake - he is a good guy, an honest guy. 'He writes, ""I made a mistake, let's clean the yellow card for Cesc"". It should be a simple process.'","Cesc FabregasÂ was booked for apparent simulation on Sunday .

Man of the Match: Hugo Lloris . Despite playing at left wing back, Ashley Young spent most of his time in the Tottenham half. Click HERE to see more from our brilliant Match Zone . To be fair, neither team should be particularly happy with this. Manchester United had the best of the first half but were undone by a combination of their own inefficiency in front of goal and the brilliance of goalkeeper Hugo Lloris. The second half belonged to Tottenham but they did not carve out enough chances of import and while David de Gea was again impressive, it did not require heroics to keep the home team at bay. The draw was the proper result, but those who expected a high-scoring affair given the ambition of these clubs and the array of talent on display left disappointed. Harry Kane worked hard but to scant effect, while Unitedâs expensive acquisitions could find no way through. Louis van Gaal picked the same United side that beat Newcastle on Boxing Day â the first consistent starting XI for United since November 2012, a run of 85 league games â and will no doubt believe he had no option given one day to prepare between fixtures. Yet United looked leggy by the end, with Tottenham in the ascendancy. They could have lost it with eight minutes remaining when Kane put through Ryan Mason with only De Gea to beat. He snatched at his shot and blasted over. There was an inevitability about the slow fade to the end from there. Michael Carrick, whose return to the Manchester United team has coincided with their recent good form, looks to play a pass . Kane throws himself at a chipped pass from Andros Townsend but the Spurs striker couldn't quite get enough on the shot . Ryan Mason chops down Manchester United striker Robin van Persie, giving away a free kick in a dangerous area . Juan Mata sees his free kick deflected off the Tottenham wall and onto Hugo Lloris' post, resulting in a goalmouth scramble . Neither Falcao or Van Persie were able to turn the ball over the line as it came back off the post, Ben Davies and Lloris scrambled it away . It has been hard to overshadow De Gea this season, but Tottenham goalkeeper Lloris pulled it off. If there was one exceptional display here, it was his first 45 minutes, which shaded Unitedâs standout performers, Ashley Young and Juan Mata. Faced with a stellar front line and a supporting cast that is finally beginning to click, only Lloris prevented United having the game won by half-time. He flew through the air acrobatically and stuck in a tackle on Robin van Persie that would have pleased John Terry. Yet, from a long way out, this was a game that was going to be settled by one goal â or left wanting for goals at all. As Tottenham are currently playing the inexperienced Kane as a lone front man, they will have less to regret. After the money spent on Unitedâs forwards this season, nobody should leave a tense affair like this talking about Tottenhamâs goalkeeper. Van Gaal would surely have expected to find a match-winner in his ranks, even accounting for seasonal fatigue. The promise is certainly there. Mata is growing into his role this season and twice he picked out Radamel Falcao in the first half, Lloris dealing with both shots comfortably. More fortunate was a 23rd-minute escape after Mataâs free-kick from 25 yards out clipped the top of the Tottenham wall and deflected on to Llorisâs near post. It rebounded, leaving the goalkeeper stranded and provoking a mad scramble, ended only when Vlad Chiriches cleared under pressure from Van Persie. Wayne Rooney, continuing in his new midfield role, challenges in the air with Benjamin Stambouli as United looked to take control . Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal named an unchanged team for the first time, despite having two games in three days . These were testing times for Tottenham and a minute later, pandemonium again. This time it was Van Persieâs header that provoked the confusion, Falcao and Phil Jones competing to force the ball over the line, before Jan Vertonghen cleared it with an acrobatic overhead kick. The replays showed the ball was in before Vertonghen made contact, but also that Jones was offside, and the free-kick to Tottenham was the correct decision. Unitedâs De Gea has proven expert at saving with his feet this season, but Lloris showed he was a match for that skill, too. Michael Carrick played a lovely through-ball over the top to Van Persie, putting him clear with only Lloris to beat. For a moment a breakthrough seemed certain, but Van Persie required too many touches and Lloris as good as tackled him, centre-half style, in the six-yard box. Rounding off an outstanding first half, Lloris tipped out a cross by Young that swung in viciously, becoming a tasty shot. There were odd threats after half-time â most particularly two wild shots over the bar from Van Persie and Mata â but it was Tottenhamâs game from there. Unlike United, however, they rarely got in behind the back line and most of their opportunities came from range. Andros Townsend, Federico Fazio and Christian Eriksen all had a go, but it would have been a poor show from De Gea if any of the attempts had gone in, and his form is too good right now to be beaten from distance. Managers like solid performances like this, particularly over the gruelling festive period, but anyone who has seen Chelsea or striker-less Manchester City of late will know the difference.

"Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini accused his players of complacency after squandering a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Burnley.

There are no excuses from us on that. 'I think we have played seven games less this season compared to last season. I never question the physicality of the group. They are super-fit. The distances have changed this season and we actually cover less distance in this division then they did in the Championship.â Pellegrini also complained that the officials were responsible for allowing Burnley a way back into the game, arguing that George Boyd was in an offside position for Burnleyâs first goal.

Looked untroubled in unfamiliar defensive role, spraying superb attacking passes and playing very comfortably. Martin Skrtel - 7 . Kept Bony quiet and led Liverpool's developing back three well. Looked an attacking threat from set-pieces too. Liverpool defender Emre Can holds off the challenge ofÂ Bafetibis Gomis during a comfortable performance . Mamadou Sakho - 6.5 . Still doesn't look good enough for an elite Premier League side and was often poor in trying to clear defensive lines. Jordan Henderson - 7.5 . Captained Liverpool in Gerrard's absence and didn't disappoint. Controlled the midfield and set up opening goal. Liverpool left back Alberto Moreno (right) celebrates his opener at Anfield on Monday evening . Alberto Moreno - 7 . Scored first Anfield goal but was just as effective defensively as he was going forward. Looks settled in 3-4-3 formation. Javi Manquillo - 6.5 . Game seemed to pass midfielder by, but was alert defensively to prevent Swansea from gaining an attacking influence on the wing. Raheem Sterling went close with this effort on Monday but couldn't score in the 4-1 victory at Anfield . Lucas - 7 . The enforcer in the Liverpool midfield displayed a mature performance with a 90 per cent completion rate from 59 passes. Philippe Coutinho - 7.5 (Fabio Borini 90) Full of invention and was a key attacking influence, with his back heel assist key in build up to Lallana's second goal. Raheem Sterling - 6.5 (Mario Balotelli 83) A menace on the run, but night was spiked by poor finishing and a moment of madness to lash out at Fernandez. Lucky not to see red. England international Adam Lallana (right) fired in a brace to ensure Liverpool beat Swansea at Anfield . Adam Lallana - 8 (Lazar Markovic 77) Fortunate, yet alert for first goal. But second strike was much more liking of a player costing Â£25million. Excellent showing. SUBS . Lazar Markovic - 6.5 . Given just 13 minutes and slotted well into a team which already had the game won. More to come though from the forward. Mario Balotelli (83) Fabio Borini (90) SWANSEAÂ (4-2-3-1): .

Swansea keeperÂ Lukasz Fabianski (right) gifted Adam Lallana Liverpool's second with a poor clearance . Federico Fernandez - 5.5 . Made seven interceptions, two clearances and battled well with Sterling. But also in a defence that conceded four goals. Ashley Williams - 5 . Bullied by Martin Skrtel when defending corners and couldn't prevent Liverpool's attackers from running riot. Jazz Richards - 4.5 (Angel Rangel 45) Had so many problems dealing with Liverpool's attacks, he was hooked off at half-time for Rangel. Neil Taylor - 5.5 . Attempted to add width to Swansea's left wing and often resourceful in possession. Not as convincing in defence however. Former Liverpool midfielder Jonjo Shelvey (centre) headed into his own net during a disappointing evening . Jonjo Shelvey - 3.5 . Hard to imagine how Anfield return could have got much worse. Should have seen red for elbow on Can and scored own goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson - 6.5 . Couldn't trouble the Liverpool defence with much of his attacking play but was well alert to pounce for Swansea goal. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates scoring immediately after Liverpool's second but it failed to ignite a comeback . Wayne Routledge - 5.5 . On a night when Swansea needed their speedy wingers to shine, the midfielder was literally caught with his shorts down. Nathan Dyer - 5.5 . Struggled like Dyer to carry Swansea's main creative threat. Had a header comfortably saved but offered little else. Leon Britton - 5.5 (Ki Sung-yueng 67) Lost out in the midfield battle.

Got involved after replacing Bony, but couldn't find the target despite going close on a few occasions - including hitting woodwork. Ki Sung-yueng - 5 .

"There is possibly one rugby ball in the entire building, but Brian OâDriscoll manages to find it and cradle it in his arms for the whole interview. Here is a man who has spent most of his life with a ball in his hands â developing such a natural connection that it has almost become a fifth limb. As a player, he relied on guile and sleight of hand. These are traits that, he believes, are becoming devalued in a changing arena where junior players spend more time lifting weights than honing their skills. There is a diminishing marketplace for âspindly little kidsâ â the words used to describe OâDriscoll when he arrived at his first Ireland training session in 1999 â but the Irishman believes it is time to restore some old-fashioned values. âI was exposed to the gym at about 28,â joked OâDriscoll. âI never had a huge love or appetite for it â it was just a means to an end. I get burnt in the sun, so thereâs no point me getting pecs for when I take my shirt off in the summer. Brian O'Driscoll thinks there is too much emphasis for younger players on to do well in the gym . The Irish rugby legend fears that learning the finer arts of the game is second behind performing in the gym . âIn more recent years I got into it because it was a necessary evil. You have to adapt. You have to get a passion for it, but I donât just know if that balance is there at the moment. âI never loved doing weights the way these young guys do. Their technique is phenomenal but itâs as if theyâre winning if they have great scores in the gym. Theyâre not . . . theyâre rugby players. âIâm not privy to the English set-up but at the academies in Ireland there is a huge focus on the weights room, as opposed to whether they can throw a 10-metre pass on the run. They should be rugby players becoming athletes, not athletes becoming rugby players.â The team culture in English rugby encourages players to strive to be top of the charts in the playersâ room. It becomes a machismo contest to see who has the highest one-rep maximum on the bench-press or the Olympic squat. O'Driscoll retired from international rugby earlier in 2014 after helping Ireland win the Six Nations . The 35-year-old has been working as a pundit for BT and will do so for the upcoming Six Nations . Size matters, but amid a growing chorus of concern, OâDriscoll believes the obsession is only serving to widen the gulf in class between northern and southern hemisphere teams â with the All Blacks setting the standard. âI donât think the gym monkey thing applies to them as much as it does over here,â said OâDriscoll. âThey have farmer strength. The Polynesian guys are pretty strong without going to the gym. âIn New Zealand, they focus way more from an early age on skills. They do everything with a ball. They do all their fitness work with a ball and thatâs why they have better skill levels. They have the balance; they have that physicality but they are able to mix their game up.â With a strong Pacific Island core, many of the All Blacks are blessed with natural strength â Julian Savea and Sonny Bill Williams are both of Samoan descent. O'Driscoll backs New Zealand to retain their crown and win the 2015 Rugby World Cup in England . England suffered defeats by both South Africa and New Zealand at Twickenham in the autumn internationals . O'Driscoll at a rugby event in east London . A clean sweep of victories on their European tour was rewarded with a new deal for coach Steve Hansen and the Kiwis reinforced their position as favourites to win next yearâs World Cup. England and Wales both failed to shoot down the world champions, but focus now turns towards the Six Nations, which kicks off on February 6. OâDriscollâs involvement will be as a pundit. He missed just one Six Nations campaign between 1999 and 2014, so it is natural that he still has the occasional pang to be involved. Ireland were expected to struggle after their talismanâs retirement but fared best out of the home nations during the autumn internationals. OâDriscoll says that New Zealand will win the World Cup, but he is not so decisive when asked about his countryâs credentials to win the Grand Slam. âIreland are the form team and England look as though they took a step back in November,â he said. âI think it will be the most open Six Nations for years â but I canât see anyone winning the Slam. I donât think Stuart Lancaster has been able to pair up people he would have liked to, particularly with Manu Tuilagi being injured. You would imagine that heâll now back George Ford at fly-half going into the Six Nations. âI think a really good foil for Ford would be Kyle Eastmond and Manu. I think they could complement each other really well. I also really like Jonathan Joseph and Luther Burrell â who can play plenty for a big man â but Iâd probably go with Eastmond.â The former centre thinks Ireland are the form team heading into the Six Nations in February . Englandâs midfield puzzle remains unsolved. The November Tests provided more questions than answers and Tuilagi is being heralded as the solution to Lancasterâs soft centre. Like the Polynesian All Blacks, the Leicester man also has roots in the Pacific Islands. He is Englandâs most naturally powerful player and has the potential to spark huge collisions in the contact area. OâDriscoll, a healthy-lifestyle ambassador for Coca-Cola, would never shirk a tackle on a player such as Tuilagi, but admits he is concerned about the long-term impact of the ever-increasing physicality. Last seasonâs England Under 18 side were, man for man, heavier than the senior England side who reached the 1991 World Cup final. This has a direct impact on the risks of concussion and OâDriscollâs family have been at the forefront in raising awareness of head injuries. O'Driscoll took part in a surprise rugby session with teens in east London ahead of the Rugby World Cup . âIt was not something we sat and talked about over Sunday dinner,â said OâDriscoll, who suffered a series of concussions as a player. âThere have always been head injuries in the game. The impacts are getting bigger, but we are more aware of concussion these days. âItâs not a cool thing to play on with a head knock any more. It is not manly, it is not heroic; it is just stupid. âWeâre guinea pigs from the physicality in the game, not from a concussion point of view but how our joints are going to be when we are in our 40s and 50s after the impacts we are taking. You see guys from the amateur era having knee and hip replacements at 45 and 50. âHaving said that, I think we are physically considerably fitter than they were in the amateur era so our bodies are more toned to take that level of impact, at least I would be hopeful that thatâs the case.â BrianÂ OâDriscoll was taking part in a surprise rugby session with teens in east London to launch the official partnership between Coca-Cola and Rugby World Cup 2015.

"Napoli twice came from behind against Juventus to win the Italian Super Cup on penalties in Qatar. Massimo Allegri's side took the lead through Carlos Tevez in both normal and extra time but Napoli forward Gonzalo Higuain proved he could match his compatriot with a brace of his own. And in a dramatic penalty shootout that saw both keepers produce a string of stunning saves it fell to the unfortunate Simone Padoin to miss the decisive spot kick that handed the Neapolitans their first Super Cup success in almost a quarter of a century.

The last time these two teams met in the Italian Super Cup final was in 2012 when the Turin giants ran out comfortable winners in Beijing. The 2014 final was played in different country but the final's first incident was depressingly familiar for Rafa Benitez's Napoli side. The crowd were barely in their seats when Tevez scored the game's opening goal. The Argentine forward slotted the ball through Rafael Cabral's legs after being put through one-on-one. Napoli's Jose Callejon had gone nine games without a goal before Monday's game and it was a drought that really should have ended early in the second half. Marek Hamsik's defence-splitting pass provided a glorious chance for the former Real Madrid man but he dragged his shot wide of the far post. But the equaliser did eventually come, ending another Napoli player's barren spell in the process. Gonzalo Higuain found the net for the first time in seven matches, heading in Jonathan de Guzman's perfectly-weighted cross. Napoli were the better side for most of the game but after finally finding the back of the net they lost confidence and sat back, allowing Juventus to come at them. Their timidity almost cost them late on but Arturo Vidal and Tevez conspired to squander chances and send the game to extra time. As the game wore on the humidity and heat of the Doha night drained the players' energy but Tevez still had more to offer. After some neat work from Paul Pogba on the edge of the box, Tevez beat a defender and slotted home his second of the night to restore his side's lead. The Serie A champions couldn't hold their lead though as Higuain equalised yet again to take the game to a penalty shootout. Both sides appeared certain to win during the course of the finale but it was the unfortunate Padoin who provided the final nail in Juventus's coffin.

"The astounding response to Fernando Torres' homecoming shows no sign of waning as the Chelsea flop continues to prove a record-breaking hit on his return to Atletico Madrid. Torres attracted the biggest welcome ever for a Spanish player's unveiling at a club with 45,000 fans turning out to watch him wave and juggle on the Vicente Calderon pitch. Now the No 19 shirt he will wear is breaking its own benchmarks at the club. Fernando Torres has been given a hero's welcome on his return to Atletico Madrid . Replicas of the No 19 shirt Torres will wear are flying off the shelves in record numbers in Madrid . Spanish media crane their cameras to get shots of Atleti's prodigal son . The Atletico store alone sold 2,000 of the strip with Torres' name and 19 on the back on Sunday alone, Marca reports, at an average of 222 shirts an hour if the nine hours the shop was open are taken into account. Torres takes the 19 worn previously at the club by Diego Costa, before the Brazil-born Spaniard made a Â£32million move to Chelsea where he's scored 15 goals in 25 appearances. The No 9 Torres called his own while scoring 84 goals in 214 league matches for Atletico before going to Liverpool seven-and-a-half year ago, is now worn by Croatian star Mario Mandzukic.

The 22-year-old also has interest from Barclays Premier League sides but Moyes said: 'Iâd like to add one or two to the squad, but on loan if it can be done.

"A judge busted for sending a nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff has defiantly admitted sexting the same snap to a string of other women. Wade McCree, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd Circuit, nonchalantly batted away claims the seedy semi-naked shower pictures sent by mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate'. When approached by Fox 2 News, he said: 'Hot dog, yep that's me. I've got no shame in my game. I ain't talking to nobody else's wife. You can almost get that here and now. Scroll down for video... Inappropriate: Judge Wade McCree sent this nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff . Nonchalant: Wade McCree, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd Circuit, batted away claims sending a semi-naked shower picture via mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate' 'I've sent that out to other women. There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.' McCree, who's appeared on the channel's Let It Rip show preaching self-respect, has played down the incident. It is reminiscent of former congressman Anthony Weiner's spectacular fall from grace and a plot-line from new spies-in-the-D.C.-suburbs drama Homeland. But his seemingly arrogant stance has angered his colleague's husband. The court bailiff's spouse said: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot that he's flawed. Questions: Anthony Weiner lost his post as Congressman after sending nearly nude pictures of himself to women over Twitter . Under fire: Anthony Weiner initially denied the accusations but eventually admitted to sending the pictures . 'He's not what he appears to be, at least not to the general public because he has access to kids, he has access to different charitable functions. 'He's been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to the picture, you see what he's really all about. 'What kind of man would send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?' Fox 2 legal analyst Charlie Langton claimed McCree would 'probably' now lose his job - in echoes of former Congressman Antony Weiner who was forced to resign in June last year. He said: 'If you take your cell phone and you send naked pictures to people that's called sexting. Echoes: A similar storyline of a Congressman being busted for sexting to younger women appears in drama Homeland, starring Damian Lewis as Nicholas Brody (left) and Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison (right) 'High school kids do it these days, I wasn't aware that judges do it too. I mean it's borderline criminal... and weird.' Jokingly, Langton later admitted the judge was 'pretty fit' but then questioned 'what exactly he was fit for'. Weinger quit after it emerged he sent a lewd photograph to a 21-year-old woman in Washington over Twitter. Although he initially denied the accusations, he eventually admitted to sending the picture - and others before and after his marriage. His wife Huma Abedin, a Hillary Clinton aide, stood by him throughout the scandal. The scandal recently resurfaced when it was mirrored in Showtime's spy-drama Homeland - where a politician was ousted for also texting nude pictures of himself to young women. The bailiff's husband said they were now filing a complaint with the prosecutor and the Judicial Tenure Commission.","Detroit 3rd Circuit judge Wade McCree 'sent snap out to other women'

"Romelu Lukaku's last-gasp goal forced an FA Cup third round replay as Everton came from behind to draw 1-1 with Barclays Premier League rivals West Ham. Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein takes you through the talking points from Tuesday night's clash at Goodison Park. TOFFEES TRIO KNOW WAY TO WEMBLEY . Everton haven't won a major trophy for 20 years but three of their starters on Tuesday night already have FA Cup winners' medals. Gareth Barry could add another FA Cup medal to his cabinet if Everton go the distance . Thirty-seven-year-old defender Sylvain Distin was in the Portsmouth team that lifted the cup in 2008, Gareth Barry played for Manchester City when they were triumphant in 2011 and goalkeeper Joel Robles was in the Wigan line-up when they shocked City at Wembley in 2013. Everton sub Arouna Kone also played for Wigan in that final. NO-NONSENSE REID SHOWS HIS CLASS . Winston Reid was his usual uncomplicated self despite speculation over his future. The 26-year-old New Zealander is a defenders' defender and had to be at his most alert with opponent, Romelu Lukaku, even bigger and stronger than he is. Reid's reading of the game was excellent and saved his goalkeeper Adrian with one clearance, the question is whether he has enough finesse on the ball for a club like Arsenal as he enters the last six months of his contract at Upton Park. West Ham defender Winston Reid did enough to keep Romelu Lukaku at bay until the dying seconds . Recent FA Cup history favoured West Ham who had not lost to Everton in the competition since 1957 when future managers Malcolm Allison and John Bond were in their line-up. The most famous cup meeting between the clubs came in a 1980 semi-final replay when Frank Lampard Sr scored the winning goal for Second Division Hammers. NO ROMANCE AT GOODISON . The lack of atmosphere at Goodison was in contrast to what neighbours Liverpool experienced at AFC Wimbledon the previous evening. Plenty of empty blue seats made it feel more like an under-21s development game; Tuesday nights under the floodlights should be reserved for FA Cup replays, not third round ties made-for-TV. There were plenty of empty seats at Goodison Park as just 22,236 fans attended the FA Cup clash . It wasn't warm on Merseyside, but certainly not freezing. Maybe you could just about excuse Everton's Bryan Oviedo from wearing gloves, he is from Costa Rica close to the equator. But was it really necessary for Kevin Mirallas, a Belgian international whose formative football years were spent in northern France with Lille, to cover up on such a benign evening.

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce revealed he was forced to leave Andy Carroll out of the club's FA Cup clash with Everton due to an injury picked up in training. The former Newcastle and Liverpool man 'kicked the floor' in training and the Hammers' manager decided it wasn't worth risking him at Goodison Park. Speaking on BT Sport, Allardyce said: 'Andy kicked the floor in training and obviously his foot's a bit sore so we didn't bring him with us. Andy Carroll was left out of West Ham's squad to face Everton due to an injury picked up in training . Hammers manager Sam Allardyce was talking on BT Sport ahead of the game against Everton . 'We didn't (want to) risk the fact that if he'd played today it would've probably got worse.' Carroll has endured numerous fitness problems since joining the Hammers so fans are likely to forgive Allardyce for his caution. In better news for the club, Alex Song may be available for selection in January after Allardyce suggested he may not play in the African Cup of Nations after all. Song was initially left out of the Cameroon squad after falling out with manager Volker Finke. Finke was reportedly then pressured in to changing his mind by the country's FA and Song eventually flew out to join up with the squad. But now Allardyce has hinted at yet another U-turn by claiming the former Arsenal midfielder may not feature in the competition. He said: 'He's out there. We're not absolutely certain if he's staying there or not. There's been a bit of confusion over it but we'll find out in the next day or so.'

Even though this is the clubâs first FA Cup tie at home in four years, the poor response has been blamed on the game being moved to a day when many people are just returning to work after Christmas. The move brought an angry reaction from fansâ groups, although Burnley are still expecting a healthy number of supporters to buy tickets on the day. Chief executive Lee Hoos has defended the decision to play on a Monday and close the stand, claiming the decision was made with police and stewarding resources in mind as well as the fitness of Sean Dycheâs squad. He said: âThere are a lot of fixtures over the Christmas and New Year period and to maximise player recovery time, Monday is an optimal day to play. âWe are sure that the long-term goal shared by all fans is to have a full squad capable of being competitive in all competitions. With regard to the Family Stand closure, this is based purely on the historical lack of demand for tickets for cup matches in the early stages. 'If supporters purchase enough tickets to indicate there is a demand for opening additional stands for this game, we will happily open the stand.â Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham side have won five of their last six games in all competitions .

"Mike Ashley has appeared to hit back in the battle for control at Rangers after Sports Direct executive Barry Leach was appointed finance director at Ibrox. Leach, who is head of brands at Ashley's sportswear firm, has been acting as a consultant at Rangers since late October but his appointment to the board was confirmed on Monday evening. The appointment came hours after the club announced they had secured a Â£500,000 loan from football club chairman Sandy Easdale to provide working capital in the coming days. Sports Direct executive Barry Leach has been appointed as the new finance director at Ibrox . Ashley's influence appeared to be on the wane after the Scottish Football Association rejected his attempts to increase his shareholding from nine to almost 30 per cent. The Newcastle owner and Rangers also face SFA disciplinary action relating to his dual interests and the fact that Easdale had to loan the club urgently-needed money suggested the Englishman might be prepared to step back. But the appointment of Leach, who joins former Newcastle managing director Derek Llambias on the board, shows Ashley is prepared to fight back against competition from Dave King and the so-called Three Bears, who snapped up almost a third of shares in the club in separate deals last week. The move also comes after the emergence of interest from American banker Robert Sarver, the owner of the Phoenix Suns basketball team, whose approach to the club was confirmed in a statement to the stock exchange on Monday morning. But his interest preceded the share purchases of the four Rangers-supporting businessmen and the club needs a new influx of cash quickly. Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United and also has a stake in Scottish giants Rangers . The precarious nature of their finances was laid bare in details over Easdale's interest-free loan, which Rangers revealed was secured on transfer money due from Lewis Macleod's move to Brentford on Friday for a reported Â£1million fee. The sale of the 20-year-old Scotland squad player had angered Rangers fans given he has been one of the most highly-rated young players to emerge from Murray Park, and the desperate need for the cash was apparent when the statement announced that Easdale's loan would be used for 'general working capital purposes over the next few days'. Rangers, who borrowed Â£3m from Ashley late last year, have previously stated their need to recoup the vast majority of the Â£8.3m losses made last season. There were claims that Easdale's money had prevented Rangers being wound up due to an overdue national insurance bill, but it is understood the Scottish Professional Football League is satisfied that there was no default that breached its rules on reporting tax debts. Rangers are soon due money from the Â£200,000 transfer of Charlie Telfer to Dundee United and Tannadice chairman Stephen Thompson revealed he had been sent a reminder by the Ibrox club. But the club appears to be in dire need of a major influx of cash soon and it is unclear how they will get it despite plans for a share issue. Rangers shareholder Sandy Easdale is pictured taking his seat Hibernian's Easter Road stadium last month . Ashley is unable to increase his stake - if he sticks to the SFA agreement - and American Sarver's offer of investment would probably only succeed if he managed to independently snap up a major amount of shares in what would likely be a time-consuming and expensive exercise. His approach to the club appears to have been predicated on the possibility of shareholders voting to accept allowing him an exclusive share deal - but a similar resolution was heavily defeated at the club's annual general meeting on December 22. Rangers said his approach 'may or may not lead to an offer being made for the company'. King and the Three Bears - Douglas Park, George Taylor and George Letham - together own about 35 per cent of shares, although they stress they are not working as a group. But a consortium including King and the two Georges saw a Â£16m investment offer rejected by the Rangers board in late October in favour of Ashley's intervention, which saw him strengthen his already tight grip on the club's retail division. The Three Bears also offered Â£6.5m to underwrite the planned share issue just before they each snapped up shares. Rangers chairman David Somers (left) and non-executive director Derek Llambias (right) It is understood that Sarver has had tentative talks with the Three Bears but it is unclear whether he would welcome being a member of a consortium. And the bitter nature of the battle for boardroom power continued when King hit back at claims that Easdale had come to the club's rescue. Jack Irvine, spokesman for Sandy and his brother James, who is a Rangers plc director, said: 'Once again Sandy has stepped up to the plate with this half-million pound loan from his own pocket. 'Whilst we welcomed the recent share purchases by Dave King and Douglas Park and his consortium, this unfortunately did not put any funds into the club. 'Sandy was the only option for this cash injection at such short notice. The Easdale family remain totally committed to achieving a satisfactory financial future for Rangers and they hope all parties can work together in the future with that common goal.' In response, King told the Telegraph: 'Given that Sandy Easdale rejected new funds and was a chief architect in getting the club into this mess, lending a small amount of money is the minimum he should have done. As part restitution he should make the Â£500,000 a donation rather than a loan.' American financier Robert Sarver had submitted an Â£18million offer for a controlling stake in Rangers .","Barry Leach has been appointed as the new finance Director at Rangers .

"Tony Pulis wants to add Paul Jewell to his new-look coaching team at West Bromwich Albion. And the the new Baggies boss also wants to draft in Carlo Nash to be his goalkeeping coach at the Hawthorns. The Midlands club confirmed the departures of coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely with immediate effect on Monday following the sacking of Alan Irvine last week. West Brom boss Tony Pulis shouts instructions to his players during Saturday's win against Gateshead . Former Ipswich manager Paul Jewell is expected to become Pulis's first-team coach at West Brom . Carlo Nash - who worked with Pulis at Stoke - is set to be announced as the club's new goalkeeping coach . And Pulis has wasted no time in shaking-up his back-room team at the Midlands club and is close to making his first two new captures. Jewell, who has been out of work since leaving Ipswich in 2012, is set to join as first-team coach. Nash, who played for Pulis at Stoke, will work with the club's goalkeepers. Pulis' trusted assistant Dave Kemp has already joined, while Gerry Francis is set to agree a part-time coaching role. West Bromwich Albion today announce the departures of senior coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely. The trio have left the club with immediate effect as Tony Pulis prepares to finalise the appointment of a new backroom staff. Director of football administration Richard Garlick said: 'The Club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure. 'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team. 'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up. 'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff. 'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.' Downing became first-team coach under Roy Hodgson, in March 2011, before being elevated to Assistant Head Coach in December 2011 following the departure of Michael Appleton to become Portsmouth manager. Following Steve Clarke's departure in December 2013, Downing took the reins at The Hawthorns in caretaker capacity - his side winning one and drawing three of his five Barclays Premier League games in charge. Albion recruited Downing as Academy Under-18s coach in July 2009. He also became responsible for running the Baggies' Barclays Premier Reserve League team at the start of the 2010/11 campaign. Kelly joined Albion as Alan Irvine's Joint-Assistant Head Coach alongside Downing in June. Kiely became Albion Goalkeeper Coach in March 2010. The former Republic of Ireland man initially joined the club as a player in January 2007, helping the club to the Championship play-off final later that year. The following season he scooped the Championship's 2007/08 Puma Golden Glove thanks to his 18 clean sheets in all competitions after helping Albion clinch the title and reach and FA Cup semi-final. He made 88 appearances for Albion as a player. In confirming the departures of Kelly, Downing and Kiely, Richard Garlick, the clubâs director of football administration, said: 'The club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure. 'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

"Norwich City manager Neil Adams has resigned with immediate effect and will take a break from the game until the summer. First team coach Mike Phelan will take caretaker charge, starting with Saturday's visit to Championship leaders Bournemouth. Norwich are currently seventh in the table - three points off the play-off places - and were knocked out of the FA Cup at League One Preston North End on Saturday. Neil Adams has resigned as Norwich City manager with immediate effect and will take a break from football . Norwich were beaten 2-0 at Preston in the FA Cup on Saturday, with Paul Gallagher (left) on target . Played 32 . Won 11 . Drawn 8 . Lost 13 . Win Ratio 34.38 . A statement released on the club website on Monday  read: 'Norwich City can confirm Neil Adams has resigned as manager with immediate effect. 'The process of appointing a new manager to take the club forward is already underway. 'Meanwhile, first team coach Mike Phelan will take charge of team matters until the new manager is confirmed. 'Former Canary winger and successful youth team coach Adams will take a break from the game before returning to work for the club in July, in a role to be confirmed at a later date. Mike Phelan will take temporary charge after Neil Adams resigned as manager with immediate effect . 'Adams was appointed to the first team managerâs position on a full-time basis in May 2014 after a brief five-game spell as caretaker at the end of the 2013-14 Barclays Premier League campaign. 'Following the Sky Bet Championship defeat at Reading on December 28, the Canaries currently sit seventh in the league table. After Saturdayâs FA Cup third round exit at the hands of Preston North End, Adams met for discussions with the Board and agreed to resign.' Neil Adams commented: 'I firmly believe that we are still on course for a crack at promotion back to the Premier League. That is where this club belongs. It was an awfully long way to travel for such a dismally poor performance. 1,200 Norwich City fans made the 470-mile round trip to Preston for Saturday's FA Cup third round tie and their reward was an abject display that left Neil Adams searching for words. 'I can only apologise to the fans. They saw nothing and they have nothing to go back with positive. You always look for something to cling to. Today we haven't got anywhere near that,' the manager said. The past couple of weeks have summed up the inconsistencies and idiosyncrasies of Norwich's season. Those inconsistencies have now led to Adams handing in his resignation. One win in 10 Championship matches during October and November saw the Canaries knocked off their perch, having looked good for an immediate Premier League return initially. But then, just in time for Christmas, some much-needed cheer as wins over Wigan, Huddersfield and Millwall, as well as a stirring comeback at promotion-chasing Derby, saw them rise from 11th to 7th and back into play-off contention. Even more encouragingly, the goals were starting to flow again. There had been many games when Norwich would create up to 20 chances, and take just a couple. But they smacked five past Huddersfield and hit Millwall for six. It coincided with the arrival of former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan and the early signs were this could be an effective partnership. Following that, though, came another slump - the one that proved fatal for Adams. They were lacklustre in a 2-1 defeat at Reading and even worse against Preston. Adams, the genial and loyal club servant who played 206 times on the wing during his playing day and then looked after the fledglings in the academy, arrived in April with an impossible task. Replacing Chris Hughton, Adams really had to claim full points from a final batch of fixtures against Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal. In the end, they gained just one and went down. But, handed the reins permanently in May, he managed to retain quite a few members of their Premier League squad and brought in Cameron Jerome, Lewis Grabban and Kyle Lafferty, among others. Just over halfway through the season, though, it's all come to a screeching halt for Adams and it remains to be seen which Norwich turns up next. First team coach Mike Phelan will take temporary charge, starting with Saturday's trip to Bournemouth . 'However, I feel it is in the best interests of the team that an immediate change is made in order to ensure a positive impact on results. 'It goes without saying that I sincerely hope the team achieves success this season and I would like to say a huge thank you to the supporters who have backed me during my tenure as manager.' The statement continued: 'The club would like to thank Neil for his hard work and dedication during his time as manager and over many years as a player and coach. Everybody at Norwich City looks forward to working with him again when he returns in the summer. 'The club will not be commenting any further at this time.' Adams took over from Chris Hughton for the final five matches of last season but was unable to keep the team in the Premier League. Norwich had appeared to be rediscovering their best form before Christmas but things soon unravelled . He was given the role permanently at the end of the season and things initially started well in the Championship, with the Canaries retaining much of their squad and topping the table at one point. But they dropped off the automatic promotion pace - to the growing frustration of fans - after a run of one win in 10 Championship games. However, a four-game unbeaten run in December, including free-scoring wins over Huddersfield and Millwall led many to believe they had turned the corner. They also came from two goals down to draw at promotion-chasing Derby. But things unravelled again after Christmas, with a 2-1 defeat at Reading in the league followed by a disappointing 2-0 loss at Preston on Saturday. Norwich are currently seventh in the Championship table, three points off the play-offs .","Neil Adams has resigned as Norwich City manager with immediate effect .

"It is a year to the day that Theo Walcott fell to the floor, screaming and clutching his left knee in what seemed a fairly innocuous challenge on Danny Rose. It is at the same stage of the FA Cup that Arsenal face Hull on Sunday afternoon â the third round â that he cruelly ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in that match against Tottenham. It would painfully cost him a place in Arsenalâs side which won the tournament that year, after beating Spurs 2-0 to progress, and Englandâs World Cup squad. VIDEO Scroll down to see Wenger on the fitness of Walcott and Ozil ahead of Hull City tie . Theo Walcott has struggled with injury problems ever since signing for Arsenal, most recently against Tottenham in a third round win for the Gunners last January (left) Initially the prognosis was that he would be out for six months. It has been a year and Walcott has managed just three substitute appearances, constituting a total of 51 minutes of football. Thirty of those came against Southampton on New Yearâs Day. âIt has gone very quickly,â Walcott said. âThere have been loads of things in my life that have changed completely. Things happen for a reason. âI have had the opportunity to work on different parts of my game which I missed out on when I was younger. 'The actual development stage of it. I am really looking forward to it if I am given the opportunity. âIt is the chance to go out there and get a few more minutes. I am not going to be expecting too much from myself early on. 'It is nice to blow cobwebs away to be honest and be out there playing with your mates again. I have missed that obviously.â The 25-year-old also missed attending the FA Cup final at Wembley âwhen Arsenal came from two goals behind to beat Hull and win their first trophy in nine years â due to âa personal thing.â Walcott missed out on seeing his side lift the FA Cup last May due to personal reasons . The England forward cheekily gestures to the Tottenham fans telling them what the score is after going off . But he did catch it on television and struggled not being a part of the clubâs history with his team-mates. âI wasnât at the final,â he explained, âI had a personal thing in my life that happened and I couldnât attend. I was able to watch it on television and it was tough to take. 'But it was a special moment for everyone. It had been so long and hopefully that was the push start to everything and to build on from that. 'It has been a stop-and-start season at times and with the FA Cup â being the holders â you want to keep hold of that. âIt is important to get a good start, especially against Hull. We will have home support and we have to bounce back from a disappointing result at Southampton.â Walcott was playing some of the best football of his career for club and country before the injury. So confident was the player that he goaded Spurs fans who had pelted him with coins as he was carried off on a stretcher, by using his fingers to indicate that his side were two-nil ahead. Walcott managed just 51 minutes of action in the whole of 2014 after rupturing his anterior cruciate ligament . The 25-year-old came on with 30 minutes remaining in Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on Thursday . The winger looked in little pain at the time, but that was the last football he played for 10 months. When he returned in November with two substitute appearances against Burnley and Swansea, he looked set to make his first start soon. But manager Arsene Wenger released him for international duty for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia and friendly with Scotland and he came back with a groin problem after putting in some extra shooting and crossing practice during training. Arsenal have looked light in attack in recent weeks and badly need Walcott back. They have lost Lukas Podolski to Inter Milan on loan and Olivier Giroud picked up a three-match ban for head-butting Nedum Onuoha when they played Queens Park Rangers on Boxing Day.Â The Frenchman completes the last game of his suspension against Hull. Walcott looks in good spirits in training on Saturday ahead of the Gunners' third round game against Hull . Danny Welbeck, Yaya Sanogo, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Mesut Ozil are all struggling with injuries, slashing Wengerâs options going forward. That presents an even greater challenge to progress in their cup tie with Hull, but Walcott is intent on improving Arsenalâs rich history in the competition after they went level with Manchester United â with 11 wins â when they were victorious last season. âWe want to continue that,â Walcott said. âHistory is important and we want to become those legends as well. We need to knuckle down and start performing . âYou see a lot of clubs put out weakened teams. But for me, it is a game you want to win. The fans always love a good cup run and going to different stadiums. âI enjoy going to a League One side, for instance. It is things like that which they donât usually get the opportunity to do very often.

"CLICK HERE to read Pete Jenson's match report from the Anoeta Stadium. Real Sociedad manager David Moyes praised his side's determined defending after their 1-0 victory over Barcelona on Sunday. Moyes has had little to cheer about over the last year but was all smiles after his side held on to beat Barca, having taken the lead in the second minute through an own goal by Jordi Alba. The Scotsman lasted less than a season at the helm of Manchester United before being sacked last April and took on a tough task when he agreed to take over a Sociedad side fighting relegation in November. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Real Sociedad 1-0 Barcelona . Luis Suarez (left) looks on as Real Sociedad players celebrate taking an early lead on Sunday . David Moyes' side had previously beaten Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid at the Anoeta Stadium this season . Barcelona defender Jordi Alba (right) heads into his own goal to give Real Sociedad the lead . There were plenty of doubts in the local media over his lack of experience of Spanish football, and his inability to speak the language, but he has made a solid start, building from the back and they have lost only one game so far. 'I am very happy to get the result, it was a very important and it was a very hard game,' Moyes told a news conference. 'We worked hard defensively and defending is a big part of football. You don't win games if you don't defend well. The way that we played at the back gave us the chance to win this game. Luis Enrique controversially left out the likes of Lionel Messi (second left), Gerard Pique and Dani Alves (right) from the Barca starting XI to face Sociedad on Sunday . Messi watches the action from the Barcelona bench after surprisingly being left out by coach Enrique . Moyes screams instructions from the sidelines as Real Sociedad fight to maintain their slender lead . 'I always hope that we have the ball in all our matches but against Barcelona you know that this is difficult.

"Prince Ali of Jordan faces an uphill battle to prevent Sepp Blatter from winning a fifth term as FIFA president. The 39-year-old third son of the late King Hussein announced on Tuesday that he was going to stand against Blatter in May. The prince, head of the Jordanian FA, is a thoroughly credible candidate and one of the few modernising reformers with a seat on the FIFA ExCo. FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan will run for football's top job against Sepp Blatter . But his chances of beating Blatter are a lot longer than the 10-1 being quoted by William Hill on Tuesday. Hills make Blatter a 1-33 odds on shot. Prince Ali said: âI am seeking the presidency because it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport. The headlines should be about football, the beautiful sport, not about FIFA.â FA chairman Greg Dyke said: âI welcome Prince Aliâs decision.

"Former referee and Sportsmail columnist Graham Poll believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember . The body which represents Premier League refs has hit back following stinging critcism from former referees' boss Keith Hackett. Hackett has called for his successor Mike Riley to be removed from his position with Professional Games Match Officials Ltd (PGMOL) and labelled the current crop of officials as the 'worst that we have seen', citing 'over 20 major errors' during the Christmas period. The 70-year-old said Mike Jones, Andre Marriner, Chris Foy and Lee Mason should be stood down at the end of the season and Lee Probert removed from his position should he fail a fitness test. Referees' chief Mike Riley (pictured) should be removed from his position, says former boss Keith Hackett . Hackett watches a game at Oakwell (left) and during his days as a top-flight referee (right) PGMOL would not respond directly but released statistics showing standards had improved in every available measure in the five years since Hackett left the organisation. These include accuracy on major decisions, up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent, on decisions in the penalty box (98 per cent) and offsides, 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent five years ago when Riley took over. Hackett's attack was made on his website, which also sells refereeing kits and equipment and offers training courses. The PGMOL is standing firm, however, confident it has taken the right path since Hackett's departure and that it is backed up by all the statistics. There are usually periods in every season where a series of controversial decisions puts the spotlight on to officials, and has led to football's lawmakers to begin to consider video replays. That will be debated at the International FA Board at its next meeting in Belfast on February 28, though any final decision is likely to be a couple of years away with trials being needed first.

'One thing is certain: Professional Game Match Officials Limited cannot continue without a fundamental review of its operations,' he wrote. 'The PGMOL is failing in its aim to DELIVER EXCELLENCE ON THE FIELD.' And Hackett agrees with former referee Graham Poll's scathing opinion that performances have been reached a new low.

"FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan has announced that he is to stand for the presidency of the world governing body. Prince Ali, who is also a member of the FIFA Executive Committee and the head of the Jordan Football Association, will stand against incumbent Sepp Blatter and Frenchman Jerome Champagne for the top job in May this year. 'I am seeking the presidency of FIFA because I believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport,' he said in a statement on www.jfa.com. FIFA vice president Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan will run for football's top job . 'This was not an easy decision. It came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected FIFA colleagues over the last few months. 'The message I heard, over and over, was that it is time for a change. The world's game deserves a world-class governing body - an International Federation that is a service organisation and a model of ethics, transparency and good governance.' Blatter has held his position as FIFA president since 1998 and will be running for a fifth term at the 65th FIFA congress in Zurich on May 29. The governing body has been engulfed by controversy in recent months over the decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Prince Ali will challenge Sepp Blatter (right), who is running for a fifth term as FIFA president . American lawyer Michael Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the tournaments but quit as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. The Executive Committee agreed unanimously in December that an 'appropriate' form of the Garcia report into World Cup bidding should be published. Officials at a meeting in Morocco agreed to the proposal without a vote being taken - but nothing will be published until the Ethics Committee charges against three FIFA ExCo members - Angel Villar Llona of Spain, Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe and Thailand's Worawi Makudi - have been dealt with. 'The headlines should be about football, not about FIFA,' Prince Ali added. 'FIFA exists to serve a sport which unites billions of people from all over the world, people of differing and divergent political, religious and social affiliations, who come together in their enjoyment of ""the world's game"".' Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said: 'Personally I welcome Prince Ali's decision to stand for the FIFA presidency. It is very important that there is a credible candidate standing against Mr Blatter and Prince Ali is certainly that.' FA chairman Greg Dyke, pictured in July, has welcomed Prince Ali's decision to stand against Sepp Blatter . Prince Ali has served as president of the Jordan Football Association since 1999 and a year later founded the West Asian Football Federation which consists of 13 different nations. The 39-year-old was educated in the US at the Salisbury School in Connecticut, where he impressed as a wrestler, before moving to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the UK. He's served as a pathfinder in the Jordanian Special Forces and graduated from Princeton University in 1999. Ali is married to Algerian-born Rym Brahimi, now Princess Rym, who previously worked as a journalist for CNN and is the daughter of UN diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi. They have two children. Frenchman Jerome Champagne will also challenge to end Blatter's reign, which began in 1998 . Among his achievements in football is his championing of the lifting of FIFA's ban on the hijab in the women's game. Ali was among those FIFA officials who have called for the publishing of the Garcia report. Champagne is a former FIFA deputy secretary general. Nominations have to be made before January 31.","Vice president Prince Ali of Jordan to run in FIFA president election .

"Hull City manager Steve Bruce admits Jermain Defoe is on his January wishlist. The former Tottenham Hotspur striker is understood to be open to a Barclays Premier League return from Major League Soccer's Toronto FC. But the 32-year-old's Â£68,000-per-week salary, which can potentially rise to Â£90,000 in his four-year deal with the MLS outfit, may pose a problem for Hull. Former Tottenham Hotspur striker Jermain Defoe is understood to be open to a Premier League return . Hull City manager Steve Bruce admits Defoe is very much on his January transfer window wishlist . 'If he becomes available, which I believe he is, then we'd love to do something,' Bruce said after Hull's 2-0 win over Everton on New Year's Day. 'I think it might be too expensive but it's not a bad bit of speculation. 'There's always speculation. You ask any club in the bottom of the division about Defoe, all of us would say yes. Whether we can do it financially is another problem.' Defoe moved to Toronto for Â£6million from Tottenham last January, and the England striker with 55 caps has also been linked with Queens Park Rangers. Hull put 2014 behind them in spectacular fashion by beating a miserable Everton in a manner not properly reflected by the 2-0 scoreline. 'It's been probably our best performance,' Bruce said.

"As Harry Kane trains his sights on records set by Tottenham legends such as Gary Lineker, it is hard to imagine he could have played for Arsenal; harder still to think he might have been a goalkeeper, or that Spurs nearly let him go. Kane has 17 goals this season and is scoring at a rate that puts him on course to be the first Spurs player since Lineker, 23 years ago, to break the 30 barrier. His personal target was amended from 10 to 20 just before Christmas. âI always want to progress and hopefully I will do that this year,â he shrugged with modesty after scoring two, setting up another and winning a penalty in a 5-3 win against Chelsea on Thursday. Harry Kane has been in sensational form for Tottenham - most recently netting a double against the Blues . Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with the in-form Spurs forward after scoring their fifth goal of the afternoon . Kane and team-mate Nabil Bentaleb celebrate at the final whistle as Tottenham moved up to fifth . More than his goals, his industry and infectious enthusiasm have lifted the club. Mauricio Pochettino has found a prolific striker who covers more than 13km per game and fans have a hero; one of their own, as they sing. Although it might have been different. Arsenal were the first club to take Kane in when he and Brentford full back Nico Yennaris were spotted at the age of nine playing for Ridgeway Rovers, a junior club in Chingford, Essex, famed for producing David Beckham. Former Ridgeway coach Dave Bricknell recalls first setting eyes on a young Kane, who also followed Beckham through Chingford Foundation School. After a stunning first half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side . Kane impressed on loan at Millwall during the second half of the 2011-12 season - scoring nine goals . Kane celebrates scoring for Leicester against Blackburn during his brief spell at the Foxes two years ago . The 21-year-old has also spent time at the likes of Norwich and Leyton Orient over the years . âI thought Iâd found myself the next Pat Jennings,â said Bricknell, who now scouts for Spurs. âIn the first training session, there was me and Harry Yennaris, Nicoâs dad, putting a side together and I said, âRight, who can play in goal?â. âHarry went in and he was unbelievable, not that youâd have known if you saw him in goal for Spurs. Then someone told me he was a striker, so he came out and scored about four goals.â In October, having already scored a hat-trick, Kane took over in goal when Hugo Lloris was sent off in the Europa League against Asteras Tripolis. He fumbled a free-kick into the net in the last minute, but Tottenham won 5-1 and the episode only enhanced his cult status. At Arsenal, he sometimes trained with the goalkeepers, but they chose to let him go and he found his way back to Ridgeway Rovers, who also produced Tottenhamâs Andros Townsend, Crystal Palaceâs Dwight Gayle and Bournemouthâs Charlie Daniels. âHe was a bit down after Arsenal let him go,â said Ian Marshall, chairman of Ridgeway. âHe took a bit of persuading to come back but some of his mates talked him into it and he scored quite a few goals. âTottenham picked him up but then let him go and he found himself at Watford, where he played in a trial game against Spurs and scored two. Thatâs when Spurs realised they might have made a mistake and asked him to come back. âThe rest is history. We donât get anything financially. Thatâs the way it is at the grass roots. Even 0.1 per cent of Dwight Gayleâs transfer fee to Palace would keep us going for a year. But, as a club, weâre proud. Harry came back to present some prizes for us a couple of years ago. Heâs a good, down-to-earth lad.â This attitude shone through during his loan moves. It is four years this month since his senior debut on loan for Leyton Orient in front of 2,731 on a sodden pitch at Rochdale. He scored five in his first six games for Orient, before a red card slowed his progress. There were nine goals for Millwall, but he broke a metatarsal at Norwich and Spurs aborted the one-year loan and sent him instead to Leicester, where he was used mostly as a substitute. At this point, 18 months ago, a top-flight career did not seem to beckon. Kane salutes the White Hart Lane crowd after his match winning display for Spurs against Chelsea . Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris celebrates with Kane after the win over Chelsea . Most would have predicted a move into the lower leagues, but Tottenham, to their credit, have shown patience with talent like Townsend and Ryan Mason and both Pochettino and his predecessor Tim Sherwood, who knew Kane from the development teams, showed faith. Kane responded by knuckling down, something those who know him attribute to parents Pat and Kim. He doesnât drink, trains hard, is devoted to his career and his desire is shown by his surge past Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor. Soldado cost Â£26million and had he scored the occasional goal, or had Adebayor not lost his focus, the chance might never have appeared for Kane. But he saw a glimmer and forced his way through, thriving under a manager forced to look beyond reputations. Kane has tried his hand in goal during the Europa League when Hugo Lloris was sent off . Former Spurs striker Teddy Sheringham was Kane's hero when he was growing up . At first, Pochettino used the 21-year-old mainly in cup competitions, then a little from the bench. A late winner as a substitute at Aston Villa was a significant step. Now, Kane simply has to start, either at centre forward or just behind. As a boyhood Spurs fan, he idolised Teddy Sheringham and they have similarities. Like Sheringham, Kane has a great appreciation of the game and the movement of others, evident in his assist for Nacer Chadli against Chelsea. He is strong, good in the air and able to influence the game. He has an instinct; a goal knack. It is not luck. He sees the ball early, which offers the illusion of magnetism when it arrives in his orbit, somewhere near the goal. Top up confidence levels and he will score goals like his second against Chelsea, rolled into the far corner coolly enough for Lineker to compare him to Thierry Henry. It is impossible not to be heartened by the rise of Kane. Roy Hodgson will be watching closely, aware he is eligible for the Republic of Ireland through a grandfather and has been resisting their advances for some time. He is determined to play for England. And Kane is one determined young man. Do not bet against it.

"French giants Paris-Saint Germain would be at the front of the queue to sign Lionel Messi if he becomes available, according to midfielder Javier Pastore. Recent speculation has linked Messi with a move away from the Nou Camp, with reports in Spain claiming the Argentine is frustrated with life under manager Luis Enrique. The 27-year-old has a contract until 2018 and is believed to have a buy-out clause of Â£196million, but Pastore believes PSG have the resources to bring him to the Parc des Princes.

Speaking to TyC Sports, Pastore said: 'If Messi were to leave Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain's owner will be right there to strike a deal.' The Ligue 1 club have spent big on new players since being bought by Qatari investors in the summer of 2011, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and David Luiz among the marquee signings made. And Pastore, who himself made a Â£37m move to Paris three-and-a-half years ago, is confident that his club has enough left in the back to sign his compatriot Messi. 'Money will not be a problem,' he said. 'The club has the resources to buy a number of Messis.'

"Charlotte Dujardin admitted to a 'surreal' feeling after completing a remarkable clean sweep of Olympic, world and European individual dressage titles. British star Dujardin, who also holds the sport's three individual world records with 12-year-old wonderhorse Valegro, lit up Caen's Stade D'Ornano with a brilliant freestyle to music performance. A score of 92.161 per cent gave her gold by an emphatic margin from Germany's Helen Langehanenberg (Damon Hill NRW) on 88.286 per cent, while Holland's Adelinde Cornelissen (Jerich Parzival) took bronze. Gold again: Dujardin added another medal to her tally with an emphatic gold in the Freestyle to Music event . Composed: The 29-year-old had already secured a gold and silver at the World Equestrian Games . It means that at the age of 29, Gloucestershire-based Dujardin is Olympic champion (freestyle), European champion (grand prix special and freestyle) and world champion (grand prix special and freestyle). 'It just feels so surreal,' she said. 'After London, I never thought it could get better, then last year we had the Europeans and now my first Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games. Debut: This was Dujardin's first Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games and heads home with three medals . 'To come away from here with two individual golds and a team silver, I can't believe it.' A crowd of around 20,000 gave Dujardin a rapturous reception, and she once again delivered under pressure with a performance that oozed star quality in glorious Normandy sunshine. 'I don't think there is anything else I want to achieve on him (Valegro),' she added. 'He has already exceded what I wanted to do - way beyond that. He is just such a special horse. 'He is such a fantastic horse, and coming here he felt on top form. 'The rides in the grand prix (team) and grand prix special were just incredible, and then today I love the music we performed to and he just felt absolutely fantastic. 'I've had one bad ride out of the eight years I have been riding the horse - at Aachen (in July this year) - and who can moan about one day? Not me, that's for sure. Champion: Dujardin also won gold in the Freestyle Grand prix Dressage competition in Caen . 'With what I have achieved on that horse, and what that horse has done for me, he is just one in a million.' With Dujardin and the British team winning silver on Tuesday, her freestyle exhibition completed another memorable championship and augers well for next year's Europeans ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics. Dujardin's colleagues Michael Eilberg (Half Moon Delphi) and Carl Hester (Nip Tuck) were eighth and 12th, respectively . 'That was a good way to end the week,' Eilberg said. 'The stadium was packed, and you really feel it. I was just hoping she (Half Moon Delphi) would maintain her concentration and show some of the work I know she's capable of.' In the eventing competition, about 60 miles south of Caen at Haras du Pin, it was not such a good day for Britain, the reigning team world champions. Success: Team GB celebrate their Olympic qualification after winning the silver medal in Caen . Overnight leader and world number one William Fox-Pitt remains in individual medal contention aboard Chilli Morning, lying second behind Germany's Sandra Auffarth, but dressage scores in the 50s from his team-mates Zara Phillips (High Kingdom), Tina Cook (De Novo News) and Harry Meade (Wild Lone) means Britain have it all to do. They lie fifth in the team standings ahead of Saturday's pivotal cross-country phase on a score of 142 penalties. Germany lead (116.9), with New Zealand (125.5) second, United States (138.8) third and France (139.9) fourth. 'I am a bit disappointed with that test as I know we can do better,' triple Olympic medallist Cook said. 'He warmed up well, but just got tense with the atmosphere in the arena and went a bit 'babyish' on me which caused a few mistakes that you can't afford to have at this level. 'The (cross-country) course is a true championship one with plenty of questions. 'From walking it, it walks very big and Pierre Michelet (course designer) has done a good job of creating rider-frightener fences. It will be a real test and challenge for everybody.' Britain's two individual riders - Nicola Wilson (Annie Clover) and Oliver Townend (Black Tie II) - lie 16th and 21st, respectively, on scores of 46.0 and 47.2.

"Google today announced the introduction of Treasure Mode following the discovery of the long lost maps of pirate Willian 'Captain' Kidd during an underwater exhibition. They're only kidding about the discovery, of course - it's one of a string of hoax new products and services the online ads giant revealed for April Fool's Day. But the new Treasure Mode is such fun that observers are nonetheless hoping that it will actually last beyond the annual day of tricks and tomfoolery. Me hearties! Google today announced the introduction of Treasure Mode following the discovery of the long lost maps of pirate Willian 'Captain' Kidd during an underwater exhibition . Google has led the way in jolly tech-related April Fool's japes, with its Treasure Mode joining Gmail Blue, Google Nose and the announcement that YouTube has in fact been an eight-year competition to find the best video. The Google Maps blog explains how its Street View team found Captain Kidd's maps during a recent expedition beneath the waves of the Indian Ocean to expand their underwater Street View collection. They published an accompanying YouTube video about the 'find'. 'When Dr. Marco Meniketti, an independent archaeologist, confirmed that this was Captain Kiddâs 315 year-old map, we were very excited,' writes Google software engineer Tatsuo Nomura in the blog post. 'However, as seen in the video, the map contains a variety of encrypted symbols and is not readily decipherable. We need your help to decipher these symbols and find Captain Kiddâs treasures; therefore weâve decided to digitize the map and make it accessible to everyone.' Do not attempt at home: In an accompanying YouTube film, the Maps team explain that some of the clues can only be revealed in special circumstances, such as when the maps are heated . Ye Olde Street View: Going into Street View while in Treasure Mode brings up this sepia-tinged, telescope view of the images stored on the company's servers . c by clicking on the 'Treasure' button in the top right corner of Google Maps, and follow the hunt's progress on Google Maps G+ page. However, the site warns: 'Treasure Maps is our Beta Maps technology and has certain system requirements. Your system may not be able to display at higher resolutions than paper print. 'Take care when unfolding the map to avoid ripping it.' Google's other April 1 practical joke pokes fun at its latest Glass project, with the revelation that Google Nose is the newest addition to the the search engine's capabilities. Google Nose apparently allows users to search the 'Aromabase' of more than 15million Scentibytes then catch a whiff of everything from wet dog to dust bins. Sniffing it out: Google Nose, where users can search the 'Aromabase' for smells and then inhale through their computer and phone screens, was also 'launched' today . Whiffy: Google Nose promised to allow users the smell of what they are searching for . There is also the announcement that YouTube is shutting down at midnight - to allow a panel of experts to pick the best video ever for when the site relaunches in 2023. The hilarious clip includes comments from some of the site's biggest stars including the little boy who had a dazed conversation with his father following a dentist appointment and Judson Laipply from 'Evolution of Dance' clips. The team at Google Australia also came up with SCHMICK - Simple Complete House Makeover Internet Conversion Kit - offering homeowners the chance to spruce up their houses on Google Street View with different themes and features. Gmail Blue, meanwhile is 'Gmail, only bluer'. Home sweet home: A property on Google Street View in Australia . Home improvements: Renovate your house on Street View with Google SCHMICK . But Google is not the only one breaking out a sense of humour for the start of the month. Twitter announced that from April 1, Twitter would become Twttr as the micro-blogging site cancelled the use of vowels. If you want the use of a,e,i,o, or u, then it will cost five dollars a month. 'Weâre doing this because we believe that by eliminating vowels, weâll encourage a more efficient and âdenseâ form of communication,' announced Twitter's director of product Kvyn Wl (sic) on its blog this morning. Annncng: Twitter reportedly became Twttr on April 1 as the site started charging for the use of vowels . Sacla's new pasta for the Twitter generation could've proved a geek-chic hit... had it been for real . He added: 'Twttr will roll out slowly to a small percentage of users, growing to 100% over the next few days. We recommend that you practice using only consonants (and âyâ) with the hashtag #nvwls (or if you have paid for our premium service, use #icanhasvowels).' The company even went so far as to produce a companion website that can translate any tweet into its vowel-less equivalent and re-created Obama's most-tweeted 'four more years' message from last year in the new format. Continuing the Twitter theme, Italian food brand Sacla added a touch of tech to its April Fools joke with the announcement of its latest product, Twitteroni pasta. Rather like the tinned alphabet soups of your youth, Twitteroni pasta is shaped into letters, but also includes hashtags and the 'at' symbol . With the trend in tech moving towards packing ever-greater computing power into ever-smaller gadgets, Sony's April Fool's gag could almost be believable. The company is advertising the world's smallest laptop on its website, the 0.75in by 1.25in Vaio Q, which is about the size of a pound coin but nevertheless packs 8Gb RAM and a 3D capable display.

"Millions of families face rising mortgage interest rates that will add Â£300 a year to the cost of a Â£100,000 home loan. The RBS-NatWest group is pushing up rates from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent while Halifax, one of Britain's biggest lenders, followed suit by pushing its own home loan rate up from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent. The increases come despite the Bank of England maintaining its base rate at just 0.5 per cent and will be met with fury by homeowners, who will see the moves as rank profiteering. Rate rise fears: Other borrowers are braced for increases in mortgage rates after the hike at RBS-NatWest . Itâs the fear factor in markets that drives up borrowing costs â even when the UK base rate remains unmoved. The . Bank of England has kept its key bank rate pinned down at 0.5 per cent . for nearly three years in a bid to keep borrowing cheap for individuals . and businesses. However, . banks also need to borrow from each other on money markets so that they . have enough to lend out as loans and mortgages. Even money they have . lent years before on mortgages needs to be âfundedâ by borrowing fresh . batches of money. The rates on this inter-bank lending - known as LIBOR - are influenced by the fear factor in the markets. The . concerns about the Eurozone crisis in the second half of 2011 made . banks suspicious of one another so the key LIBOR rate â the three-month . sterling rate â steadily rose, up from 0.75 per cent at the start of . 2011 to 1.08 per cent by the end of the year. Banks . say they have largely absorbed the rising cost, but feel that they need . to pass it on â despite the âBig Fourâ making profits of more than . Â£10bn from British High Street banking last year. Recent . intervention by the European Central Bank to dole out colossal, cheap . loans to banks across the Continent appears to have stabilised these . money markets and LIBOR has fallen marginally in recent weeks. The . most recent loans bonanza was earlier this week. RBS took around . â¬5billion to add to a similar size European loan in December. The rise by Halifax will affect around 850,000 households by driving up repayments on a Â£100,000 mortgage by Â£24.31 a month or just under Â£300 a year. Yesterday it emerged that the . RBS-NatWest group, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is . increasing the rate charged to 200,000 of its customers to 4 per cent. Other banks and building societies . could now follow suit. Halifax is part of the giant Lloyds group, which . also includes the Lloyds-TSB and Cheltenham & Gloucester brands. The increases could not come at a . worse time for hard-pressed families, who are struggling to make ends . meet. Just yesterday the price of petrol hit an all-time high, . threatening to reverse recent falls in the headline rate of inflation. The rate rises also amount to a . significant slap in the face to taxpayers who supported banks such as . Halifax through the banking crisis of 2008 but who are now suffering . cuts, austerity and job losses. Accusations of profiteering will be . bolstered by official figures published earlier this week that revealed . how the big banks have dramatically pushed up their profit margins on . credit cards, overdrafts and other products. At the same time, the Bank of England . has kept its base rate at a record 300-year low and has also, since . 2009, poured a staggering Â£375billion of cheap money into the banking . system through so-calledÂ  quantitative easing. Sources close to the banks involved, . however, claimed that the prices they are being charged to borrow money . on the wholesale markets have risen in the past year and they have no . choice but to pass the increase on to customers. The banks also blame the rises on a need to offer better interest rates to savers. RBS has already ordered the increase of 0.25 per cent to 4 per cent on its RBS and NatWest-branded offset mortgages . Homeowners sat on Halifax standard variable rate mortgages at 3.5 per cent received a rude shock, as the lender hiked their monthly payments. The mortgage lending giant has an estimated 1 million borrowers paying its standard variable rate (SVR), many of whom will had reasoned that they are safe from having their rate jump as long as the UK base rate remains at its record 0.5 per cent low. But Halifaxâs recent move to lift a cap on its SVR meant a rate rise of almost 0.5 per cent for all. A rise from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent would add Â£735 a year to the cost of a Â£150,000 interest-only mortgage. One insider said: âThe change acknowledges that the cost of funding a mortgage in todayâs market has risen. âThe increase to the rate reflects the . fact that raising money through retail savings and in the wholesale . markets is currently very expensive.â Following the Halifax rise â . which will take effect from May 1 â a customer with a . Â£100,000 mortgage would see monthly repayments rise from Â£714.88 to . Â£739.19. The Consumer Credit Counselling Service said: âHouseholds are being hit by a double whammy. âHigh interest rates and the squeeze . on household budgets across the board areÂ  combining to make it even . harder for people to repay their debts, and many areÂ  at risk of falling . even further behind.â Marc Gander, of campaigners the . Consumer Action Group, said: âIf consumers think that banks are . suffering alongside them in this economic crisis, they really do not . understand what is going on.â Feeling the pinch: RBS boss Stephen Hester, on a Â£1.2million salary, was pressured into waiving a Â£1million bonus . Seven in 10 Britons are in debt and will raise fears that many will struggle to make monthly mortgage payments and even face repossession of their homes . The fall and rise of borrowing costs: The key rate of three-month sterling LIBOR - the interest rate banks charge each other for short term loans - fell from 6.3% in 2008 to a low of 0.50% in 2009 before steadily climbing to a peak of 1.08% at the start of 2012 . Home buyers pay a âpremiumâ of nearly Â£50,000 to live in a spa town. House prices in spa towns in England and Wales are around 27 per cent or Â£48,123 higher than neighbouring towns, averaging Â£275,397 last year. Prices there have typically climbed Â£1,077 a month and nearly Â£130,000 overall since 2001, Lloyds TSB research shows. Spa town homes now cost 8.3 times gross annual earnings. Ilkley in West Yorkshire boasted the highest premium, at almost double the prices of surrounding areas. Boston Spa, also in West Yorkshire, came second with an 85 per cent premium, followed by Bath in Somerset (53 per cent), Church Stretton, Shropshire (45 per cent) and Tunbridge Wells, Kent (34Â  per cent). The higher rates come . just days after Britainâs big five banks â HSBC, Santander, Barclays, . Lloyds and RBS âfinished revealing their financial resultsÂ  for last . year. Overall, the five made profits of . Â£10.7billion from their high-street banking operations, excluding the . cost of compensation to their payment protection insurance victims. John . Mann, a senior Labour MP on the Treasury select committee, described . any rate rises as an âoutrageâ considering the money Halifax took when . it was bailed out by the taxpayer. He said: âThey take taxpayer money in . the form of a bail-out and then take their money again through their . mortgages â it is totally unfair.â RBS has announced its increase, to take effect on May 1, on RBS and NatWest-branded offset mortgages. The same change will apply to its âOne Accountâ range, which includes Virgin One, DirectLine One and NatWest One. It blamed the increase on the higher cost of wholesale borrowing, which it had now decided to âpass onâ. The âbad bankâ set up by the Government to manage the toxic loans of Northern Rock and Bradford & Bingley repaid Â£2.15billion to taxpayers last year. But this progress came at a high price for homeowners, as 8,749 families had their properties repossessed â a 10 per cent increase on 2010. Debt charities yesterday said that families were paying for the reckless lending of Northern Rock and B&B, which brought the banks to their knees. Taxpayers were also warned that it could . be up to 15 years before the rescue loans were repaid, with almost . Â£47billion outstanding. Beleaguered bank: Customers queue outside a Northern Rock branch in Newcastle to get their money out in this September 17, 2007, file photo . UK Asset Resolution, established by the Government to manage the bad loans issued by the stricken lenders, announced that profits had soared 145 per cent to Â£1.09billion last year. This enabled it to repay Â£2.15billion to the Treasury, taking its total repayments to Â£3.1billion. While the âbadâ part of Northern Rock has prospered, the âgoodâ part â which runs savings accounts â made a Â£79million loss in the first half of last year, and fell Â£232million into the red in 2010. Yesterday UKAR revealed a surge in repossessions as families failed to keep up with mortgage repayments. Cities such as Liverpool, Manchester and Northern Rockâs Newcastle heartland were particularly hard-hit. Richard Banks, chief executive of UKAR, insisted it had done everything in its power to help struggling families.","RBS-Natwest group pushing rates from 3.75% to 4% .

"The Muslim convert who attacked four police officers with a hatchet yesterday afternoon was a 'recluse' who kept two sharp axes and a hunting knife at home. Zale Thompson, 32, was shot dead yesterday after charging at the officers in Queens with a hatchet in his hands. He slashed at one policeman's head, seriously wounding him, and hurt another. And it has now emerged that Thompson kept even more dangerous weapons at home, converted to radical Islam two years ago, and that even his own family describe him as a 'recluse'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Extremist rants: Police are investigating Thompson's potential terrorist links, including social media post advocating attacks on American soil. His own family said he was a recluse who spent all day in his room . Shot dead: Zale Thompson, 32, is pictured above on the street after police officers stopped him in the midst of his attack . Weapons: Police searches found a sharpened axe and an ornate hunting knife in Thompson's home. The axe pictured is different to the one used in yesterday's attack . Police searches on Thompson's home in Queens turned up another 'weaponized' hatchet, and a long, wide-bladed hunting knife. It comes as Police Commissioner William Bratton has branded the attack a 'terrorist act', but said that Thompson did not, in fact, have any clear ties to international extremists. Following computer examinations for clues about a motive for the assault, police discovered Thompson's  browsing history included organized terror groups, beheadings and the shooting in Canada earlier this week that officials there have called a terrorist attack. However, the suspect was not on any watch lists, and officials found no indication he sought any training or affiliation to any groups, Mr Bratton said. Act if terror?: Suspect Zale Thompson can be seen swinging a hatchet towards police officers at 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon in Jamaica, Queens . Still, the commissioner said he was comfortable calling the incident a terrorist attack, saying: 'This was a terrorist attack, certainly.' But he stopped short of including the attack in the list of terror plots against the city since September 11, 2001, adding that the investigation was continuing. According to officers, Thompson was a 'recluse' who spent most of his time in his bedroom. He was described as a 'self-radicalized' Muslim who converted about two years ago. He had once served in the U.S. Navy and had a history of run-ins with the law over domestic violence in California in 2003 and 2004, police said. Investigators believe Thompson was a loner and carried out yesterday's attack without any help - though they are probing potential links to other extremists. Robert Boyce, the NYPD's Chief of Detectives, outlined the new findings at a conference today. Without warning: Zale Thompson attacked officers without warning or uttering a single word . Checkpoint: The NYPD were out in force at a subway station near the scene of the attack today . It was also revealed that Thompson has a history of six arrests - in California from 2003-2004, though he has no criminal history in New York. In the conference today, Boyce also praised the 'exceptional performance of heroic duty' by the officers who took down Thompson. The entire incident lasted just seven seconds, he said. Surveillance footage showed Thompson charging at officers, swinging his blue-handled hatchet. He was still clinging to the weapon when he was shot dead. Earlier today social media posts made by Thompson cane to light, in which he called on Muslim extremists to attack America and wage jihad. Concern: Authorities worry than more officers or public servants may be attacked in the wake of other strikes . Bloodied hatchet: The 18 and 1/2 inch hatchet is dripping with blood after Zale Thompson used it to slash a police officer in the head and the other in the arm . Commenting on a video supporting the rise of an Islamic caliphate - such as ISIS claim to have established in Iraq and Syria - Thompson asked: 'Which is better, to sit around and do nothing, or to Jihad fisabeelallah [for the cause of Allah]!' Comments from Thompson's Facebook account were also reported on Fox News, who said he posted: 'The solution is to fight. Armed struggle. Simple.' He then reportedly advocated an armed revolution, saying: 'America's military is strong abroad, but they have never faced an internal mass revolt. â¦ They are weaker at home. We are scattered and decentralized, we can use this as an advantage. It continued: 'They will not be able to defeat our people if we use guerilla warfare. Attack their weak flanks... If you get wounded who cares. If you die who cares. Eventually they will surrender and then the war will be over.' He also spoke of a global conspiracy by 'Zionists and Christians' to suppress Islam. He wrote: 'If the Zionists and the Crusaders had never invaded and colonized the Islamic lands after WW1, then there would be no need for Jihad!' Posting elsewhere under a music video called 'No white God', he seemed to call for extremists to overthrew European governments and enslave their people. He wrote: 'They call black people racist for rejecting the oppression they suffered from whites. Listen, when black people have colonized the entire continent of Europe, enslaved its people, and sold them into bondage to foreign lands, then you can call them racist.' ISIS has continually urged its supporters to launch 'lone wolf' attacks in the West. Thompson's family, meanwhile, say they are 'shocked' by news of the attack, while neighbors say they would never have connected him with radical Islam. Social media: Thompson's Facebook profile has a verse of the Qur'an emblazoned across the top, and pictures a man in a balaclava holding weapons . Speaking to ABC7, his grandfather, Ralph Thompson, said only: 'Very shocked, his father not well.' Igeoma Simon, who lives nearby in Queens, said the Thompson he knew was a 'great guy'. He said: 'He was very positive. He helped me stay physically active at the park...I don't really know what would drive him to that.' Police say they are investigating whether Thompson's attack on the cops was linked to Islamic terrorism. ISIS has urged fighters to launch lone wolf attacks in the United States. Thompson's Facebook page features a photograph of a man dressed in Middle Eastern garb and a cover photo displaying Arabic writing. Two attacks in Canada this weekÂ by radicalized converts to Islam have killed two Canadian soldiers. In one, a man ran down two soldiers in his car in Quebec, killing one, before being shot dead. On Wednesday a convicted felon ambushed a soldier outside Canadian Parliament, fatally wounding him, before running the Parliament building and opening fire. The scene: NYPD officers shot dead a man armed with a hatchet who attacked them Thursday afternoon and critically injured a 29-year-old female bystander in the process . DNA Info reports that on Thursday afternoon a freelance photographer approached the group of rookie cops and asked to take their photograph. As the officers were posing for the camera, Thompson charged towards them swinging an 18.5 inch hatchet without uttering a single word. One 24-year-old officer was slashed in the arm. Another 25-year-old officer, Kenneth Healey, was slashed in the back of head and taken to Jamaica Hospital where he remains in a critical but stabled condition. A 29-year-old female bystander half a block away from the attack was also critically injured after being shot by an errant police round. She is currently recovering from surgery at Jamaica Hospital and is listed in 'grave' condition. The two remaining police shot at Thompson who dropped his hatchet then died at the scene. Innocent bystander: Police gather around a woman who was struck by an errant bullet discharged by a cop . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said he's not ruling out terrorism especially in the wake of recent terror attacks in Canada, reports CNN. 'There is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case. I think certainly the heightened concern is relative to that type of assault based on what just happened in Canada,' said Bratton. CNN reports that Thompson has a criminal record in California and that he was discharged from the U.S. Navy for misconduct. Details of his criminal record and his misconduct are not known at this time. His Facebook page says that Thompson graduated from Columbia Teacher's College and that he resides in Queens. Praise: Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hold up a photo of the scene on Thursday and says that the group of recent Police Academy graduates handled the situation as best they could . CNN reports that New York police were alerted to be on the lookout for random attacks following Thursday's incident. DNA Info spoke with witnesses on the scene. 'We heard pop, pop, pop, pop,' said Rafael, 44, who works at Overseas Travel nearby where the incident occurred. 'She was screaming,""'Help me."" She couldn't get up,' said Ericka Babb, a medical assistant at Priority Medical Center in Queens. 'We were way too scared,' said Rafael. Officers say they shot the hatchet-yielding suspect but itâs not clear how many rounds were fired. 'It was a completely unprovoked attack,' said NYPD Chief Kim Royster, a department spokeswoman. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said during a news conference that all of the police involved are recent graduates of this summer's Police Academy class. 'Three rookie cops, absolutely modest about what happened today and what they did,' de Blasio said. During the conference Bill De Blasio lauded the officers' training and their fast response to the unprovoked attack.

"Pupils as young as six were taught to treat Western women as 'white prostitutes' by a school at the centre of the 'Trojan Horse' Islamist plot. The shocking . disclosure comes ahead of two bombshell reports into claims Muslim . radicals conspired to infiltrate governing bodies of Birmingham schools. A leaked copy of one . report says teachers at Oldknow Academy told school inspectors they were . alarmed by the use of terms such as âwhite prostituteâ and âhellfireâ in school assemblies, and that non-Muslim teachers were banned from . being present. A leaked report speaks of alarm at language and teaching in Oldknow Junior School, Birmingham . A report by the Education . Funding Agency says: âWe were told by teachers that non-Muslim teaching . staff are no longer allowed to take Friday assemblies. In separate . interviews, staff told us that in Friday assemblies, occasionally words . have been used such as âwhite prostituteâ andÂ  âhellfireâ which they . felt were inappropriate for young children.â Well-placed . sources have told The Mail on Sunday that the term âwhite prostituteâ was used to suggest to pupils that Muslim women were moral but . non-Muslim women were not. Oldknow . Academy, which has around 600 pupils, is said to have been the subject . of a gradual takeover by extremists, who allegedly pushed out head . teacher, Bhupinder Kondal, because she opposed the âIslamisationâ of the . school. Officially, Mrs Kondal is on sick leave, and she refused to discuss the matter with The Mail on Sunday. She was among four of the schoolâs six senior managers who have left in recent months. It . is also claimed that in one assembly, just before Christmas last year, a . senior teacher led âan anti-Christianâ chant. He allegedly shouted at . the pupils âDo we believe in Christmas?â, to which the pupils replied . collectively âNo we donât.â Head teacher Bhupinder Kondal opposed the 'Islamisation' of Oldknow Junior School . The senior teacher is said to have made other âanti-Christian commentsâ at the same assembly. Officials . from education watchdog Ofsted, who have also studied the âTrojan . Horseâ claims, investigated the âanti-Christmasâ chant incident, but . found no evidence of it. However, . a source said that teachers and pupils at Oldknow have referred to . Christians as âkaffirsâ, a derogatory Arabic term meaning infidels. The . source said that as part of the Islamic takeover, urinals from the . boyâs toilets were removed, in accordance with Muslim custom which . frowns on those who stand up to urinate. More . than 95 per cent of Oldknowâs pupils are Muslim. It holds Islamic . prayers every Friday, teaches Arabic and organises trips to Mecca. Last . week, Oldknow teacher, Samir Rauf defended the school, accusing Ofsted . inspectors of âhaving an agendaâ. He said he had seen no evidence of an . extremist takeover, and denied Christmas had been banned. In . February, a senior Oldknow teacher is said to have posted a message on . social media urging all Muslims to disown those who gave up their faith. He said: âDo not love the one who does not love Allah. If they can leave Allah, they will leave you.â Only . a year ago, an Ofsted inspection of Oldknow found it âoutstandingâ in . all areas, including in promoting multi-racial harmony. It is one of 21 schools being probed for claims extremists tried to influence teaching. Education . Secretary Michael Gove is expected to put five schools into special . measures when the reports are published tomorrow. He will make a Commons . statement as head teachers hold a press conference in Birmingham to . speak publicly for the first time. The five schools . include Oldknow, and secondary schools Park View and Golden Hillock. The . running and teaching at all three have been described as âinadequate.â According to a leaked report, teachers at the school lead chants criticising Christmas . Ofsted . inspectors criticise poor teaching at Golden Hillock, and in their . report say: âToo little is done to keep students safe from the risks . associated with extremist views.â The . school, which has just under 900 pupils, is said to have been taken . over by extremists with an âIslamising agenda.â Former head teacher . Matthew Scarrott reportedly left because he opposed the change. Ofsted . say Golden Hillock did not provide adequate sex education and that some . female teachers at were spoken to in a way they found âintimidatingâ. The . school did little to âmitigate against cultural isolation,â leaving . students âvulnerable to the riskÂ  of marginalisation from wider British . society and the associated risks, which could include radicalisationâ. However . Mohammed Shafique, chairman of governors at Golden Hillock, said he . would challenge any move to put the school into special measures: . âOfstedâs views are completely unfounded, we do not practise . isolationism or segregation. They did not check the reality on the . ground. They were listening to comments Michael Gove made.â At . Park View, it is alleged that pupils were told homosexuality is evil, . given lists of Christian teachers and told to try to convert them and . that staff preach âmind-blowingâ anti-Western propaganda in assemblies.","Oldknow Academy in Birmingham allegedly used hate terms in assemblies .

"Belgium is launching a bid to have potato fries recognised as a part of its cultural heritage. Long believed to have been created in France, Belgians now want the item officially endorsed by the United Nationsâ Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Both the French-speaking community of Wallonia in southern Belgium and the German-speaking community in the east have announced that theyâre joining forces with their Flemish cousins in the north to set up a petition calling for the culinary item to gain UNESCO status. Belgium is launching a bid to have potato fries and Friktot shops recognised as a part of its cultural heritage . If successful, it means that Belgian fries will be put on a par with the Tower of London, Stonehenge, the Grand Canyon and the Kremlin in Russia. Belgian fries are traditionally sold in a paper cone from a âfritkotâ - a shack or trailer. There are some 5,000 of these in Belgium, making them ten times more common, per capita, than McDonald's restaurants in the United States. To become recognized by the United Nations' cultural arm UNESCO, they need to be endorsed by a minister of culture, and Belgium has three of them. The national association of fritkot owners say that 95 percent of Belgians visit a fritkot at least once a year . The government of the Dutch speaking region of Flanders recognised Belgian fries as an integral part of national culture this year, and the French and German-speaking communities are expected to debate the issue next year. UNAFRI, the national association of fritkot owners, which started the drive, says the unpolished establishments are uniquely Belgian, combining the country's embrace of chaos with a dislike of corporate uniformity. âA cone of potato chips is Belgium in miniature. What's astounding is that this way of thinking is the same, notwithstanding the different communities and regions,â said spokesman Bernard Lefevre. If successful, it means that Belgian fries will be put on a par with the Tower of London, Stonehenge, the Grand Canyon and the Kremlin in Russia . UNESCO has a list of 314 items of cultural heritage worthy of preservation, ranging from the Statue of Liberty to the Grand Canyon in Arizona . Belgian fries could soon join The Kremlin in Russia as an item of cultural heritage recognised by UNESCO . âThere is a phenomenon we share, German-speakers, French-speakers, Dutch-speakers, and itâs a cone of fries but itâs also this culture which surrounds it. âItâs a good product, but itâs a way of living.â Many tourists join the locals in the long queues at popular Brussels fritkots such as Frit Flagey and Maison Antoine. There are some 5,000 Friktots in Belgium, making them ten times more common, per capita, than McDonald's restaurants in the United States . âBefore I came here, one of the only things I knew about Belgium was that they liked their fries, so I think they are pretty much there already,â said Rachael Webb, a visitor from Ottawa, Canada, holding a cone of fries. UNESCO has a list of 314 items of intangible cultural heritage worthy of preservation, ranging from Turkish coffee to the polyphonic singing of the Aka pygmies of the Central African Republic. It also has 1007 World Heritage Sites including the Statue of Liberty, The Krelmin and the Tower of London. Potatoes reached Belgium in the 16th century, but it was not until the 19th century that they were widely sold chipped and fried as a meal in themselves. UNAFRI says 95 percent of Belgians visit a fritkot at least once a year.","Long credited to France, Belgium want item officially endorsed by UNESCO .

"Nasa has said there are 'billions' of planets in our own Milky Way galaxy - but a new study suggests that the idea that they are teeming with alien lifeforms may just be wishful thinking. Two Princeton scientists used what's known as 'Bayesian analysis' - a technque that 'boils down' ideas to the actual data, as opposed to scientists' own ideas about what 'should' be true. They suggest that it's very possible Earth is a one-off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet, the chances of life are very low indeed. The Milky Way: It contains 100 billion planets, but scientists suggest that it's very possible Earth is a one-off aberration where life took hold unusually fast - and on the average extraterrestrial planet, the chances of life are very low indeed . Science fiction? Princeton scientists suggest that the idea of extraterrestrial life - as in Stephen Spielberg's ET - is just fiction, and Earth's early evolution of life might just be a 'fluke' âFossil evidence suggests that life began very early in Earth's history and that has led people to determine that life might be quite common in the universe because it happened so quickly here, but the knowledge about life on Earth simply doesn't reveal much about the actual probability of life on other planets,â said Princeton astrophysical sciences professor Edwin Turner and David Spiegel, a former Princeton postdoctoral researcher. âInformation about that probability comes largely from the assumptions scientists have going in, and some of the most optimistic conclusions have been based almost entirely on those assumptions,â he said. âIf scientists start out assuming that the chances of life existing on another planet as it does on Earth are large, then their results will be presented in a way that supports that likelihood,â Turner said. âOur work is not a judgment, but an analysis of existing data that suggests the debate about the existence of life on other planets is framed largely by the prior assumptions of the participants.â Joshua Winn, an associate professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that Turner and Spiegel cast convincing doubt on the basis for expecting extraterrestrial life. Winn, who focuses his research on the properties of exoplanets, is familiar with the research but had no role in it. âThere is a commonly heard argument that life must be common or else it would not have arisen so quickly after the surface of the Earth cooled,â Winn said. âThis argument seems persuasive on its face, but Spiegel and Turner have shown it doesn't stand up to a rigorous statistical examination â with a sample of only one life-bearing planet, one cannot even get a ballpark estimate of the abundance of life in the universe. The Princeton scientists suggest that it's likely that Earth is a one-off - and that life may not have evolved anywhere else . One of the recent 'earth-like' planets discovered by Nasa - but a new Princeton study suggests that Earth alone may play host to life . The emergence of life on Earth gave reasons to be optimistic about the search for life elsewhere,â Winn said. âNow I'm not so sure, though I think scientists should still search for life on other planets to the extent we can.â Deep-space satellites and telescope projects have recently identified various planets that resemble Earth in their size and composition, and are within their star's habitable zone, the optimal distance for having liquid water. Of particular excitement have been the discoveries of NASA's Kepler Space Telescope, a satellite built to find Earth-like planets around other stars. While these observations tend to stoke the expectation of finding Earth-like life, they do not actually provide evidence that it does or does not exist, Spiegel explained. Instead, these planets have our knowledge of life on Earth projected onto them, he said. Yet, when what is known about life on Earth is taken away, there is no accurate sense of how probable abiogenesis is on any given planet, Spiegel said. It was this âprior ignorance,â or lack of expectations, that he and Turner wanted to account for in their analysis, he said.âWhen we use a mathematical prior that truly represents prior ignorance, the data of early life on Earth becomes ambiguous,â Spiegel said. Spiegel and Turner also propose that once this planet's history is considered, the emergence of life on Earth might be so distinct that it is a poor barometer of how it occurred elsewhere, regardless of the likelihood that such life exists.","Analysis suggests idea of extraterrestrial life is 'wishful thinking'

"Despite capitulating defensively at Tottenham, Chelsea managed to cling on to top spot in the Premier League. They now find themselves level on points with Manchester City, with the title race primed to become as keenly-contested as last season. But Liverpool's pursuit wasn't quite as close as this battle between the champions and Jose Mourinho's Blues. Jose Mourinho could only watch on as Chelsea were beaten 5-3 away at Tottenham Hotspur . Cesc Fabregas looks on dejected as Chelsea surrendered an early lead at White Hart Lane . Stevan Jovetic and Gael Clichy celebrate as Manchester City beat Sunderland 3-2 at the Etihad Stadium . The pair are not only level on points, but on goals scored, goals conceded, wins, draws and defeats. In an astonishing quirk, Chelsea lead the way by alphabetic virtue. If this were to be the case at the end of the season, both sides would need to play-off in a one-off clash to determine who lifts the Premier League crown. The match would be played at a neutral venue chosen by the Premier League Board of Directors and agreed by both clubs as soon as viable after the season finishes. A play-off remains highly unlikely, but would serve as an exciting crescendo for supporters up and down the country. The FA rules state: 'If at the end of the season either the League champions or the clubs to be relegated or the question of qualification for other competitions cannot be determined because two or more clubs are equal on points, goal difference and goals scored, the clubs concerned shall play off one or more deciding League matches on neutral grounds, the format, timing and venue of which shall be determined by the Board.' Captain Yaya Toure scored a stunning goal for City against the Black Cats on New Year's Day . A play-off has never been played before, although league officials did plan for a title-decider between Manchester United and Newcastle at the end of the 1995-96 season. The match would have taken place on either May 16 or 21 at Wembley but United beat Middlesbrough on the final day of the season and Newcastle drew at Tottenham, leaving the Red Devils four points clear at the top of the table. If a play-off were to happen this season a venue away from London would likely be chosen. Tickets were printed for a title play-off between Manchester United and Newcastle but the game wasn't needed . C.4. The position of Clubs in the table shall be determined by the number of points scored in that Season, the Club having scored the highest number of points being at the top of the table and the Club having scored the lowest number of points being at the bottom. C.5. If any 2 or more Clubs have scored the same number of points their position in the table shall be determined on goal difference, that is to say, the difference between the total number of goals scored by and against a Club in League Matches in that Season, and the higher or highest placed Club shall be the Club with the higher or highest goal difference. C.6. If any 2 or more Clubs have scored the same number of points and have the same goal difference the higher or highest placed Club shall be the Club having scored the most goals in League Matches in that Season.

"The giant oarfish, the largest bony fish alive, has finally been caught on camera in its natural environment. Marine biologists at Louisiana State University captured the mysterious fish on camera through a partnership with an offshore drilling company in the Gulf of Mexico. The scientists used the company's remote-operated submersibles and observed the oarfish five times between 2008 and 2011. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Louisiana State University marine biologists are believed to be the first to capture the mysterious giant oarfish on camera in it's natural habitat . Up close and personal: The LSU team observed the giant oarfish five times during their study off the Gulf of Mexico . The giant oarfish was first discovered in 1772 by Norwegian biologist Peter Ascanius . It's formal scientific title is Regalecus glesne, but the fish is also known as king of the herring, Pacific oarfish, streamer fish and ribbon-fish. And that's just what the thin fish looks like - a stream of ribbon. The oarfish in the video is thought to be around 8 feet long. The longest recorded specimen clocked in at 26 feet. However, the species is believed to grow as long as 50 feet and weigh as much as 600 pounds. Like the equally mysterious giant squid, the oarfish would go on to enchant fisherman and sailors and inspire stories of sea monsters. What a catch! Navy SEALs display a 23-foot giant oarfish found in 1996 on the beach in California . Legendary: The oarfish's massive size spawned many a story from fisherman and sailors . The reason the oarfish hadn't been . caught on camera before is because it lives at extreme ocean depths, . between 656 feet (0.2 kilometers) and 3,280 feet (1 kilometer) deep. In a partnership called the SERPENT . Project, scientists are able to peer into depths not normally observable . by enlisting the help of deep sea oil and gas drillers. Not much is known about the creature. Studies had previously only been possible when the rare fish has washed ashore dead or dying. Though the species has only been sighted in a few places worldwide, it is believed to inhabit deep waters around the globe, save for the polar regions. Washed up: A giant oarfish that washed ashore on the Japanese island of Kashiwajima in February 2002 . The fish uses a form of location called amiiform . swimming in which its dorsal fin, which runs the length of its sizable . body, undulates while the body itself remains straight and motionless. Last October, an oarfish washed ashore off Cabo San Lucas. It was 15-feet-long and attracted a crowd of gawkers. No one could revive the fish, so it was taken in for scientific study. In 2006,Â  another oarfish in poor condition surfaced in a cove on Santa Catalina Island in Southern California. Doug Oudin, a harbormaster, was able to swim with the creature before it died remarking that it's coloring was 'metallic silver with bright blue-brown spots and splotches, along with its amazing pinkish-red fell length dorsal fin.' It also appeared that the fish was blind, which isn't unusual for creatures that live at such deep parts of the ocean where there is little light. Another spotting of the creature occurred in 1901. A 22-foot oarfish landed on Newport Beach, California, which spurned ' the basis for many sea-serpent stories told by local bay patrons for more than a decade after its discovery,' according to reporting on Pete Thomas Outdoors.","Oarfish can grow up to 50 feet long and weigh as much as 600 pounds .

"While Jose Mourinho insists Barclays Premier League referees are conspiring against him, the Chelsea manager has only himself to blame for not being seven points ahead of Manchester City. Frank Lampard was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June, when the 36-year-old signed for New York City before moving on loan to the Major League Soccer outfit's sister club in Manchester. The former England midfielder has won last season's Premier League champions seven points this campaign, his latest two coming after turning a draw into a win against Sunderland on New Year's Day.

Frank Lampard was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June, where the 36-year-old signed for New York City .

That earned City two points and was reward following 48 hours of negotiations  to extend Lampard's deal at the Etihad. Another two came away against Leicester City on December 13 when, without Lampard's winner in the 40th minute, they would have been held to a 0-0 draw at the King Power Stadium. But his first and most significant contribution to Manuel Pellegrini came on September 21 when Chelsea were in town, winning 1-0 against 10 men after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off. Lampard's equaliser in the 85th minute not only rescued City one point, but dropped two for Chelsea in the process, making his total seven so far. Mourinho and Pellegrini are level, sharing 46 points and a plus-25 goal difference, but Chelsea could be the happier in 2015 had Lampard not been wearing a lighter shade of blue.

He will probably not overtake Alan Shearer on 260 goals.

His latest claim came after referee Phil Dowd did not award them a penalty in the 5-3 loss against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.

"The 'End of History Illusion' means people believe they are the finished article - explaining why teenagers don't regret tattoos or other things that may affect their appearance in the future . If becoming old is something that you can't get your head around, there could be a good reason why. Researchers have discovered a phenomenon called âthe end of history illusionâ in which we mistakenly think we are always the finished article. A survey of 19,000 people found that when we look back in hindsight it easy to see how much we have changed. But we look into the future, however, we are rarely able to see how different we are going to be. The finding helps to explain why a teenager who gets a tattoo never thinks they will regret it, even if they do so later. Similarly, when we get older the prospect of grey hair is not something we can begin to imagine. The researchers asked the 19,000 respondents 18 to 68 to take a survey and asked about their values, personalities and things they liked to do. Some were asked to reflect back over the last 10 years whilst others were asked to predict how they would change in the coming decade. The American team found that across all age ranges, everyone underestimated how much they would be different in the future. When it came to music for example, most people expected artists like Coldplay or Rhianna to play on into their old age - even though they will by then long have stopped making music. Lead researcher Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist at Harvard University, said that the findings showed that a 40-year-old looking back would remember more looking back than a 30-year-old would looking forward. He said: âWhat we never seem to realize is that our future selves will look back and think the very same thing about us. Phenomenon: Many of the 19,000 people questioned by researchers at Harvard University couldn't imagine their appearance changing or getting grey hair as they got older (stock image) âAt every age we think weâre having the last laugh, and at every age weâre wrong. âLife is a process of growing and changing, and what our results suggest is that growth and change really never stops, despite the fact that at every age from 18 to 68, we think it's pretty much come to a close.â Jordi Quoidbach of Harvard University, another one of the researchers, added: âBelieving that we just reached the peak of our personal evolution makes us feel good. âThe âI wish that I knew then what I know nowâ experience might give us a sense of satisfaction and meaning, whereas realising how transient our preferences and values are might lead us to doubt every decision and generate anxiety.â","The phenomenon means people always think they are the finished article .

"Arsene Wenger is not given to tub-thumping, so when he steps out of character, we do well to listen. âWhen you look at the top-quality players that come into the Premier League, we have all the best attacking players in Europe here,â he said last week. âThe big clubs here have huge financial potential and offensive power. All the best players play here.â As the point sinks in, you find yourself ticking lists: Manchester United have signed Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to play alongside Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. Chelsea have bought the prolific Diego Costa, Liverpool secured the tempestuous Mario Balotelli to contest his place with Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert, Arsenal have signed Alexis Sanchez, while Manchester City gladly settled for Edin Dzeko, Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero, who may just be the best of the lot. The presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar  in Barcelona, as well as Cristiano Ronaldo in Madrid, tends to mock Wengerâs boast that âall the best players play hereâ. Chelsea's Diego Costa is one of the many top-class strikers plying their trade in the Premier League . But Vincent Kompany aside, there are barely any world-class centre backs currently playing  in England . No matter, that collection of strikers is probably as good as it gets. Yet while it is relatively easy to reel off the names of genuinely gifted goalscorers in the Premier League, the list of similarly accomplished central defenders may be scribbled on the back of a stamp. There is Vincent Kompany at City and, potentially, Dejan Lovren, Liverpoolâs signing from Southampton. United and Arsenal have nobody of real note, while Chelseaâs most plausible candidate is the battle-worn John Terry. The fact that Terry is still Englandâs most formidable centre-half says everything about the current state of English central defenders. Yet this is a nation which down the decades has produced more than its share of gifted defenders. A top-of-the-head trawl turns up Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, Tony Adams, Mark Wright, Brian Cloughâs sublime alliance of Roy McFarland and Colin Todd, all the way back to the blessed Bobby Moore, who virtually invented the art. The days have gone when our senior division can offer hugely accomplished Scots and Irish defenders, after the fashion of Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson, while United would gladly hurl scores of their untold millions at a young Nemanja Vidic. But they are not to be had, neither for love nor for money, at home or abroad. The recent World Cup demonstrated just how bare is footballâs cupboard. The fact that 33-year-old John Terry is still far and away England's best defender shows there isn't much talent coming through . On the flight home from Brazil, I met a Premier League manager, a man who is a considerable authority on the world game. I asked him what he had made of the tournament. âNobody knows how to defend,â he said. âThe best players in the world and you canât see a defender. They donât exist, it seems.â So how had such a situation developed? An eloquent shrug. âYou tell me,â he said. âCos I donât have a clue.â His honesty was commendable, his conclusion depressing. Because the gameâs inability to produce distinguished defenders is more than a mere quirk. It produces a distorted sense of the gameâs values. The best strikers are footballâs Flash Harrys; hugely paid and greatly feted. They are the darlings of the television directors, the names the crowds sing, the idols of starry-eyed children who dream of the glory which accompanies the goals. But if those goals arrive too easily, then it follows that the attackersâ qualities are marginally invalidated. And the signs suggest that the inadequacy of defenders is now an accepted fact. Consider the following statistic: in  2013-14, after five Premier League games, a total of 107 goals had been scored. This year, after five games, the total stands at 143. Arsene Wenger said there are many strars in the Premier League, but almost none of them are defenders . Now some will see this as a cause for celebration; the TV directors I mentioned and the people charged with negotiating the next Premier League television contract. But the gameâs essential balance has been disturbed. Just as there is more to cricket than a series of sixes, more to golf than the ability to blast a drive for 300 yards, then there is much more to football than a furious flood of cheap goals. But that flood will not be stemmed until the game rediscovers the art of competent defending. Wengerâs instincts are admirable. The attackers he cited are faithful symbols of his philosophy. On those days when the passing game flows and the chances are generated in thrilling profusion, Arsenal are probably the most attractive team in all of England. But offer him a Vidic, a Hansen, another Adams, and he would sell the grandstand for his signature. Because then he would discover, beyond doubt or question, the true worth of the best attacking players in Europe. Ham acting like this is Frankly just laughable . Frank Lampard wore the look of a man who had just done something unforgivable. His beaming colleagues came bouncing to his side but he responded with firmly polite rejection. At such a moment he needed time to be alone, time to come to terms with his shame. It was the stuff of Victorian melodrama. Indeed, you would have needed a heart of stone to keep from laughing out loud. For Lampard was observing the most fatuous convention in modern football. He was ostentatiously refusing to celebrate the goal he had just scored, on the grounds that he had scored it against his former club. Frank Lampard's non-celebration when he scored for Manchester City against Chelsea was nauseating . The entire exercise reeked of calculation, as it always does. The City fans would be so cheered by the goal that they would overlook the absence of celebration. The Chelsea fans would see the stricken face of their old favourite and tell themselves: âDear old Frankâs still one of usâ. Yet the fact is that Lampard is now employed by Manchester City. They pay his wages. He joined them because Chelsea decided that they no longer needed him. Thatâs how professional football works, as Lampard knows full well. Nobody was expecting extravagant, knee-sliding glee last weekend, just a simple recognition that he had done his job. The counterfeit remorse convinced nobody but the terminally gullible. A yellow card for simulation should greet the next player to pull the stunt. Ham acting deserves no less. Insipid Geoff Thompson rewarded by Sepp Blatter . FIFA have rejected calls to publish their own report into alleged corruption in the bidding for the World Cups of 2018 and 2022. Having commissioned the report, Sepp Blatter has discovered it was telling uncomfortable truths. Enforced silence was his predictable response. In a busy week, it offered a brief distraction from his efforts to organise his fifth term as FIFA president. Yet there was one matter which almost sneaked past the public gaze. FIFA decided to ban the third-party ownership of players. Former FA chairman Geoff Thompson endorsed Sepp BlatterÂ for his current presidential term . So they set up a working party. And who is to be chair? I give you Mr Geoff Thompson, former chairman of our own FA. In nine years as FA chairman, he never cast a shadow. Indeed, there were those who seriously doubted his very existence. But he did sign a letter endorsing Blatter for his current presidential term and, in Seppâs world, no sycophantic deed goes unrewarded. So Thompson heads working parties, where he will rock no boats, drop no bricks and say nothing because he has nothing to say.

"The idea of storing information in living cells has been the plot of sci-fi fantasies such as Johnny Mnemonic, starring Keanu Reeves - and today it has become reality . It sounds like the stuff of science fiction fantasies, but scientists have turned living cells into data storage devices - like 'living hard drives'. The idea of storing computer information inside living cells - or human brains - has formed the plot of sci fi thrillers such as Johnny Mnemonic (pictured). But in reality, the cells are likely to become a method for retrieving information from inside the human body. The information - stored in the DNA code - can be rewritten and erased at will, so could be used to study ageing cells, and even 'turn off' cells before they turn cancerous. The cells would be like tiny computers that can 'live' with the body - and could be an incredibly important tool for both computing and medicine. âIt took us three years and 750 tries to make it work, but we finally did it,â said Jerome Bonnet, PhD, of his latest research, a method for repeatedly encoding, storing and erasing digital data within the DNA of living cells. Bonnet, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University, worked with graduate student Pakpoom Subsoontorn and assistant professor Drew Endy, PhD, to reapply natural enzymes adapted from bacteria to flip specific sequences of DNA back and forth at will. All three scientists work in the Department of Bioengineering, a joint effort of the School of Engineering and the School of Medicine. In practical terms, they have devised the genetic equivalent of a binary digit â a âbitâ in data parlance. âEssentially, if the DNA section points in one direction, it's a zero. If it points the other way, it's a one,â Subsoontorn explained. âProgrammable data storage within the DNA of living cells would seem an incredibly powerful tool for studying cancer, aging, organismal development and even the natural environment,â said Endy. Researchers could count how many times a cell divides, for instance, and that might someday give scientists the ability to turn off cells before they turn cancerous. In the computer world, their work would form the basis of what is known as non-volatile memory â data storage that can retain information without consuming power. The team calls its device a ârecombinase addressable dataâ module, or RAD for short. They used RAD to modify a particular section of DNA within microbes that determines how the one-celled organisms will fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Â¿It took us three years and 750 tries to make it work, but we finally did it,Â¿ said Jerome Bonnet, PhD, of his latest research, a method for repeatedly encoding, storing and erasing digital data within the DNA of living cells . The microbes glow red or green depending upon the orientation of the section of DNA. Using RAD, the engineers can flip the section back and forth at will. They report their findings in a paper that will be published online May 21 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. âPrevious work had shown how to flip the genetic sequence â albeit irreversibly â in one direction through the expression of a single enzyme,â Bonnet said, âbut we needed to reliably flip the sequence back and forth, over and over, in order to create a fully reusable binary data register, so we needed something different.â âThe problem is that the proteins do their own thing. If both are active at the same time, or concentrated in the wrong amounts, you get a mess and the individual cells produce random results,â Subsoontorn continued. The researchers found it was fairly easy to flip a section of DNA in either direction. âBut we discovered time and again that most of our designs failed when the two proteins were used together within the same cell,â said Endy. âErgo: Three years and 750 tries to get the balance of protein levels right.â Bonnet has now tested RAD modules in single microbes that have doubled more than 100 times and the switch has held. He has likewise switched the latch and watched a cell double 90 times, and set it back. The latch will even store information when the enzymes are not present. In short, RAD works. It is reliable and it is rewritable. For Endy and the team, the future of computing then becomes not only how fast or how much can be computed, but when and where computations occur and how those computations might impact our understanding of and interaction with life.âOne of the coolest places for computing,â Endy said, âis within biological systems.âHis goal is to go from the single bit he has now to eight bits â or a âbyteâ â of programmable genetic data storage. âI'm not even really concerned with the ways genetic data storage might be useful down the road, only in creating scalable and reliable biological bits as soon as possible. Then we'll put them in the hands of other scientists to show the world how they might be used,â Endy said. To get there, however, science will need many new tools for engineering biology, he added, but it will not be easy. âSuch systems will likely be 10 to 50 times more complicated than current state-of-the-art genetic engineering projects,â he said. For what it is worth, Endy anticipates their second bit of rewritable DNA data will arrive faster than the first and the third faster still, but it will take time. âWe're probably looking at a decade from when we started to get to a full byte,â he said. âBut, by focusing today on tools that improve the engineering cycle at the heart of biotechnology, we'll help make all future engineering of biology .","Sections of living DNA glow red or green to store computer data .

But Drogba is determined to ensure it is a season to remember at Stamford Bridge. He told Chelsea TV: 'We have to do it (win something) together. 'We want to achieve something great and I think that is why we have played well this season. I hope at the end of it we will be able to say together we won this trophy, this trophy and this trophy. 'And yes, I would love to win another FA Cup. I would love to win it for the club and for the fans as well. I know the feeling the fans have when we get to a final. We share the same feeling. 'It would be nice to go back to Wembley together again and make history.' Harry Kane celebrates scoring for Tottenham during their 5-3 win over Chelsea on New Year's Day . Kane added his second and Tottenham's fourth with a smart finish acrossÂ Thibaut Courtois and into his net . A 5-3 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on New Year's Day has allowed Man City to join the Blues at the summit of the Premier League. So Drogba and Chelsea are determined to get back to winning ways - first against Watford in the Cup and then against Newcastle United next Saturday in the Premier League. The 36-year-old continued:Â 'The mentality is always to get closer to Wembley. You win this round; you go to the next one. 'If you have to replay a game you do it but really the thing is to get to Wembley because it's a fantastic stadium and the FA Cup is only good when you win it. Andros Townsend then scored a third from the penalty spot after Kane was brought down by Gary Cahill . Diego Costa gave Premier League leaders Chelsea a lead at White Hart Lane before Spurs stormed back . 'If you get to the final that's when you really know you have a chance to win the trophy because when you come in you see the cup. Everything changes. 'We always play to win. The more you win this competition the more you are connected to it. I think it's been two-and-a-half years since we won it last so it would be good for us to go to Wembley again and win it but it's a long journey ahead.' Jose Mourinho is determined to secure silverware this season having failed to pick up a single trophy in his first campaign back at Stamford Bridge last year. Drogba (second left) and his Chelsea team-mate parade the FA Cup and Premier League trophies in May 2010 . And former Marseille, Shanghai Shenhua and Galatasaray striker Drogba is determined that the 'big competition' that is the FA Cup be one of them. The ex-Ivory Coast international added:Â 'Even when I was in France it was a big competition. 'We all watched the FA Cup final as though it was the last game of the season. I used to see players that I was and still am a big fan of playing and scoring in these finals, people like Cantona and Anelka. Drogba (left), Florent Malouda (second left), John Terry (second right) and Frank Lampard lift the FA Cup . 'It's a great competition for English football, one where you can find a team from a lower division or a team that is struggling in the league in the semi-final or the final. The atmosphere for the games, with all the fans travelling to support their teams, is special. 'When I think of the FA Cup I have these images of (Roberto) di Matteo, (Eric) Cantona, (Nicolas) Anelka scoring in the final at the old Wembley. I always dreamed of playing at the old Wembley but I didn't have the chance because they built the new one. 'I was lucky then to create some kind of history at the new stadium (with Chelsea).' Drogba runs off celebrating after scoring in extra time against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup final .","Chelsea host Watford in the FA Cup third round on Sunday .

"Vitor Pereira, the former manager of Porto, is the surprise name on the short-list for the vacant job at Crystal Palace. Pereira, 46, was considered by Everton as a successor to David Moyes, before the appointment of Roberto Martinez. Now he is set for discussions with Crystal Palace owner Steve Parish, who sacked Neil Warnock on Saturday, following the 3-1 defeat at home to Southampton. VIDEO Scroll down to see Warnock's last press conference as Crystal Palace manager . Former Porto boss Vitor Pereira is on the short-list to replace Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace . Neil Warnock has left his post in charge of the Eagles after just 16 Premier League matches . In 76 matches as a Premier League manager, Neil Warnock has won 17, drawn 19 and lost 40. He has a win record of 22.4 per cent, and 70 points from a possible 228. Credit: Opta . Parish will open talks with Pereira, although he is believed to be one of a number of candidates. Crystal Palace would not rule out a return for Tony Pulis â although their former manager would have to make the first move, unlikely given his comments on Saturday. And there were rumours emanating from the north-east today that former player Alan Pardew could be a contender, although the Â£5m compensation clause in his contract would make a huge dent in Palaceâs budget for the January transfer window. Parish knows the appointment of Pereira would be a gamble, given his lack of Premier League experience. Aside from a recent spell at Al-Ahli in Saudi Arabia, his entire coaching career has been spent in Portugal, often at youth level or among backroom staff. He was assistant to Andre Villas-Boas at Porto, inheriting the job when he left to take over Chelsea in 2011. Tim Sherwood 6/4 . Chris Hughton 6/1 . Tony Pulis 7/1 . Tony Popovic 8/1 .

Pereira then won back to back titles at Porto, but disappointed in Europe, and quit in summer 2013 after missing out on the Everton job. He spent a year in Saudi Arabia and was succeeded at Al-Ahli by Christian Gross. Pereira is currently without a club, meaning he could start immediately, but Palace want time to consider other candidates and have already determined that Keith Millen will be in charge for the matches with Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa.

The Eagles dropped into the bottom three of the Premier League on Boxing Day after a 3-1 loss to Southampton, with pressure mounting on Warnock and fans calling for his head. The club confirmed the sacking with a brief statement on their website. It said:Â 'Crystal Palace Football Club can today confirm that Neil Warnock has been relieved of his duties and is no longer first-team manager. 'The club would like to put on record its thanks to Neil for all his hard work and energy over the past four months. 'Keith Millen will lead the team against Queens Park Rangers tomorrow [Sunday] as caretaker manager.' Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish (right) has made the decision to sack Warnock after a poor start . Mile Jedinak plays his final game for Crystal Palace against QPR, before captaining Australia in the Asia Cup . 'We got on a bus and before we got to the hotel the driver said he had a message from his boss that he wouldn't take us to the ground unless I paid for the bus. That's the last time I was at Newcastle. I haven't got my money back for that bus by the way!' - Ahead of his first match back in charge of Palace, at Newcastle, Warnock recalls learning how the club had slipped into administration ahead of his last visit to St James' Park with the Eagles in 2010. 'I think that's why they threw the last goal in, so they didn't go to Man City away. We heard the score' - Warnock was frustrated after the Selhurst Park stadium announcer told fans the winner of their Capital One Cup match against Newcastle - still ongoing at the time - would face Manchester City, who were fresh off a 7-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday. 'I have not seen something like that since Bert Trautmann' - A furious Warnock condemns Craig Dawson's challenge on goalkeeper Julian Speroni during Palace's 2-2 draw with West Brom on October 25. 'I don't really know what a billionaire could do for Palace - I have only been here six weeks. You'd better ask the chairman. There are not a lot of billionaires in Yorkshire' - Warnock reacts to speculation linking American Josh Harris with a takeover of Palace. 'I am looking forward to going back on talkSPORT and BT after (finishing as a manager), when you can say what you want and enjoy it' - Warnock reacts to an improper conduct charge from the Football Association relating to his post-match comments after the 2-1 home defeat to Chelsea. 'I can't afford to keep giving my wife the same amount of money as the fine; it's a double whammy for me' - And Warnock later reveals he must also pay his wife the equivalent of any FA fine after being made to pay Â£9,000 for those post-match remarks. 'He doesn't know what he's going to do next, so the full-back doesn't have a chance, does he?' - Yannick Bolasie's unorthodox style earns his manager's praise. 'One of the press guys told me this morning that on Delaney's Instagram he says he's agreed (to sign a new contract) so somebody at the club will tell me eventually. Unfortunately Damien can't tweet me but no doubt he'll let me know. It's good news if it is true' - Warnock reacts to reports of a new contract for Damien Delaney. 'As long as they play well I'm sure managers don't care what they wear. I'm surprised at Christmas time that we haven't got a pair of boots with flashing lights!' - In one of his final Palace press conferences, Warnock has a new suggestion for football boot designers. Speaking to the Croydon Advertiser, chairman Steve Parish revealed the reason behind the sacking, while admitting that it is a priority to start negotiations with a new manager immediately. 'We have let Neil go and we have thanked him for his work,' the Palace owner said. 'It's not working out and we are looking for a reaction against QPR. 'I slept on it really and just spoke to a few people and made my mind up this morning. Neil is a great guy and he wanted to do it at Palace. It just hasn't happened. 'It just wasn't working. You always want it sorted out as soon as possible but I haven't got anyone lined up. We want to hold negotiations as soon as possible.' Warnock has therefore become the first managerial casualty of the Premier League season, taking charge of just 16 league games in his second stint at Selhurst Park. Keith Millen will take temporary charge of Crystal Palace when they travel to Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . The substitution of winger Yannick Bolasie for full-back Martin Kelly, when Palace were 3-0 down to Southampton, saw fans call for Warnock's head on Boxing Day. Chants of 'you don't know what you're doing' rang around Selhurst Park, while sections of the home fans booed at the full-time whistle. Warnock was honest in his assessment of the performance though, admitting that he expected a negative response from the Palace faithful. 'I have no complaints, at 3-0 down, you'd be very surprised not to get a bit of stick. I thought the players were very good today in the circumstances, they were almost as shell-shocked as some of the fans.' Toby Alderweireld's third goal for Southampton was the last Warnock would concede as Palace manager . Sunday would have seen Warnock (centre) return to his old club Queens Park Rangers . Caretaker boss Millen is now in a position familiar to him, after two previous stints as caretaker manager at Selhurst Park. After the departures of Ian Holloway and  Pulis, it was him whom Palace called upon to take the reigns, and so it is not a position alien to the 48-year-old. 'It is not a nice position to be in again, I must admit,' Millen told Sky Sports News. 'It was a surprise this morning. 'We have all been disappointed by yesterday's result but the first-half performance was decent. We're just not taking our chances at the moment, so we've come into work this morning and I get the phone call from the chairman. 'It has been a shock for us all, but we have got to try and be professional and try and concentrate on a massive game tomorrow [Sunday].' The Eagles face a tough trip to Loftus Road, where they take on relegation rivals QPR in what would have been a return to his old club for Warnock. 'Neil came in this morning and we had a quick chat,' Millen continued. 'He cleared his desk and his stuff. 'It is always a sad time and it is very difficult for all of us, the staff, because he kept us here and we were part of his backroom staff. 'We're all disappointed but we have got to move on very quickly with this big game.'","Former Porto manager Vitor Pereira on Crystal Palace's short-list .

"Everton boss Roberto Martinez feels the way his side now react to suffering their first back-to-back Barclays Premier League losses this season will be vital to how their campaign pans out overall. After being beaten 3-0 at Southampton last Saturday and then 1-0 at home by Stoke on Boxing Day, the Toffees - who came fifth last term and had been targeting the Champions League places this time around - are 12th in the table, 11 points off the top four. They have only won one of their last six league games, with four of those ending in defeat, and struggled to create much going forward in what was a physical encounter with the Potters. Roberto Martinez has demanding a reaction from his players after back-to-back defeats . Everton lost 1-0 at home to Stoke City on Boxing Day thanks to a Bojan penalty at Goodison Park . Martinezâs men are next in action on Sunday at Newcastle, another outfit who will be keen to make the most of the opportunity to boost their points tally following a sequence of disappointing results. And ahead of the trip to St Jamesâ Park, the Spaniard said: 'I donât think in general we are lacking confidence, but I think this is a moment of the season that is pivotal for us - seeing how we can react. 'The reaction now has to be that we make sure we know what we are doing. We have a real understanding of how to perform and if we can keep that, the results will come. 'But football gives you these sorts of challenges, and this is the challenge of the season. We need to make sure we get through this period stronger than ever, and that could really give us a very strong second half of the season.' Martinez admits Everton have not been 'in a great moment' of late, but was keen to stress that against Stoke in particular 'nothing that could have gone our way did go in our favour.' He was critical of referee Lee Masonâs decisions to only yellow-card apparent last man Jonathan Walters for pulling back Leighton Baines in the first half and then award a penalty to the visitors moments later, having adjudged James McCarthy to have fouled Bojan Krkic, who converted the spot-kick himself. Jonathan Walters was only booked for pulling back Leighton Baines in the first half . Bojan won Stoke's decisive penalty after he was fouled by James McCarthy (left) Everton midfielder Gareth Barry was also surprised Walters was not red-carded. Barry, quoted by the Liverpool Echo, said: 'To me, at the time, it looked as though he (Baines) was going through clear on goal. 'Leighton was making the forward movement and travelling a lot quicker than anybody else. He (Walters) was the last man so I expected the red.' With regard to his sideâs inability to make real inroads against Stoke, Martinez suggested an 'accumulation' of things had made life difficult for the hosts. In what seemed a slightly backhanded compliment to the Potters, he said: 'What Stoke wanted to do helped them. They did really well coming here and trying to stop the play, making it difficult to be an open game. 'I think they defended really well, but I donât think we have seen a good spectacle because I donât think that was the intention of the opposition.' Martinez added: 'Also, we have very good, talented young players but they need a bit of direction and I did feel we missed that leadership from Tim Howard and Phil Jagielka in the second half. That was frustrating.' Gareth Barry (right) became the first player to reach 100 bookings in the Premier League . TimHoward had to come off at half-time after injuring his calf during the opening 45 minutes . Phil Jagielka (centre) winces in pain after going over on his ankle following a collision with Walters . Goalkeeper Howard and skipper Jagielka were forced off at half-time due to calf and ankle problems respectively and look likely to miss the Newcastle game. Additionally, Jagielkaâs fellow centre-back John Stones and winger Kevin Mirallas are doubtful due to knocks they picked up in the Boxing Day match. The fixture also saw forward Steven Naismith receive a fifth Premier League booking of the season, meaning he will be suspended for Sundayâs encounter. Newcastle, who are 10th, head into that game off the back of three straight league defeats.","Everton suffered back-to-back defeats against Southampton and Stoke .

"Roberto Martinez criticised referee Lee Mason and accused Bojan Krkic of tricking the official into awarding Stoke a penalty. Martinez was unhappy that Mason did not show Jonathan Walters a red card for tugging Leighton Bainesâs shirt when he was through on goal moments before he awarded a penalty for James McCarthyâs challenge on Bojan who then scored from the spot. âThe decision on Walters is difficult to understand,â said Martinez. âItâs outside the box but there is no other Stoke defender. Heâs the last man and itâs a clear goalscoring opportunity. Bojan hits the turf, leading to a penalty for Stoke which the forward converted to win the game . Bojan wheels away in celebration after scoring the only goal of the game at Goodison Park . âI donât understand why itâs a yellow card. It should be a red. Itâs very different to play against 10 men than 11, especially against a side who worked well defensively.â Martinez pointed to an incident in Evertonâs draw at Sunderland last month when they were awarded a penalty by Mason but the referee took no action against Connor Wickham who was the last man. âMy disappointment is we had the same situation last time at Sunderland that was a clear mistake. It was a real bad sign to see the same referee make mistakes applying the same rule. Thatâs a worry.â Leighton Baines and Charlie Adam clash after the Everton defender was brought down by Jon Walter . Martinez said he understood why Mason awarded a penalty against Everton but only because Bojan had made the most of little contact from McCarthy. âI know the Catalan culture well,â said Martinez. âYouâve been brought up in a way that youâre forcing the referee to make a decision. âI donât think thereâs enough contact for it to be a penalty. If he doesnât give the red card because heâs not sure I donât understand why he gives a penalty because he canât be sure it is one.â Stoke boss Mark Hughes had a different view of both incidents. âJon pulled him back but I donât think itâs a red because I donât think you can say it was a clear goalscoring opportunity,â said Hughes. âFor the penalty, defenders have to be careful and his leg has been clipped.â Roberto Martinez was aggrieved with the performance of referee Lee Mason (above)","Everton beaten 1-0 by Stoke City at Goodison Park on Boxing Day .

"Wednesday will be the last people living today to witness one of the rarest astronomical events: the transit of Venus. If it is not too cloudy, observers will see the brightest star of the night transformed into a tiny black dot crossing the face of the sun. The transit begins on Tuesday at 11.04pm - but as the sun has gone to bed in the UK at this time, it will be an early rise at 5.55am if you want to see the transit from here. If you do grumble at getting up at this time, spare a thought for the astronomers in the 18th Century, who travelled thousands of miles and risked their lives to witness this precious sight. Spectacle: A pelican and fishermen go about their routine on the Flagler Beach Pier while Venus creeps slowly across the rising sun . They did so because they believed . Venus held the key to the most pressing astronomical quest of the age: . the size of the solar system. In . 1716, British astronomer Edmond Halley had called upon scientists to . unite in a project spanning the entire globe. He predicted that on June . 6, 1761, Venus would traverse the burning disc of the sun for about six . hours. If several . people at different locations across the globe measured and timed this . celestial rendezvous, they could calculate the distance between Earth . and sun: the base unit for all distances in the solar system and the . holy grail of astronomy. Visionary: Edmond Halley, a member of The Royal Society, predicted that on June 6, 1761, Venus would traverse the burning disc of the sun for about six hours . The . only problem was that transits of Venus only occur in pairs, eight . years apart, but with an interval of more than a century before they are . seen again. After this year, the next transit is not until December . 2117. When Halley asked his international . colleagues to rally, only one transit had ever been observed. Knowing he . would not be alive to orchestrate this global cooperation â a fact he . lamented âeven on his deathbedâ while holding a glass of wine â all he . could do was place his trust in future generations. His . gauntlet was taken up when hundreds of astronomers joined the transit . project in the 1760s. At a time when it took six days to travel from . London to Newcastle, dozens of them travelled to remote outposts of the . world to observe the phenomenon, laden with clocks, huge telescopes and . other instruments. Many . risked their lives. With the Seven Yearsâ War tearing Europe apart, they . were even sent into war zones. They made for strange adventurers: most . of their lives were an endless round of dull routine, spending nights . under the open sky or engaging in complex computations. The . scientific world was electrified. The observations were the most . ambitious scientific project ever planned, because the astronomers . needed to watch the transit simultaneously from both the northern and . southern hemispheres. Venusâs path would be shorter or longer across the . sun according to each viewing station. With the help of relatively . simple trigonometry, the distance between sun and Earth could be . calculated, but only if the astronomers shared their results afterwards. Rare sight: Five transits of Venus have been recorded -- the last one priot to that in 2004 occurred in 1882 . It was to be the first international scientific collaboration, and Europe was gripped in transit fever. Even Captain James Cook got involved, taking the Endeavour into the uncharted emptiness of the South Pacific . The . expeditions were organised by the scientific societies of Europe . including the Royal Society in London. They sent Nevil Maskelyne, later . Astronomer Royal, to St Helena â a lone speck of land in the South . Atlantic. With him he took an assistant, trunks full of instruments and . more than 100 gallons of wine and rum. Charles . Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, later famed for the Mason-Dixon Line, left . Britain for Sumatra, but within four days they were attacked by a French . warship. The two refused to continue but the Royal Society threatened . they would be prosecuted as mutineers âwith the utmost Severity of Lawâ unless they pressed on. Some astronomers waded waist-deep . through icy rivers; others saw their ships wrecked by tropical storms. On the day of the transit, June 6, 1761, about 250 official observers at . more than 100 locations pointed their telescopes to the sky. But instead of swiftly moving across the sun, Venus lingered at the edge for up to a minute, making exact timing impossible. They had one more chance, on June 3, . 1769. Once again astronomers were dispatched across the world. Catherine . the Great mounted eight expeditions across the vast Russian empire. Astronomers from Britain, Austria, Switzerland and Russia travelled to the Arctic, where their brandy froze and clocks stopped. Stunning: Earth's closest planetary neighbour appeared as a black disc 30 times smaller than the Sun's diameter, slowly moving from left to right over the course of six hours when it last appeared . The British even sent Captain James Cook and the Endeavour into the uncharted emptiness of the South Pacific to follow the transit from Tahiti. Five astronomers died and many more faced unimaginable hardship. One French scientist travelled thousands of miles, facing bloody battles, dysentery and hurricanes only to be defeated by clouds. When he returned home after 11 years, he had twice failed to see the transit, his heirs had declared him dead and divided up his estate, and he had lost his job. It took years to collect the global data, but eventually the distance between Earth and sun was determined within a range of 92,900,000 to 96,900,000 miles â very close to todayâs figure of 92,960,000 miles. Impressive, but even more importantly, it was the beginning of international scientific collaboration. On June 6 this year, the sun will rise just before 5am in Britain, and Venus will begin the show about an hour later. But donât look into the sun without proper protection. If you have sharp eyes, get some cheap eclipse shades or for a closer look, use binoculars or a telescope with appropriate solar filters. But spare a moment for those astronomers who faced enemy attacks, deadly diseases and all kinds of adverse conditions when they united to measure the heavens.

"Resplendent in a chic burgundy coat and a killer spiky necklace, Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was on top fashionable form as she stepped out in The Hague today. But for once, she had competition, which arrived in the form of the ever-fashionable Queen Letizia of Spain, who with her husband King Felipe, landed in the Dutch capital Amsterdam this morning to begin a tour of the Netherlands. Letizia and Maxima didn't have it all their own way, however, and were run close in the style stakes by their dapper husbands, with King Felipe cutting a particularly dashing figure in his pinstriped suit. Scroll down for video . Big arrival: The Spanish royals arrived in the Hague today to begin a tour of the Netherlands . Glamorous: Letizia, 42, opted for a crimson ensemble while her Dutch counterpart Maxima chose burgundy .

Pleased to see you: The Netherlands' Willem-Alexander and Spain's Felipe looked delighted to see each other . The two kings, who last met during a trip to address the UN General Assembly in New York late last month, seemed pleased to see each other with King Willem-Alexander, 47, enveloping Felipe, 46, in a warm bear-hug. Letizia, 42, and Maxima, 43, who spent much of the UN meeting seated together, also appeared delighted to be together again, exchanging warm kisses and smiles as they met on the steps of the Noordeinde Palace. The two couples, who were joined for a meeting by Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, are among the youngest - and newest - monarchs in Europe, with King Willem-Alexander taking the Dutch throne last year and King Felipe ascending to the Spanish in June. His father, 76-year-old Juan-Carlos, said at the time that the decision was made because 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'. He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year - Pope Benedict XVI, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and King Albert II of Belgium having all stepped down in 2013.

First thing's first: Before being ushered inside, Felipe spent some time waving at assembled well-wishers . Despite the abdications of Queen Beatrix and King Juan-Carlos, the Queen has stated that she has no plans to abdicate, with Buckingham Palace sources confirming that she will never relinquish the British throne. One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as King Felipe. However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'. For their part, Letizia and Felipe have enjoyed a busy three months since ascending to the Spanish throne on the 19th June, with several international tours already under their belt. And they're off: Willem-Alexander then led the way as the couple made their way into the Noordeinde Palace . Together again: After greeting the Spanish royals, their Dutch counterparts swiftly ushered them inside . Reunited: The two queens were last seen together during a visit to the UN Assembly in New York last month . More recently, the pair have attended events all over Spain, including a trip to the Valle Del Cicados Institute in Calahorra last week, and have spearheaded major national events such as Spanish National Day on Sunday. But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling. Since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76 . Maxima has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence. On their way: The couples were still chatting as they made their way into the Palace in the Hague . Photo op: As they made their way through the courtyard, the two couples stopped for a quick photo . Joining in: Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was also on hand to welcome Letizia and Felipe to the Hague .

"An 11-year-old girl thought to suffer from Down's Syndrome is facing the death penalty in Pakistan for apparently burning pages from the Koran. Furious mobs of Muslim locals gathered outside the home of Christian girl Rifta Masih after she was found with charred pages of the Islamic holy book. She was arrested and has been held in custody for the last 14 days under Pakistanâs controversial blasphemy laws. A conviction could see her executed. Anger: Furious mobs similar to these gathered outside the home of an 11-year-old Christian girl accused of burning pages of the Koran (file picture) Run-down: Children play in a slum area on the outskirts of Islamabad, Pakistan, close to the town of Mehrabadi where the 11-year-old girl lives . A Pakistani police officer, Zabi Ullah, said today that the girl was arrested after hundreds of neighbors gathered outside her house in Mehrabadi, a poor outlying district of the capital, Islamabad. He said the police took the girl to the police station, and that sheâs been held for 14 days while authorities investigate. âAbout 500-600 people had gathered outside her house in Islamabad, and they were very emotional, angry and they might have harmed her if we had not quickly reacted,â he said. âSome Muslims from the area claim the girl had burned pages of the Koran, and we are investigating, and we have not reached any conclusion,â he said. Another police official, Qasim Niazi, said when the girl was brought to the police station she had a shopping bag that contained various religious and Arabic-language papers that had been partly burned but no Koran. Friction: A Pakistani Christian prays at a church with fellow worshipers. There are tensions between the religious groups and Muslims . Islamabad in northern Pakistan was the scene of several protests earlier this year after U.S. troops apparently burned Korans . Officers added that the matter could be dropped once the investigation is completed and the atmosphere is defused, saying there was ânothing much to the case.â He did not want to be identified due to the sensitivity of the case. Meanwhile, Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari said he had 'taken notice' of the reports of the arrest and asked Pakistan's interior ministry to present a report to him. There were varying reports on the girlâs age and whether she suffered from Down's Syndrome. Ullah said she was 16 while other officials have said she was either 12 or 11. Niazi said that when the girl was brought to the police station she was scared and unable to speak normally, but he did not know whether she suffered from mental health issues. The arrest of the girl and outrage among the local community demonstrates the deep emotion that suspected blasphemy cases can evoke in this conservative Muslim country, where rising extremism often means religious minorities live in fear of persecution. Sacred: A Pakistani Muslim woman holds up a copy of the Islamic holy text the Koran . Christians often live in fear that they will be accused of blasphemy, and many critics say the legislation is sometimes used to settle scores. Angry mobs have been known to sometimes take the law into their own hands and beat or kill people who are accused of violating the blasphemy laws. In July, thousands of people dragged a Pakistani man accused of desecrating the Koran from a police station in the central Pakistani city of Bahawalpur, beat him to death and then set his body on fire. And there were furious protests earlier this year after U.S. troops were accused of burning the Koran. Effigies of Barack Obama were burned in the street amid demands for an apology. Attempts to revoke or alter the blasphemy laws have been met with violent opposition, however. Last year, two prominent Pakistani political figures who spoke out against the laws were killed, in attacks that raised concerns about the rise of religious extremism in Pakistan. Liberal politician Salman Taseer was shot and killed by one of his own guards in January 2011, and in March 2011, militants gunned down Shahbaz Bhatti, the only Christian minister in Pakistanâs Cabinet. A spokesperson for Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, Farhatullah Babar, said the president has âserious noteâ of reports of the girlâs arrest and has asked the Interior Ministry to look into the case.","Furious mobs surround the home of 'mentally disabled' Christian girl .

"One of the teachers of slain schoolboy Lawrence King - the 15-year-old who was shot twice in the head for asking another male student to be his Valentine - has created shock and anger among activists for saying that she 'relates' to King's killer. The claims were made last night in Marta Cunningham's powerful new documentary Valentine Road, which aired on HBO and follows the dual stories of King - a flamboyant African-American with transgender issues, who would wear make-up and dresses - and Brandon McInerney, a 14-year-old from a troubled white home with a budding interest in no-Nazism. The day after King asked McInery to be his Valentine, McInery walked into their school in Oxnard, a small farming town in California, loaded with a pistol and murdered King in a computer lab. Cunningham's documentary was spawned by how little attention the case received and the overhelming amount of support that McInery recieved and not King, the victim. 'They made a murder victim the cause of his own murder,' said Homocide detective Jeff Kay. 'I've never seen that before.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Seventh Grade teacher Shirley Brown is one of many people in the California town of Oxnard who spoke out in support of Brandon McInery, a 14-year-old student who shot Lawrence 'Larry' King in the head for asking to be his Valentine . Murdered: Larry King was the victim of a gay hate crime . Scene: Larry King was killed in a classroom of this school, E.O. Green Junior High School in Oxnard, California . Brandon McInerney is serving a 21-year sentence in prison for the murder of Larry King. A standout section of the documentary that has drawn the ire of gay activists is an interview with Shirley Brown, King's seventh grade teacher at WE.O. Green Junior High School. King had confided in her about his gay tendencies and she told him to keeep them 'private' and to 'dwell' on them. 'I do believe in a heaven and a hell, and I do believe Larry honestly did not have a clue, honestly, the consequences of his actions,' Brown said. 'I relate to Brandon because I could see my own self being in that very same position. 'I don't know if I would have taken a gun, but a good swift kick in the butt might work really well,' she added, laughing. Perspective: Juror Diane Michaels says murderer Brandon McInery was being 'taunted' by King and that killing King was a 'plan to take care of this terrible problem' There were also interviews with some of the jurors involved in the case who spoke in support of McInery. Juror Diane Michaels, a nurse, said it was a breach of civil rights because McInery was being 'taunted'. 'Where are the civil rights of the one being taunted by another person that is cross-dressing?' she said. 'They have to address that. It's very important. He had no one to turn to because the school was soi pro Larry King's civil rights but where was Brandon's civil rights?' Michaels said if King had followed the 'example' lead by a lesbian student, who stopped holding the hands of her girlfriend at school, he would not have been killed. '(McInery) had a plan to take care of this terrible problem because no one else was,' she said. Juror Karen McElhaney described the teen as 'intelligent' and that his drawings of Nazi symbols were normal. 'That's what kids do, they doodle,' she said. Cunningham set out to challenge views such as this. 'As a community, I think weâre really failing our LGBT youth of color,' she said. 'Itâs time for us to understand where race intersects with LGBT.'","Lawrence King, known as Larry, was 15 when he was shot twice in the head at school by Brandon McInery, 14, who King asked to be his Valentine .

Three officers were pictured helping the stricken man as he sat in the restaurant in Cork, Ireland.

The image, taken by a fellow diner, has now become an internet hit since it was posted online. More than 4,500 people have seen the picture on Imgur and it has attracted hundreds of comments. The picture was taken on Tuesday evening after the man, who has not been identified, popped in for a bite to eat. He chose the child's high chair, rather than numerous adult-sized seats that were vacant at the time. Police were then called when he realised he could not free himself from the chair. According to the person who took the picture, the man had drunk some alcohol before squeezing himself in to the seat. A McDonald's spokesperson said high-chairs should not be used 'without adult supervision' He was released without charge after being freed.

"Zzzzp! goes the machine, quietly. Yeeeeow! screech the nerve endings in my cheeks as yet another searing rush of ultrasound energy whizzes through them. 'Are we still friends?' questions cosmetic nurse Esther Loughran, as she hands me a mirror to survey how much difference her 'miracle machine' has made to my face. We are still friends, but only because the agonising pain has stopped. I can't, however, guarantee that will be the case when the machine is switched back on. Ulthera isthe latest non-surgical face-lifting device that claims to 'shrink-wrap' your face from the inside, tightening sagging skin and kick-starting the growth of new collagen . I'm at Dr Rita Rakus's swish London clinic trying out something called Ulthera - the latest non-surgical face-lifting device that claims to 'shrink-wrap' your face from the inside, tightening sagging skin and kick-starting the growth of new collagen. It's loved by a host of stars including Friends actress Courteney Cox, and the before-and-after pictures on the company's website look impressive. Even the notoriously hard-to-please U.S. health watchdog, the Food and Drug Administration, likes Ulthera, deeming it the only non-invasive procedure to lift the skin on the neck, chin and brow. But here's the hitch: Ulthera is exceptionally painful. Painful enough to make a bunch of hardened beauty junkies - women who think nothing of having Botox without anaesthetic and barely flinch when their skin is flayed with a laser - literally weep. Just last week, a colleague (whoÂ  is no wimp) left this same clinicÂ  in tears, unable to completeÂ  the treatment. Despite its efficacy - and its undoubted money-spinning potential - I know two cosmetic doctors who trialled the machine and decided they would never inflict that level of pain on their patients ('Everyone said it was horrific, excruciating,' says one). Alice receiving the Ulthera treatment, left, of which actress Courteney Cox is said to be a fan . In the U.S., clinics routinely prescribe their patients Valium before the treatment or even sedate them. So you will understand my apprehension, despite Esther's reassurances that most people are 'fine' with the machine. 'Comfort levels vary from patient to patient,' says the leaflet about the treatment. 'There can be some discomfort, but this is a sign that the collagen-building process has been initiated.' Having not been prescribed Valium, I've made do with taking doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol beforehand. The face is divided into sections for the treatment and so I've asked that we start under my chin, which is most in need of help - just in case that's all I can take. Alice after having her chin and right cheek done . Esther explains that unlike lasers, which zap the surface of the skin, Ulthera uses ultrasound waves to heat something called the SMAS (superficial muscular aponeurotic system), the muscle-like layer of tissue under the skin. 'When you add heat to this muscle . layer it contracts and tightens,' says Esther. 'It is what plastic . surgeons do in theatre when performing a facelift. 'The heat also leaves a thermal coagulation point, or TCP, which will produce new collagen over the next three months. Collagen . production is also stimulated on the lower levels of the skin, meaning . there is an instant tightening and lifting effect.' With . a white make-up pencil, Esther marks out the zones on my face and neck . that she's going to treat before firing up the Ulthera machine. At . first, it feels fine, just a light prickling sensation and so I start . to relax a bit. But then she starts working on my cheeks. All I can say . is yeeeow! I know what you're thinking - that ultrasound is a gentle, comfortable thing, safe enough to be used to scan pregnant tummies - and so it is. 'At first, it feels fine, just a light prickling sensation and so I start to relax a bit. But then she starts working on my cheeks. All I can say is yeeeow' But when its waves are concentrated in a slightly different way, it becomes a different tool entirely. The . thing about pain is that everyone's threshold is different, and indeed . varies from day-to-day. I know if I'm tired, or had one too many glasses . of wine the night before, even having my legs waxed feels excruciating. I've tried a lot of beauty treatments . and, over the years, have graded them into a pain-scale ranging from . Botox (which rates at about a two - it's a series of tiny jabs and . really doesn't hurt) to having semi-permanent eyeliner tattooed along my . upper eyelash line (about a nine - intensely painful though also . mercifully quick). French women spend twice as much as British ladies on anti-ageing creams . Waxing, . I'd rate at about five. To begin with, Ulthera was a manageable three or . four, but it quickly rises to an agonising eight, causing me to screw . up my face and drum my heels on the couch. 'Try not to fight it,' says Esther soothingly. 'It makes it worse.' 'Maybe relax your shoulders,' adds Tracey, the publicist, who is watching. 'At least it's not as bad as childbirth.' 'Try deep breathing,' suggests Juliette, the photographer. So I attempt some of the focused breathing that I've been learning in yoga, which helps distract me a bit, until the next zzzp of ultrasound cuts me off mid-flow and we all get the giggles and start comparing birthing stories. I end up feeling a bit hysterical. We take a break and Esther hands me a . mirror. I'm amazed to find that already my jawline looks more taut, and . my whole cheek looks lifted on the side that has been treated. So only . one cheek's worth to go! By . now, I'm feeling fairly gung-ho, as I know we're nearly finished. I try . a more meditative approach to pain control, imagining I'm on a warm, . peaceful beach and that the flickering stabs from Esther cross-hatching . lines on my other cheek are happening somewhere else. Alice Hart-Davis, who tried the Ulthera and said she would do it again.... with Valium . The whole treatment takes the best part of an hour - it would have been longer, but thanks to prominent veins in my forehead, that area can't be treated (alas, as I was hoping for a quick brow-lift into the bargain). But I've still absorbed some 400 lines of ultrasound waves. I'm glad I didn't know how many there were before we started. And then I go home feeling a bit . spaced out from all the endorphins (the feel-good chemicals that the . body produces at times of stress or pain). Because the treatment works . below the skin's surface, there is no downtime. My . skin is a little red, but this goes within an hour, and the treated . areas feel stiff inside, as if the muscles have had a fearsome workout. I . think my jawline looks more defined than it did, but it will be months . until the full results show. So, . yes, I fear this is the most painful treatment you're likely to find. The question then is why would anyone submit themselves to this? Because . it works and the pain is fleeting. Would I do it again? For sure! Especially if I could get hold of some Valiumâ...

"A former Hollywood executive who quit his job in July after stills from a sex tape he allegedly starred in showed up on the internet is in the spotlight again after two more porn actresses claimed they were paid to perform with him in adult movies. Richard Nanula's alleged porn-scandal began when adult film actress Samantha Saint claimed she was booked for a job at a gated Malibu estate by Nanula, who co-starred and filmed the movie in which he asked to be called 'Mr Rich.' But since those career-destroying images appeared on website TheDirty.com, it has been alleged the X-rated shoot wasn't a one-off but a popular past time for the 53-year-old. Scandal: Richard Nanula, pictured, left allegedly hired adult film actress Samantha Saint, right, and other porn stars for jobs at his gated Malibu estate . Nanula, a Harvard MBA who was an executive at Disney and most recently chairman at Miramax, allegedly hired porn-stars Sarah Shevon and Penny Pax to perform with or for him. A friend of the showbiz hotshot told The New York Post: 'Now he's out of work, and his reputation is ruined.' The newspaper quotes another source as saying: 'Everyone in Hollywood is gossiping about how long Nanula has been up to this.' Saint claims she was paid $1,200 cash to star in the video and was told it would appear on fellow actress Trinity St. Clair's website. She added, according to The Post, that the cash was in a Colony Capital envelope, the parent company of Miramax. More movies: Nanula, a Harvard MBA who was an executive at Disney and most recently Miramax, allegedly hired porn-stars Sarah Shevon and Penny Pax, pictured, to perform with him . Cash money: Saint, right, claims she was paid $1,200 cash to star in the video and was told it would appear on fellow actress Trinity St. Clair's website while Shevon, left, said she was paid $300 for the scenes . The divorced father-of-three was . accused by his ex-wife Tracey Nanula in 2005 divorce papers of spending . thousands on prostitutes and was treated for sex addiction. Neither he nor his representatives have publicly denied he was the man in the pictures that appeared online. Sarah Shevon said her agent arranged the $300 sex scene, in which the actress was dressed in a schoolgirl-style skirt and white blouse knotted at her midriff, in April last year. She said when the pornographic pictures allegedly showing Nanula emerged this summer, she recognized the man as 'Mr Rich', according to the Los Angeles Times. Nanula resigned in the wake of the dirty stills emerging online. He was also reportedly embroiled in a work-related sexual . harassment suit. Nanula held top positions at Disney, biotech . juggernaut Amgen and was chairman of the board of . Miramax. Allegations: Sarah Shevon has claimed that she filmed an adult movie with Richard Nanula . Shevon claims the . job she was booked for was what is known in the industry as a 'private' - . an encounter between a porn star and a paying customer - and that it . was filmed so it would not be seen as a criminal act of . prostitution. She told the Los Angeles Times she never saw the finished video and did not know . whether it was posted on the website it was allegedly for. 'I don't like how there are these guys who have a lot of money and power . and they feel like they can just take advantage of girls or get . whatever they want out of them by throwing money at them,' she said. The . 29-year-old said her co-star was a well dressed man who filmed the . scene as well as taking part in it. She added it was clear he was . not a porn pro. She added that fellow actress Trinity St Clair had asked her to perform a private in a Malibu home two years ago, where she would be expected to perform oral sex, for $1,500. Suspicious: Sarah Shevon believes she was booked for a 'private' job . Shevon told the Los Angeles Times she declined the offer because 'it was prostitution.' However, . last year, her agent Mark Spiegler approached her with another offer in . Malibu, allegedly for a film on St Clair's website. St. Clair has declined to comment repeatedly, through her publicist, James Bartholet, according to a news agency. Dan . Miller, executive managing editor of a porn industry trade magazine, . told the Los Angeles Times that taping the encounter might have been . seen as a way to avoid breaking the law. 'The thinking would seem to be, ""OK, there is a camera there, it's a shoot"",' he said. Spiegler claimed that after Shevon's scene, St Clair booked two more of his clients for night shoots in Malibu with an actor allegedly identified as Richard. Because he did not know the actor, and said porn films are not typically shot at night, Spiegler asked to meet 'Richard.' He told the Los Angeles Times he believes the man he met in June 2012 was Nanula, adding: 'He didn't seem like a professional porn person.' After meeting the alleged actor, Spiegler cancelled the shoot, adding that the man's medical tests, which he reviewed, had come from a private doctor rather than the usual clinics porn actors go to. Thomas J. Barrack Jr, the billionaire founder of Colony who is now chairman of Miramax, declined to discuss Nanula's resignation. 'This is a personal matter for Richard and unrelated to Miramax,' he said in July. 'Richard did an excellent job at managing his business duties.' Variety had reported on June 26 that website theDirty.com had published photos it claimed showed Nanula engaged in sex acts with a porn star. Cured? Nanula, 2nd from right in 1997, reportedly entered a 6-day sex addiction rehab ten years ago that, he claimed in his divorce, had cured him . Sources for Variety said the photos . were the reason for the leave of absence Nanula recently took from . Miramax and Colony Capital, which owns a large stake in the . entertainment group. One of Colony Capital's largest investors, is Qatar Holding, the sovereign wealth fund of a conservative Muslim country. 'Richard . Nanula has taken a leave of absence from Colony and Miramax for . personal reasons,' Lisa Baker, a publicist with Owen Blicksilver PR, . which reps Colony, told Variety. Earlier, the New York Post reported a sexual harassment suit may be an additional reason for Nanula's leave of absence. 'Based on our investigation,' a Colony rep told Page Six, 'these matters are personal to Mr. Nanula, and it would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.' The harassment suit centers on a paralegal at Colony named Stephanie Shaw, who claims Nanula groped her buttocks in an 'unwelcome, extreme, and offensive' way back in early 2012 and filed suit in a Los Angeles court. Accused: A paralegal at Colony Capital, which has a major stake in Miramax, has filed a sexual harassment suit against Nanula claiming he groped her buttocks and that she was subsequently fired . Shaw, who was fired after less than a . year with the company, is also alleging wrongful termination, among . other wrongdoings. The court documents can be read in their entirety, here. Meanwhile, this isn't the first bit of funny business the executive has been accused of. Back in 2005, Nanula's then-wife Tracey filed for divorce. According to court papers, Tracey claimed she had found that Nanula had spent as much as $10,000 on prostitutes and traced his infidelities back to 2001. Tracey also indicated in her filing that Nanula had, at one time, completed a six-day rehab stint for sex addiction that he subsequently claimed had cured him. Tracey Nanula would not comment on the case. MailOnline had reached out to Miramax and Colony Capital, though neither had responded at the time of publication. Stepped down?

"The newly crown Miss Teen USA has now come forward with new details of the moment a hacker revealed himself and tried to extort her with nude photos he took using her own computer's webcam. Without her knowledge, the hacker could watch and photograph Cassidy Wolf, a 19-year-old who took the Miss Teen USA crown in early August. He contacted Wolf and threatened to go public with the photos unless she gave him a special 'performance.' Now the college freshman is speaking out against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach other young women how to avoid it. Scroll down for video . Revealed: Cyber crime victim and Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf gave new details on Today about her alleged 'sextortion' 'I was terrified,' she said Thursday in an interview with Today. 'I started screaming, bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a very terrifying moment.' Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.' 'You would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.' These are the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was crowned. Terrified: Wolf described her ordeal on Today, the same place she announced she is a victim of cyber crime just after her August crowning . Write caption here . But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title. 'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.' Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police. The FBI is now on the case. Sextortion: Wolf says the stalker used an anonymous email address and demanded sexual favors or else he'd release nude photos of her to the press . Instructive: Wolf told Today that she's trying her best to turn the negative experience into a learning experience she can share with others . The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime. 'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.' Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . Winner: She hopes to use her year-long reign to raise awareness of cyber-crimes after her own experience . Speaking to Today.com, . Wolf initially revealed the crime just after she beat 51 other young . women to take the Miss Teen USA title at a pageant in the . Bahamas. 'I was just a normal girl in high . school,' she said. Around four months ago, she was notified that someone had tried to log into her Facebook account from a different state, Today.com reported. She then received an anonymous email from a stranger saying he had photographs of her in her room that were taken when her computer's webcam was hacked. 'I wasn't aware that somebody was . watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera] . didn't even go on, so I had no idea.' She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'. Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . Targeted: Wolf received a message saying someone had photos of her taken through her webcame . She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked. 'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox. After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes. During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others. 'This next year Iâm just so excited to be able to share my story . and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said. Speaking out: Wolf, right, contacted authorities and her case is now under federal investigation . Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used. Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year. She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant on Saturday after just two years of competing in contests. 'I don't remember how I was feeling,' she said. 'I was crying, I was so happy.'","Cassidy Wolf wants to spread the word about sextortion .

"Hillary Clinton was given a raft of advice on how to soften the then first lady's stern schoolmarm images, according to documents buried in a 4,000 page dump of files released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. The previously secret paperwork shows Mrs Clinton's press secretary, Lisa Caputo, urging her in August 1995 to consider an appearance on the sitcom Home Improvement, a wedding anniversary photo spread for People magazine and a sit-down interview â with philandering husband Bill â across from Barbara Walters. 'This might be a nice time peg to have the President and Hillary do a special joint interview with Barbara Walters,' Caputo believed. 'If we did an interview around the anniversary time peg, it would not appear to be political.' Those were the days: Hillary Clinton's advisers wanted her to spearhead a love-fest media tour including special attention to the anniversary of her marriage to her philandering husband . Clinton's press secretary told her in 1995 -- the era of Netscape and dial-up AOL -- to prepare to reach the public 'through Internet' Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, floated a series of ideas designed to get positive press surrounding her wedding anniversary -- making it seem less political . Also on the plan was an interview with a women's magazine like Family Circle. 'Hillary should own the women's media,' Caputo wrote. And she urged the future senator and secretary of state to give People . magazine an exclusive photo collection from throughout the Clintons' marriage, including pictures snapped at 'a big party' held in honor of . the anniversary. 'I know this may sound like a wild idea, but I think it is an interesting one to discuss,' Caputo wrote of the prospect of lining up the president's wife opposite comedian Tim Allen on ABC's then-hit show Home Improvement. 'The outreach would be enormous and it would present Hillary in a very likeable light I believe. Although I have some concerns that it diminishes the role of First Lady by going on a tv sitcom, it is probably worth weighing it against what we believe we might be able to gain by such an appearance politically and image-wise.' Caputo's promotion of early online communications vehicles stands out, too. 'Hillary could speak to young women through Internet,' she wrote, dropping the word 'the.' 'I think Hillary would have fun with this, and I believe it would not be too difficult to organize.' The sudden publication of a portion of 33,000 pages of material came after reporters inquired why they weren't released in January 2013, at the end of a 12-year blackout period designed to protect outgoing presidents during their transition to private life. But the Obama White House doesn't appear interested in protecting Clinton's legacy, or the electoral viability of HIllary Clinton, choosing not to block the release of a single page. Awkward: Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald wrote in 1999 that she had to be prepared to answer reporters' questions about whether she had ever used drugs . Then-first lady Hillary Clinton is inextricably connected to her husband Bill's presidency, taking heat for her involvement in some of the scandals that put asterisks on his political achievements . Hillary's press secretary wanted her to appear on a sitcom opposite comedian Tim Allen . Judicial Watch, a right-leaning watchdog group that has demanded documents such as these through FOIA lawsuits for years, claimed victory on Friday. 'These documents are a long-time coming,' said the organization's president, Tom Fitton. 'It took critical news stories and Judicial Watch lawsuits (and the threat of Judicial Watch lawsuits) to extract this latest batch of documents after an inexcusable delay. The Clinton administration was rife with secrecy and corruption, so any new bits of information may be important.Â  Weâve been battling for some of this material for nearly a decade.' Mrs. Clinton, who is already the Democrats' 2016 presidential front-runner, . figures prominently in much of the material. She spearheaded an . ill-fated effort in 1993 and 1994 to reorganize the nation's health care . system, an unusually policy-heavy role for the wife of a U.S. president. And as she prepared in 1999 to run for U.S. Senate in New York, adviser Mandy Grunwald wrote in a memo that she needed to be humorous and relaxed while answering questions at public events. Look for opportunities for humor,' she wrote. 'It's important that people see more sides of you, and they often see you only in very stern situations.' Grunwald also cautionedÂ  Clinton â using quote marks â to ""be careful to 'be real'"".' It's all in there: Jeff Shesol, a Bill Clinton speechwriter, was a serious doodler, proving that boring strategy meetings can even happen in the Oval Office . The Clinton Library put out boxes of previously unseen materials on Friday, but more reporters found the documents online . As she gears up . for what nearly everyone in Washington expects will be a brutal 2016 . election, her involvement in 'Hillarycare' is making the rounds once . again. Hillary's scandal-plagued time in the White House will likely make repeated appearance in 2016 campaign ads and presidential debates. She was embroiled in a series of controversies while living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, including a scandal involving the hiring of Craig Livingstone, a former nightclub bouncer and 'advance' man for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign as director of the White House Office of Personnel Security. That office, a House panel learned in 1996, failed to perform background checks on most White House workers, and improperly obtained FBI files covering many appointees and employees of theÂ  Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. Hillary Clinton was also the driving force behind the first national scandal attached to her husband's presidency, the so-called 'travelgate' fiasco. In 1996 a memo surfaced publicly that identified her as the main instigator in a plan to dismiss the entire staff of the White House Travel Office â civil servants who served both Democratic and Republican administrations â and replace them with friends of the Clintons. While Mrs. Clinton manicured her image as a supportive wife during the 1990s, her direct involvement in a series of scandals -- and her hands-on management of the ill-fated ""Hillarycare"" program -- painted a picture of a far more ambitious woman . Billy Dale, the office's director at . the time, had served there since 1961. He was later acquitted of charges . that he embezzled from travel funds, successfully arguing that he had . set aside money in her personal for gratuities and other off-books . expenses required when the president travels. An Obama administration official has told Politico that . the White House 'cleared a significant number of P2/P5 Clinton . documents ... roughly 25,000 pages,' referring to the transparency . exceptions outlined in sections P2 and P5 of the Presidential Records . Act. 'There have been no executive privilege assertions on Clinton materials to date,' said the aide. The Presidential Records Act spells out the rules covering memos and other communications produced inside the Executive Office of the President, setting a 12-year period after which those records are subject to the same rules as other government papers under the Freedom Of Information Act. But Congress created an exception and decided the the White House could cite executive privilege to block any document from public view after the 12 years have expired. Bill and Hillary in their shaggier hippie days -- did she use drugs? Adviser Many Grunwald was worried it might come up when she ran for the U.S. Senate in New York . The fact that the administration has chosen to leave everything in plain view could spell trouble for Hillary Clinton, who fought an often brutal 2008 presidential primary campaign against Obama before accepting the secretary of state role as a consolation prize in 2009. Clinton-bashers on both her right and left flanks will look to Friday's release for ammunition to use in both the 2016 primary season and the general election â if she should choose to run, and if she manages to maintain her heir-apparent status in the Democratic Party. And the new records could drive down public perceptions of her in the all-important 'integrity' category. A Siena Polling Institute survey of historians this year found that although she ranked sixth among former first ladies overall, but a dismal 21st out of 39 for honesty and integrity. 'Trustworthiness was never the Clintons' long suit,' University of Virginia Center for Politics Director Larry Sabato told MailOnline last week. Yet some Republicans, including moderate Senator John McCain, see Hillary's ascendency to the White House as inevitable if she chooses to grab the brass ring. 'As much as I hate to admit it ... right now, if the election were tomorrow, Hillary Clinton would most likely be the president of the United States,' McCain told CNN's Piers Morgan last week. Yesterday during a breakfast event in Washington, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a much-talked-about GOP presidential hopeful aligned with tea party conservatives, said Mrs. Clinton presided over an Obama administration foreign policy that has been an absolute debacle â¦ alienating allies and cozying up to enemies.' She has been 'consistently wrong on domestic policy and foreign policy,' Cruz said. The Clinton Library in Arkansas released more than 4,000 pages of documents from the 1993-2001 Bill Clinton White House, including a series of bombshell revelations. Hillarycare: . Technology: .

"MSNBC host Alex Wagner said Thursday morning that Democratic politicians are treading lightly around Hillary Clinton out of fear that failure to enthusiastically endorse her could bring dire consequences. âThe fear mongering around the Clintons [is] like, âDon't cross them, otherwise a door in the floor opens up,' she said. Clinton, along with her husband the former president, reportedly build an 'enemies list' after she failed to win the Democrats' presidential nomination in 2008, keeping tabs on all the people they believed had betrayed her by siding with Barack Obama. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . MSNBC host Alex Wagner joked about what some Democrats consider a deadly serious subject: the political repercussions of crossing the Clintons . Hillary Clinton is the darling of the political left but may face token -- or real -- opposition from other Democrats if she runs in 2016, but some will fear her political revenge machine . âI think there's been a lot of reporting about the lists they keep,' Wagner said. 'And we are led to believe that there is this kind of Clinton Industrial Complex where names are kept, sins are recorded. Whether or not they are poring over those notes, you know, on a nightly basis would be very much up to the Clintons.' 'There's a feeling that you have to kind of plant your flag firmly for the Clintons,' she added. 'Especially now.' The 2008 enemies list focused mostly on members of Congress, and rated them on a scale of 1 (most helpful0 to 7 (most treacherous). Those with '7' ratings included John Kerry, now the secretary of state; the late Sen. Ted Kennedy; and current Democratic Sens. Jay Rockefeller, Claire McCaskill and Bob Casey. According . to the book 'HRC: State Secrets and the Rebirth of Hillary Clinton,' published in February, Clinton staffers would often joke about how . black-marked pols ended up ending their careers in disgrace. In 'HRC,' reporters Jonathan Allen and Aimie Parnes recount the construction and use of an 'enemies' list after Clinton's failed 2008 primary campaign . 'Bill Richardson: investigated; John Edwards: disgraced by scandal; Chris Dodd: stepped down; ... Ted Kennedy: dead,' an aide once joked, the book claims. Wagner's comments followed an interview of Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who supported Obama eight years ago and was among the first to urge him to run for the White House. NBC News Chief White House Correspondent Chuck Todd asked Reid whether Clinton should have to endure a contentious primary season if she decides to run for president. A cautious Reid agreed without directly criticizing the former secretary of state. 'Do you think it would be better for Secretary Clinton if she had a serious Democratic rival?' Todd asked. 'I believe that the primary with Obama and Clinton was an extremely helpful process,' Reid responded. 'I think it was wonderful.'","Hillary and Bill Clinton are known in Washington for being vindictive against people on their 'enemies list'

"An Alabama Democrat representative has said that white people would force their child to have an abortion if the father was black. Rep. Alvin Holmes made the comments during a debate on a bill in the Alabama state house which would see the state implement the toughest abortion laws in the U.S. Targeting Republican lawmakers, Holmes claimed that '99 per centâ of white representatives who are against abortion would change their mind âif their daughter got pregnant by a black manâ. Controversial speech: Democrat Rep. Alvin Holmes said '99 per cent' of white Republicans who are anti abortion would force their daughter to have one if she got pregnant by a black man . Democrat Holmes, first elected in 1974, said that ânot one in 100,000â white people would allow their daughter to have a mixed-race baby. âIf you asked the people in here now to raise their hands, of those who are against abortion, 99 per cent of all of the white people in here gonna raise their hand that they are against abortion,â Rep Holmes said during the debate. âOn the other hand, 99 per cent of the whites that are sitting in here now, if they daughter got pregnant by a black man, they gonna make their daughter have an abortion. They ainât gonna let her have the baby. â . A recording of his speech, published by Birmingham News, also includes Rep Holmes turning to an unnamed white female representative asking her if she would âallowâ her child to have a mixed-race baby. When the womanâs reply is positive, he retorts: âWell, I need to commend you then.

Republican Mary Sue McClurkin  compared her bill, which bans abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, to landmark court case Brown vs. Board of Education .

Bill sponsor Republican Representative. Mary Sue McClurkin said Tuesday that a heartbeat is universally accepted as an indication of life. She later compared her bill to Brown vs. Board of Education, the court case which ended the legal segregation of public schools in 1954. If the bill wins approval, the legislation that moves next to the Senate would tie Alabama with North Dakota as having the most stringent abortion law in the country. It is a direct challenge to the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable. Opponents called the bill blatantly unconstitutional. North Dakota approved a similar law last year, but a federal judge put it on hold while the legal challenge plays out in court.","Democrat say 'whites would force daughter to abort baby if father is black'

"A revealing new map has made it clear where hundreds of hate groups are based in the United States, showing how racist and radical groups are still largely found in the South but the number of groups has multipliedÂ  dramatically since President Obama too office. The Southern Poverty Law Center has released a 'hate map' last week which shows the national distribution of the various groups that they could confirm. The overall number of groups actually dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013- the last full year with available data- but one of their more troubling observations is that some of the far-right leaning groups have had their ideologies picked up by conservative Republican politicians. California has the most hate groups with 77 in the state but the majority is still largely found in the southeast of the country . Growing trend: The number of hate groups jumps during Democratic administrations but particularly during that of President Obama . âThe idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has . infiltrated the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland . Security, among others, is being plugged by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann . (R-Minn.). Last November, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) suggested . the president was using the Affordable Care Act as cover to set up a . âsecret security force,ââ the report states. âEarlier in 2013, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), echoing many Patriot groups, falsely claimed that a proposed United Nations arms treaty âset the stage for [gun] confiscation on a global scale.ââ The SPLC, which focuses much of its work combating racist groups, said that the lack of clear legislative victories for the Obama administration on gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook and the upcoming immigration reform battle appear to have effectively calmed some of the far-right groups. âThose factors, along with the . collapse or near-collapse of several major groups for a variety of . reasons, seem to have taken some of the wind out of the sails of the . radical right, leaving the movement both weaker and somewhat smaller,â the report states. Many . states have varying bands of hate groups, but for their map, the SPLC . qualified them into eight categories: black separatist, neo-confederate, . Christian identity, racist skinhead, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, Ku . Klux Klan and general hate. There . is only one state- Hawaii- that has no known hate groups but a vast . majority of the rest can be found below the Mason Dixon line. The . 11 states that make up the area between Texas and the Atlantic are home . to 589 of the 939 active groups that the SPLC identified- a whopping . nearly 63 per cent. Though Florida hosts 58 groups and Texas has 57, they do not take the top slot this year. California . actually made the top of the list, which comes as a bit of a surprise . given the large immigrant population in the state and the fact that . unlike the South, it does not have a history of slavery. Face of the uprising: Members of the National Socialist Movement are seen at a rally near Los Angeles, and like many far right groups, they are campaigning against immigration . Dropping slightly: The number of groups in the U.S. dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013 . The . California-based American Freedom Party that was originally founded by . racist skinheads group in Southern California is one of the top two . groups that the SPLC have flagged up as particularly threatening. They have stepped up their rhetoric against immigrants and in support of 'the interests of white Americans'. 'They . have for years, been running in political elections and haven't done . all that well.

"Study showed 10 out of 11 females experienced visible improvements to their skin . 7 out of 11 saw an improvement in their wrinkles . Watercress contains more . vitamin C than oranges, four times more beta-carotene and vitamin A than apples, tomatoes and broccoli . If you want to roll back the years, forget expensive lotions and potions and instead reach for something more natural (and cheap): a bag of watercress. The old adage of beauty coming from within has been borne out by a new study in which 10 out of 11 female volunteers experienced visible improvements to their skin after just four weeks of adding one bag of watercress a day to their diet. One woman even managed to reduce her facial wrinkles by an incredible 39 per cent. Forget expensive creams, a recent study shows that adding one bag of watercress a day to your diet can improve your skin tone and reduce wrinkles . The women, who ranged in age from 23 to 58, began the trial by having their faces photographed using a VISIA complexion analysis system which gives a subsurface reading of an individualâs skin and focuses on wrinkles, texture (the balance between oily and dry areas) pores, UV spots, brown spots, red areas (any underlying redness, inflammation, sensitivity or thinner skin) and porphyrins (levels of bacteria on the skin). â¢Â Â Â  10 out of 11 volunteers saw a positive improvement in their skin . â¢Â Â Â  7 out of 11 saw an improvement in their wrinkles . â¢Â Â Â  8 out of 11 saw an improvement in the texture* of their skin . â¢Â Â Â  9 out of 11 saw an improvement in their pores . â¢Â Â Â  5 out of 11 saw an improvement in their red areas . â¢Â Â Â  8 out of 11 saw an improvement in the levels of porphyrins . â¢Â Â Â  5 out of 11 saw an improvement in their brown spots . â¢Â Â Â  3 out of 11 saw an improvement in their UV spots . After four weeks of eating 80g of watercress a day the volunteers had their skin reassessed by the VISIA camera, and the results were extremely positive. The majority of women also reported increased energy levels. During the trial the volunteers made no other changes to their usual health and beauty regime. They were allowed to eat their daily quota of watercress in any way they chose â in salads, sandwiches, whizzed into smoothies or wilted into pasta, however it was not allowed to be cooked. One of the success stories of the study was Ruth McKechnie, 54, a theatre training teacher from Cambridge who saw a 39 per cent improvement in her wrinkles, 13 per cent improvement in her skin texture, 5 per cent per cent reduction in brown spots and 18 per cent improvement in her levels of bacteria. She said: 'Iâm absolutely thrilled with the results of the trial and astounded at how my skin has improved in almost every aspect. 'It feels smoother to touch, looks plumper and best of all my wrinkles have reduced! I had a particularly stressful few weeks at work and thought it would have a negative effect on my skin so to see such an improvement really is impressive. 'I have also felt more energised and generally healthier which has helped me deal with the stress. Watercress will certainly be top of my shopping list from now onwards.' Throughout history, eminent philosophers and doctors have revered the health boosting properties of watercress from the pharaohs in Egypt and the ancient Greeks, to the Romans and Anglo-Saxons. Now, sophisticated science techniques have confirmed folklore beliefs. Philosophers and doctors have raved about the benefits of watercress for years . Dr Sarah Schenker, a leading nutritionist and dietician who oversaw the study, said: 'Watercress is a rich source of beta carotene needed to quench free radicals, which can cause damage to skin cells. 'However, in order to work properly a high concentration of Vitamin C is also needed to complete this process and watercress again has this in abundance. 'In addition watercress contains Vitamin E which is also important for skin health.Â  It is this powerhouse of nutrients and the chain reaction in which they work together which is so important for maintaining good skin.' There are plenty of delicious ways that watercress can be incorporated into your diet . Sarah added: 'This study confirms that diet is an important aspect of beauty. Eating plenty of plant foods including watercress cannot only help to slow down the ageing of our skin, but may actually reverse some of the effects of damage.' Watercress Alliance member Dr. Steve Rothwell, who holds a PhD in watercress explained: 'There have been a whole host of scientific studies that have shown that B Carotene can help reduce the ageing of skin, so we were encouraged to carry out our own small pilot study using fresh watercress. 'We were delighted with the results of the new pilot study which may now be used to secure funding for a larger scale university research programme, as the findings have proved so conclusive.' Gram for gram, watercress contains more . vitamin C than oranges, four times more beta-carotene and vitamin A than apples, tomatoes and broccoli, more vitamin E than . broccoli, more calcium than whole milk and more iron than spinach. It . also contains lutein and zeaxanthin (45 times that of tomatoes and more . than triple the amount in broccoli). It is also the richest dietary . source of PEITC (phenylethyl isothiocyanate) which research suggests can . fight cancer.","Study showed 10 out of 11 females experienced visible improvements to their skin .

"Twin girls who have been on a primary school waiting list for four years could be separated because the school both want to go to refuses to buy an extra chair for a teaching assistant their father has claimed. Mia and Hannah Hendry, aged seven, have been on the waiting list at the All Saints Church of England school in Carshalton since they were three, due to the huge pressure on primary school places in London. Mia was recently offered a place at the Sutton School but her parents had to reject it as it was mean separating the two girls, they said. Facing separation: Twins Mia (left) and Hannah Hendry, pictured with their parents Phil Hendry and his wife Krassy, face being split up . Sister Hannah was then offered a place at the same school as she was next on its waiting list, but her family had to make the same decision in a bid to keep the twins together. This evening, the twins' father Phil, a TV producer, said that the school had a policy that meant that pupils sat in tables of six, but with class numbers limited to 35. Mr Hendry said that the final chair is used by a teaching assistant, and that the school is refusing to buy an extra for the assistant to sit on so the class can be expanded to 36 to cater for the twins. Mr Hendry added that when he threatened the school with a judicial review at the High Court they claimed they were willing to take the fight there. He added: 'The schoolâs unwillingness to find a way to keep our twins together, having known of their existence for the years weâve sat patiently on the waiting list, is a source of deep and lasting regret that is already turning to bitterness and anger.' He added: 'I feel I owe it to all parents of twins and multiple birth to highlight what has happened to us and to fight for a proper legal right for twins to be schooled together.' Reverend Dr John Thewlis, Chairman of Governors at All Saints Carshalton Church of England Primary School said:'The school places issue is not to do with the number of chairs in a class room. It is due to the pressure on places, on physical space, and the fact that the class size is already 35. If the situation could have been solved by purchasing a simple chair, this certainly would have been done.' Hannah and Mia currently go to school together . in Lambeth where the family lived before moving to Sutton, and face a . seven-mile journey to school. Councillor Kirsty Jerome, executive member for education and schools at Sutton council, said: âWe appreciate Mr Hendryâs frustration and wish it were possible to offer both twins a place but Sutton has some of the best schools in the country and this is a very popular school. 'Finding two spaces in one year group at All Saints is very rare so itâs not always possible for parents who move during the school year to get a place at their first choice school. The twins have been offered separate places at All Saints Church of England Primary School in Carshalton, but cannot attend together . 'Weâve invested millions to cope with Londonâs baby boom and this school is one of the five primary schools we are expanding this year.â Schools in Sutton are among the most overcrowded, with 26 primary schools full to capacity, teaching 415 more pupils than they should be. Elsewhere, Brindishe Lee school in Lewisham has 239 pupils but just 155 official places. Galliard primary in Enfield is 30 per cent over capacity, with 661 pupils for 510 official places. The Islamia primary school in Brent has 391 students, but officially has 210 places. Latest figures show that 514 primary schools in London are facing similar problems, and are either full or already over capacity. The number of children needing a school place in London is expected to grow by 100,000 over the next five years. Evening Standard research reveals some of the most popular primary schools in the capital are coping with huge demand for places by taking more children than they have capacity for. New figures show that 428 primary schools are over capacity and are taking an extra 8,000 pupils too many between them. Some are squeezing in 100 extra pupils or more to cope with demand.","Mia and Hannah Hendry denied place at same school .

"A schoolboy hanged himself after he was falsely branded a rapist by fellow pupils after pulling out of a playground drug dealing racket, an inquest heard. Tom Acton, 16, claimed that he was bullied into taking Ecstasy, amphetamines and cocaine in between lessons â yet when his mother, Gaynor, went to see staff at the 1,700 pupil Poynton High School and Performing Arts College in Cheshire, it was alleged that they refused to do anything about it. When she withdrew the boy from school, false rumours began circulating which alleged the innocent teenager had tied a girl to a tree then sexually assaulted her. Tragic: Tom Acton three month before he killed himself after being bullied by fellow pupils at Poynton High School, Cheshire . It resulted in mobs of up to 30 angry youths targeting him in the street and turning up at the familyâs front door saying they wanted to kill him and âget rid of the verminâ. Tom began to self-harm with a blade and even carved the word ârapistâ into his leg. A friend had to stop him jumping from a railway bridge and he considered stepping into the path of heavy traffic. On October 31, days before he was due to testify at the trial of one of the bullies, Tom was found hanged in his bedroom by his father. The family home of Tom Acton in Poynton, Cheshire. After being called a rapist on Facebook, Tom hanged himself here in October 2013 . Taken to Stepping Hill Hospital, he died on November 2. Tomâs organs were used to save the lives of eight people.The tragedy occurred just months after Tom gained nine GCSEs. At an inquest in Warrington, Gaynor Acton questioned why the school refused to accept that they had a problem with drugs â even though the suspected drug dealer's own mother gave staff a similar story. Mrs Acton, 45, a former company director . of a hydraulics firm said that her son had been bullied into taking . drugs within the school and had started taking them in 2009. Tom Acton and his mother Gaynor. She believes that his school, Poynton High School and Performing Arts College in Cheshire, did not do enough to tackle drug taking among pupils . She added: âTom was getting beat up a lot, being chased a lot, physically and mentally abused on a daily basis. âThere were lots of police incidents recorded, school records. I tried working with the school to start with but the school wouldn't do anything about it, the next line was the police who again did nothing about it. âHe was on Class A drugs that had been supplied to him from the lads inside of school, MDMA, amphetamines, cocaine, tablets. The only way we could get him to stop was to take him out of school; we took him out for three months.â Asked by a coroner if he had explained to her why he took the drugs, Mrs Acton added: âBecause if he didn't he would get bullied â if he did what everyone else did they would leave him alone. âOur doctor wrote to the school about peer pressure. But because he wasn't in school taking the drugs that's when they put it out on Facebook that he was a rapist.â Tom Acton in his bedroom in December 2012. He was accused of being a rapist and gangs of youth came up to his front door threatening to kill him . She said Tom had first started talking about suicidal thoughts in February 2013 and added: âThere were lots of times when he said he was going to do something. He never showed me any of the self-harm. It was only what he had told me. He just couldn't sleep. âTom couldn't have a girlfriend because he was 'a rapist'. That's how the rest of the people saw him in Poynton. He loved going out with girls before the rapist allegations.â She also confessed to buying cannabis for Tom in an effort to help his recurring insomnia. Dr David Ward, Tom's GP, said: âHe told me that he was the victim of bullying and other children had offered him drugs and cigarettes. He said he was being intimidated by a school pupil that was actively seeking him out and verbally and physically abusing him. âHis mum alleged they were spreading rumours that he was a dirty rapist â he was struggling to concentrate and his mood was low. He described it as being dead inside. In July 2013, she said Tom left Poynton and began studying music production and sound technology at South Manchester Collegeâ but had never got over the false rape allegations. Tom attended Poynton High School and Performing Arts College in Cheshire leaving in July 2013. His mother Gaynor claims that Tom was forced to take Class A drugs at the school . âHe was very excited about leaving school, he couldn't wait to get away from it,â said his mother. âHe was ecstatic that he was leaving school and he wouldn't have to go back. âThe bullies didn't know how to get to him since he left school. âBut as regards the rape allegations, he was very upset and he never actually got over that. It was always on his mind. âI want to know, why, when presented with physical evidence of drug taking in the school, the school refused to accept it had a problem and no action was taken.â Holly Spicer, Tom's ex-girlfriend, told the hearing: âAbout one month or so before his death I was talking to him in the kitchen and he was talking about the rapist allegations. âHe said he cut 'rapist' into his leg and also showed the marks on his wrist. He said he was sorry, I can't quite remember why. He spoke how he was beginning to believe the rumours himself.â Tom was left bleeding after being attacked by bullies (left) Another friend Jake Dwight said that Tom had been feeling worried about testifying against teenager Thomas Greenwood, 18, who gave him a hiding whilst shouting: âIf I see you, you are dead.â Jake said: âI knew he was very worried about the upcoming case. âA couple of people sat at the gates waiting for him, his mother had to pick him up. Tom's father Paul, a mechanical electrical manager, was asked if Tom had been anxious about the court case and he said: âNot for himself. We had spoken about it. I had asked him during the week if he was still okay with it and he said he was a bit nervous.â He added that he had become a âprisoner in his houseâ for three years before his death because of the rumours.

"Contacts in the Gulf: Financier Amanda Staveley, who was once Prince Andrew's girlfriend and is seen here pictured in 2004 - brokered big deals in Qatar . Barclays is being investigated over Â£12billion of investment from Middle East royals that saved it from being nationalised. The bank â already reeling from a string of scandals â admitted that City watchdogs were looking at four of its employees, including finance chief Chris Lucas. The Financial Services Authority is concerned about massive investments made in Barclays by the royal families of Qatar and Abu Dhabi during the depths of the banking crisis in 2008. The deals were masterminded by two . of the worldâs most powerful financiers, Prince Andrewâs former . girlfriend Amanda Staveley and Roger Jenkins, who is dating supermodel . Elle Macpherson. Miss . Staveley, herself a former model, has built up an unrivalled . relationship with some of the Gulfâs wealthiest and most powerful . investors. It was she who brokered Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansourâs Â£210million purchase of Manchester City Football Club. She . also acted as the sheikhâsÂ  go-between when he invested Â£3.5billion in . Barclays, and her company, PCP Capital Partners, is estimated to have . made some Â£40million on that deal alone. Mr Jenkins, whose worth is estimated . at Â£300million, brought Â£4.5billion of investment from Qatar, earning . himself an estimated Â£30million in the process. He was later part of a . group that raised another Â£4billion from Qatar. The . deals helped Barclays avoid the fate of rivals such as Royal Bank of . Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, which were forced into state . ownership in the credit crunch. There . was controversy at the time, because it was claimed the Middle Eastern . investors were getting a better return on their money than ordinary . shareholders could expect. But the FSA investigation centres on . fees paid for âadvisory servicesâ by Qatar Investment Authority to . Barclays in the Middle Eastâ as part of the deals. It . is understood that the regulator is concerned by a lack of transparency . around what advice the Qataris were offering Barclays and what they . were being paid for it. Amanda Staveley, right, with Ali Jassim, adviser to Manchester City owner Sheik Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nayhan . Old hand: Amanda Staveley  in 2001 meeting the Duke of York, who she once dated . The FSA's concerns focus on the Qatari investment suggesting Mr Jenkins is at the centre of the probe. Chairman Marcus Agius was cagey about the latest probe, the disclosure of which came as Barclays unveiled a 13 per cent rise in profit during the first half of the year to Â£4.2billion. âInvestigations like this happen frequently,â he said. âTypically they are not disclosed or made public at all. The fact itâs being disclosed is at our request because one of the four people named is our finance director.â But he refused to offer any more detail, repeatedly saying âEnough!â when asked for more information. The bankâs reputation has sunk to an all-time low after a series of mis-selling scandals and revelations that it had artificially manipulated the Libor rate used by banks to lend money to each other. Probe: The FSa are also investigating  Roger Jenkins, pictured above with his supermodel girlfriend Elle Macpherson in Ibiza in June . Finance chief Mr Lucas is the last man standing of Barclaysâ former top three: Chief executive Bob Diamond fell on his sword over the Libor scandal and while Mr Agius reversed his initial resignation over the same matter, he is due to step down as soon as a replacement can be found.

"A Michigan woman accused of lying for years about having cancer was convicted on Thursday in a separate case of falsely accusing two men of rape. The jury took less than 30 minutes to convict Sara Ylen after a three-day trial in St. Clair County, 60 miles northeast of Detroit. Ylen was charged with making up a story of two men attacking her in her Lexington home in 2012. Ylen, 38, was also convicted of tampering with evidence after police said she used makeup to create what looked like bruises. She did not testify in her own defense. Trading Places: Sara Ylen (left) was convicted on Thursday of falsely accusing two rapists--a third of her victims James Grissom (right) was imprisoned for 10 years for her fabricated rape claim . Ylen's story resembled a 'cheap novel,' prosecutor Suzette Samuels told jurors. 'She's lying through her teeth. ... This was unreal,' Samuels said. In final remarks, defense attorney David Heyboer said police did not follow up on other leads and didn't go to Ylen's house for a close examination of what took place. Judge Daniel Kelly revoked Ylen's bond and sent her to jail to await sentencing on Jan. 17. Her legal problems, however, are far from over. Ylen faces trial on Feb. 4 in neighboring Sanilac County, where she's charged with fraud and false pretenses for claiming she had cancer. Her story raised eyebrows: Ylen claimed she was raped in a parking lot in broad daylight and in her recent rape claim she used cosmetics to create bruises . Ylen received months of hospice care and thousands of dollars from sympathetic supporters, but there's no evidence that she had cancer, according to the state police. The criminal cases have stunned people here in the eastern Michigan area known as the Thumb. Ylen is well-known locally after talking to the Port Huron Times Herald years ago for a series of stories about being a rape victim. She said she was attacked in daylight in the parking lot of a Meijer store, a major retailer. The man she accused, James Grissom, insisted he was innocent. He served about a decade in prison before his 2003 conviction was overturned last year based on new evidence about Ylen's credibility. All eyes on Sara: Grissom was convicted or raping Ylen in 2001 and spent 10 years in prison--her recent false claim that two men raped in her 2012 was too much for Grissom to ignore . James Grissom, an off-duty Meijer . employee with a past sex-related conviction, was charged after Ylen said . her attacker, like Grissom, had a skull tattoo. Readers inspired by 'Sara's Story', as the series was titled, started a fund to send her to community college. But . it didn't take long for Ylen's story to start unraveling. Authorities . learned she claimed to have been kidnapped and raped while visiting her . parents in Bakersfield, California, just months after the alleged . parking lot attack back in Michigan. No charges were filed. Grissom was a spectator this week during Ylen's false rape trial. 'Strange. The last time I was coming down to this courtroom I had handcuffs on,' Grissom told the Times Herald. ""I figured I had to be here, just to see what she gets away with and what she don't.' Ylen's community, which had come to . admire her as the subject of a newspaper's award-winning 2003 series . about surviving a rape, rallied when her cancer diagnosis became public. Churches sold Super Bowl sub sandwiches and auction items to raise . money. Friends cut her grass. One of her close friends, Carol Connell, spoke of the gift she gave Ylen, in a bid to help give her hope in her time of need. 'It . was a little box, a very ornate box, to hold a prayer. She needed God . to look over her,' Connell said, recalling the 2008 lunch when she gave . Ylen the jewelry. 'Sara was visibly touched.' Connell now can't help but wonder whether Ylen was showing gratitude or simply perpetuating years of jaw-dropping deceit. Always the victim: Sara's ex-husband discovered his wife was lying when she wouldn't let him visit her in the hospital despite driving for miles . 'The . fact that she's lived this long is a miracle. But maybe it wasn't a . miracle after all. ... I'm just baffled. Is she the biggest con artist . in the state of Michigan or the victim?' Connell said. She . claimed she was a patient at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in . Zion, Ill., but the hospital said Ylen never was treated there. During . pre-trial hearings, prosecutors disclosed forged documents with . University of Michigan medical center letterhead. Just about a year ago, Ylen was in a wheelchair at a Croswell Wesleyan Church auction and spaghetti dinner that raised $10,800. Here for the show: 'Strange. The last time I was coming down to this courtroom I had handcuffs on,' Grissom told the Times Herald. ""I figured I had to be here, just to see what she gets away with and what she don't' 'I . thought I was doing something good for someone who had cancer. It's . like a bad Lifetime movie,' said event organizer Sue Birtles. 'I've heard that some people want their money back. ... I'm working on forgiveness.' Mercy . Hospice, which visited Ylen at her home, declined to comment on her . care but said in a statement that any terminal illness typically 'must . be certified' by a patient's doctor before services are provided. Ylen's . ex-husband, Jim, declined to comment on the criminal charges against . his former wife, but divorce records indicate he had long doubted her . tales of woe. The couple were married in 1993, separated in 2007 and divorced in 2011. Judge Daniel Kelly found her guilty as charged and sent Sara to Jail until her sentencing on January 17th . Time to think: Sara will serve jail time for her actions and will anyone feel sorry for her? The . marriage 'broke down due to the wife's complex lies and deceit . involving fictitious rapes, kidnappings, pregnancies and illnesses â all . attempts to control others by complaining of physical symptoms,' Jim . Ylen's attorney, Aaron Cassell, said in a court filing. Sara . Ylen told her husband the name of her cancer doctor, but he later . learned there was no physician by that name in Michigan, Cassell said. And . she wouldn't let him join her at medical appointments, even after . driving hundreds of miles to Cancer Treatment Centers of America in . Zion, Ill. Psychologist Daniel Kachman evaluated . Ylen as part of the divorce case and told the judge: 'Often feeling . dependent and dejected and fearful of rebuff, she may either withdraw . from painful social relationships or decide to adapt the role of . martyr.' Mike Connell, the newspaper columnist, said he regrets not treating his own doubts more seriously. 'Sara . is innocent until proven guilty, but if she did pull off an elaborate . con, consider what genius it required,' he said in an email. 'She has a brilliant mind. I recognized that straightaway.'","Sara Ylen was charged with making up a story of two men attacking her in her Lexington home in 2012 .

"Organisers of a Newtown children's choir that has appeared on Good Morning America are facing accusations they have misled the public - as the group has no formal connection to Sandy Hook. While the Newtown Music Project features a handful of children from the school, it is organised independently and led by a teacher who quit her job at a Newtown high school after she was accused of theft. The choir, which has recorded a single of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' to raise money for the town, will appear on the Grammy's this weekend. It is a separate choir from the Sandy Hook Elementary School choir that performed alongside Jennifer Hudson at the Super Bowl last weekend. On Thursday, the school district superintendent Janet Robinson voiced misgivings about the choir during an appearance on CNN after parents called her office with their concerns. Scroll down for video of the choir . Questions: The children from the Newtown Music Project are seen singing on Good Morning America last month. The group does not have anything to do with Sandy Hook Elementary School . They had complained about Sabrina Post, who is leading the choir and runs a performing arts studio in the town, and her history with the school system, Robinson said. Post had been the choral director at Newtown High before she was charged with stealing through bogus expense vouchers and placed on leave in February 2005. She resigned in June 2005 after agreeing to pay the school board $11,000, the Hartford Courant reported. Robinson said parents were also confused whether the choir had been to the Super Bowl. Those students do attend the school where a gunman killed 20 students and six women on December 14. 'I just know that I've got a lot of . people saying, ""They're on Good Morning America. These aren't our . kids,' Robinson said. 'Why are they using this name?' In charge: Some parents have expressed concern that Sabrina Post, pictured, leads the choir as she was accused several years ago of theft. She has insisted it is all above board . Disgruntled: School district Superintendent Janet Robinson said parents are unhappy about Post's part . But Post said Good Morning America contacted her to organise the children's choir after learning she was a popular private music teacher working in the town. 'Everything is done by the book,' said Post, who is not paid for working with the choir. Last month, the choir featured on the show, with many of the children saying they were desperate to do anything that would lift the spirits of the town. The youngsters, who range from kindergarten to 8th grade, performed 'Over the Rainbow'. They recorded the song with Ingrid Michaelson, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz of Talking Heads, and copies are being sold on Amazon to raise funds for the Newtown Youth Academy. Second choir: It is not the same choir as the one which sang with Jennifer Hudson at the Super Bowl . Emotional moment: The children at the Super Bowl are all students at Sandy Hook Elementary School . Devoted: The children, from kindergarteners to 8th graders, have recording a single with Ingrid Michaelson to raise money for the town. They said they wanted to help the victims' families . The choir has since sung the national . anthem at a recent New York Knicks game and will appear live via . satellite at the Grammy Awards on Sunday. 'We're . not doing it so we can sing on Grammys, though that's nice,' Post told . the Courant. 'Weâre doing it because we know we're doing . something good for the town. 'I think itâs wonderful that the kids are being asked to give for kids, . and using their music and talent to help other kids.' The choir is also scheduled to perform at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in April. New . York producer Tim Hayes, who produced the Over the Rainbow project, has . defended Post and the fundraising efforts. He said Robinson sent him an . email to stop working with Post. Murdered: Twenty six people were killed at Sandy Hook on December 14 including this first grade class . 'I'm a little sad that someone's personal vendetta is muddying something that's completely transparent,' Hayes said. 'She attacked Sabrina and the integrity of 21 little kids.' He added that Post does not deal with the fundraising money. Some residents told the Courant they do not care that there is a second choir representing the town. Monte Frank, whose children used to go to Sandy Hook Elementary, said he thought both choirs were fantastic. 'Seeing the Sandy Hook chorus at the Super Bowl made me really proud,' he said. 'And seeing [the other choir] sing Over the Rainbowâ¦ that made me really proud as well.' Video: Newtown Music Project performs on Good Morning America .

"An unarmed 60-year-old Florida man has been shot twice in his own driveway by deputies who mistook him for a car thief. For the past month, Roy Middleton, of Pensacola, says he has been living in perpetual pain and struggling to sleep, haunted by the events of the night when he was shot. At around 2.30am on July 27, Middleton went to retrieve a loose cigarette from his mother's Lincoln Town Car in the driveway on Shadow Lawn Lane when he was spotted by a neighbor. Scroll down for video . Mistaken identity: Roy Middleton, 60, of Pensacola, Florida, was shot by deputies in his own driveway after being taken for a criminal . Bad call: Middleton was rummaging in his mother Lincoln Town Car in search of a loose cigarette when a neighbor spotted him and contacted police to report a car thief . No questions asked: Mr Middleton said that instead of asking him for his ID, the officers opened fire on him in his own driveway, striking him twice in the leg . Middleton lives with his wife and mother at the Pensacola address, and his name is listed on the insurance of the Lincoln, the Pensacola News Journal reported. Believing that a car break-in was in progress, the resident called 911. Within minutes, officers Jeremiah Meeks, Sgt. Matthew White and Charles Wright arrived on the scene. Meeks and White ordered the 60-year-old man to show his hands, and when Middleton allegedly hesitated and made what was described as a lunging motion, they unleashed a barrage of 15 bullets, two of them striking the man in the legs. The officers and their superior, Sheriff David Morgan, have maintained that the use of force in this case was proper because Middleton did not immediately comply with their orders and appeared to reach for a metal object. The victim, however, claimed that he was raising his hands when the deputies fired on him instead of asking for his identification or simply inquiring him if he lives there. Middleton added that the object that put the officers on edge was nothing more than a key chain with a flashlight given to him as a present by his daughter, who is serving in Afghanistan. Perpetual pain: The 60-year-old, who also has a bad back, says that now he cannot even sit on the couch without suffering pain . Profound effect: Middleton's wife, Sharlet (center), pictured with their lawyer (left) and his mother (right), said her husband is not the person he was before the shooting . The shooting has left the 60-year-old man, who also has a bad back, in a state of agony, exacerbated by nightmares. Mr Middleton told the station WEAR-TV that the bullets that struck him shattered his left leg, requiring an operation to insert metal rods in order to keep the limb intact. Now, he says he cannot even sit on the couch without pain. The man was released from Baptist Hospital late last month and is expected to begin physical therapy next week. Defiant: Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has sided with his deputies, saying that the use of force against Middleton was appropriate because he had failed to immediately comply with their orders . âI ask myself why they shot me first. And why they shoot me so many times afterwards. Yeah, I ask why -- . that's all I can ask is why,â he told CNN in his first public interview. Sheriff Morgan sided with his officers and sounded a defiant note amid the firestorm that has erupted in the media since the incident last month. âThere was nothing glaringly apparent to us that the officers did that was out of the ordinary in the given set of circumstances as have been given to us,â Morgan said in an interview with CNN. The deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation that will determine whether any charges will be filed against them. Mr Middleton is now planning to file a civil lawsuit against the sheriff's office claiming excessive use of force. Beside punitive damages, the 60-year-old also wants an apology. His wife, Sharlet, said the shooting has had a devastating impact on her husband â previously a laid-back, jovial man who enjoyed fishing and family gatherings. 'He still tries to be the Roy that we all know, but he's not,' she told the paper.","Roy Middleton, 60, struck twice in the legs while looking for cigarette inside his mother's car in Pensacola, Florida .

"No one has come forward to claim the body of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, it has been revealed, as investigators continue to piece together his movements prior to the attack. Tsarnaev was shot during a dramatic gunbattle with cops in Watertown, Massachusetts on Friday, before police said he was run over by his younger brother Dzhokhar as he tried to escape. Tamerlan was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Scroll down for videos . Dead: . Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a shootout with police on Friday . Harrowing: Images taken by a resident show the suspected Boston Marathon bombers hiding behind a car as they engage in a dramatic shootout with police in Watertown last month . Battle: The eyewitness said the men ran to the green sedan, left, for more supplies such as explosives . Married: Katherine Russell was 21 when she married Tamerlan and converted to Islam. They have a child together who is now three years old . ABC News reported that so far, neither his wife - Katherine Russell - nor other family members have claimed his body for burial. Katherine, was 21 when she converted to Islam and married Tsarnaev. After marrying, she left Suffolk University without graduating. They had a daughter, Zahara, now 3. Tamerlan seems never to have found a full-time career. His family members say his new wife supported him, while he stayed home with the child. The report came as incredible new . photos of the shootout showed the brothers taking shelter behind a . vehicle and taking aim at police. The images, taken by a resident, show . the brothers running to a car for more supplies before hauling out a . pressure cooker bomb they then detonated, filling the street with smoke. The . photos were taken on the eyewitness' phone from a third-floor bedroom . overlooking the harrowing scene, are the first images giving insight . into the fraught battle that left one brother dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is recovering from a gunshot wound to the neck in the hospital, has told investigators that his older brother was the ringleader in the attacks. Threat: In another image, a red circle shows what the eyewitness believed to be a pressure cooker bomb . Escape: After detonating the bomb and filling the street with smoke, the youngest brother jumped in the car and ploughed towards the police officers lining the end of the residential street . Taken down: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed in a gunfight with police on April 19. Dzhokhar, who was injured, was captured that evening . Andrew Kitzenberg, who snapped the photographs as he sought refuge in his home, shared the dramatic images and details on his blog. 'I . was in my living room working on my computer when I heard multiple . ""pops"" coming from outside,' he recalled. 'At that point, I had no idea . that I was about to become an eye witness to the biggest news story in . the country. 'When . I looked outside my window, I could clearly see two people (the . Tsarnaev brothers) taking cover behind an SUV and engaging in gunfire.' He ran to the third floor of the home to seek shelter from the gunfire. 'As . I ran into my room, overwhelmed by shock, adrenaline, and curiosity, I . jumped onto my bed to stay below the windows but also have a clear view . at the shooters and photograph the event,' he said. He described seeing the men jump out of a green sedan, which they returned to for supplies - 'assumingly, more ammunition and explosives'. Aftermath: When the gun battle was over, police rushed to where the green sedan was parked and announced there were other devices on the street, sparking a search . Site: This image shows a blast mark on the ground from where the pressure cooker bomb exploded . In another picture, he highlights a dark object that he identifies as a pressure cooker bomb. 'The . use of this explosive created an enormous cloud of smoke that covered . the entire street,' he wrote. 'While the street was still cloudy with . smoke one of the brothers started running down the street towards the . officers, while still engaging them in gunshots. 'As he got closer to the officers, within 10-15 yards of them he was taken down.' Kitzenberg added he had been unable to see whether police knocked him to the ground or shot him. His brother then jumped in their car and barreled towards the police cars barricading the end of the street. Authorities said he ran over his brother. The images reveal the moment Dzhokhar headed for the police cars - dodging between two. 'The SUV side swiped both cars taking out doors and windows and ultimately broke through the vehicle barricade and continued driving west on Laurel St.,' Kitzenberg wrote on his blog. 'This was the last I saw of the black SUV.' Wanted; Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, was killed in the shootout, while his brother Dzhokhar, right, escaped .

"Even for a doctor used to the carnage of war, it was a sight which instilled panic and fear. As appalling figures reveal that 3,600 people in Syria have been treated for neurotoxic symptoms â and that 355 of them have died â one of the courageous medics treating them has spoken about the horrors of Wednesdayâs chemical attack. Majid Abu Ali, a 38-year-old Syrian GP, has described the moment he watched hundreds of dying men, women and children arrive at his makeshift hospital on the outskirts of Damascas. There were toddlers and babies gasping for oxygen as their air supply was slowly cut off. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT. Scroll down for video. Hell: A man mourns over a dead body after what Syrian activists claim was a poison gas attack by regime forces in Douma town, Damascus . Paralysis, foaming at the mouth and an inability to control bodily functions were also symptoms, which made Dr Ali and his colleagues certain they were witnessing the effects of chemical weapons. âThe look of horror in victimsâ eyes was what affected us most,â said Dr Ali. âAll of us have been dealing with war victims for the past two years, but nothing could have prepared us for this. The situation was quite terrifying.â As the international community argues about the exact nature of the weapons used, Dr Ali has provided the first detailed testament of life inside a Syrian civilian community contaminated by deadly nerve agents. Anguish: A man tries to console a woman as she clutches at the dead bodies of children killed in a chemical attack on Arbeen Town in Damascus . He told The Mail on Sunday: âWe want . the world to know what innocent people are suffering â for people to . share our outrage and to stop this horror. âThis . is not about politics or taking sides, this is about stopping the . extermination of people in one of the cruellest ways known to mankind. âNot . only are children being exterminated by the dozen, but doctors treating . them are also succumbing to the chemicals as they go about their work.â Reports from human rights activists in Damascus suggest that at least six doctors have died while treating victims. Dr Ali trained at Damascus University and now works inside the rebel city of Douma, about seven miles north-east of the centre of Damascus and two miles from the suburb of East Ghouta, scene of the atrocity. He said: âI was woken by a colleague on Wednesday soon after 3am. The bombing is constant, and we are used to early calls, but this was an appalling escalation in the conflict. Survivors: This little boy escaped, but 3,600 people in Syria have been treated for neurotoxic symptoms after Wednesday's chemical attack, and 355 of them have died . âMy colleague said that there would be no shifts as we all had to deal with a massive emergency round-the-clock. âBy . 7am there were 630 victims, 422 of them women and children. Sixty-seven . had died by this time, with many more close to death. âAll . had the classic symptoms of chemical attack, ranging from asphyxiation . to that terrible glazed look associated with nerve agents â pupils are . contracted and muscles are in spasm.â Dr Ali said the most disturbing sight was row upon row of young childrenâs corpses lying perfectly still and seemingly asleep. âThere had been similar attacks in the past, but our suspicion was that the agents were diluted. Wednesdayâs attack was a full-blown chemical bombardment,â he said. Destruction: Syrian army soldiers walk among the rubble in the aftermath of government attacks . âThose who made it to the medical point were not even the worst affected. Whole families died in their own homes. âMy . friend Abu Abdel-Rahman, a doctor, died at home with his grandmother. He was only 32 and was solely interested in caring for other people . âAbuâs body was only found because one of us from the team went round to scramble him to get on duty. âPeople like Abu were dying everywhere â simply falling down in the street. Others simply passed away in their sleep. At 5am on Wednesday, a mother and her three-month-old baby girl came into the medical point, even though the mother could barely walk. Toxic: Soldiers wear medical masks after chemical attacks that caused victims to suffer asphyxiation, muscular spasms and death . âShe screamed at us to save her little girl, but we couldnât do anything for her. She was too young for her bodyâs system to cope. âAnother entire family of five arrived later, but each of them died slowly in front of us. We are all used to dealing with the classic wounds and other trauma caused by shelling, but not theseÂ  horror weapons. âThey are utterly inhumane.â The Ghouta attack was concentrated on a heavily built-up area largely controlled by the rebel Syrian Free Army, with at least seven districts hit. All are just a short drive from the bunker where Assad is said to be commanding the destruction of his own people. Weapons: Syrian state TV broadcast these images of plastic jugs, gas masks, vials of an unspecified medication, explosives and other items allegedly seized from rebel hideouts in the Jobar neighborhood of Damascus . Dr Ali pointed to US President Barack Obamaâs âred lineâ speech of almost exactly one year ago, when he suggested that the use of chemical weapons would make international intervention inÂ  Syria inevitable. âThat sounds like a hollow claim now,â he said. âThe truth is that Assad is taking advantage of the lack of international action to exterminate potential enemies as quickly as possible. My patients are the principal victims of this thinking.â By Ian Birrell, Foreign Correspondent . More than 100,000 Syrians lie dead. One-fifth of a 22âmillion population has been displaced. Yet even a few months ago there were still supposed experts who claimed Bashar Assad, the London-trained eye doctor turned dictator, was a decent chap trapped by cruel circumstance. These deluded fools must surely have been silenced after the hideous deaths of perhaps 1,700 people in apparent chemical attacks last week. If confirmed, it will be the worst such incident since Saddam Husseinâs attacks on the Kurds 25 years ago. When there is slaughter on the Syrian scale it seems almost academic whether people are killed by bullets or poison. But last year Barack Obama said the use of chemical weapons was a âred lineâ that would âchange my calculusâ. He was right: if the world is to have any rules of war, there has to be a response to Assadâs latest outrage. The question, of course, is what? This is already a proxy war, with fighters from 25 countries. I have spoken to refugees burned out of their homes by Iranian forces who, like the Russians, side with Assad. Meanwhile money and munitions have poured into the rebels from Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia â with a wink and a nod from the White House. Now the contagion seems to be spreading. Lebanon suffered two more huge bomb attacks yesterday. Jordan is struggling to cope with a massive influx of Syrian refugees while Iraq is again drowning in blood. Amid all this, the UN looks even more hopeless than ever, given the shameful Russian and Chinese lock on any Security Council action and a second-rate Secretary-General. Yet if nothing is done, what message does this send to other rogue states? And as the world wrings its hands, the jihadists and extremists grow stronger inside Syria. For months, Britain and France have wanted a bolder stance, encouraged by their action in Libya that ousted another despot (although this aided the collapse of neighbour Mali). David Cameron, meanwhile, is haunted by another conflict: Bosnia. This showed how doing nothing can turn out to be as fateful a choice as taking action. Serbian ethnic cleansing rampaged for three years while a Conservative Government led Western opposition to intervention. Then came the 1995 massacre of 8,000 people in Srebrenica, finally forcing Nato into action. There are no easy answers to the Syrian dilemma. The easiest move politically is to arm the rebels,Â  although their problem is not a shortage of weapons, and there is no point creating no-fly zones if we cannot defend them against well-armed forces backed by Russia. Ultimately, we must ponder two profound questions. First, are we prepared to become embroiled in war in the Middle East? And second, do we really understand the impact of our actions if we do get involved? The answers could define this decade.","Dr Majid Abu Ali describes horrific neurotoxic effects of poison gas .

"Warning: Assistant Commissioner of the Met police Cressida Dick says the consequences of the conflict in Syria - and the return of British-born jihadists - will be felt in the UK for many years . Britain will feel the repercussions of Syria and the rise of Islamic extremism within its own borders for 'many years' to come, a top counter-terrorism   expert has said. Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police's assistant commissioner and head of specialist operations, warned that Britain would feel the long-term   consequences of the conflict. She said it represented a terrorist threat to the UK, and that young British Muslims who have travelled to the war-torn country to fight might   commit violence when they return. 'I'm afraid I believe that we will be living with the consequences of Syria - from a terrorist point   of view, let alone the world, geopolitical consequences - for many, many, many years to come,' Ms Dick told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Her warning came after footage emerged online apparently showing several young British jihadists in Syria in a recruitment video for the extremist   militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (Isis), in which they urge UK Muslims to join insurgents there and in Iraq. Two have been identified as brothers from Cardiff - 20-year-old Nasser Muthana, and 17-year-old Aseel Muthana. Another has been identified as Reyaad Khan, 20, a former pupil at Cardiffâs Cantonian High School. Two other men were arrested in March and April in the UK after they returned from Syria. The pair, aged 19 and 23 and both also from Cardiff, were held   on suspicion of receiving terrorist training and attending a place used for terrorist training, but were later released without charge. Scroll down for video . From Wales to a warzone: Reyaad Khan (left) sits alongside fNasser Muthana, with a rifle resting on his knee, urging Britons to travel to Iraq and Syria . Nasser Muthana (left), who went to the same Cardiff sixth-form as Reyaad, is one of the Britons who have been radicalised. This picture on the right is understood to be Aseel Muthana, the 17-year-old younger brother of Nasser, who has travelled to the Middle East to fight . South Wales Police said in a statement: 'We are increasingly concerned about the numbers of young people who have or are intending to travel to Syria   to join the conflict. 'The advice is to avoid all travel to Syria - anyone who does travel is putting themselves in considerable danger. 'Travelling abroad for the purpose of   engaging in terrorist related activity is an offence and we will seek to prosecute anyone engaged in this type of activity. 'The issue is not unique to Cardiff or Wales and is a priority for police and security services across the UK.' Police across the UK have made 65 Syria-related arrests over the last 18 months, including 40 in the first three months of this year alone. A video showing men facing execution at the hands of ISIS, which has cut a swathe of terror across Syria and Iraq . Shadow . justice secretary Sadiq Khan warned that radicalisation in prisons was a . big problem and described the inadequacy of training for prison staff . to deal with the issue as 'shocking'. Mr . Khan said mosques do a good job in educating young people and called on . the Government to concentrate on the spaces it can govern, such as . prisons. He . told Sky News's Murnaghan programme: 'You speak to prison governors, as . I do, prison officers, as I do - the inadequacy of the training is . quite shocking. Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan warned that radicalisation in prisons was a big problem and called on greater efforts to combat it . 'But also their inability to tackle this problem is a big issue and we should be doing much, much more.'There's . no point in politicians from this Government coming on with their heads . in their hands, blaming parents or mosques - important roles that they . have to play as well.' Earlier, . he told the programme: 'The mosques actually do a good job. Actually . most mums and dads don't want their young sons, we've seen the father of . the two sons in Cardiff, being radicalised. 'The problem is with the internet now, with social media, with Twitter. 'Our . ability as parents or as governors of a mosque are less than they were . and we've got to redouble our efforts to stop the source, these . preachers of hate, getting into people's bedrooms. 'I . think we've got to recognise that if you are a young person born and . raised in this country and the first time somebody shows you a role . model is a bearded man with a Kalashnikov in Afghanistan, or somebody . doing bad things in Syria or Iraq, it's a problem.' Yesterday it emerged that around 500 Britons had travelled to Syria and Iraq - a higher estimate than the 400 claimed by Foreign Secretary William   Hague. Sir Peter Fahy, who leads on the Prevent counter-terrorism strategy for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said 'huge amounts of material' was   being taken down from the internet every week as part of the effort to stop people being radicalised. Another terrorism expert warned that it is 'inevitable' that jihadists returning from Syria and Iraq will pose a threat in Britain, saying that   hundreds may have already returned. The ISIS chief executioner Shakir Wahiyib, who was born in 1971 in Baghdad . Richard Barrett, a former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, estimated that 'possibly up to 300 people have come back to the UK' already, and warned   that intelligence services faced an 'impossible' task in trying to track them. He told The Independent on Sunday: 'If you imagine what it would cost to really look at 300 people in depth, clearly it would be completely impossible   to do that, probably impossible even at a third of that number.' Mr Barrett said police and intelligence resources were stretched in terms of numbers and knowing where the returning jihadists are. He said: 'With this whole business in Syria, although there is no linear projection from foreign fighters to domestic terrorists, it's inevitable that   a number will fall into this category.' Taking no prisoners: Footage posted on YouTube appears to show ISIS militants carrying out summary executions on dozens of captured soldiers in Syria . Mr Barrett has co-authored a report, released this month, which concludes that more than 12,000 foreign fighters have gone to Syria since the war   began, and that it is 'likely to be an incubator for a new generation of terrorists'. Meanwhile the father of the Muthana brothers said his sons, both high achievers at school with good career prospects, must have been 'brainwashed' and   believes a network of radical jihadi recruiters must have paid for them to go. Mr Muthana said that he and his wife were 'devastated' when they found out from police in November that their eldest son Nasser had joined a terror   cell in Syria. In February police informed them their second son, Aseel, had obtained a second passport and travelled to Cyprus and was planning to join   his brother. Nasser was reported to have passed 14 GCSEs, was studying for his A-levels and had been offered places to study medicine at four universities before he   became radicalised. His brother Aseel was an A-level student at Fitzalan High School in Cardiff and had dreams of becoming an English teacher. Mr Muthana, 57 who came to the UK in the 1970s from Yemen, told the Sunday Telegraph: . 'I feel sick and devastated my son is caught up in this - they were . brought   up to love and respect my country Britain. Now I fear they may . come back in coffins. 'I'm . worried about their safety. But I am also worried about the evil . messages Nasser is spreading in this vile video - I am concerned that . other boys   may follow him there.' The . brothers were part of a wider terror network that included two friends . arrested months ago after they returned from the Middle East. Yesterday . thousands of young British Muslim men rallied against radical Islam . amid the concerns that British jihadists are fighting in Syria. An . estimated 5,000 Muslims gathered in Surrey to pledge loyalty to Britain . in light of concerns over the popularity of Isis and the alleged . involvement   of Britons. The . three-day residential event, organised by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Youth . Association (Amya), has brought together 5,000 young British Muslim men . from   England, Scotland and Wales, to foster bonds of brotherhood and . affirm their pride in being British and Muslim.

Kidwai, general secretary of the leading Muslim body, said he believed . there were as many as five Welsh muslims already fighting in Syria and . Iraq with the now-outlawed terror group Isis. The . mosque where Muthana worshipped yesterday denied being a source of . radicalism and said that young people were being turned to extremism . through the internet. Barak . Albayaty, a trustee at the mosque, the Al Manar Centre, said that . Muthana had been 'just like any other guy' and he had been shocked to . see him in the video. He said: 'What I'm sure of, being part of here, it's not to be taken as a source of radicalism.'We're against going to Syria for the armed struggle and have spelt this out on many occasions.' He added: 'It is worrying. We have to do something collective about the media and how these youths are getting affected. 'They're . affected by the internet. It's not just Cardiff, it's all over the UK. I'm told the numbers could be in the hundreds all over the UK.' Mr . Albayaty said there would be a meeting between trustees who will . discuss the issue.

"With a Â£26million fortune, Robin Gibb left behind more than enough to ensure his widow and three children would be well provided for. However, it may be a different story for the late singerâs love child â who has been cut out of his inheritance altogether, the Daily Mail can reveal. The former Bee Gee died in May last year aged 62 after a long battle with colon and liver cancer. He was survived by his second wife Dwina, 60, their son Robin-John, 30, and his two children from his first marriage, Spencer, 41, and Melissa, 39. Assets: Robin Gibb's wife Dwina (pictured left with her late husband) will inherit his fortune while the daughter he had with his housekeeper Claire Yang (pictured right holding Snow Robin) has been cut out of his will . Gibb also left four-year-old daughter Snow Robin, who he fathered with his live-in housekeeper Claire Yang, then 33, in 2008. But newly released details of Gibbâs will show the youngster will not inherit any of his estate. The revelation follows reports of a feud between Mrs Gibb and Miss Yang. Although the singer and his partner of 35 years had an open marriage, Mrs Gibb reportedly stopped Snow and her mother from attending his funeral last year. Valued at Â£25.8million after tax, Gibbâs fortune includes all of his UK assets but does not include his properties in America or assets already shared jointly with his wife. The money has been placed in a trust fund, with Mrs Gibb receiving all profits until her death. The self-described Celtic druidess has also been granted all of her husbandâs âpersonal chattelsâ and the lucrative music rights to his share of the royalties from the Bee Geesâ back catalogue, which includes hits such as Stayinâ Alive and How Deep Is Your Love. Spencer and Melissa will each be given Â£500,000 immediately, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and Robin-John upon Mrs Gibbâs death. Mourners: Although Gibb and his partner of 35 years widow Dwina (right) had an open marriage, Mrs Gibb reportedly stopped Snow and her mother from attending his funeral last year . Happy families: Gibb's wideo Dwina (centre) stands to inherit his fortune of Â£25.8million. The money is in a trust fund, with Mrs Gibb receiving all profits until her death, when their son Robin-John (left) will inherit . Miss Yang has been allowed to keep the Â£850,000 house Gibb bought her in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, but her daughter did not inherit anything from the will. The 15-page document was drawn up in August 2011, nine months before Gibbâs death, and was witnessed by his personal assistant and his chauffeur. In the final paragraph, Gibb stated that he was âin the process of making reasonable financial provision for Snowâ. He asked his trustees to provide for her should he fail to do so before he died, but made no specific provision in his will. There were unconfirmed reports Gibb gave Miss Yang Â£5million before he died. But she refused to comment on the will or financial arrangements when she was approached at her home yesterday. News of Gibbâs affair with Miss Yang emerged only in February 2009 â three months after Snow was born at the private Portland Hospital in West London. It reportedly took a year for Gibbâs lawyers to agree a financial settlement with her for Snowâs future education and maintenance. The pair are thought to have been involved romantically for some years before the childâs birth. Miss Yang started out as the coupleâs housekeeper, working at their 12th century mansion in Thame, Oxfordshire, and at their Â£2.6million waterfront beach house in Miami, Florida. Pay out: Gibb's children Spencer (left) and Melissa (right) from his first marriage to Molly Hullis (centre) have been given Â£500,000, with the remainder of the estate to be split between them and half-brother Robin-John on his mother's death . Smash hits: Mrs Gibb (pictured left) will inherit the lucrative music rights to Gibb's back catalogue of hits with the Bee Gees (pictured right). It is rumoured he gave his former lover Calire Yang Â£5million before he died . Following Snowâs birth, Gibb said: âNew life is heaven sent and a blessing. Thatâs what I can say about children and life.â Despite the affair, Mrs Gibb insisted she and her husband had a happy relationship. Earlier this year, she said: âItâs very important that people who are creative are given the freedom to create in a marriage. Itâs not good to have jealousies around. âSome people even get jealousÂ  of someone reading a book and not paying attention to them.Â  We were both creative and there was a lot of trust.â She added: âLetâs just say Robin made sure everyone in his life was taken care of. Theyâve been sufficiently provided for â everyone has.â Gibbâs total fortune was estimated at Â£93million last year, significantly more than the amount bequeathed in his will. It is believed most of the remainder is tied up in assets held overseas as well as those owned jointly with his wife. Money held in joint bank accounts and all jointly owned homes pass directly to Mrs Gibb without being included in the will. It is not known whether Miss Yang plans to contest the will. Under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act 1975, any child is allowed to contest a will â or have it contested on their behalf â if they are excluded or if it is unfair.","Robin Gibb died in May last year after a battle with liver and colon cancer .

"Lockerbie bomber Abdel Basset Al . Megrahi will today mark the second anniversary of his release from . prison in a safe house with his family. Libyaâs under-fire regime has called for any celebrations to remain âlow keyâ. Megrahi was filmed last month by . Libyan state television appearing at a rally. Despite the fact he looked . ill in a wheelchair, the 59-year-oldâs surprise appearance was a huge . propaganda coup. This week the Scottish government insisted it has been 'vindicated' in it's controversial decision to release Megrahi from jail on compassionate grounds. Sick bed: Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, pictured with his family at his Tripoli home, is still alive despite being given just months to live . Homecoming: al-Megrahi and the son of the Libyan leader Seif al-Islam Gaddafi on his arrival at an airport in Tripoli . The former intelligence officer was convicted in 2001 of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, which killed 270. He was freed from a life sentence on . compassionate grounds in 2009 after doctors said he was suffering with . terminal prostate cancer and had only three months to live. However it emerged yesterday a . revolutionary cancer treatment developed in London, but not yet . available in the UK, has enabled him to survive. Megrahi has been taking Abiraterone, . the hormone-based therapy drug discovered by scientists at the Institute . of Cancer Research in London. Hug: Megrahi received a hero's welcome from Muammar Gaddafi in Libya when he was released from a Scottish prison 'on compassionate grounds' A study at the Royal Marsden Hospital . in London in 2007 found it dramatically improved the condition of up to . 70 per of prostate cancer patients. But despite pharmaceutical firm . Johnson and Johnson preparing to market the drug under the name Zytiga, . its cost is estimated at a prohibitive Â£3,000 a month. âBrother Al-Megrahi has received the very best treatment, including Abiraterone,â revealed a medical source. Consultant urologist professor Roger Kirby, founder and director of The Prostate Centre in London, said: 'He has long outlived the speculative three-month prognosis and it appears he may continue to do so for a while yet. I strongly suspect that this drug has been central to that.' Last month a mission to capture the freed bomber and return him to face justice in the United States was revealed. Under a secret deal between President . Barack Obama and Libyan rebel leaders, Megrahi would have been detained . by opposition troops and then handed over to U.S. special forces. The biggest stumbling block was that nobody knew where he was â or even if he was still alive. Convicted: Al Megrahi when he was found guilty of the Lockerbie bombing . âNow it is clear that he is alive and in the Tripoli area,â said the medical source. âBecause of this the number of guards . around him is being increased, and his hideaway being made even more . secure. He will remain in his safe house for the second anniversary of . his release.â Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was said to be three months from death when he was freed from Greenock jail on August 20 2009. The decision by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill sparked international condemnation from some relatives of victims and politicians, including US President Barack Obama - but also attracted high-profile support from figures such as Nelson Mandela. Now, two years on, with Megrahi still alive in his home country, a spokesman for Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond defended the release. Senior figures in the American, British and Scottish jurisdictions have all agreed that the decision was taken in good faith, the spokesman said. 'Two years of extensive scrutiny, under three jurisdictions, vindicates the position that the Justice Secretary released al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds and compassionate grounds alone, based on the rules and regulations of Scots law and the reports of the Parole Board for Scotland, the Prison Governor and the Scottish Prison Service director of health and care Dr Andrew Fraser - all of which have been published,' he added. Relatives of victims of the bombing are still looking for clarity and answers.Pamela Dix, whose brother Peter was killed in the bombing, said: 'It's extremely frustrating that we're here, still talking about this. 'The fact that it's now years later means that the decision was probably made on a spurious basis. 'I'm sure Kenny MacAskill made it in good faith, but why are we having this discussion now? It's just another thing that remains unsolved.' Scottish Conservative justice spokesman John Lamont said: 'Mr Megrahi murdered 270 people in the skies over Scotland. 'He showed no compassion to his victims. 'He has admitted his guilt by dropping his appeal. Indeed, the Justice Secretary has made it clear that he believes that Mr Megrahi is guilty. 'Yet he was been allowed to return to Libya to a hero's welcome. That was so fundamentally wrong. The SNP's case for release lies in tatters.' Thousands of foreigners trapped in Tripoli are set to be evacuated in a massive international rescue operation . NATO warplanes sunk a tugboat carrying troops loyal to Gaddafi near the strategic western city of Zawiya as rebels advanced closer to the Libyan capital, the alliance reported today. The warplanes struck while rebels laid siege to Libya's last functioning oil refinery in a symbolic coup for the opposition. A rescue attempt was made after aircraft spotted several troops swimming toward a nearby buoy. The rebels claim they had captured the 120,000-barrel-per-day refinery in fighting that could be a turning point in the six-month civil war. Explosions also shook the capital early Friday as NATO jets were heard circling overhead. Flames lit up the Tripoli skies near Gaddafi's Bab al-Aziziya headquarters and army barracks. Seven thunderous blasts could be felt at a hotel where foreign journalists stay in Tripoli and three strikes were heard hitting the road to the airport in the capital. NATO also said its planes took out five tanks in Zawiya. Libyan rebels could resume oil output at two large fields in the east of the country within threeÂ  weeks in a bid to ease fuel shortages since war broke at the start of the year. OPEC member Libya is the third-largest oil producer in Africa and holds the continent's largest oil reserves. It produced 1.6 million barrels of oil a day before the uprising. âUnder these circumstances there will be no celebrations of Brother Al-Megrahiâs release,â said the same medical source. âInstead he will spend the day in a safe house well away from the fighting. âThere will be no triumphalism â Brother Al-Megrahi will spend a quiet day with his family,â the source added. Al-Megrahi was filmed last month by Libyaâs state-run television service at a rally of his tribe, which remains loyal to Colonel Gaddafi. Despite looking extremely ill as he sat in a wheelchair, Al-Megrahiâs surprise appearance was a huge propaganda coup for the dictatorâs beleaguered regime. But, a few weeks earlier, a mission to capture the freed bomber and return him to face justice in the United States was revealed. Under a secret deal between Barack Obama and Libyan rebel leaders, Al Megrahi would have been detained by opposition troops and then handed over to US Special Forces. The Scottish government has insisted the decision to release Al-Megrahi was taken in good faith, and based on medical evidence from Dr Andrew Fraser, the director of health and care of the Scottish Prison Service. But British Home Secretary William Hague said Al-Megrahiâs release was a âgreat mistakeâ, adding: âThis was absolutely the wrong thing to do. It shows the medical advice it was based on was pretty much worthless.â Meanwhile, Gaddafi is said to be getting ready to go into exile in Tunisia with his family, according to NBC News. One U.S. official suggested it was possible the dictator would leave within days, the channel reported. The report follows a series of statements this week from U.S. officials that Gadhafi would soon give up the five-month-old fight and and leave Libya. Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said: ""I think the sense is that Gaddafi's days are numbered.' And as fighting moves closer to the . Libyan capital, concern is growing for those trapped between Colonel . Gaddafiâs troops and rebel forces. A spokesman for the International Organization for Migration last night said the operation would begin within days. âWe are looking at all options . available, but it will probably have to be by sea,â Jemini Pandya told a . news conference in Switzerland.","Megrahi gets Â£3,000 a month pills .

"Former South African president Nelson Mandela's condition has improved, although he remains critically ill, the government has announced. President Jacob Zuma's office said that Mr Mandela is 'still in a critical condition in hospital but shows sustained improvement'. Mr Zuma gave the update after visiting Mr Mandela at the Pretoria hospital where he is receiving ongoing treatment. Towering figure: Former South African president Nelson Mandela, who is in hospital with a infection, became an iconic politician after his 1994 electoral victory ended apartheid . During the visit, he told the anti-apartheid leader of the love and support of all South Africans that was displayed at the leader's 95th birthday celebrations on July 18. The president also asked the nation to continue to keep Mr Mandela in its thoughts and prayers. Mr Mandela, who was jailed for 27 years during white minority rule, was hospitalised on June 8 for a recurring lung infection. On his birthday, well-wishers celebrated . with worldwide tributes dedicated to him on a day declared by the UN as . the Nelson Mandela International Day. Hope: South African President Jacob Zuma flanked by Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula outside Mandela's hospital on Mandela's brithday . Happy: Mandela's former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, right, waving to the well wishers at the hospital . It became a very poignant day for South Africans, as Mr Mandela's health tentatively continues to recover. President Jacob Zuma visited Mr Mandela at the hospital and said he was making steady progress. 'I was able to say ""Happy Birthday"" to him and he was able to smile,' he told reporters. His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela called the 95th birthday 'a gift to the nation'. Across South Africa, office workers, students, soldiers and ordinary citizens marked Mandela Day by performing community service to honour him, including sprucing up orphanages, painting walls at schools and delivering food to the poor. Thrilled: Thousands of South Africans today took part in charitable initiatives on the U.N.-designated 'Nelson Mandela Day'. These schoolchildren held balloons and flowers outside his hospital . Adoration: A group of people with banners and signs arrive at the Pretoria hospital to wish Mandela a happy birthday . Ethiopian and Nigerian asylum seekers . who had settled in South Africa fleeing persecution and conflict in . their own countries cleaned streets in Johannesburg to pay tribute to a . figure widely praised as 'a father of Africa'. Many offered birthday wishes outside the Pretoria hospital where Mr Mandela has been receiving treatment, singing songs and holding up signs wishing him a speedy recovery. Over in the U.S. his birthday was celebrated with speeches from figures such as former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Community spirit: Mandela's grandchildren, left to right, Adjoa Amuah, Mbuso, Zondwa and Tukwini work on a garden for 'Nelson Mandela Day' The day was also marked in nearly 20 U.S. cities with ceremonies around Capitol Hill in Washington and volunteers handing out South African oranges in New York. Mr Mandela became a pivotal figure in the country's democracy after his victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system. Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.","Mandela is showing 'sustained improvement' from six-week illness .

"Britain's closest ally in the Gulf has secretly granted political asylum to the surviving family of Colonel Gaddafi, it emerged today. News of the Libyans' arrival in Oman coincides with a visit by Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to the country last week. Gaddafiâs widow Safia, daughter Aisha and sons Mohammad and Hannibal, as well as their children, have all been living there since October 2012. On the run: Colonel Gaddafi's children Hannibal, left, and Aisha, right, have recently taken refuge in Oman . Asylum: The dictator's widow Safia, left, and son Mohammad, right, were granted refuge in the Gulf state . They have been granted asylum on âhumanitarian groundsâ and their expenses are being covered entirely by the Omani government. This is despite all members of the . family having deeply controversial pasts, having once shared all the . wealth and privilege enjoyed by the tyrant, who was deposed and killed . in 2011. Hannibal Gaddafi was renowned for his . abuse of servants, and for once allegedly beating up his wife in a . suite at Claridgeâs Hotel in central London. Aisha Gaddafi, a qualified lawyer, . notoriously defended dictators like her father around the world, . including deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. The pair are both currently wanted on Interpol arrest warrants issued at the request of Libya's new democratic government. Deposed: Gaddafi was overthrown as Libya's ruler by a nationwide rebellion in 2011 . The Gaddafi familyâs luxurious . lifestyle in Libya came to an end during the revolt against the despot, . which was supported by RAF bombing raids sanctioned by David Cameron. Since Gaddafiâs demise, there have . been fears that family members will revive his legacy, and return to the . blighted North African country to try and gain power again. The dictatorâs three children first fled to Algeria in August 2011, and had been living there until they moved to Oman. Late last year, Arab media started . reporting rumours that all four had left the area - and last week this . was confirmed by Algeria's ambassador to Libya.

"A father saved his life with a doner kebab after being stabbed in the neck after buying a takeaway. James Hobbs, 37, used the unopened Â£3.40 meal to stem the flow of blood after he was knifed by Jamie Edney, 36. He lost six-and-a-half pints of blood and was left with a five-inch knife wound which missed his windpipe and jugular vein by millimetres following the attack in Highbridge, Somerset. Doner saved my life: James Hobbs holds a kebab like the one he used to stem the blood after he was stabbed in the throat . Doctors told Mr Hobbs that holding the kebab to his neck saved his life because it gave paramedics time to rush him to hospital. Edney was today jailed for five-and-a-half years at Bristol Crown Court after being found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Mr Hobbs, from Highbridge, had been out with his cousin to buy food before returning to his flat on January 15, 2011. He accused his neighbour Edney of having an affair with his girlfriend - and he responded by cutting his throat. Jailed: Jamie Edney, 36, who was today told he must serve five-and-a-half years behind bars . Mr Hobbs said he held the kebab to his neck for several minutes until his cousin found a towel to cover the deep horizontal cut. Doctors told him he was lucky to be . alive as he needed an operation to open his windpipe so he could breathe . and 27 staples to seal the cut. Judge Michael Longman told Edney that he was giving him the lowest sentence possible due to the mitigating circumstances. Judge Longman said: 'You say that Mr Hobbs lunged at you, that you raised your arms and in doing so you accidentally cut him. 'But the prosecution said effectively, in a single movement, you slashed his neck. The jury rejected your account. 'I accept that you did not go looking . for trouble. It was not begun by you. It was Mr Hobbs who came to your . door and he did so in a temper. 'To answer the door holding the knife was asking for trouble - you selected the knife intending to intimidate. 'I accept that you regret and didn't . expect the injury or the outcome, but when you use a knife in the way . you did it is perhaps only to be expected.' Mr Hobbs has previously told how he battled to stay alive for his daughter Molly. He claimed: 'I think subconsciously I wanted to live for Molly and just didn't want to die like that. Meal: James Hobbs, 37, bought the Â£3.40 meal which saved his life from this takeaway in Highbridge, Somerset . 'I do go round with a bit of a spring in my step, knowing how lucky I am.' Mr Hobbs and his partner Lisa Reed, 33, did not want to comment after leaving court today. Dave Jones, 38, and Ian Anderson, 37, both also pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. The court heard that under a 'misguided sense of loyalty', Anderson and Jones had burned the clothes Edney had been wearing on the evening of the attack. Anderson was given 160 hours of unpaid work and Jones was given 150 hours. Both were also ordered to pay Â£250 each in prosecution costs.","James Hobbs, 37, lost six-and-a-half pints of blood following the attack .

"The uncle of Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad has sold a Paris mansion for Â£60million, it emerged today. Rifaat al-Assad, 75, was christened 'the Butcher of Hama' after allegedly ordering the massacre of 25,000 people - making him as reviled as his increasingly bloodthirsty nephew. But this has not stopped him acquiring a vast property portfolio in numerous cities across the world including Paris and London. Riches: Rifaat al-Assad, left, uncle of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, right, had put the seven storey home in Paris' most desirable areas on sale for Â£90million, but eventually sold it for Â£60million - still a huge profit . It is understood Rifaat has made a multi-million pound profit by selling the seven storey home at 38 Avenue Foch - one of the finest properties in the French capital. He originally put the building up for sale at 90 million, but accepted a reduction of just over 30 per cent and accepted Â£60 million. Rifaat is known to have bought the house for at least half that amount - meaning he now walks away with a vast profit. Billionaires' row: The Avenue Foch, pictured, where Rifaat al-Assad sold one of his homes for Â£60million - is in Paris' most desirable area and home to some of the world's richest people . Contrast: Rifaat al-Assad sold the palatial, seven storey home for a huge profit while large swathes of Syria, such as Aleppo, pictured, are torn apart by civil war . It will infuriate the victims of his . family's increasingly desperate attempts to win the civil war which has . been raging in Syria for the past two-and-a-half years. The . buyer of the house is said to be a Russian tycoon who is apparently . unconcerned about paying so much to an alleged war criminal. 'Rifaat . al-Assad has a fortune which is calculated in billions of euros, for . which opponents of the Assad family would love to know the origin,' according to French newspaper Liberation. Rifaat . also owns a Â£10million town house in Mayfair, London. The parents of . Syrian first lady Asma Al-Assad, who was born and brought up in the . English capital, also still live in the city. Rifaat . is said to have attacked and killed thousands of civilians in Hama in . 1982. Entire neighbourhoods were razed and there were mass executions of . the regime's opponents. Battleground: Rifaat al-Assad owns properties in desirable areas of the world - a far cry from the hellish place many towns in Syria, including Bab Tadmur in Homs, pictured, have become after months of brutal fighting . He became known as 'The Butcher of Hama', despite denying being in the city at the time. Rifaat was stripped of power and exiled to Europe after trying to oust his brother, Hafez, in a coup attempt in 1983. Assad invested in a London-based television station, Arab News Network, and bought property in the capital. He is thought to be selling up in France, where he also owns a country estate and several flats, because the French government is trying to clean-up its image as a bolt-hole for international criminals. The bloody fighting in Syria continues, as smoke rises from Al-Safsaf in Homs . Full scale civil war: As Damascus is devastated by shelling, the fighting here and in Aleppo highlights the country's rapid descent into civil war 17 months after peaceful protests against President Bashar al-Assad marked the beginning of the uprising . In recent months there have been a number of attempts to seize property belonging to discredited African dictators, including other homes on Avenue Foch. Rifaat has a large team of bodyguards, who reputedly include food tasters to ensure he is not poisoned, and experts in kung fu. Since the Syrian uprising, the European Union has imposed asset freezes on those 'responsible for the violent repression of the civilian population in Syria', but Rifaat's portfolio has largely remained intact. Today Rifaat could not be contacted for comment on the sale of his house. But in previous interviews he has styled himself as a potential successor to his nephew, whose regime has been responsible for thousands of civilian deaths as it tries to crush the uprising which started in early 2011.","Rifaat al-Assad had asked for Â£90million for the seven storey home .

"Evicted: Colonel Gaddafi's daughter Aisha was kicked out of her Algerian safe-house because she kept setting fire to it in fits of anger . Colonel Gaddafiâs lawyer daughter was kicked out of her Algerian safe-house because she kept setting fire to it in fits of anger, it emerged today. Aisha Gaddafi, 37, has an arrest warrant against her name after fleeing Libya when her father was deposed and then killed two years ago. The bleach blonde, western educated âClaudia SchifferÂ  of North Africaâ was widowed in the bombing raids which destroyed Gaddafiâs regime, leaving her as a single mother. Soon afterwards she arrived in neighbouring Algeria with other family members, and they were given a presidential residence in the south of the country. But now it has emerged that Ms Gaddafi, who was once a UN Goodwill Ambassador, was so angry at what happened to her father that she kept vandalising furniture and attacking guards. âShe ended up blaming Algeria for many of her problems, and also began starting fires in the house,â said a government source in Algiers. âShelves in the library went up in flames, as she regularly attacked army personnel looking after her safety.â The situation came to a head late last year when she destroyed a portrait of Algerian president Abdul Aziz Bouteflika, Algerian newspaper Ennahar reported. This led to Aisha being kicked out of the country, and eventually finding sanctuary with Oman, Britainâs closest ally in the Gulf. Escaped: Colonel Gaddafi  who died in 2011 and his wife Safia who fled Libya with his daughter Aisha . Aisha, Gaddafiâs widow, Safia, and sons Mohammad and Hannibal, as well as their children, have all been living there since October 2012. They have been granted asylum on âhumanitarian groundsâ and their expenses are being covered entirely by the Omani government. This is despite all members of the family having deeply controversial pasts, having once shared all the wealth and privilege enjoyed by the tyrant, who was deposed and killed in 2011. Ms Gaddafi had a baby girl after evading rebel forces in her home country. Bride: Aisha Gaddafi at her wedding - she is now a widow and single mother . Family album: A photo of Aisha found in a family album at his wrecked former headquarters in Tripoli's Bab al-Aziziya compound on August 28, 2011 . Aisha is Gaddafiâs only biological daughter, and spoke out in support of her father throughout the civil war. âHe is my remedy against pain and my fortress against grief,â she said. Aisha also spoke up for Saddam Hussein following the Iraq War. âWhen you have an occupying army coming from abroad, raping your women and killing your own people, it is only legitimate that you fight them,â she said at the time. In 2006 she married her cousin Ahmed al-Gaddafi al-Qahsi, an army colonel with whom she had three children. Qahsi was killed during a bombing raid on one of Gaddafiâs compounds. Luxury lifestyle: Children jump into the swimming pool at Aisha Gaddafi's home inside her father's compound in Tripoli .

"Violent clashes have broken out in a Paris suburb after police tried to arrest a Muslim woman for wearing a veil. It came as two men today put a 21-year-old pregnant woman in hospital for covering her face with a veil on the same council estate. In what is being viewed as a severe test of France's burka ban, around 60 people attacked police on Wednesday night in Argenteuil, a commuter town to the north west of the capital. Clashes: Two women wearing burkas walk through Douai, in northern France. Violent clashes have broken out in a Paris suburb after police tried to arrest a Muslim woman for wearing a veil (file photo) Under a law which came into force in 2011, women found guilty of wearing niqabs in public can be fined the equivalent of around Â£130. But when officers approached the unnamed woman, passers-by became involved in a 'riot' and police used tear gas and flash-ball shots to disperse them, according to a police source. 'The police were attacked' the source told Le Parisien newspaper. 'They were insulted and beaten, including punches'. Two men aged 23 and 37, including a cousin of the young veil-wearer, were arrested and placed in custody under suspicion of violence and public order offences. In the end, 40 riot police had to be called to the area to restore order, said the source. Affront: Nicolas Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of the French Republic . Today, the 21-year-old was attacked in Argenteuil, with 'two shaven-haired men tearing the veil from her face and pulling her hair,' said a police source close to the case. She was rushed to the emergency ward of Argenteuil hospital where she underwent treatment for unspecified injuries. Police said that the men had shouted racist insults at the girl, saying that the veil was no longer acceptable in France. The attack may have been caught on CCTV, said the police source. In a third incident, police confirmed that a 17-year-old, identified only as Rabia, was attacked in Argenteuil on May 20th for wearing a veil. Two men beat her up at around 9pm, shouting 'Dirty Arab' and 'Dirty Muslim' while laughing. Rabia said afterwards: 'One of them insulted me. I sped up not because I was scared, but the men turned around, one of them tore my veil, pushed me to the ground and them hit me while insulting me.' Rabia continued: 'Without the approach of a passerby who stopped the attackers, I do not know what would have happened.' In March, a Frenchman who ripped a Muslim woman's veil off her eyes was given a five-month suspended prison sentence. The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he was merely trying to 'enforce' his country's laws when he carried out the attack in the city of Nantes. He approached the woman in a fairground in September last year and pulled away the veil. A judgment against him released by the Nantes criminal court said: 'Ordinary citizens are not entitled to take the law into their own hands.' Fined: Despite protests, seen here in 2010, under a law which came into force in 2011, women found guilty of wearing niqabs in public can be fined the equivalent of around Â£130 . The man, who originally gave a false identity to police, said he was a firm believer in the law brought in by government of former President, Nicolas Sarkozy. But the judge said that he had acted like a 'vigilante' and carried out the attack solely because he was prejudiced against the women's faith. Mr Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of the French Republic, saying that they could be used by both shoplifters and terrorists to hide their own identities. The incidents are all in a long line triggered by Mr Sarkozy's ban. Last September, Louise-Marie Suisse, a Muslim teenager from Marseille received a two month prison sentence for biting a policewoman who arrested her for wearing a full-face veil. Amnesty International is among human rights groups who have condemned the law, saying it breaches the right of freedom of expression.","Two men put pregnant woman, 21, in hospital - undergoing treatment .

"Black and North African railway workers were banned when the President of Israel visited France 'because they might be Muslim', it emerged today. This was despite Shimon Peres specifically arriving in the country to work towards a Middle East peace agreement between Arabs and Jews. The alleged discrimination took place when Mr Peres arrived at the Gare du Nord in Paris, the hub for high-speed trains travelling to cities including London, on March 8. French President Francois Hollande receives President of Israel Shimon Peres at Elysee Palace. It was on this trip that black and African rail workers were banned for the arrival of Mr Peres at Gare du Nord station in Paris because they might have been mistaken for Muslims . It is now the subject of an official complaint by the SUD-Rail transport union which says everything was done to ensure there were 'no Muslim employees to welcome the Head of the State of Israel'. Mr Peres and a delegation of other senior Israelis arrived on a morning train from Belgium, and were greeted by staff from SNCF, France's national railway, and their baggage-handling subsidiary, ITIREMIA. But the day before, a site manager told all workers at the station about the ban on black staff, and those of North African descent, because they might be Muslim. SCNF, France's national railway, have now pledged a full investigation . Secular France does not officially recognise anybody's religion, but it was assumed by management that anyone from a 'black or Arab' background might be Muslim - an assumption 'based on the appearance of the workers', according to a SUD-Rail statement. The SUD-Rail statement adds: 'We insist that SNCF publicly condemns these practices' as 'unacceptable'. Gare du Nord has a large number of workers from an ethnic minority in its workforce, many of whom live in the suburbs of Paris. SNCF . initially blamed the discrimination on 'security protocol' advised by . the French Interior Ministry and the Israeli Embassy in Paris, but this . has been emphatically denied by both. Instead, the order came from SNCF management, with a spokesman for the state-run company pledging 'a full investigation'. The row is particularly embarrassing . for SNCF because of the part it played in the extermination of Jews, and . other minorities, during the Second World War. In . 2011 the organisation made its first formal public apology to Holocaust . victims, many of whom had been entrained to death camps in Germany on . lines which ran out of the Gare du Nord. Francois Hollande, France's Socialist President, has pledged to clamp down on discrimination against minorities, and particularly Muslims, but prejudice is still rife. France has the largest Muslim population in western Europe, with up to six million living in the country, many in major cities like Paris.","Black and African workers were banned from the President of Israel's visit to France .

"Anelka faces a five match ban for performing DieudonneÂ¿s Â¿quenelleÂ¿ gesture . The controversial French âcomedianâ at the centre of the Nicolas Anelka anti-Semitism row was last night banned from comingÂ  to Britain. Dieudonne Mâbala Mâbala, who has convictions for inciting racial hatred, said he would come to London to support the WestÂ  Bromwich Albion striker, who faces a disciplinary hearing for carrying out a âquenelleâ salute during a December match against West Ham. But the Home Office has now given the performer persona non grata status, warning he is not allowed into the country. Airlines and other transport companies including the Eurostar high speed train service between Paris and London, as well as border officials, have been told that Dieudonne is an âexcludedâ individual. All can be fined up to Â£10,000 if the ban is breached. A Home Office spokesman said: âWe can confirm that Mr Dieudonne is subject to an exclusion order. âThe Home Secretary will seek to exclude an individual from the UK if she considers that there are public policy or public security reasons to do soâ. Many of Diedonneâs show were banned in France last month because of fear that he would mock the Second World War Holocaust. Anelka has been charged by the Football Association after performing a quenelle when he scored a goal against West Ham on December 28. He denies any wrongdoing. Instead, the 34-year-old player said he was expressing his support for âmy friendâ Dieudonne, insisting he is âneither anit-Semitic nor racistâ. Dieudonne has defamation convictions for inciting racial hatred but insists the gesture is simply anti-establishment. Last week more than half a million pounds in allegedly laundered cash was found in Diedonneâs home near Paris. Official searches were sanctioned by a French magistrate investigating money laundering and false tax declarations. Investigators also believe that Dieudonne sent the equivalent of more than Â£380,000 in cash to Cameroon, where his extended family live, since 2009. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala (right) wanted to travel to the UK to support the West Bromwich Albion footballer (left) And they allege that a production company owned by his wife, Noemie Montagne, bought one of his properties for Â£450,000 in cash when he owed the government Â£740,000. But Diedonneâs lawyer, Jacques Verdier, said the French were involved in an âorganised hunt for Dieudonneâ. Mr Verdier said his client was byÂ  no means anti-Semitic and âdoes not support the Third Reich.â Dieudonneâs last visit to Britain was in 2010 when he appeared in front of a large of audience of mainly French expatriates at a London theatre. He argues that his act is full of risque humour about a range of minority groups, including black people and Muslims. Dieudonne, who was brought up as a Christian, said that one of the reasons Anelka is being made a scapegoat in Britain is because he is a black Muslim who drives a Ferrari.","Dieudonne M'bala M'bala wanted to support West Bromwich Albion player .

"The Lockerbie bomber was buried in a Tripoli cemetery yesterday as the row over the case â and his release from jail â raged on. Up to 200 family and friends attended the burial of Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, whose return to Libya three years ago was greeted triumphantly by Colonel Gaddafiâs regime. The men who were closest to him in his life placed a white shroud across his body, while the traditional Arabic prayer Salat al Janaza was read out by an Iman. The 60-year-old, who died on Sunday from prostate cancer, is the only person convicted of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 with the loss of 270 lives. Pallbearers carry the coffin of convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset al-Megrahi during his burial at a cemetery in Janzour, west of Tripoli, earlier today . The body is carried from an ambulance for a funeral prayer before Al-Megrahi's burial. The Libyan was the only person ever convicted of the 1988 bombing of a PanAm flight over Lockerbie, Scotland . The coffin is covered with a white sheet with the Koran on it, lies in front of an imam during the funeral prayer . As his body was placed in the ground, the handful of family members present shouted out 'God is Great' and said private prayers. They included the former secret serviceman's four sons. His wife Aisha and one daughter remained at the family home, in accordance with Islamic tradition. By Muslim custom, Al-Mergahi's body had to be interned within 24 hours of his death on Sunday. His body was washed and groomed before the short burial service early on Monday afternoon. A period of mourning was then formally announced, and it will last for 40 days, as Al-Megrahi's surviving family receive mourners to their home. All had been extremely close to the late dictator Muammar Gaddafi, but have been extremely well treated since the Colonel was murdered by revolutionaries last year. Convicted Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi speaks during an interview his home in Tripoli in October last year(R) and (L) a younger Al-Megrahi in an undated photograph . Mohammed Bukharis, a neighbour, said: 'Brother Al-Megrahi is honoured and respected by all Libyans because of the suffering and pain he went through following his unjust conviction. 'Many view him as a national hero because he took the blame and the punishment for a crime that could have seen the whole country punished. 'There was never any resentment against the Al-Megrahi family when Gaddafi disappeared. On the contrary, all have been honoured.' Also among those attending today's funeral were relatives from Sebha, Al-Mergahi's hometown in the south of Libya. The town is the home of both Al-Mergahi's tribe and the Gaddafi tribe. This led to Colonel Gaddafi filling his intelligence services to members of the so-called Megarha, the tribe to which Al-Megrahi belonged. Al-Megrahi, who always maintained his innocence, is being carried by male relatives and friends of the family. Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi was 60 years old when he died . Final rest: Friends and relatives lower the coffin of Al-Megrahi . Mohammed Harizi, spokesman for Libya's ruling National Transitional Council, said: 'No official attended the funeral - it was a private family affair'. Al-Megrahi turned 60 on April 1st, but had been living on borrowed time since Britain released him on compassionate grounds in 2009 because of prostate cancer. Earlier this month he was rushed to a private medical clinic in Tripoli where he underwent a blood transfusion. When he was released from prison in Scotland in August 2009, Al-Megrahi was given just three months to live, but a combination of excellent medical facilities in Libya and the support of his family has allowed him to survive for almost three years. Al-Megrahi's house in Tripoli where the Lockerbie bomber spent his final years after being released on compassionate grounds . Friends and relatives pictured standing outside Al-Megrahi's house yesterday after the news of his death broke . A revolutionary new cancer treatment developed in London but not yet available in the UK had also enabled Al-Megrahi to survive. He took Abiraterone, the Â£3000-a-week hormone-based therapy drug discovered by scientists at the Institute of Cancer Research in London. Al Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 as it flew to New York from London, but has always insisted he is innocent. His release infuriated many relatives of those who died as the plane exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. There were even calls by American politicians for his extradition to face further charges in the USA, but Libya's new National Transitional Council always resisted them. He marked his 60th birthday surrounded by family and friends and vowed to 'prove my innocence' before he died. Al-Megrahi's freedom was largely due to work carried out by the Gaddafi regime, and especially by the dictator's son, Saif-Al Islam Gaddafi, who is currently being held in custody in Libya, pending a trial.

"A British tourist has died after apparently taking cocaine and heroin on a trip to Amsterdam. Joel McDevitt, 22, was taken by ambulance to a hospital in the city, but discharged himself before he was treated. Officers later found him nearby and took him to a police station, where he had to be resuscitated. He was then taken back to hospital, but died there on October 26. 'Such a top bloke': Joel McDevitt died after taking a 'quantity of drugs' with a friendÂ on a trip to Amsterdam . Officers believe he and an unnamed friend, both from Burnley, Lancashire, had 'taken a quantity of drugs' including cocaine and heroin. The second man remained in hospital in the city yesterday. Both men were found near a canal by police and were taken to different hospitals in the city. A spokesman for Amsterdam Police said: 'It is believed the man who died and the other man, who is still in hospital and also had to be resuscitated, had taken a quantity of drugs. 'An investigation is under way. 'Because the man who died had been in the care of the police, a state investigation has also been launched.'

Stanton had doctors appointments scheduled for today after which the team will have a better idea as to whether the Marlins have any hope him returning to the team before the season ends.

'That's why he's going through the evaluations and the tests to see where he's at.'

"Nepal will issue passports for three genders, with a third option for people who feel they are neither male or female. The long-awaited move follows a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2007 that recognised a third gender. It is a further sign the Himalayan nation is becoming more liberal following the end of a decade-long civil war in 2006. Nepal will issue passports for three genders with an option for people who feel they're neither male or female . Lok Bahadur Thapa, chief of the governmentâs passport department, said: 'We have changed the passport regulations and will add a third category of gender for those people who do not want to be identified as male or female.' Nepal joins Australia and New Zealand in recognising a third gender. Citizens will now have the chance to choose between three genders - male, female or indeterminate, marked by an 'x' in the passport. It is hoped the change will help combat widespread discrimination against the country's sexual minorities. Pinky Gurung, chief of the Blue Diamond Society, a leading gay rights group, said: 'It is a very progressive move and we welcome it.' He also called on authorities to amend existing legislation - such as inheritance laws - to recognise the third gender. The move follows a landmark ruling by the country's Supreme Court (pictured) that recognised third gender . Nepal emerged from a decade of conflict between government forces and Maoist rebels in 2006. The aim of the civil war was to overthrow the Nepalese monarchy and establish a 'People's Republic'. After the end of the war - which saw the end of the 239-year-old Nepalese monarchy and a constituent assembly election held - the country started to acknowledge the rights of the LGBT community. Since then, same-sex marriages have taken place in public (although they are still unrecognised in law) and gay pride parades and beauty contests have been held in the capital Kathmandu. Despite that, gay sex remains illegal with a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment, and gay rights activists say the LGBT community continues to face discrimination. The country is preparing its first constitution after the abolition of the monarchy. The LGBT community hopes that the charter - expected to be drawn up this month - will ensure greater rights to minority groups. Elsewhere, India' Supreme Court recognised the third gender last year. This will apply to all identity documents, including a birth certificate, passport and driving licence.","Long-awaited move follows court ruling thatÂ recognisedÂ a third gender .

"A passenger dialled 999 and reported his drink-driver friend to police after she confessed to getting behind the wheel after downing three pints, a court heard. Sian Adam, 27, was driving a male friend home from the Man of Kent pub in Rochester, Kent, when she admitted to him that she had been drinking alcohol. The front seat passenger, who was not named in court, demanded she pulled over before calling 999 to report her for drink driving on December 12 last year. Sian Adam, pictured above, was arrested for drink driving after her friend dialled 999 and reported her to the police . When police arrived on the scene they arrested the young woman as she walked away from her car. Her  passenger, who had reported her to police, was still sitting in the car and told police it was him who called them. A breath test found that Adam was almost twice the legal limit and gave a reading of Â 67 micrograms of alcohol in 100 milliliters of breath. The legal limit is 35 micrograms. Medway Magistrates Court heard how the pair had 'got into an argument' after she admitted drinking three pints of lager. Adam and her friend had been to the Man of Kent in Rochester, Kent, Â on December 12, last year .

"A doctor who quarantined herself for three weeks after treating dozens of ebola patients in West Africa has vowed to return to disease ravaged Liberia to help more victims. Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from Cardiff, has today spoken of her ordeal for the first time, revealing of the 100 patients she helped, just three survived. The 32-year-old spent a fortnight in Liberia with relief organisation Samaritan's Purse, treating victims of the epidemic. During that time she watched as two colleagues, Americans Dr Kent Brantly and aid worker Nancy Writebol fell ill with the deadly virus, helping nurse them before they were flown home for treatment. Scroll down for video . Dr Nathalie MacDermott, has been revealed as the British national, who put herself into quarantine after returning from Liberia fearing she had ebola. The 32-year-old is back at work at Singleton Hospital in Swansea after health officials gave her the all-clear . Dr MacDermott, pictured in her protective clothing, right, worked for the organisation Samaritan's Purse in the Liberian capital of Monrovia, at the same treatment clinic as American victims of the deadly virus Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol . After returning to her home in Cardiff, Dr MacDermott said she decided to confine herself to her flat for three weeks, fearing she could have contracted the disease. Following advice from Public Health Wales, she only kept in touch with friends and family via Skype, even becoming a virtual guest at a wedding. But the 32-year-old has now been given the all-clear and has rejoined colleagues at the Swansea-based Singleton Hospital. She said: 'Before I went out there it was apparent to me that there was an epidemic that was spiralling out of control. 'When I got out there with Samaritan's Purse I felt like we were sitting on a timebomb waiting to explode. 'And it was very apparent that there were increasing numbers of ebola cases and there were not enough staff to look after them and they were struggling to get on top of everything. 'It was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life.' At her treatment centre in the capital, Monrovia, there was a 90 per cent mortality rate among the roughly 100 patients she dealt with. 'It was very challenging to manage so many patients and see so few survive,' she said. 'Ebola is a horrible disease and the way it causes people to die is unpleasant. 'And . the trauma to the families is terrible - knowing that their loves ones . had ebola and the likelihood they wouldn't survive was very difficult to . manage as well.' Dr . MacDermott took over the day-to-day running of the centre when Dr . Brantly, 33, and 59-year-old Ms Writebol were isolated after developing . the potentially fatal condition. Both . were flown back to the U.S. for treatment and have since been cured, . with Dr Brantly describing his return to health as 'miraculous'. When the 32-year-old returned home to Cardiff she voluntarily put herself in quarantine, not leaving her flat for 21 days, only contacting her family and friends via Skype . Dr MacDermott, said: 'When I got out there with Samaritan's Purse I felt like we were sitting on a timebomb waiting to explode. It was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life' Dr MacDermott said: 'When we heard Kent and Nancy had contracted ebola it was a scary time. 'But I didn't have a lot of time to worry about it as we were so busy. 'Kent had isolated himself as soon as he had a fever and I helped to look after him - along with the rest of the team - before he was flown back to the U.S. 'As well as a friend and a colleague he was the medical director of our unit and after he left I took over the day-to-day running of the unit. 'It was extremely stressful so I didn't have a lot of time to think about it. 'It was probably one of the most traumatic experiences of my life' - Dr Nathalie MacDermott . 'The most worrying thing was how he and Nancy had become infected. We all had personal protective equipment and very tight protocols which had not been broken.' Dr MacDermott said while beds were in short supply the unit had plenty of IV drips, antibiotics, anti-malaria drugs, painkillers and other medical equipment. But without a specific treatment for Ebola she knew most of her patients would die. Of the roughly 100 patients she helped cared for, just three survived. 'It's hard for a doctor to know that . they won't be able to save the vast majority of their patients but I . already knew that when I went to Liberia,' she said. 'I knew many local health care workers were frightened of their patients and the care they gave them was inconsistent. 'There . can be nothing worse than to die alone in pain and frightened so I went . there to help prevent some of this suffering - to care for them, to . manage their pain, to pray with them and to comfort them.' She said one of the most memorable days she spent in Liberia was when a boy of 12, called William, recovered and was able to be reunited with his family. Mrs Writebol and Dr Brantly were flown back to the U.S. in specially designed isolation pods and treated using the experimental ebola drug, Zmapp. Both have since made a full recovery . She added: 'We were so delighted when he got better and we were feeding him lots of biscuits. It was a great day in a very hard period of time.' Two of her other patients also survived ebola but Dr MacDermott was back in Wales when she was told they had been given the all-clear. Dr MacDermott, who wants to specialise in paediatric infectious diseases, said she would not hesitate to go back to Liberia. She added: 'There is so much work to be done and if I could get leave I would definitely go out there and help again. 'They need healthcare staff to not only care for patients but help to contain the spread of infection.' Ebola is a severe viral illness often characterised by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. In its early stages its symptoms can often be confused with a cold or flu. With Ebola, however, other symptoms emerge which include vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding.","Dr Nathalie MacDermott confined herself to her Cardiff flat for three weeks after arriving home from a two-week stint treating ebola victims in Liberia .

"His exploits on the football pitch are often picture perfect, and now Lionel Messi has been captured by one of Britain's most prominent artists. The FC Barcelona star is the subject of a new work by Damien Hirst. The piece, titled Beautiful Messi Spin Painting, will be auctioned next month as part of a campaign to help children in war-torn or poverty-stricken countries into education. Work of art: Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi has been captured in a new picture by British artist Damien Hirst . Messi also features in a piece by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. The 27-year-old conceded that he is 'not an expert in the world of art' but added: 'I am flattered that two great artists such as Takashi Murakami and Damien Hirst created a work of art with my image. 'I am immensely proud to be part of this creative process whose ultimate beneficiaries will be children in need. 'It is a unique experience. Also, I think that the fusion of art, sport and education is fantastic; all three fields have a lot in common.' Picture perfect: Lionel Messi has also been captured in piece by Japanese artist Takashi Murakami . The 1 in 11 initiative is being launched by the FC Barcelona Foundation, Reach Out To Asia (ROTA) and Unicef. Campaigners say that one in 11 children of primary school age are out of school. Messi said: 'I'm supporting the 1 in 11 campaign because I believe every child has the right to fulfil their potential and realise their dreams. Education is fundamental to this, but millions of children across the world are out of school and not getting the start in life they are entitled to. 'I believe that through sport we can teach values of respect, teamwork and effort, and ultimately inspire children to attend and stay on in school, so they will receive the quality education which will equip them with the skills they need for life.' Tennis star Serena Williams is also backing the campaign. She said: 'In many countries we take it for granted that every child has the right to receive a quality education, but '1 in 11' children around the world do not enjoy that right - and without it, may never reach their full potential,' said Williams. 'We need to kick start global progress and get that number down to zero, so every child has the chance to learn.' Footballer Lionel Messi, pictured left, and tennis star Serena Williams, pictured right, are supporting the 1 in 11 campaignÂ to help children in war-torn or poverty-stricken countries into education . Works donated by artists including Hirst and Murakami will be auctioned at Sotheby's in London on February 12. The campaign aims to raise funds to extend educational opportunities to marginalised children in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Nepal, with the goal of expanding to more countries.","Footballer Lionel Messi has been captured by British artist Damien Hirst .

But nevertheless fans and players alike seem delighted to welcome back El Nino. Antoine Griezmann and Diego Godin dedicated their goals to Torres with his celebration during the win against Levante on Saturday as he watched on from the stands.
