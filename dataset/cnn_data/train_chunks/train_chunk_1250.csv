"Inside the Maracana on Sunday July 13, a decade of planning and preparation was finally realised when Philipp Lahm lifted Germany’s fourth World Cup. They were a tournament team, built to last the distance in Brazil under the astute guidance of their coach Joachim Low. On Tuesday, in Roy Hodgson’s first major interview since England exited the World Cup with one point, he suggested we are on the same upward trajectory. Here comes the killer quote, delivered by Hodgson at our national stadium, from Tuesday's interview on Sky Sports News HQ: ‘I don’t believe in the nonsense spoken about the identity of certain countries and how they play,’ claimed England’s head coach. ‘I don’t see a vast amount different between how we try and the way Germany try to play.' VIDEO Scroll down to watch Germany celebrate World Cup victory with on-stage stunt . Deluded: England boss Roy Hodgson believes there isn't much difference between the Three Lions & Germany . Spot the difference: Germany players lifted the World Cup after a storming summer in Brazil . Early exit: England failed to win a match and were sent packing after the group stage in Brazil . To put that into context, during a friendly in England’s backyard last November, Toni Kroos had 125 touches of the ball and set up Per Mertesacker’s winning goal. Wayne Rooney, cast in the same role as Kroos that night, had just 42. Until Hodgson, or someone else in his position for that matter, accepts that Germany are currently operating at an elite level we have no chance of catching them, let alone overtaking them. ‘Now there is a major difference between the 11 players in the German shirt and the 11 players in the England shirt,’ added Hodgson. ‘But if we are talking about how they attack and build up their attacks. Or how they keep possession and seek for openings when they have got the ball, I don’ t see a vast amount of difference in philosophy or style. And the same defensively. Random things that happen in the game make all the difference. I could give you six or seven examples from the World Cup that made winners into losers.’ England were losers, beaten by Italy in their opening group game in Manaus and swatted aside by the brilliance of Luis Suarez when they played Uruguay in Sao Paulo. Hard to take:  Hodgson watched his England team lose to Uruguay - after going down to Italy . Hard to take: Steven Gerrard was comforted by Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan wrecked his World Cup . Let us not forget that this England team were out of the World Cup before 12 teams had even played their second game. They left with one point, as did Japan, Iran, Ghana and South Korea. Hodgson didn’t offer to resign after being backed by FA chairman Greg Dyke. The football’s broke, but we are not prepared to do anything to fix it. ‘I would quite happily relinquish this job when my employers don’t want me here any more and the players don’t have the respect necessary and they don’t want to continue to play for me,’ added Hodgson. ‘In that moment, if it is time for me to walk away I will do so. But this time it was made clear to me that that wasn’t the situation, that the FA wanted me to continue in the job and the feedback within the team was the same. ‘You walk away when you can’t stand the pressure, or you don’t feel you are good enough to do the job and in that situation I can safely and strongly say that I never felt that at all. ‘As a result we have to look forward to 2016 and make certain that we don’t allow it to happen again and hope we don’t have the same lack of fortune.’ VIDEO Record-breaker Klose retires from international football . Top of the world: Mario Goetze was the German hero with the winner against Argentina in the World Cup final . Two bad: Suarez (right) beat Joe Hart (left) twice as England lost 2-1 to Uruguay . England play a friendly against Norway at Wembley on September 3 before the Euro 2016 qualifier, against Switzerland in Bern, five days later. There will have to be some restructuring of the team, in part due to captain Steven Gerrard’s retirement from international duty. ‘It wasn’t easy for him to turn his back on England because he so much enjoyed playing for England and he’s done such a good job for us,’ added Hodgson. ‘I went through all the possible discussion points that you could have and I made my points of why I wanted him to stay on and he promised to give it a thought.’ Another captain, likely to be Wayne Rooney, will be chosen next month as Hodgson attempts to repair some of the damage from England’s disastrous World Cup. ‘We don’t need to compare ourselves to other European countries, let’s just stay as England,’ he said. ‘I have got a big job to choose that captain. I have half-chosen him. The person who is captain for the Norway game will be the person I will be designating to hopefully be the captain in 2016. ‘We have a lot of rebuilding to do, not only of our team but also rebuilding all the faith that people showed us.’ Prices for England’s next game against Norway at Wembley are priced at £30,£40,£50 and £60. Family enclosure tickets are priced at £20 and £10 for U16's. There is a large family enclosure for this match and over half of the tickets sold will be under£30 if demand dictates.

"This is the moment a bedraggled and emaciated cat was pulled from a car engine after being stuck inside for two weeks. Princess was unwittingly driven around for hundreds of miles while trapped in her owner's BMW before she was discovered. It was only after the pet clawed her way through a coolant hose - triggering a warning light - that owner Julie Tansley, 40, of Nottingham, realised where she had been. Princess the cat spent two weeks stuck under the bonnet of her owners car . The bedraggled moggy was hauled out of the engine bay of the BMW 1-series by its shocked owners on Wednesday . The mother-of-three, from Nottingham, had mounted a desperate search for her beloved cat after she went missing on May 7. Unaware that the long-haired black cat was under the bonnet of her car, Ms Tansley drove her car as normal and even went through a car wash at one point. But she couldn't believe it when she looked inside the engine and found the filthy moggy staring back at her. Princess was wedged so firmly inside the engine bay that it took a whopping 45 minutes to get her out. Ms Tansley, partner Trevor Lee, 46, and friends had to partially dismantle her black convertible in order to free the stricken cat. The bedraggled cat was yanked from the car after she clawed her way through a coolant hose - triggering a warning light. The car was partially dismantled so Princess could be rescued from inside . Remarkably, Princess was not hurt and is already on the way to a full recovery. Ms Tansley said the cat has acted like nothing happened since her ordeal ended on Wednesday. She said: 'I had no idea where she had gone, then I was driving along and noticed the warning light came on the dashboard. 'I didn't know what the light actually was so I checked in the book and saw that it was coolant. 'We opened the bonnet and there she was, stuck inside the engine. 'I tried to get to her but I just couldn't, in the end I phone the guy who lives across the road because he owns a scrap yard. 'He sent around one of his mechanics to see what they could do. emarkably, Princess was not hurt and has acted like nothing happened since her ordeal ended on Wednesday .

'They had to take one of the headlights out and take other things out too before Princess could be reached. 'I have absolutely no idea how she managed to get there. It wasn't until I opened the bonnet I had any idea that she could be there. 'As you can see on the video she had no way of getting out of there by herself. It wasn't as if she was curled up lying down there either, she was stretching up on her back legs in there. 'If the warning light hadn't come on I dread to think what would have happened. 'She was covered in horrible coolant when we got her out, we had to wash her down straight away. Princess with owner Julie Tansley and daughter Trinity. The famil had launched a desperate search for the cat . The cat was very thin as it had been without food and water for two weeks. But the family said she's happily eating and walking around as if nothing happened . 'She's alright now though, but she is really really thin as she hasn't eaten for two weeks, but she's happily eating and walking around as if nothing happened. 'Now we've got quite an expensive repair coming up, I don't know how but it seems she was so desperate to get out the clawed right through the hose. 'It has cost over £300 to replace that hose, so it's an expensive way to travel having your cat with you. 'It's just unbelievable, we took her all over Nottingham, I mean we've driven to and from school, work, even through the jet wash with her in there.'

"Squeezed into a four-bedroom council house in Guernsey lives a woman branded the UK's most prolific single mother. Joanne Watson, 40, has 14 children, ranging in age from three to 22 and . survives largely on state benefits after the breakdown of her marriage . in 2010. Once . celebrated in endless articles in the press for her clan of immaculately . turned-out blonde children, who were then supported entirely by the . salary of her hardworking husband John, Joanne Watson and her family . have now become figures of ridicule - and even hate. Mum of Britain's biggest family Joanne Watson, 40, left, stands at the head of her 14 children at their family home in St Martin, Guernsey: From left to right, Indianna, three; Tallulah, four; Armani (known as Arnie), five; Nerilly-Jade, seven; Lilly-Arna eight; Charlie, nine; Febrianne, 10; Brittany, 11; Caitlin, 12; Georgia, 15; Mariah, 16; Shanice, 19; Bradley, 21; and Natasha 22 . The family's bubble was burst four years ago when an accident meant John, 46, had to give up work as a lorry driver. The . financial pressure of caring for his 14 children meant John made a . decision he will forever regret. As his health improved and with bills . mounting, John claimed benefits while simultaneously taking some . earnings. He was caught, and the man who for . two decades had been seen as the model father was sent to prison. The . couple, who Joanne says had been arguing for years, separated and . divorced. 'I feel pretty sore about what went . on,' John says now. 'I've been married 20 years and been a good father. I've worked hard. Nobody can say I haven't, because I have.' 'I did get done for benefit fraud,' John admits.' But I paid my punishment, I went to prison and I paid all the money back. Joanne leaps to her ex-husband's . defence. 'He wasn't doing it to go on holidays and buy mobile phones,' Jo says. 'He was doing it to support us.' The publicity the case attracted has . made life - one that was already played out in the public eye - yet more . difficult for the Watson children. Georgia, 15, says her regular . appearance in the papers makes life at her school in St Martins very . difficult. Quality time: Joanne relaxes with her 14 children in the garden outside their family home . 'When we're in the papers, everyone . talks about it at school the next day,' she says. 'Last time I was in . the paper everyone was discussing it. People were leaving messages on my . Facebook page. There were over 100 comments and not one of them good. 'A boy at school the next day saw me . and said, ""Oy, what's a Watson doing here?"" I said I'd been here all . along but he said I shouldn't be there because there was too many of us. 'We're only a family. We're like everyone else,' she adds. But Georgia is not entirely like . everyone else. She is a sweet, calm girl with an outlook that is mature . beyond her years. She helps tirelessly at home: planning school uniforms . and packed lunches for the rest of the children, bathing her . three-year-old sister Indianna and putting her to bed. While her home life is no doubt happy . and full of love, she has, perhaps, missed out on some of the carefree . moments that children in smaller families take for granted. Son Bradley, a professional boxer, says the taunts are never-ending. 'If your name is Watson, it doesn't . go down too well,' 21-year-old Bradley says evenly. 'They never say . anything to my face, but your ears are always burning. I don't like it, . but what can you do about it?' But while the children of the . household struggle with life under the microscope, Jo is defiant about . the public's reaction to her and her brood. 'When I was in town this week, a . woman looked at me and said, ""Oh look, it's the baby-making machine."" I . just glared at her,' Jo adds. 'Sod them all,' she says. 'This is the way I am.' Despite Jo's ability to rise above . the attention though, it's clear that her children despair of their . mother's continual procreation - and of their own cramped (if always . neat and tidy) quarters. 'Our family is huge, laments one of . the littlest boys. There's a new one born nearly every year. Being in a . big family is horrible. If she has any more, that's it, this house won't . fit us.' Indeed, the house is full to . bursting. With 11 children still living at home, getting ready for . school is a military style operation, with little uniformed bodies . filing out of the front door in a seemingly endless line. Packed lunches . are a production line involving bags of fruit and dozens of sandwiches. There are mountains of washing to be done daily - 56 loads a month, to . be precise. Supplies, supplies: Joanne at home with her weekly shopping . Joanne pays only £27 a week rent for . the house, a heavily subsidised fraction of the normal cost, receives a . total of £160 a week in family allowance for the 11 children still . living at home, and another £405 a week in supplementary benefit. But . money is still tight, and a budget must be adhered to. And since her marriage broke down, . with a little help from her children, Jo has to do it all herself. But . despite the workload, Joanne believes firmly that ending her crumbling . marriage was the right thing to do. 'When I was expecting my 14th child, . my husband phoned the papers to tell them so they could arrange a . photoshoot. But I refused to do it. I couldn't go on playing happy . families. It's not right. I couldn't take any more. The way we were . arguing, I didn't want the children to hear it any more.' Since her marriage broke down, Joanne . has been on the look out for a new love - and hasn't given up on the . idea of having another baby. In the hopes of meeting a new man, . Joanne signed up to local dating agencies. But even there she met with . prejudice. One dating agency refused point blank to have her on their . books, saying the men they dealt with wouldn't want someone like Joanne. 'She made me cry,' says Joanne. 'She . said the men wouldn't want someone on state benefits, with so many . children, or living where I live.' But Joanne has developed a thick . skin. Last year, Joanne was left devastated when her pregnancy with what . would be her fifteenth child ended in miscarriage. She had fallen . pregnant just three weeks after embarking upon an affair with leisure . centre worker Craig Le Sauvage, 35, who was an old neighbour. Two weeks later, she split up from . Craig, who subsequently told his story to the papers. Headlines . appeared: ""How I escaped the baby machine"", talking of how Jo bombarded . Craig with texts begging for a fifteenth baby. Joanne was devastated, . but now says that nothing people say about her can match the hurt of . losing the baby she named Billy. Fighting back tears, Jo looks through . a box of scans and tiny foot and handprints from the little boy. 'Holding his little body, seeing his tiny feet and hands. That hurts,' she says. 'People criticising me, slagging me off, that's not hurt.' Joanne's 16-year-old daughter Mariah . recently had her first child - making Joanne four times a grandmother. The media glare this brought upon the family (and their decision to take . part in Channel 4 documentary 15 Kids and Counting, which aired last . night) means the Watsons are unlikely to be out of the headlines any . time soon. But Joanne, who once enjoyed the fame and notoriety her large family brought her, now insists she regrets their infamy. 'I don't want anyone coming to our house looking for a dirty story,' says Joanne. I wish they would just leave us alone.'

An effigy of President Barack Obama is burnt by Filipino activists during a rally as a 10-year pact was signed . The presence of foreign troops is a sensitive issue in the Philippines, a former American colony . The Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close down U.S. bases at Subic and Clark, northwest of Manila. However, it ratified a pact with the United States allowing temporary visits by American forces in 1999, four years after China seized a reef the Philippines contests. Following the September 11, 2001, attacks in the United States, hundreds of U.S. forces descended in the southern Philippines under that accord to hold counter terrorism exercises with Filipino troops fighting Muslim militants. However this time, the focus of the Philippines and its underfunded military has increasingly turned to external threats as territorial spats with China in the potentially oil and gas-rich South China Sea heated up in recent years.

U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg and Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin signed the agreement at the main military camp in the capital, Manila, ahead of Obama's stop and portrayed it is as a central part of his weeklong Asia trip. The Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement will give American forces temporary access to selected military camps and allow them to preposition fighter jets and ships. The deal was signed hours before Obama arrived in Manila on the last leg of a four-country Asian tour, following stops in Japan, South Korea and Malaysia. Goldberg said the agreement will 'promote peace and security in the region,' and allow U.S. and Philippine forces to respond faster to disasters and other contingencies. It is not known how many additional U.S. troops would be deployed 'on temporary and rotational basis.'

'The Philippines' immediate and urgent motivation is to strengthen itself and look for a security shield with its pitiful military,' Manila-based political analyst Ramon Casiple said. 'The U.S. is looking for a re-entry to Asia, where its superpower status has been put in doubt.' The convergence could work to deter China's increasingly assertive stance in disputed territories, Casiple said. However, it could further antagonise Beijing, which sees such tactical alliance as a U.S. strategy to contain its rise, and encourage China to intensify its massive military buildup, he said. Hundreds of American military personnel have been deployed in the southern Philippines since 2002 to provide counterterrorism training and serve as advisers to Filipino soldiers, who have battled Muslim militants for decades.

The agreement says the U.S. will 'not establish a permanent military presence or base in the Philippines' in compliance with Manila's constitution. A Filipino base commander will have access to areas to be shared with American forces, according to the primer. Disagreements over Philippine access to designated U.S. areas within local camps hampered negotiations for the agreement last year. The agreement will increase coordination between U.S. and Filipino forces, boost the 120,000-strong Philippine military's capability to monitor and secure the country's territory and respond more rapidly to natural disasters and other emergencies. U.S. President Barack Obama reviews the honor guard with Philippines President Benigno Aquino III, left, at Malacanang Palace in Manila . While the U.S. military will not pay rent for local camp areas, the Philippines will own buildings and infrastructure to be built or improved by the Americans and reap economic gains from the U.S. presence, it has been said. Chinese paramilitary ships took effective control of the disputed Scarborough Shoal, a rich fishing ground off the northwestern Philippines, in 2012. Last year, Chinese coast guard ships surrounded another contested offshore South China Sea territory, the Second Thomas Shoal, where they have been trying to block food supplies and rotation of Filipino marines aboard a grounded Philippine navy ship in the remote coral outcrops. China has ignored Philippine diplomatic protests and Manila's move last year to challenge Beijing's expansive territorial claims in the South China Sea before an international arbitration tribunal. It has warned the U.S. to stay out of the Asian dispute.","Military will get greater access to bases across the region .

"It was billed as the ultimate test of man vs machine, with a world champion table tennis player taking on one of the world's most advanced robots. Footage put online shows the pair competing in a head to head contest, claiming a real match was being played - with a teaser being watcher over a million times on YouTube. However, MailOnline can reveal the stunt was just a TV ad for the robot-making firm. Scroll down to see the video - and how it was made . The match takes place in a giant warehouse, pitting German no 1 Timo Boll against Kuko's robot . The robot was even programmed to perform trick shots such as balancing the ball on a bat . German No 1 Timo Boll faced off against a Kuka KR Aglius. to celebrate the opening of an inaugural Kuka plant in Shanghai. The new KUKA Shanghai plant will produce 3,000 KUKA KR QUANTEC robots and KRC4 universal control units annually for its Asia-based customers . The  Kuka KR Agilus was chosen because of its high levels of precision at fast speeds, while former world No 1 Boll has enjoyed a successful career that has spanned almost two decades and won a Bronze medal with the German team at the 2012 London Olympics. The stunning ad shows the pair in head to head combat, fighting an astonishing game to to final point - where Boll triumphs over the machine. However, Kuka today revealed the match was a stunt for its latest TV ad - and showed how it did it. The team took over a huge warehouse in Bulgaria, and flew in a programmer to program the series of shots into the robot arm. Multiple cameras were used to record the action after every shot was choreographed . Shots were replayed time and time again, with a programmer on hand to tweak the robot's movements . Despite this, the robot still manages to show incredible agility, even at one point balancing a ball on the racquet. Boll said he was intrigued by the stunt. 'I'm happy to play against the robot, but what makes a good table tennis player is speed, agility, and action - and those are attributes a modern robot needs to have. Hans Neubert, the director of the ad, said 'It's a gigantic production . 'We are filming with two cameras, and two superstars.' He admitted that although many of the sequences were preplanned, watching the robot and player recreate them over and over to get the right shots was an incredible experience. Every shot was painstakingly programmed to make the match look real . The ad was filmed in a giant warehouse in Bulgaria . 'These two attack each other all day long. 'The speed at which the two have been going at each other is fascinating. 'You don't have a chance following them with a camera. 'Playing the ball on the same point over and over again with such precision is unbelievable. 'Their precision is to the millimetre, its crazy.'","Match billed as ultimate test of man vs machine - and teaser had over a million YouTube views .

The youngster, who created his own . logo and did all his own marketing, is a dab hand at spreadsheets, . margins and business rates. He proudly hands out business cards . emblazoned with 'creative director' to fellow pupils at Swanbourne House . School, Buckinghamshire. And he already has big plans for the future. As well as adding to his business . portfolio he hopes hopes to direct his own film after writing a . screenplay featuring the characters from his sweet shop. The schoolboy has gone into partnership with his mother Rebecca who runs an online confectionary store. Sweet success: Harry has recently launched his third business, an online sweet store . A jar of the 'Not before Tea' range of sweets available on nine-year-old Henry Patterson's website . Henry has come up with the idea, designed the logo and marketed his new business a children's sweet shop called Not Before Tea . Henry, whose father Julian, 52, works . in marketing, said: 'I started coming up with business ideas when I was . five. I started selling manure and I loved it - even if it was a bit . smelly. 'My friends couldn't believe it when I . set up the sweet shop. But I don't think they were really surprised . either because I've set up my other businesses before. 'No one knows the type of sweets that . children like better than a child. I just love looking at the products . there in front of me. 'The best part of the sweet shop is . that I get to taste test all the sweets. My favourite one is the old . fashioned liquorice straws. 'I get five per cent of what I make into my bank account and I try and spend it on things for the businesses. 'I want to try and carry on with this for the next ten years, but I want to set up more businesses after this one. I made a film about a tadpole that can't swim. I think I would like to be a film director when I'm older.' A screenshot of  Henry Patterson's Sherbet Pip company website . Henry hopes hopes to direct his own film after writing a screenplay featuring the characters from his sweet shop . Henry has created a whole story around his sweet products with two central characters - Sherbet and Pip. His jar containers come with pens so kids can doodle on their own designs and also include reward stickers for parents to give children who clean their teeth before bed. Henry added: 'I thought I didn't want to do just sweets so I came up with the idea of Sherbet and Pip. I really loved English at school and so I thought we should have a story to go along with the shop. 'I hate cleaning my teeth after I have eaten sweets but love getting stickers at the dentist. That's how I got the idea.' Henry has contributed his own product range to the site with sweet jars that include mud, worms and alien themed sweets. His mother, a PR manager, set up her Sherbetpip.co.uk site as part of a programme with Bedfordshire County Council that shows young people how easy it can be to start a small business. The pair are now in talks with producers at ITV's Saturday Night Takeaway about featuring the sweet jars in hampers to be given away at the show. Mrs Patterson, 39, said: 'Henry's got a business brain and thinks this venture is the start of other adventures. He could tell you how much everything costs and how much it costs to put together each jar. 'He has three ambitions. One is to make £10 from this business - which he's already achieved, one is to meet David Walliams and the other is to see his products sold in a big shop. 'He plans to keep this business going until he is 16 and all the money he makes is going into a bank account to help start any other future businesses. 'I'm really proud of him. But this is just how he works. He rings me from school and asks me if the site is live. 'But the only thing he is not allowed to do is pack the jars with sweets because of hygiene and health and safety. If he wants money he has to go out and try and make it himself.'","Schoolboy slicker Henry Patterson started first enterprise aged seven .

"Brisbane mother Deborah Camacho has joined the fight to legalise medicinal marijuana in a bid to find an alternative treatment for her nine-year-old daughter whose life is plagued by seizures. Isabella Camacho, 9, has suffered from Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy with no cure, since she was 10 months old. The condition means she has a 20 per cent chance of dying before her 18th birthday from a condition which had left her with behavioural problems such as speech delay and movement and balance issues. But the most significant impact on her life is her daily seizures which can last up to 45 minutes. Since feeding Isabella two milligrams of cannabis a day, the Brisbane mother says her daughter's life has been turned around and her seizures have drastically improved. Deborah Camacho (left) has been giving her daughter Isabella Camacho (right) cannabis oil in an attempt to treat her life-threatening seizures . 'She was rashing up, blue in the face, unconscious, eyes trolled back, foaming at the moth – it was absolutely horrific,' Deborah told the Daily Mail Australia of her eldest daughter's first seizure when she was just 10 months old. The mother-of-four says she now suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and anxiety from having to deal with her daughter's daily seizures. Ms Camacho said she constantly lived in fear that each seizure could be the last. She said her two sons and second daughter also suffer from anxiety worrying about the health of their sister. 'Doctors tell us that to give her the best quality of life we have to limit their seizures,' Deborah said. 'You have to get the paramedics out each time and all my other children are affected because they have to watch each time, and they always ask me ""is Isabella going to die this time, mummy?"" 'Her seizures are started by any trigger - if she doesn’t have enough sleep, she'll have it in the playground at school.' Isabella, pictured here having a seizure four years ago, suffers from Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy with no cure. She has tonic clonic seizures that can last up to 45 minutes . During a seizure, Deborah said all she can do is put her daughter in the recovery position and wait for paramedics to arrive . Taking part in a variety of support groups, Deborah even placed a video of one of Isabella's seizure online in which she can be heard trying to organise her other children for the afternoon so she could accompany Isabella to the emergency room - a standard everyday procedure for the family. She recently placed Isabella on a non-government pilot study run by de-registered Sydney doctor Andrew Katelaris, which is testing the effectiveness of CBD cannabis in treating children with severe epilepsy. Since feeding her daughter two milligrams of marijuana oil each day, Deborah says she has seen an enormous improvements. Isabella's extreme 45 minute seizures were reduced from three a week to just one every month. 'She was becoming much more awake – it's like her brian is waking up, it's amazing,' she said. 'She has been able to endure all day whereas I'd be rushing to school to pick her up each day when she has a seizure. The mother-of-four said her eldest daughter's mental and physical health has greatly improved since she began the marijuana study: 'she's more alert more aware and more happy now' The non-official pilot study is being run by de-registered Sydney doctor Andrew Katelaris. He is striving to make CBD dominant cannabis, which he says does not have an intoxicating  effect on users like THC dominant cannabis, approved for medical research . 'Her speech is improving, she's even able to sing songs now - she's sounding like a teenager actually, singing all these love songs! 'Her appetite has improved greatly, she's more alert more aware and more happy now. She was always crying on this other medication, like real tears too like she had depression, and now she's just happy.' Dr Katelaris, who supplies the marijuana, told the Daily Mail Australia that the cannabis used to treat the seizures did not contain the THC chemical that intoxicated users and made them 'high'. Instead, the strain contained the non-intoxicating CBD chemical, he said. 'They're both cabanoids but THC is considered the intoxicating version while CBD has anti-inflammatory effects - that’s why its so useful in brain disorders and it has been proven to reduce dementia in dementia suffering animals at Sydney University,' he said. Dr Andrew Katelaris said his pilot study was inspired by the medical marijuana movement which is taking off in certain states in the US . Despite receiving enormous amounts of criticism for her stance, Deborah (left) refuses to back down from her goal to make medical marijuana available as an alternate treatment in hospital settings . Deborah said she decided to take part in the study after growing tired of constantly trying various medications which had bad side effects such as one which shrinks her daughter's gums. 'One of them is called Frisium which is going to be hell getting her off. It has like withdrawal symptoms that crack addicts go through – I'm highly against drugs,' the Brisbane mother said. 'I just think I'd rather have plant-based medicine for my baby instead of all this crap she's been given over the years that's wrecking her body.' Despite receiving enormous amounts of criticism for her stance, Deborah refuses to back down from her goal to make medical marijuana available as an alternate treatment in hospital settings. 'A lot of mums are too scared because it's currently illegal, but when you actually stop, read and educate yourself its actually something that's going to help these kids and it is a disgrace that it isn't offered - there's people's lives at risk,' Deborah said. Dr Katelaris, whose study was triggered by a recent break through in the United States, is also struggling to be given a chance to present his controversial findings. I want CBD dominant cannabis moved out of the prohibition schedule and approved for medical use because CBD is not only not intoxicating but annihilates the toxic effects of THC,' he said.","Isabella Camacho, nine, has daily seizures which can last 45 minutes due to her Dravet syndrome .

"A grand jury in Missouri has been given until January next year to decide whether Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson should be charged for the shooting  of teenager Michael Brown. The deadline for the grand jury has been extended until January 7 to allow them to consider whether there is enough evidence to criminally charge Wilson, CNN reports. But this does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will take that long. During this time, the grand jury will mull testimony and come to a decision whether they believe Wilson committed a crime when he shot dead Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, on August 9. Scroll down for video . Michael Brown, 18,  was unarmed when he was shot dead by a white Missouri police officer on August 9 . Outrage over the shooting led to days of protests and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role . St. Louis County Judge Carolyn Whittington initially said the grand jury could sit until November. But she extended that order for another 60 days on September 10, taking the grand jury's meetings into early 2015. So far, police and witnesses have given different accounts of what happened in the moments before the shooting. The confusion  fuelled tensions in Ferguson, where outrage over the shooting led to days of protests and a heated debate over whether Brown's race played a role in his death. Brown, like two-thirds of his neighbors in Ferguson, was black. Wilson is white, like most of the city's police officers. The grand jury, which meets in secrecy, consists of nine white people (six men and three women) and three black people (two women and a man), court officials have said. Darren Wilson is waiting to hear whether he will be charged in  connection with the shooting of Michael Brown . Police officers point their weapons at demonstrators protesting against the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson. Tear gas and stun grenades were fired at protesters  after days of unrest sparked by the killing .","Deadline to decide if Darren Wilson will be charged extended until January 7 .

"The South Korean Government is investigating reports Kim Jong Un imposed another purge on those closest to him after rumours of North Korea's number two leader Choe Ryong Hae's disappearance. The statement was made by the South Korean Government on Monday after mounting speculation since last week that Choi was in jail and being interrogated. The Times reported South Korea’s Unification ministry, which deals with relations between the two countries, said it was 'looking into' the rumours.

Treachery: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Choe Ryong Hae pictured in July last year, before rumours of a disappearance surfaced . Crazed: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle Jang Song Thaek executed in December last year . It is assumed Choi held several top positions in the North Korean leadership after Kim ordered the high-profile execution of Jang Song Thaek, the previous incumbent and Kim's uncle and mentor. There is speculation Choi displeased Kim by taking management of several state-owned industries. Rumors about Choi's disappearance have intensified since his no-shows  at public events he normally would have attended with Kim in February. There was further speculation on Monday about his whereabouts when North Korea fired short-range missiles into the sea off its eastern coast as an act of defiance to South Korea. The missiles as well as a series of Scud missiles, which were fired last week, were seen by Seoul as a signal from Pyongyang that it is still developing ballistic missile technology as part of its nuclear weapons program. Taken out: Kim Jong-Un ordered the execution of his uncle Jang Song-Thaek (left) in December last year, after a special military tribunal found him guilty of treason . Executed: Jang Song Thaek, previously considered the second most powerful man in the secretive state, is seen with his hands bound as he is dragged into the court by uniformed personnel  shortly before his death . Kim's uncle Jang, 67, was executed in December, after being accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime. Jang was married to Kim Kyong Hui, Kim's aunt and former leader Kim Jong-Il's sister and was killed by firing squad. It has since been claimed that members . of his uncle's family were rounded up by the dozen following his arrest . and subsequent death in December. Jang Song-Thaek's children, brothers and grandchildren were condemned to death, according to media reports in South Korea. Tension: Missiles have been fired by North Korea as a possible sign it is developing ballistic missile technology as part of its nuclear weapons program . Although . South Korean news agencies have published unconfirmed information from . North Korea in the past, the report from Daily NK back up the claims of a . 'purge' of Jang's family. As . well as his uncle, other high-ranking members of the military have been . purged by Kim Jong-Un, including three defence ministers and three . chiefs of the army's general staff. Kim Chol, the vice minister of the army, was reportedly put to death in October 2012 by soldiers firing mortar rounds at him. In . August last year, members of a female musical group, Unhasu Orchestra - . which included the dictator's ex-girlfriend - were reportedly publicly . machine-gunned apparently for watching pornography and filming . themselves naked. There are said to have been between 40 to 80 public mass executions in North Korea in 2013.","North Korea's second most powerful leader has disappeared with speculation Kim Jong Un has sent him to jail and is having him interrogated .

"A British couple died along with their future son-in-law when the plane he was piloting crashed into a lakeside forest in Canada. Peter Keate, 81, and his 79-year-old wife Inez were in a float plane flown by Scotsman Colin Moyes that struck a hillside and burst into flames after taking off from Okanagan Lake in British Colombia. Mr Moyes, 52, had been set to wed the Keates' youngest daughter Alexandra next month. Sadly missed: Peter Keate, 81, and his wife Inez, 79, had five children, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren . The Keates, originally from Exeter, had five children, 14 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Eyewitnesses said the plane appeared to be trying to gain height when it hit trees. Friends said Mr Moyes, who had an 11-year-old son and was originally from Peebles, in the Scottish Borders, was a 'phenomenal flyer'. Dale Floyd said: 'It was a huge passion of his - he flew every chance he could get.' The Canadian Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the crash, said a fire destroyed the aircraft's logs.

'Devastated': Family and friends have paid tribute to Peter and Inez Keate and Colin Moyes, who were killed in a crash involving a de Havilland Beaver float plane like the one pictured above . Peter Keate and his wife Inez on their wedding day, July 7, 1956 . The single-engine de Havilland Beaver, which Mr Moyes had bought a year earlier, crashed on Sunday, May 13. His wedding on June 23 would have been his second trip down the aisle after his first wife died of cancer. Mr Keate, a quantity surveyor who served as a captain in the Royal Engineers, married Inez in 1956. The couple and Mr Moyes had emigrated to Canada. Mrs Keate's sister, Susan White, of St Thomas, Exeter, said she would be flying out to Canada for a memorial service on Sunday. She told the Exeter Express and Echo newspaper: 'It was a great shock when we heard the news. 'We were on holiday in Spain at the time. Peter and his family were very well-known in Exeter.' Christopher Georgas, the owner of Pacific Rim Aviation Academy Inc, based at Pitt Meadows Airportnear Vancouver, paid tribute to Mr Moyes. He said: 'Mere words cannot express the incredible sense of loss that the aviation community here at Pitt Meadows and across the nation is feeling at this very moment. 'The tragic loss of a loved one and those closest to him came in the spiritual form of a great man, father, partner, husband, relative colleague and a gift to the world. 'All of us have been affected and are truly devastated.' The investigation into the crash is expected to take months because the plane was so badly damaged. Bill Yearwood of the Canadian Transportation Safety Board, said: 'The post-crash fire consumed the logs of the aircraft and a lot of the evidence.'

Her husband is Mohamed Elomar is believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. Sharrouf has allegedly been tweeting pictures in support of ISIS terrorists. Ms Elomar was arrested by joint counter-terrorism detectives at Sydney Airport on May 3 while trying to board a flight to Malaysia with her children. She was reportedly carrying cash and camouflage gear, on behalf of her husband, who is in Syria. Ms Elomar's lawyer Zali Burrows made an application under the crimes Act to the downing Centre court to have her address suppressed to protect the safety of herself and her children. Ms Burrows said Ms Elomar 'has received threats' and feared harassment from anti-Muslim groups. Ms Burrows said the 'ADL (Australian Defence League) or anti-Islamic groups' could target her client if her address was published. Ms Burrows excused the presence of Ms Elomar's children in the court, saying they were there because it was 'school holidays'. Threats: Fatima Elomar (pictured with children and lawyer Zali Burrows) made an application to the court for suppression of her address, saying she had received 'threats' following her being charged with a terrorism related offence . Ms Elomar, who describes her self as 'a devoted mother of four', attended court with her children to appear on a charge of supporting incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities. Fighting in Syria: Fatima Elomar's husband Mohamed Elomar (pictured) is believed to have left Australia last year to fight in Syria. Ms Elomar was arrested in May before trying to board a flight in Sydney allegedly with money and camouflage clothing . In May, through her lawyer, Ms Elomar described herself a ‘devoted mother’ of her four children and said the charges were ‘serious and over-zealous’. In a statement, Ms Elomar said her children had suffered enough from not being able to visit Malaysia for a holiday, which she claims was her intended destination when she boarded the plane. ‘The ordeal of being interviewed without their mother, being unable to return home to their friends and school, having to adjust to a new way of life of reporting in to the police station with mum, and the task of trying to make new friends at a new school in a new state,’ her lawyer told the Daily Telegraph. Ms Elomar is the wife of Mohamed Elomar, an extremist believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Elomar is the nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Elomar, who plotted with four other men in 2005 to bomb targets in a bid to force Australia's government to change its policy on Middle East conflicts. Ms Elomar (pictured, above at the Downing Centre court complex with her children and lawyer Zali Burrows) is the wife of Mohamed Elomar, who is believed to be fighting with terror group the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Ms Elomar said her arrest highlighted the pitfalls for travellers packing camouflage gear as a fashion item. ‘At the end of the day this is an example of one must be careful what you pack to travel, let it be a travel warning to leave the camouflage pants at home and best check with Smart Traveller as to what the acceptable fashion is,’ she said. Ms Elomar said her case was a warning to other travellers to be careful of the 'fashion' items they packed.

The Japanese space agency Jaxa also revealed that it was planning manned moon missions. We are looking at the Moon as our next target for human exploration,” said Yuichi Yamaura, an associate executive director at JAXA. An official statement from the conference said, 'The International Space Station has helped us learn a lot more about humans in space but we still have more to learn. Will private space entities eventually turn to a settlement and colonisation model going forward, and will this open up space settlement and colonisations in ways that were not thought of in previous decades?' 'We have produced and flown more hardware over the last 30 years than we will need for Mars, although the necessary technologies aren’t necessarily the same.  The key to success is austere programs that are properly led and focused.'

"Son of terror suspect convicted: Imran Mostafa, the 20-year-old son of controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza, pictured, has been convicted for his part in an armed robbery of a jewellers in Norfolk . The son of controversial Muslim cleric Abu Hamza has been convicted after he stole £70,000 of gems in an armed smash and grab raid on jewellers. Imran Mostafa, 20, was one of three men who raided jewellers in Kings Lynn, Norfolk armed with a firearm and a hammer as shop staff cowered behind counters. The civil engineering student denied his part in the robbery on January 31 and possessing a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offence but the jury at Norwich Crown Court convicted him of both charges. The jury heard that three men burst . into the shop and used a hammer to break display cabinets while another . many stayed in a waiting van. The men wore hooded tops to disguise their faces. Prosecutor . Ian James said: ‘Members of staff cowered behind counters as the men . burst in, one with a firearm and another with a hammer, which was used . to break the display cabinets before leaving with what they could. ‘One of the robbers let off some sort of . smoke bomb causing confusion and stock was taken as loads of glass . fragments went everywhere because of the way the robbery was conducted.’ Mr James also said that Mostafa was Hamza’s son, after the Recorder of Norwich, Judge Peter Jacobs lifted a contempt of court order. He said: ‘His (Mostafa) parentage is as we thought. His father is Abu Hamza.’ The judge said: ‘The gentleman with the hook.’ Mr James replied: ‘Yes’. Hamza is considered a dangerous terror suspect who is currently appealing to European judges over his extradition from the UK to America after being accused of conspiring to take Western hostages in the Yemen, funding terrorism and running a terrorist training camp in Oregon between 1998 and 2000. In the jewellery robbery, Mostafa and Ossama Hamed, 19 of Fulham, London, Ahmed Ahmed, 19, of Enfield and Jonathon Abdul, 17, also of Fulham, dumped the van nearby the shop before returning to London. They also stopped in Gayton to dump jewellery casings. Mostafa told the jury that he was teaching Arabic and the Koran at a community centre in London at the time the robbery took place. He said he was on a gap year from university and said: ‘I am not a thief. I am not an armed robber.’ Other sons jailed for different crime: Hamza's other sons Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan (left to right) were jailed in 2009 for their part in a £1million luxury car scam . Abdul, who was 16 at the time of the robbery, denied the offences but was also convicted by the jury. He said he was subject to a bail curfew at the time and had to return to London by 10pm that day. The judge lifted previous reporting restrictions on the youth, allowing the publication of his name of someone under 18 in ‘these exceptional circumstances’. The judge asked for full pre-sentence reports to be prepared. Hamza has seven children and in the past his relatives have been arrested for various offences. Sons Hamza Mustafa Kamel, Mohamed Kamel Mostafa and Mohssin Ghailan were jailed in 2009 for their part in a £1million luxury car scam.","Imran Mostafa, 20, was convicted of his part in the armed robbery on January 31 and possessing a firearm with intent to commit an offence .

"Solitude: Tom Hanks in the Hollywood film Cast Away . The biggest problem facing those cast adrift on the open seas is succinctly summed up by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in his poem The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner: ‘Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink.’ A human being can survive for around three weeks without food if they have water, but will perish after just three to five days without fluids. In the absence of drinking water, a man who was last week washed up on the shores of a remote Pacific Island after surviving on his tiny, broken-down boat for an astonishing 13 months, kept himself alive by a means not available to Coleridge’s cursed seamen — he drank turtle blood. Jose Ivan left his native Mexico on Christmas Day 2012 for a short shark-fishing trip to El    Salvador with a companion. But not long after setting sail, disaster struck when the engines of the 24 ft fibreglass boat lost their propellers. The two men were left to the mercy of the ocean currents, which proceeded to sweep the boat 8,000 miles west to the Marshall Islands — a former American territory halfway between Hawaii and Australia, and one of the most isolated spots on the planet. Ivan’s companion died several months ago, leaving him to eke out a desperate living alone, drinking rainwater when it was available and feeding off passing birds, fish and turtles, which he caught and tore apart with his bare hands (no fishing rods were found on his boat). When it didn’t rain, Ivan was forced to drink turtle blood. It is rich in iron and proteins, and provides the same sort of nutrition as steak and eggs. It also provides a measure of rehydration, though not as effectively as rainwater. Discovery: Two Marshall islanders stumbled upon the man - half-starved, with long hair and an unkempt beard - and his boat last Thursday, after the tides miraculously deposited them on a coral reef at Ebon Atoll (pictured) It’s not known if he ate the turtles’ eyes, but experts advise they are the most fluid-rich part of the reptile’s body. When Ivan, whose ordeal has parallels with the Tom Hanks film Cast Away, was eventually discovered, there was a turtle lurking in the hold of his battered boat. Two Marshall islanders stumbled  upon him — half-starved, with long hair and an unkempt beard — and his  boat last Thursday, after the tides  miraculously deposited them on a coral reef at Ebon Atoll. Severely sunburnt, dehydrated and emaciated, Ivan was first cared for at a government property, where he was fed and rehydrated. Because he didn’t speak English — and none of the 700 islanders spoke Spanish — he had to use drawings and gestures to explain his astonishing story to the mayor, Ione deBrum. Mr Debrum said: ‘We’ve been feeding him nutritious island food and he’s getting better. He has pain in both knees. Otherwise, he’s OK.’ Ivan also has low blood pressure, but there seems to be no sign of any long-lasting physical effects of the ordeal, even after spending so long at sea. This morning, he is due to arrive at Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands. In a cruel irony, the archipelago’s only plane capable of landing on Ebon is undergoing maintenance, so Ivan is having to travel by boat. One can only imagine his thoughts at being on the ocean again. ‘I just want to get back home to Mexico, but I don’t even know where I am — I’m tired and sad,’ said Ivan, on a crackly phoneline from the Marshall Islands at the weekend. ‘I’m desperate and I want to get back to Mexico, but I don’t know how.’ Then, revealing that he had not lost his sense of humour, he added: ‘If someone gets me home, I’m sure my boss will pay.’ Ola . Fjeldstad, a Norwegian anthropology student working on Ebon who spoke . to Ivan, said: ‘His condition isn’t good, but he’s getting better.’ Map: Jose Ivan left his native Mexico on Christmas Day 2012 for a short shark-fishing trip to El¿¿¿Salvador with a companion. But not long after setting sail, disaster struck when the engines of the boat lost their propellers . What . a research opportunity Jose Ivan must present to any anthropologist in . search of a golden case study. For if Ivan’s story is true, he is one of . the longest surviving castaways in history. The . physical challenges associated with being adrift at sea are severely . testing, but not insuperable. In the warm, fertile waters of the . Pacific, there can be food available in the form of turtles and fish, . which often congregate near small boats to shelter beneath them. They . can be caught by hand. However, the mental ordeal is, if anything, worse — a debilitating cocktail of despair and delusion brought on by prolonged exposure, starvation and lack of water. The victim does not know if they might be found or whether they are facing a lingering death. Other castaways have died after much . shorter times on the open sea. In 2012, two Panamanian fishermen . succumbed to heat stroke and dehydration after 28 days. When it didn't rain, Ivan was forced to drink turtle blood. It is rich in iron and proteins, and provides the same sort of nutrition as steak and eggs . Their surviving companion, Adrian Vasquez, sued the owners of a passing cruise ship for apparently ignoring their desperate cries a fortnight before he was rescued. Their tiny 10 ft boat, the Fifty Cents, was on a short trip from Panama to Costa Rica when the engine failed and the boat drifted west to the Galapagos Islands, where the lone survivor was picked up. The trio’s problem wasn’t food — they . still had their fishing nets — but lack of water. Vasquez survived only . thanks to a providential rain shower when he was at death’s door. In . recent years, the closest anyone has come to surviving as long as Jose . Ivan are three other Mexicans, also adrift at sea near the Marshall . Islands. They survived on fish, birds and rainwater for nine months in 2006 — their mental health was sustained by a copy of the Bible. One . survivor, Jesus Vidana, said: ‘We ate raw seagulls, ducks and fish; we . ate everything raw — any fish that came near the boat, we grabbed it and . gulped it down. We were able to drink rainwater because it rained every . day. ‘But twice we almost . sank. The waves washed into the boat and we thought we were going to . die. Then suddenly we saw ships going by and we’d reached the other side . [of the Pacific].’ One of . the most graphic descriptions of a rudderless life at sea comes from . Briton Douglas Robertson, who was 18 when he was stranded with his . younger siblings — twin boys aged ten — and  their parents and a friend . in the Pacific in 1971. Issue: The biggest problem facing those cast adrift on the open seas is summed up by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (pictured) in his poem The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner: 'Water, water, everywhere, nor any drop to drink' His father, Dougal Robertson, was sailing their boat, the Lucette, from Panama to the Galapagos Islands when it was holed by a pod of killer whales. After 38 days, the castaways were picked up 300 miles from land by a fishing trawler. When the whales struck, the Robertsons took refuge in a life raft, but it deflated after 17 days, forcing them to transfer to an even smaller dinghy. They only had six lemons, ten oranges, a tin of biscuits, a bag of onions and half a pound of glucose sweets to sustain them. More worryingly, there was only enough water for ten days. No one knew they had gone adrift, and sharks staked out their dangerously overcrowded vessel. And just like Jose Ivan, the family depended on turtle blood for survival. After their rescue, Douglas said: ‘You have to knock it back quickly otherwise it sets into blancmange. It has an after-taste that makes you want to retch.’ How strong the temptation towards . cannibalism must have been for Jose Ivan when his companion died; how . noble to stick to turtle . It helped, too, that his mother, Lyn, had trained as a nurse. She knew about the healing properties of turtle oil (turtle flesh is rich in it), which she rubbed into the painful, saltwater boils that the family developed as a result of constantly sitting in seawater. There was only one dry seat in the boat, and the six of them took turns sitting on it. Crucially, Lyn was aware of the danger of drinking the fluid at the bottom of the dinghy — a polluted combination of blood, turtle offal and rainwater. This would have been poisonous if taken orally, yet taken rectally by enema it would not impair the digestive system. Lyn kept them all hydrated by using an enema tube that they crafted from the rungs of a ladder. But at least the poor Robertsons didn’t have to deal with the ultimate castaway horror — cannibalism. In 1884, an English yacht, Mignonette, set out for Sydney from Southampton, but when it capsized in a gale off the Cape  of Good Hope, the crew took to  a lifeboat. After 18 days at sea, living off turnips that they’d salvaged and turtles, two of the starving men resolved to kill and eat another crew member. After their rescue, the two men were convicted in a historic legal case (R v Dudley and Stephens), when it was ruled that necessity could be no defence to murder. How strong the temptation towards cannibalism must have been for Jose Ivan when his companion died; how noble to stick to turtle.

"Declassified spy photography has uncovered a long-lost Eastern frontier built by the Romans dating from the second century AD. The site of the wall, which once stood over three metres tall with numerous forts along its length is situated in Romania. Named Trajan's Rampart, the long wall ran 60 kilometres from the Danube to the Black Sea and is considered the most easterly example of a man-made frontier barrier system in the Roman Empire. Built in the mid-second century AD the wall once stood eight-and-a-half metres wide and over 3-and-a-half metres high, including at least 32 forts along its course. Declassified spy photography (pictured) has uncovered an Eastern frontier built by the Romans dating from the second century AD. The site of the wall, which once stood over three metres tall with numerous forts along its length is situated in Romania. Here you can see the square outline of forts along its length . Hadrian’s Wall is near the Scottish border. It stretches for about 73 miles, from Bowness on Solway on the west coast, to Wallsend on the east coast. The wall and most of its defenses were built between about 122 and 128 AD. Its purpose was to mark the northern extent of the Roman Empire, which then covered much of Europe. Hadrian’s Wall was originally constructed in two parts, with the western part of the wall built first. It was originally made from turf, allowing it to be built more quickly. Sixteen forts were built along the length of the wall - each one could house 800 soldiers and had its own prison, hospital, bakery and stables. Although much of the wall is still standing, over the centuries people have taken away the stones for building. Several nearby monasteries contain stones taken from from Hadrian’s Wall. It is thought to have served a similar purpose to other Roman frontier walls, such as Hadrian’s Wall, which were built to defend the Empire from threats to the borders. Trajan’s Rampart actually consists of three separate walls of different dates and while constructions were previously known about, they were wrongly thought to date to the Byzantine or Early medieval period. Although it is estimated that over 50 per cent of all archaeological sites in the UK have been discovered from the air, other countries are less well studied. Archaeologists believe that examining declassified photographs taken during covert surveillance may herald a new era for archaeological discovery and could help to uncover and identify thousands of new archaeological sites around the world. Dr Ioana Oltean, senior lecturer in . the archaeology department from the University of Exeter, . said: 'Photographs from military surveillance are revealing more than . those who took them could have imagined because now, half a century or . more later, they are proving to be of enormous benefit in showing us our . lost archaeological heritage. 'Thanks to such images, the landscape of this frontier zone is now known to have been as busy in the past as it is today.' Built in the mid-second century AD the wall once stood eight-and-a-half metres wide and over 3-and-a-half metres high, including at least 32 forts along its course. Pictured is a modern aerial photograph of a Trajan Rampart fort . Tens of millions of images of Europe and the Middle East were taken by Allied and German air forces during the First and Second World Wars and are now held in vast public archives. Alongside this, a considerable historical aerial resource is also now available from the recently declassified covert US CORONA satellite intelligence programme of the 1960s, 70s and 80s, which includes around 900,000 photographs from around the world. Hadrian's Wall (pictured) epitomises Roman power. It stretched 80 miles from the Solway Coast in Cumbria to Wallsend near Newcastle upon Tyne. In places the Wall reached 6m in height and it took three legions or around 15,000 men just six years to build . These images are particularly valuable to modern archaeologists as they effectively turn back the clock to a time before recent development changed the face of the landscape through industrialisation, intensive farming practices and urban development. Bill Hanson, professor of Roman archaeology from the University of Glasgow, said: 'We believe we have enough evidence here to demonstrate the existence of a chronologically complex Roman frontier system and the most easterly example of a man-made barrier in the Roman Empire, serving to block an important and strategically valuable routeway.' 'It is an incredibly important discovery for the study of Roman history.'","Trajan's Rampart ran 60 kilometres from the Danube to the Black Sea and would have measured 3.8 metres tall and over eight metres thick .

The competition: Gandy (left) will have to take on David Beckham who designs a range for Swedish giant H&M . Popular: Beckham is also the face of H&M underwear, which has made inroads into the men's pant market . Gandy himself described his new role as 'a step on' from his modelling work and says he was involved in every part of the design process, including the choice of fabrics. The new pants, which launch in September, will be sold in twin packs for £20 - more expensive than the chain's current offering, although that's unlikely to put off famous fans such as David Cameron. What's more, according to analysts Verdict, the new range is likely to strike a chord, with men prepared to splash out more as the economy recovers. Speaking to the Sunday Times, retail analyst Kate Ormerod said: 'Disposable incomes are rising and people want to trade back up.' Good news, then, for M&S and Gandy.

Former White House incumbent George W Bush, right, looks on as current First Lady Michelle Obama (hidden by umbrella) is welcomed . President Obama is welcomed upon his arrival on Air Force One to attend a memorial service for Nelson Mandela at FNB Stadium in Johannesburg . Mr Obama is among foreign leaders from all over the world who traveled to pay tribute to Mr Mandela at the stadium which hosted the World Cup Final in 2010 and was the site of Mandela's final public appearance. Ben Rhodes, White House deputy . national security adviser for strategic communications, said that the . President and First lady Michelle had earlier spent time with the Bushes and . Secretary Clinton on board Air Force One. They are said to have been reflecting on their experiences meeting Mr Mandela.

That said, the Bushes ended up spending more than an hour in the press cabin at the back of the plane. En route: Barack Obama boarded Air Force One Monday alongside wife Michelle as they joined Hillary Clinton, George W. Bush and Laura Bush en route to South Africa for a memorial service for anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela . Seeing off his hero: Officials revealed Monday that Obama plans to speak at Mandela's mass service, to be held in Johannesburg on Tuesday . The plane's spacious conference room served as a gathering spot for them all during the flight from Maryland to South Africa which is expected to last 16 hours. President Obama did not spend the entire trip catching up with his fellow politicians but squeezed in some time with them between in-flight meetings and calls. ‘It's a very, I think, enjoyable experience certainly for the president and first lady,’ said White House spokesman Jay Carney. ‘And they're both grateful to be able to have former president and first lady, former secretary of state on board.’ Behind closed doors: President Obama kept hold of his office (pictured during a 2012 flight) and former President Bush and Laura were given the room generally used as the medical office . Gathering space: The conference room is where the the Obamas, Bushes and Hillary Clinton reportedly got together and hung out during the 16-hour flight (President Obama seen here with his staff during an April 2009 trip) Clinton take over: The former Secretary of State was given free reign for she and her staffers to convene in the area usually allotted to President Obama's senior staff (as seen here in July 2012) For Bush, the flight marked the first time he had stepped foot on Air Force One since leaving the presidency nearly five years ago. He and the former first lady were already on board the plane in Washington when Obama arrived, skipping an on-camera greeting with the Obamas. Bush has purposely tried to stay out of the public eye since leaving office but he wandered back to the plane's press cabin for two lengthy off-the-record conversations with reporters, returning the second time with Laura Bush in tow. Clinton is no stranger to the presidential plane, having travelled aboard Air Force One frequently as both first lady and secretary of state.

"The 'nanny from hell' who refused to move out of a California family's home despite doing no work has hit back at her former employers saying they once tried to feed her dog food. Diane Stretton, 64, spoke out for the first time after it emerged she told the Bracamonte family she could be out of their Upland home as long as her long list of conditions were kept. The alarming demands include providing her air-conditioning and hand soap at all times, vacating the property between the hours of 8am and 5pm and giving her access to healthy meals - or cough up $200 so that she can go out for a meal. But Stretton has now claimed in an interview that it was the family who were being demanding as they worked her as many as 10 hours a day without any lunch or coffee breaks. Scroll down for video . Battle: Diane Stretton, pictured helping bake a cake for the Bracamonte's son in March, has denied she was lazy after moving into their home and simply said they overworked her . 'There wasn’t a single day I was there, except for the two days I was sick, that I didn’t do dishes and about two or three hours of cleanup,' Stretton told KTLA in her first interview. She called Marcella Bracamonte a 'drama queen' and 'Screaming Mimi' who spent most of her day on the phone 'just like a teenager' and who wanted her to work harder than her board was worth. Mrs Bracamonte has previously said that her three children, aged 11, four and one, initially loved Stretton but after three weeks, she refused to help them and claimed she had health problems. After sending her warning letters asking her to improve, the family eventually told Stretton that she needed to leave and within 12 hours, her cable, air conditioning and internet access were cut off. But she claimed that it didn't stop there - because the family tried to feed her dog food. Family: Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte hired Stretton through Craigslist to look after their 3 young children . Diane Stretton's letter to the family reads: . 'Agreement: I will voluntarily agree to leave by 6pm on 7/6/14 if each and all of the following conditions are met: . 1. My WiFi and TV and house air conditioning and water must be continuously . on until I vacate. Electricity in my room must be operational. 2. Bathrooms must be stocked up with TP (toilet paper) and hand soap at all times. 3. Marcella and kids must vacate the premises between the hours of 8am and . 5pm until 7/6/14 whether I elect to leave during the day or not. 4. Between the hours of 5pm and 8am, I have full access to my room, the . garage bathroom and the areas of the house between the front door and my . bedroom. I will not linger in these areas. 5. I'm either given . access to healthy food or given $200 to eat out. Said access to food . shall be limited to hours between 8am and 5pm. 6. Neither the front . door nor my bedroom shall be locked in a manner than prevents me from . entering. This means the chain must be off and the locks cannot be . changed. In exchanged [sic] for the above, I will agree not to seek any of my legal remedies for your past violations of our agreement.' 'Right after she served that letter, she gave the kids three cans of dog food and told them to put it outside my room for my food,' she said. 'And so little Ralphie, four-years-old, knocks on the door and says, ""Diane, your dinner's here, we got dog food for you"".' She said that she had planned to move out in 30 days, but the situation 'got complicated'. But she now could be out of the house by the weekend - as long as certain conditions were met. A letter Stretton sent to the Bracamontes and seen by MailOnline shows her demands, including that she has access to amenities, healthy food and a well-stocked bathroom. 'Marcella and kids must vacate the premises between the hours of 8am and . 5pm until 7/6/14 whether I elect to leave during the day or not,' one of the demands reads. 'I'm either given . access to healthy food or given $200 to eat out,' she wrote in another. 'Bathrooms must be stocked up with TP (toilet paper) and hand soap at all times.' The list says, if the conditions are met, she will voluntarily leave on July 6 and will not seek any of the legal remedies for 'your past violations of our agreement'. Police had . previously said they could not kick Stretton out of the home because . they had willingly invited her into their home and she had established . residency. If they wanted to get rid of her, they had to evict her, they . said. The Bracamontes were also not impressed with this latest correspondence from Stretton. 'She wrote it to get me really upset, to get me furious and she did get me furious, but I didn’t respond to her,' Mrs Bracamonte told MailOnline. Demands: An image shows the handwritten letter sent to the Bracamontes outlining the conditions they must keep to ensure Stretton moves out of their home before this weekend . 'She's . playing games. She knows I have a very short temper and she's trying to . wind me up. She's not going to do it because I know her game - I'm not . going to get wound up.' The nanny has cited the weather, the media and physical disabilities as the . reasons she hasn't moved out of her former employers' home, but said . she will be out this week. In an email sent this weekend to the Bracamontes' lawyer, Stretton said she tried to move out of . the house but there was 'always a bunch of news vehicles right in front . of the house. The media needs to be completely gone before I continue . moving.' Stretton disappeared from the . Bracamontes' house last Thursday morning and was later discovered in her car . outside of a police station on Friday. Asked if she's relieved Stretton has now said she will leave, Marcella said: 'I'm relieved and then not.' Nightmare: Stretton, 64, moved into the family's home in Upland, California, pictured, in March . 'I'm . relieved because the past few days she hasn’t been here,' she said. 'But . then that also scares me because I don’t know when she’s coming. 'Say I want to go to the grocery store and then she comes, what is she going to do to the house? What if she comes and burns my house down. What if she comes in the middle of the night when I’m sleeping.' Marcella and her husband Ralph are heading to her . sister’s wedding in Mexico on Wednesday and have arranged for members of her husband’s family to move in to guard the house. She said: 'I have to go, it’s my sister’s . wedding and I’m maid of honor and this woman has stolen enough from us, . stole enough piece of mind, time, energy, heartache, crying, tears, . she’s not going to take my sister’s wedding away from me.' Hiding out: Last week she was seen sleeping in her car - but the family lives in fear she will return . The saga began in March when Stretton responded to the family's Craiglist ad for someone to help around the house and watch the children in exchange for meals and a room. A few weeks into being hired, she revealed that she suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a breathing condition, and all but gave up on work. Since the story has made headlines, it has emerged that this is not Stretton's first experience with litigation, She is even listed on California's Vexatious Litigant List, . which includes those who bring legal action that is . frivolous or repetitive. The majority of the lawsuits were . directed at her own family members, particularly her two sisters, and last year she even attempted to sue her son.","In her first interview, Diane Stretton has said she was overworked by the Bracamonte family, who hired her to look after their children .

"The Premier League are taking action over Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho riding roughshod over regulations that require him to hold a press conference the day before a game. Mourinho refused to meet the media on Friday before Saturday’s top-of-the-table clash at home to Manchester City. The Special One also breached rules when coach Steve Holland deputised for him before the Newcastle game three weeks ago but there was no media conference at all on Friday. It happened twice last season, too. Mourinho argues with referee Michael Oliver  on Tuesday during the Capital One Cup clash with Liverpool . The Premier League have written to Chelsea asking for an explanation of Mourinho’s absence ahead of the Newcastle match. Another letter will follow about Friday’s media snub. The Premier League board will then decide whether to fine the club. However, it might take some time as former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson did not talk to the BBC for seven years before that issue was resolved — and Mourinho thinks he is the new Fergie when it comes to flouting the Premier League rulebook. Chelsea refused to comment. Mourinho (right) prepares his team to face Man City during a Chelsea training on Thursday . The FA have brought in former Manchester United finance director Nick Humby to be their interim chief operating officer until the successor to general secretary Alex Horne, who left on Friday, arrives at Wembley. Greg Dyke will work as executive chairman during that void in a double move that does not reflect much confidence in the remaining heads of department and also points to the FA being prepared to wait for the right replacement for Horne. Humby, who temporarily led the Lawn Tennis Association after the Roger Draper regime, takes over at an opportune time with football agents urgently wanting guidance from the FA after FIFA scandalously washed their hands of regulating the middle men. former Manchester United finance director Nick Humby with Cristiano Ronaldo back in 2005 . Humby knows the subject, having conducted the United inquiry into the 99 questions posed by shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus into Sir Alex Ferguson’s transfer business. His findings led to Ferguson’s agent son Jason being banned from United transfer activity. Meanwhile, only FIFA could have been planning to scrap all agents’ licences on Monday — transfer deadline day — until persuaded to postpone the move until the end of March. The start of Prince Ali of Jordan’s campaign for the FIFA presidency — endorsed by the FA on a reform agenda to improve integrity, governance and transparency — coincides with him having to decide the future of Ray Wilkins as the national coach. Ray Wilkins is the national coach of Jordan, who failed to get out of their group in the recent Asian Cup . Jordan failed to get out of the group in the Asian Cup under Wilkins’s leadership, having reached the quarter-finals in the previous two tournaments. But the former Chelsea assistant manager would like to extend his five-month deal and with Prince Ali due in London next week to talk about his FIFA ambitions, Wilkins will perhaps get an unlikely stay of execution.

Gary Lineker is pictured presenting an episode of the BBC's Match of the Day, but could he present at BT? Consequently, with more joint deals on the horizon — perhaps the Six Nations from 2018 — the BBC are not going to object to Lineker’s contract changing to allow him to work for BT as he has done for Fox and Al Jazeera before they rebranded as beIN Sport.

"Miss de Freitas told detectives that Mr Economou raped her just before Christmas 2012 . A wealthy financier yesterday sent his condolences to the family of the woman who killed herself after he launched a private prosecution against her because she had accused him of rape. Alexander Economou, 35, said the death of Eleanor de Freitas, 23, was a ‘great loss’ as her father asked a coroner to investigate why the Crown pursued the case against his daughter. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders is personally overseeing an inquiry into lawyers’ decision to put the vulnerable young woman on trial. Miss de Freitas, a brilliant former Durham University student who suffered from a psychiatric illness, told detectives that Mr Economou raped her just before Christmas 2012. Police investigated her allegations but closed the case after concluding that gaps in the evidence meant they would not be able to secure a conviction. Despite being told he would not face charges, Mr Economou paid for his own inquiry in an attempt to show he was innocent. As part of the effort to clear his name, he assembled emails, text messages, details of phone calls and CCTV footage of him and Miss de Freitas together. He then started a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. The whole process is said to have cost him £200,000. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case but decided against using its powers to throw it out, leaving her frightened and devastated. Bipolar disorder sufferer Miss de Freitas killed herself in April this year, three days before the start of her trial at London’s Southwark Crown Court. Mr Economou’s father Angelo, 62, is a successful businessman of Greek origin who was born in Britain. He runs UK-registered firm Time and Tide Shipping, and lives in a £830,000 house in Chiddingfold, Surrey. Mr Economou is the company secretary of his father’s firm and a former director of a helicopter training school. Companies House documents list his occupation as ‘financial analyst’. Scroll down for video . He lives in a £900,000 flat in an exclusive mansion block overlooking the upmarket King’s Road in Chelsea, west London. His father’s wealth appears to explain how Mr Economou was able to buy his Chelsea flat in his own name for £245,000 in 1999, when he was just 20. He declined to comment yesterday, but his spokesman said: ‘He sends his condolences to the family for this very unfortunate event. It is a great loss.’ An inquest into Miss de Freitas’s death was adjourned yesterday following Mrs Saunders’ intervention. Bipolar disorder sufferer Miss de Freitas killed herself in April this year, three days before the start of her trial . West London coroner Chinyere Inyama said he needed to know the remit of the CPS investigation before deciding on the scope of his hearing, which will probably be held in front of a jury. Lawyers for Miss de Freitas’ parents called for the inquest to look at whether there were adequate measures in place to protect people who report rapes. Catherine Oborne, representing the young woman’s family, said: ‘We specifically request any advice on evidence and any correspondence between the police and the CPS in relation to the decision by the CPS to continue the prosecution against Eleanor. ‘It is quite an unusual case which brings to light areas where there are not such adequate procedures. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders is personally overseeing an inquiry into lawyers’ decision to put the vulnerable young woman on trial . ‘The question we want to ask the court to consider is whether there are sufficient safeguarding policies, processes and procedures to protect rape claimants and prevent prosecutions of rape claimants.’ Miss de Freitas’ father David, 59, a financial planner from Fulham, west London, complained to officers that he was harassed after the private prosecution against his daughter was launched. Miss Oborne told the coroner yesterday: ‘We will be asking you to take into consideration the way the police investigated claims of harassment made to Mr de Freitas during the private prosecution. ‘But also the overall oversight of the private prosecution process which, as it is in this case, allows the alleged perpetrator to enter a prosecution against the complainant. We also want to explore whether there are sufficient processes, policies and safeguards to ensure there is communication between the public authority for prosecution and the public authority for health.’ Mr Economou is not required to attend the inquest, according to his spokesman. Miss de Freitas achieved straight As at A-Level at the private Putney High School before starting a geography degree at Durham University, but she dropped out after her mental state deteriorated. Before her death, she was studying for financial services exams and was in a loving relationship with a boyfriend she met at Durham. But she was ‘ground down’ when the CPS took over the private prosecution, her father said. Mr de Freitas said he welcomed Mrs Saunders’ pledge to investigate the case, but added: ‘It very much falls into the category of too little too late.’ Eleanor de Freitas claimed she was raped by Alexander Economou just before Christmas 2012. But she did not go to the police station to make a formal complaint until January 4 last year. Detectives investigated but ruled that there were too many inconsistencies in the evidence to bring a successful prosecution. Officers informed Miss de Freitas on February 21 last year that they would not be bringing any charges. But wanting to clear his name, Mr Economou used his own money to launch a private prosecution against Miss de Freitas for perverting the course of justice by allegedly lying to police. She received a court summons on August 13 last year. The Crown Prosecution Service took over the case, giving it the power either to end it or to pursue it. To the horror of Miss de Freitas and her family, it decided to continue. Miss de Freitas killed herself on April 7, three days before she was due to stand trial.","Alexander Economou launched private prosecution against Eleanor de Freitas because she had accused him of rape .

"Campaigners are calling for a ban on a colouring linked to cancer which has been found in Coca-Cola sold in Britain. A chemical in the caramel colouring that gives the drink its distinctive colour has been at the centre of a health alert in the United States. Coca-Cola has recently switched to a new manufacturing process in America to bring down the level of the suspect chemical, 4-methylimidazole (4-MI). Concern: A chemical found in all Coke drinks in the UK is at the centre of a health alert in the U.S. But this precaution has not yet been . taken in other countries such as Britain, where its products are the . nation’s biggest selling soft drinks with sales of £1.1billion a year. The . amount of 4-MI found in regular Coca-Cola cans sold in Britain was 135 . micrograms – some 34 times higher than the 4mcg level in the US, . according to research by the US group Center For Science In The Public . Interest in partnership with Britain’s Children’s Food Campaign. Health authorities in California are so concerned that they have passed a law that requires any can of drink containing a 4-MI reading of 30mcg or more to carry a health warning. If this safety assessment was applied in Britain, all cans of Coke would have to carry a warning. The contaminant results from the industrial process, involving ammonia, that creates the caramel colouring. Chemical reactions between sugar and the ammonia result in the formation of 4-MI, which has been found to cause cancers in laboratory tests with mice and rats. The results of the campaigners’ research are to be published in the International Journal Of Occupational And Environmental Health, and today they will write to British health ministers calling for an outright ban on the colouring. Malcolm Clark, campaign co-ordinator at the lobby group, said: ‘Coca-Cola seems to be treating its UK consumers with disdain. The company should respect the health of all of its customers around the world, by using caramel colouring that is free of known cancer-causing chemicals. ‘The UK Government must regulate to protect public health from companies that aggressively market sugar-laden drinks that lead to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.’ Manufacturers say it is possible to provide a caramel colour that is totally free of 4-MI, however it is four times more expensive. The CSPI examined regular Coca-Cola from around the world. In the US the 4-MI level was 4mcg per 355ml. The figure was higher in every other country, from 56 in China to 267 in Brazil. Diet Coke and Coke Zero were not included, but earlier tests suggest they tend to have one third less of the contaminant than the standard drink. The Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment in California, which made the warning labels law,  said: ‘Studies published in 2007 by the federal government’s National Toxicology Program showed that long-term exposure to 4-MI resulted in increases in lung cancer in male and female mice.’ Recipes: The level of 4-MI in Coca-Cola in the UK was found to be significantly higher than the version sold in the United States, according to a study . California’s experts suggest that regular consumption of 4-MI at its warning label level of 30mcg would cause cancer in one in 100,000 people over their lifetimes. Coca-Cola strenuously denies there is any human health risk from 4-MI. It said the decision to change the manufacturing process in the US, made public in March, was to avoid the need to apply ‘scientifically unfounded’ health warnings to cans and bottles. The British arm of the company said it will change the caramel colouring used in its drinks in this country, but was unable to put a timescale on it.It said: ‘We intend to expand the use of the reduced 4-MI caramel globally as this will allow us to streamline and simplify our supply chain, manufacturing, and distribution systems.’ The British Soft Drinks Association said there was no need to ban caramel colours containing 4-MI. A spokesman said: ‘The 4-MI levels found in food and drink products pose no health or safety risks. Outside the state of California, no regulatory agency in the world considers the exposure of the public to 4-MI as present in caramels as an issue.’ The spokesman and Coke said food safety watchdogs in Britain and Europe have both decided the presence of 4-MI in caramel colouring is not a health concern.","Campaigners to write to UK health ministers calling for an outright ban of the colouring .

The Regal Rejuvenation, which starts at £650, includes diamond facial mapping and infusions of precious stone extract, as well as Botox and hyaluronic acid injections. Inspiration: The Duchess of Cambridge boasts flawless skin, strong brows and sculpted cheekbones . But even if they can afford it, Dr Neetu Nirdosh, the beauty guru behind the treatment, says not everyone will be allowed to have it. 'I turn people away all the time,' says the doctor who offers the treatment from her Wimpole Street clinic in London's West End. 'I try not to treat people under 20 and I won't do anything if people don't need it. It's my job to give advice and guide people to the right treatments.' The Duchess of Cambridge inspired procedure begins with diamond facial mapping, which contours the face via the use of injections. Popular: Surgeons have seen a surge in people wanting to recreate the Duchess' looks, especially her nose . Next comes a facial using diamond, pearl . and 24-carat gold extracts before the look is finished off with light . filler to the cheeks and lips. 'Kate Middleton has one of the most . beautiful faces in the world and it’s no surprise that we are seeing . such a huge demand from women wanting to emulate her look,' adds Dr Nirdosh. 'The Regal Rejuvenation procedure enables me to re-contour the face to . achieve an air brushed look without make up. 'Each face is . individually treated and adjusted to suit the client, while still . achieving a natural looking finish.' That, she explains, is particularly important. 'You'll still look like you after the treatment,' she adds. 'You can't go around saying I've got Kate's nose or Angelina's lips. 'Everyone has a right to be beautiful but you will still be you - just with plumper, fresher and almost flawless skin.' New look: Dr Nirdosh says the treatment will give you Duchess of Cambridge style skin and cheekbones . Having great skin doesn't have to mean Botox and filler; instead, it's all about taking care of it and making the most of what you have. You don't even have to splash out on expensive face creams. From water to sunglasses, some of the best skin saviours are cheap, cheerful and already in your home. Dr Nirdosh explains how to get A-list skin without going under the knife. GET SOME SLEEP . 'You need at least seven or eight hours a night,' explains Dr Nirdosh. 'That gives skin time to repair itself and de-stress.' DRINK MORE WATER . 'It's been said many times before but you do need to drink as much water as possible,' says the doctor. 'It flushes out toxins and hydrates skin from within.' EAT MORE ANTIOXIDANTS . 'You can't just eat for your body, you have to eat for your skin as well,' reveals Dr Nirdosh. 'Try and avoid high GI carbs such as white bread or pasta because the sugars in it break down collagen. 'Also avoid fruit if you can, because it's full of fructose which attacks collagen. You can get the same vitamins from vegetables - if you want something sweet, try tomatoes. TAKE PLENTY OF VITAMINS . 'Your skin's needs change as you age, so start off with antioxidants and B-vitamins in your 20s and 30s before adding to collagen boosters in your 40s,' explains Dr Nirdosh. 'In your 50s, take more amino acids to help replace collagen as it breaks down.' AVOID THE SUN AND EXTREME FILLERS . 'Use an SPF and stay out of the sun to keep wrinkles in check,' adds Dr Nirdosh. 'Also stay away from things like permanent fillers. 'Your face changes all the time but permanent fillers and implants don't break down with time so that's going to end up looking really bizarre.'","Royal Rejuvenation is designed to give you Kate-style cheekbones and skin .

"Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, based at 100 Parliament Street (pictured), wants the power to take money directly from accounts . The taxman cannot be trusted to enact ‘excessive’ new money-grabbing powers properly, accountants have warned. They say Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs is ‘a pretty dysfunctional department’, and allowing it to seize money from bank accounts could lead to an erosion of trust. In a savage assessment of the controversial proposals to recoup unpaid tax bills, the majority of accountants said the powers are unnecessary – and the HMRC is not fit to oversee them. The warning comes as MPs today grill the department’s chief executive Lin Homer about the proposals, which were announced in the Budget in March. Under the plan – currently subject to a public consultation which ends on July 29 – HMRC wants the right to be able to take money directly from bank accounts. If it believes taxpayers owe money, it can take the cash directly from a current account, joint account or even tax-free Isa to settle an unpaid tax bill. One of the biggest concerns is that HMRC will not need to apply to the courts to get permission to seize the money. Around 17,000 people a year are expected to have money taken under the proposed new powers. HMRC insists taxpayers will only be targeted if they owe £1,000 or more to the taxman, have been contacted by HMRC at least four times and would have at least £5,000 left across all their accounts after the money has been removed. But Rebecca Benneyworth, of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, warned the department is ‘shooting itself in the foot.’ She said: ‘Public trust in HMRC would be eroded very quickly if cases come to light where funds have been incorrectly removed. If the consequences of that are devastating to individual taxpayers, that erosion could become a landslide. ‘HMRC cannot afford to have public opinion turn against the tax system and those charged with administering it. This really could be a case of shooting oneself in the foot.’ HMRC is giving under heavy criticism for its desire to take money directly from people's bank accounts . There are concerns around joint accounts such as those set up to pay the bills for an elderly person. For example, an elderly woman in a care home might pay money into a joint account to fund her bills, but have no idea that one of her children who administers the account owes tax. Paul Aplin, a tax partner at the accountants AC Mole & Sons, told the ICAEW conference about the catalogue of problems experienced by his own clients. One client was chased for £9,500 in a PAYE tax debt, which had already been paid. Another was chased for £11,000 in a VAT debt which, again, had already been paid. Speaking at the conference, Jonathan Schwarz, a barrister at the Temple Tax Chambers, said: ‘Why is it that HMRC is asking for these powers? ‘A power which is stripped of judicial supervision goes beyond what is necessary to achieve these objectives and undermines the essential elements of a constitutional democracy. ‘The only purpose of this proposal is to circumvent the jurisdiction of the courts in applying the rules relating to the seizing of assets.’ He said the rules should be redrawn. Anthony Thomas, of the Low Incomes Tax Reform Group, said: ‘I don’t honestly think you can trust HMRC to do the job properly. I think it is regrettably a pretty dysfunctional department even today and a long way from being able to do this job properly.’ An HMRC spokesman said it is having ‘a series of constructive conversations with accountants’ before the consultation closes in a few weeks’ time. Just weeks after the proposals were announced in March, the ICAEW warned MPs they were ‘extremely worrying’. Frank Haskew, from the ICAEW, which has not yet formally responded to the consultation, told MPs: ‘We can’t have HMRC as judge and jury on this. This power is unprecedented in the UK. These powers are extremely worrying and excessive.’ An HMRC spokesman said: ‘It is hard to see why a tiny minority of people who can pay the tax they owe, but refuse to, should enjoy an advantage over the vast majority of people who respect the rules.’","Accountants warn 'dysfunctional' HMRC cannot be trusted to use proposed money grabbing powers properly .

"In the post: The online retailer is among a host of multinationals whose tax bills have fallen under the spotlight after the European Commission widened its inquiry into how firms use countries such as Luxembourg to cut their tax bill . Amazon was today dragged into an EU probe investigating the use of offshore tax havens to slash their bill, it has been revealed. The online retailer is among a host of multinationals whose tax bills have fallen under the spotlight since the European Commission widened its inquiry into how firms use countries such as Luxembourg to cut their tax bill, an official with knowledge of the matter said today. Other companies to be drawn into the examination because of their links to the tax shelter include building equipment maker Caterpillar and UK mobile telecoms group Vodafone, while Apple, Starbucks and Fiat Finance and Trade are already on the list. The Financial Times revealed that . Amazon's main European operating company, Amazon EU Sarl is being . examined over whether its decisions on corporate tax complied with state . aid rules. An EU official told the newspaper: 'We are looking into what kind of arrangement Luxembourg has with Amazon.' The company was criticised last month after it was shown to have funnelled about £11bn through its . Luxembourg-based subsidiary in 2013, but paid only £4 million in UK . corporation tax last year - 0.1 per cent of the £4.3bn in sales that the company . generated in the UK last year.

Under investigation: Last month, the Commission warned Ireland, another EU country that offers companies offshore tax status, that it could investigate more companies beyond Apple Inc as part of its probe into European tax practices . 'It would be premature to speculate on whether ... formal investigations could be opened about any specific company.' Luxembourg is used by many multinationals including online retailer Amazon, building equipment maker Caterpillar and UK mobile telecoms group Vodafone. Pushed by France and Germany, Brussels is keen to clamp down on what it sees as unfair tax competition across the bloc. If the Commission can prove countries such as Luxembourg and Ireland agree tax treatments that diverge from international rules, it could deem any corporate tax savings to be a form of subsidy that must be halted or even repaid. Failed: In a strongly worded statement in March, the Commission, the EU executive, chastised Luxembourg (pictured: the village of Echtemach), saying it had 'failed to adequately answer previous requests for information' and ordered it to outline many details of its tax system . In a strongly worded statement in March, the Commission, the EU executive, chastised Luxembourg, saying it had 'failed to adequately answer previous requests for information' and ordered it to outline many details of its tax system. The finance ministry in Luxembourg was not immediately available for comment on Friday but in June it said it had 'doubts about the legality of certain aspects of the European Commission's information requests.' Corporate profit-shifting has come under the international spotlight in recent years following reports of how companies such as Apple use complex structures to slash their tax bills. The investigation is centred around the commonly-used practice of transfer pricing - a profit allocation method employed to attribute a multinational corporation's net profit (or loss) before tax to countries where it does business. This is one way multi-national companies are able to spread . or reallocate earning from the parent company's net profit. A Reuters examination in 2012 of accounts filed by 25 Amazon units in six countries showed how tax arrangements in Luxembourg also allowed the company to avoid paying more tax in the United States, where the company is based. Tax advisers say Luxembourg has helped attract more than 40,000 holding companies and thousands of high-paying jobs for its population of nearly half a million.","Amazon is among list of firms being probed by European Commission .

William and Harry also feature in the photos, both as tiny babies and later as young men. One adorable series of photos shows the two-year-old Duke of Cambridge attempting to scramble up the steps into a plane following a Balmoral break, while others show them with their mother, Princess Diana.

The Queen has a long tradition of hosting visiting statesmen and the Prime Minister for parts of her stay at Balmoral with Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, and US president Dwight. D. Eisenhower among those to have visited. Balmoral, which is privately owned by the Queen, was purchased by Queen Victoria in 1852, although the castle's royal connections are of a considerably older vintage. First mentioned in the 12th century, Balmoral began life as a hunting lodge owned by Robert II of Scotland but had been handed to the Drummond family who built the first castle on the site in 1390.

Later, the castle became the property of the Earls of Huntly before passing into the Farquharson family. The Farquharsons, committed Jacobites, were involved in both uprisings as well as the Battle of Falkirk in 1746 during which James Farquharson, the then owner, was wounded. With the Jacobites defeated, the estate was declared forfeit and was handed to another branch of the family, the Farquharsons of Auchendryne, who in 1798, sold it to James Duff, 2nd Earl Fife. He, in turn, leased it to Sir Robert Gordon, a younger brother of the Earl of Aberdeen, who lived there from 1830 until his death in 1847. It was then that Queen Victoria, already in love with the rolling Scottish moors, stepped in to buy the property, eventually rebuilding the house and clearing the way for generations of royal holidaymakers.

"The Super Isa, which was one of George Osborne's flagship announcements in the last Budget, is due to be launched on July 1 . Banks and building societies are slashing savers’ Isa interest rates by up to 40 per cent – just weeks before the launch of the Chancellor’s flagship Super Isa. Savers are set to miss out on hundreds of pounds a year as high street names including Lloyds, Halifax, Santander, Tesco Bank and Virgin Money rush to cut cash Isa rates to avoid big interest payouts. Under current rules, savers can put up to £11,880 into a tax-free Individual Savings Account (Isa) each year, but only half of this can be in cash – the rest must be made up of stocks and shares. But the new super-charged Isa – to be launched on July 1 – will allow savers to put in up to £15,000 cash a year. It will also be made easier to transfer balances from one ISA to another. The policy was one of the George Osborne’s flagship announcements in the last Budget. However, just three weeks before it launches, banks and building societies are pushing down rates to avoid paying extra interest on the new bigger allowance. Around 16million people hold cash Isas. Around 2.7million invest only in share Isas and 4.4million have savings in both. Lloyds Bank has chopped the rate by a fifth for new savers, cutting its easy-access Cash Isa Saver from 1.25 per cent to 1 per cent. On Monday, rival Santander will slash interest on its two-year fixed rate cash Isa Saver to 1.5 per cent. Just weeks ago, it was 2 per cent. Payouts are falling even more sharply at Leeds Building Society. It now pays new savers opening an account just 0.75 per cent, down from 1.25 per cent – so someone who saved the full £15,000 in a Super Isa for a year would get  just £112.50 in annual interest. Others to cut rates for new savers include BM Savings, part of the Lloyds Banking Group, and Ipswich Building Society. Dr Ros Altmann, a savings expert and former Downing Street adviser, said: ‘This outrageous behaviour shows how, once again, savers are being hung out to dry. ‘Savers have been suffering for five years since base rate had to be cut because of banks’ behaviour. And now here they are again – still being made to pay in the shape of rate cuts for their Isa savings.’ The rate-cutting has left millions of savers who are sitting on their cash waiting for a top Super Isa deal in limbo – often earning a paltry rate of less than 1 per cent. Figures from the Bank of England showed that sums held in cash Isa deposits in April, usually the biggest month for attracting new money, fell by a record £2.8billion to £226billion. Part of the problem for savers is that banks and building societies don’t want to be at the top of Best Buys tables as it means they will attract funds they don’t want. Having lots of savers costs banks money because they must pay them interest. This has increasingly led to a race to the bottom of the savings tables. Additionally, some of the remaining best deals are already closed to transfers, blocking savers from moving money held in a low-paying cash Isa into a better deal. For example, Nationwide’s easy-access Flexclusive Isa at 1.75 per cent interest is only for current account holders and does not accept transfers. Other top deals including the National Savings & Investments Direct Isa paying 1.5 per cent, and Cheshire and Derbyshire building societies offering 1.6 per cent, will not let customers switch in cash from existing Isas. Charlotte Nelson, a spokesman at financial analysts Moneyfacts said: ‘The launch of the Super Isa is set to be a damp squib. ‘Banks and building societies have no appetite whatsoever for savers’ cash – they just don’t need it. The best we can hope for is a small rate rise from one bank to try and spark some competition for savers – but it just doesn’t look like it at the moment.’ The dearth of decent deals just 23 days ahead of the Super Isa’s introduction is the latest bad news for savers hoping for rising rates. They have suffered after more than five years of the Bank of England keeping the base rate at just 0.5 per cent – with no sign of a significant rise on the horizon. Bank of England governor Mark Carney recently dampened expectations of a rate rise by suggesting falling unemployment did not necessarily mean rates would go up.","Savers will miss out on hundreds of pounds as high street banks cut rates .

"Dr Liz Dawson specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes, but her habit of prescribing medicine for the cat became ‘common knowledge’ at her surgery . A GP has been prescribing insulin needles and chemotherapy drugs – for her sister’s pet cat. Dr Liz Dawson specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes, but her habit of prescribing medicine for the cat became ‘common knowledge’ at her surgery. The 35-year old justified the prescriptions by saying she ‘knew how expensive medication was when prescribed by the vet’. Many pet owners will be aware of the painful cost of vets’ bills – but Dr Dawson’s sister, Julia Wallace, 37, sends her daughter to the £10,000-a-year Warwick Preparatory School and lives in a large detached house. Between June and December 2013, Dr Dawson – who practises at Horsefair Surgery in Banbury, Oxfordshire – submitted five private prescriptions for insulin, needles and chemotherapy tablets to Cox and Robinson pharmacy in the town. All items were charged at cost and the prescriptions were made out ‘for use in my practice’ – despite being intended for the cat. Insulin needles for animals can cost double those for humans, at around £13 for 100. According to the General Medical Council (GMC) the medical treatment of animals is restricted to those registered with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, so by writing a prescription for a cat, Dr Dawson was breaking the law. Last month, Dr Dawson complained about GPs’ workloads in her local newspaper, saying: ‘GPs are bearing the brunt of trying to save NHS money ... We need better funding to recruit to reduce the intensity of our workloads.’ But a whistleblower said: ‘It’s outrageous. Perhaps this doctor’s workload would be less if she stuck to medicine and not veterinary practice.’ He said he became aware of the prescriptions because Dr Dawson ‘was very open about it and it was common knowledge’. The whistleblower complained to the GMC, who admitted that Dr Dawson had broken the law – but decided against any further action. The GMC is the main regulator for doctors, and ensures they meet good standards of medical practice. When she initially found out about the complaint, Dr Dawson telephoned the GMC to tell them she had consulted with the vet, and justified the prescriptions by saying that vet’s bills were too expensive. Between June and December 2013, Dr Dawson – who practises at Horsefair Surgery (above) in Banbury, Oxfordshire – submitted five private prescriptions for insulin, needles and chemotherapy tablets to Cox and Robinson pharmacy in the town . In its response to the complaint, the GMC admitted that the prescriptions were for a cat but said further investigation was not warranted. It stated: ‘It is alleged that Dr Dawson prescribed inappropriately and irresponsibly in that she prescribed medication for her sister’s cat. ‘Dr Dawson [clarified] ... that she had first consulted with the vet and pharmacist before prescribing the medication. The prescriptions were made out “for use in my practice”. ‘By treating a cat Dr Dawson has transgressed the legal remit of veterinary practice. However we note Dr Dawson’s comment that she had talked to the vet and pharmacist and thus taken steps to ensure that the cat received appropriate medication. ‘Dr Dawson did write that the medication was for use in practice, which was not true. [However], the case examiners concluded that we do not need to take any action against her registration [as a GP]’. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the GMC, said it did not normally comment unless action was taken on a case. However he added: ‘What we can say in general is that doctors have access to the whole range of medications and they must exercise that privilege responsibly. That does not include prescribing for animals.’ Mrs Wallace and Horsefair Surgery declined to comment.","Dr Liz Dawson specialises in coronary heart disease and diabetes .

"A techy father has come up with a novel way of keeping an eye on his son as he walks to the school bus stop - a flying drone camera. The 21st century solution to the time-honoured tradition of escorting children to the bus stop is the brainchild of Paul Wallich. Called the Kid-Tracking Drone the hi-tech gadget uses a smart phone and chat software to record  images from a lightweight 'quadcopter'. Scroll down for video . Spy in the sky: The quadcopter has a central frame to hold the electronics, motors and propellers . The pictures are then beamed back to Mr Wallich's computer to give him a live view of his son as he walks the 400metres down the hill to catch the bus. Once he is safely on board the flying machine hovers back to the family home, ready for another flight the following day. Posting on the Inside Technology ieee site, Mr Wallich says: 'On school-day mornings, I walk my grade-school-age son 400metres down the hill to the bus stop. 'Last winter, I fantasized about sitting at my computer while a camera-equipped drone followed him overhead.  So this year, I set out to build one.' Intricate: Wires sprawl across the machine from its circuit board . Compact: The small piece of kit has a main control board plus sensors, batteries, a power distribution board and power controllers for the motors . In order to ensure the helicopter flies close to his son a beacon has been fitted in the child's backpack which uses GPS to link up to an antenna attached to the quadcopter. Mr Wallich has successfully used the device, but admits there are still some obstacles to overcome to make it efficient. He said it has proved difficult to obtain batteries powerful enough to complete the flight when weather conditions are anything other than fairly flat, and wind has also proved to be a problem. He added: 'To see the world from the quadcopter’s point of view, you can put together a fancy video-transmission rig, or just do as I did—strap on a smartphone and fire up your favorite video chat app. 'The motors I got can lift a few kilograms, but my surveillance drone’s total weight comes closer to 1 kilogram, for a good margin of maneuverability. ' He used open-source code to keep the helicopter stable in flight and to ensure it maintained whatever altitude the controller commands. Back from the comfort of his home Mr Wallich can connect to a number of PC-based graphical user interfaces that overlay the quadcopter’s position and other data on a map in real time.","Images are beamed back to Paul Wallich's computer from on-board camera .

"Security contractors warned Hillary Clinton's U.S. State Department nearly three months before a deadly 2012 terror attack on its diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya that guards were quitting at an alarming rate, leaving the facility vulnerable to assault. Judicial Watch, a center-right watchdog group, said Tuesday that it obtained damning emails as part of a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit against the State Department. They paint a picture of frantic warnings about armed security personnel not showing up to work and refusing to work night shifts because they were afraid of the Islamist militia that ultimately killed America's ambassador to Libya and three other Americans as they laid waste to the compound. The documents refer repeatedly to 'emergency shift' workers and show 8-hour windows in overnight security rotations when few if any guards were on patrol. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Mayhem: A terrorist militia linked with al-Qaeda attacked the U.S. State Department's outpost in Benghazi, Libya on Sept. 11, 2012, killing America's ambassador and three other US personnel . Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has caught much of the blame for failing to oversee the Benghazi compound's security needs, and for helping to obscure the terrorist nature of the deadly coordinated assault . Warnings began on June 30, 2012 with a report from Blue Mountain Libya, the contractor tasked with protecting the Benghazi outpost. The company told State Department Contract Specialist Neal Kern security guards were fleeing and leaving the Benghazi Mission vulnerable. 'Due to the amount of local guard force members leaving out of fear of their safety,' the company reported, 'and the long process to security check individuals, it makes it very difficult to quickly react to a large drop in staff in quick succession as has been occurring with all the incidents.' Chief among those 'incidents' was the June 5 bombing of the compound's outer perimeter wall. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican, later wrote to then-Secretary Clinton that the attack left a hole described by locals as 'big enough for forty men to go through.' Blue Mountain's reports to the State Department included a note that six days later a guard 'did not attend' his night shift 'and gave no prior warning of absence.' 'It is believed that the explosive device set off on the compound perimeter wall had a lasting effect on certain members of the staff,' the report said; 'this promoted a fear factor when it came to working the nightshift.' Three days later the company warned the State Department about 'last minute resignations of ... guard staff' that left the mission's security even weaker. The newly uncovered documents 'show that the U.S. Special Mission at Benghazi was a sitting duck and that the State Department’s local militia ""security"" feared for their own safety and wouldn't even show up to provide necessary protection,' Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said in a statement Wednesday. 'All security indicators were flashing red and, perhaps, with a show of strength to secure the Benghazi mission, U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods might be alive today.' Problems with protecting the compound were apparent in reports filed about incidents going back as far as April 2012. Aftermath: The compound was destroyed and abandoned quickly as American personnel scrambled to evacuate . One of Blue Mountain's guard commanders was fired on April 18 after he got into a fight with a soldier tasked to a Quick Reaction Force in Benghazi. Another guard 'failed to turn up for duty' without warning on April 22. That left the entire compound in the hands of four men during the perilous hours between midnight and 8:00 a.m. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, then the State Department's chief spokesperson, claimed three days after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack that no outside contractors had been hired to provide security for the Benghazi mission. She was forced to retract that statement a week later, conceding the Blue Mountain Group was contracted to keep the facility and its personnel safe. Judicial Watch said Wednesday that the Obama administration has not turned over any documents showing the state of security in Benghazi during the last critical weeks before the attack. The group announced three new federal lawsuits demanding those records, and others that relate to the State Department's role in crafting a false narrative about the attack's causes. Numerous Obama administration officials, including the president himself, pinned early blame on a clumsily produced online video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad. While simultaneous protests in Egypt and elsewhere were in part inspired by outrage over the video, no evidence has emerged to suggest that the militants who attacked in Benghazi were acting as part of a spontaneous mob. Instead, investigations have consistently shown that the armed assault was a carefully planned and expertly executed military mission, complete with precision mortars that plunged the compound into chaos. Mrs. Clinton, now the Democrats' front-runner in the 2016 presidential contest, still faces stern questions from members of Congress and the press about her role in the security failures and the attack's PR-nightmare aftermath.","Contractor providing security to diplomatic facility in Libya told State that terrified security guards were fleeing their posts .

"A psychology professor has pleaded guilty in a California courtroom to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter in the murder nearly 20 years ago of her alleged rapist. Norma Esparza, 40, is one of four people accused of the 1995 killing of Gonzalo Ramirez, 24, whose body was found hacked to death with a meat cleaver on the side of a road in Orange County. A fifth suspect shot himself during a standoff with police in 2012. Esparza, a professor at Webster University in Geneva, Switzerland, was arrested in the cold case murder two years ago after she re-entered the U.S. for an academic conference. Norma Esparza, 40, is facing six years in state prison after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter in a California courtroom on Friday . Before changing her plea, the wife and mother of a four-year-old daughter had been due to face trial for one felony count of special circumstance murder - a charge that if convicted carried a life sentence without parole. She is now expected to be sentenced to six years in state prison and will testify against her co-defendants, announced the Orange County district attorney’s office on Friday. Esparza had previously rejected a plea deal that would have handed her a three-year prison sentence. 'The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,' she said last November. Accused: Ex-husband of Norma Patricia Esparza, Gianni Van (left), and Shannon Gries (right) She told a grand jury that she never meant for Ramirez to be killed and that her ex-boyfriend, Gianni Van, forced her to point him out after she told him about the rape. Esparza’s attorney, Jack Earley, said his client, who is married and has a young daughter Arianna, was unwilling to risk a life sentence if convicted of murder. Though Esparza did not intend for Ramirez to be killed, he said, she was not forthcoming about the slaying when police confronted her about it almost two decades ago. 'She was frightened,' he told the LA Times. 'And she realizes that... there’s a chance people will hold her accountable for that. It’s very hard for someone to put themselves in her situation. At trial they’d be looking at a 40-year-old instead of what she was at the time, which was a 20-year-old girl.' Prosecutors have described the murder of Gonzalo Ramirez as a 'revenge killing.' They allege that on 15 April, 1995, a 20-year-old Esparza was at a bar with a group of friends, including former boyfriend Van, when she pointed out Ramirez, claiming he had raped her in her dorm room at Pomona College in Claremont, California, a few months earlier. Involved: Diane Tran (left) has plead not guilty in the crime, and Kody Tran (right) would have been charged had he not shot himself in a standoff with police in 2012 . According to the prosecution, Esparza, Van, Kody Tran, Diane Tran and Shannon Gries followed Ramirez when he left the bar in the early hours of the following morning. They intentionally rear-ended his vehicle, say prosecutors, forcing him to get out of the car to inspect the damage. He was then kidnapped. His body was found on the side of Sand Canyon Road in Santa Ana hours later. Esparza says she was forced by the aggressive Van to identify Ramirez and then coerced to keep the secret of his murder for almost two decades. Diane Tran, Shannon Gries and Gianni Van have also been charged. All have pleaded not guilty. Co-defendants Van, 45, and Gries, 43, are charged with felony murder in the commission of a kidnapping. They are expected to go on trial next year. A third suspect, Diane Tran, 45, of Costa Mesa, Calif., pleaded guilty earlier this year to voluntary manslaughter and is expected to be sentenced to four years in prison, prosecutors said. Esparza's current husband Jorge Mancillas, left, told reporters that Esparza was pressured into marrying Van so that she would not be bound to testify against him . Tran’s husband, Kody Tran, who was also a suspect in the case, shot himself during a standoff with police in 2012. Kody Tran died after shooting himself in a standoff with police in July 2012. Esparza says she met Ramirez in a Santa Ana nightclub. The next morning he asked her to breakfast and offered to drive her and some friends back to Pomona College. Once in her dorm room, he raped Esparza, who went to a school nurse and was given the morning-after pill. She was too ashamed to report the rape to authorities and the nurse did not advise her to do so. 'I don't think I was thinking at that time,' she said. 'I felt ashamed. I felt guilty. I didn't want to come forward because I didn't want my family to know.' Julie Ann Rojas, who was Gries then-girlfriend, testified that she was with Van and Esparza the night Ramirez died. She said Van, Gries and Kody Tran attacked Ramirez while she and Esparza went to a bar. After about an hour Roja and Esparza went to the transmission shop owned by Kody Tran where Esparza said she saw Ramirez tied and hanging from the ceiling. Esparza, who is married and has a young daughter Arianna, was unwilling to risk a life sentence if convicted of murder . After Ramirez's death, Esparza began dating Van again and the two were married. Esparza's current husband Jorge Mancillas told reporters that Esparza was pressured into marrying Van so that she would not be bound to testify against him. He said that his wife was told that Ramirez was 'roughed up' and was unaware of the murder until weeks later when she was questioned by police. Esparza, who says she suffered years of sexual abuse by her father as a child, said at a news conference last November that she lived in fear of Van for years after the attack. 'All I knew is that I wanted to survive,' she said. 'All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.' Mancillas and Esparza have a four-year-old daughter Arianna. Until her arrest, the family had lived in a small town in France on the Swiss border and Esparza was an assistant professor of psychology and counseling at Webster University.","Norma Esparza, 40, is facing six years in state prison after pleading guilty to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter on Friday .

"The Premier League has had its share of renowned dead-ball specialists down the years, with the likes of David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo and Leighton Baines among them. However, none of them make the top three most clinical players of the last 14 years when it comes to scoring direct from free-kicks. Instead, top of the pile is Manchester United's Juan Mata who, based on official Premier League data, has been the deadliest set-piece exponent during that period. Juan Mata is the Premier League's most deadly free-kick taker of all-time . The Spaniard scores from a set-piece for Manchester United against Southampton last year . The Spain international has scored five of his 28 attempts, giving him a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent - almost three times the success rate of Everton ace Baines, who is ninth on our list with 6.6 per cent (five goals from 76 shots). Second on the list - compiled from players who have scored five or more free-kicks since the start of the 2001-02 season - is Sunderland's Sebastian Larsson, who showed his prowess with a brilliant set-piece strike against Tottenham at the weekend. That was the 11th time the Sweden international has scored direct from 90 free-kick attempts in the Premier League, giving him a conversion rate of 12.2 per cent. At that current rate, the final tally is set to be around 26 at the end of the campaign - well down on the 39 scored last season when Yaya Toure, Mata and Baines were especially deadly, and a figure which would represent the second lowest in the 13-and-a-half-seasons since official records began in 2001/02. The highest number of free-kick goals scored in the last 14 years goes to former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry with 12 (8.3 per cent), but it must be noted that he, along with the likes of third-placed Beckham (five goals at 9.3 per cent), were also playing top-flight football before the 2001-02 season. Former Chelsea playmaker Mata has scored five of his 28 attempts, a conversion rate of 17.9 per cent . David de Gea is unable to stop a Mata free-kick during Chelsea's 3-3 draw against United in 2012 . Manchester City's Yaya Toure hasn't been able to match his impressive free-kick success rate of last season . So far 246 shots direct from free-kicks have been attempted in the Premier League this season, an average of 1.12 per match. That is by far the lowest amount, with the highest coming in the 2008-09 season when the average per game was 1.72, with 31 goals scored during the campaign from 652 tries. Perhaps it is no coincidence that season was also Cristiano Ronaldo's final one in England. The former Manchester United man is famed for his dead-ball prowess and willingness to try his luck from most ranges and angles, and it should be no surprise to see him near the top of the list for free-kick attempts in the Premier League since the start of the 2001-02 campaign. Sebastian Larsson scores from a free-kick against Tottenham - his 11th goal from 90 set piece attempts . David Beckham, known for his fantastic free-kicks, finish in fourth place with a 9.3 per cent conversion rate . The current Real Madrid star and reigning Ballon d'Or winner had 164 shots from free-kicks in top-flight matches and scored 10 during his time at United, for a conversion rate of 6.1 per cent. That ranks him the 11th most clinical player on our list, . Larsson, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink (six goals at 9.7 per cent), David Beckham (five goals at 9.3 per cent) and Nolberto Solano (seven goals at 9.0 per cent) complete the top five. Frank Lampard had the most attempts of players who had scored five or more free-kicks, with the midfielder trying his luck 175 times for seven goals (4.0 per cent). Cristiano Ronaldo had 164 shots from free-kicks in top-flight matches and scored 10 during his time at United . Former Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is third on the most deadly set-piece takers list . Thierry Henry scored the most direct free-kicks with 12 - his conversion rate was 8.3 per cent .","Juan Mata is most clinical set-piece taker in the last 14 years .

"The security team charged with defending the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 say they were told to 'stand down' for nearly half an hour after it was attacked, a new book reveals. The team, who were stationed in a nearby CIA annex, allege that they were ready to go within five minutes of the attack starting but were ordered not to deploy by a top CIA chief. Instead they waited in their vehicle before eventually ignoring their orders and moving into battle. By the time they arrived,  ambassador Christopher Stevens was dead, along with American Sean Smith. The team say if they had been allowed to deploy earlier, those men would still be alive. Scroll down for video . The CIA team charged with protecting the U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya when it was attacked in 2012 say they were told to 'stand down' for half an hour by a CIA official after the attacks began . The team say if they had been allowed to deploy immediately Christopher Stevens, the U.S. ambassador, and American Sean Smith would not have been killed . Speaking to Fox News, commando John Tiegen, said: 'I strongly believe if we'd left immediately, they'd still be alive today.' In a new book called 13 Hours, Tiegen and four of his colleagues discuss what happened that night for the first time from a soldier's perspective. They say word of the attack first reached the CIA building at 9.30pm, and they got ready in such a hurry that one of the team forgot to put underwear on, while another was dressed in cargo shorts. Christopher Stevens suffocated in the attack after the consulate compound was set alight . But as they climbed into their vehicle fully armed and ready to go, a commander identified only as 'Bob', told them to wait. Tiegen recalls telling the commander, 'Hey, we gotta go now! We’re losing the initiative!' but was told 'No, stand down, you need to wait,' reports the New York Times. According to the commandos, the chief later told them that Libyan militias were being called in, but the Libyan guards at the consulate compound deserted without firing a shot, and no other support ever came. Eventually, the commandos received a radio message from the compound: 'If you guys do not get here, we are going to die!' At that point, in defiance of their orders, the men went to help. At around 10.30pm the team made it into the compound and rounded up the surviving personnel before loading them into a convoy. They were unable to find ambassador Stevens, who by that time had died from suffocation after the buildings had been set alight. As the team moved out of the diplomatic compound their convoy was attacked, and once they were inside the CIA annex, that too became the target of rocket and small arms fire. These patchy attacks went on for roughly 90 minutes as the commandos fought on-and-off battles with gunmen lurking in side streets and alleyways. Around the same time, a CIA security team based in Tripoli, which included two U.S. military officers, landed at Benghazi airport. In a new book, the security team say they were told three times not to deploy, before eventually ignoring their orders and driving to the beseiged compound . The commandos say officials tried to bring in local Libyan militias to help, along with heavier weapons, but no meaningful support materialised until the next morning . Not long before dawn, the reinforcements from Tripoli managed to take themselves and a convoy of vehicles to the CIA base to prepare for an evacuation. Just after they arrived mortars began firing on the base, killing another two  security officers after they took a direct hit from one of the shells. It took until 5.30am, a full nine hours after the attack began, for Libyan security forces to arrive with heavy weapons. A security services spokesman denied the claims, saying: 'A prudent, fast attempt was made to rally local support for the rescue effort and secure heavier weapons.' The official said 'there was no second-guessing those decisions being made on the ground' and 'there were no orders to anybody to stand down in providing support.'","Ambassador Christopher Stevens killed during 2012 attack in Benghazi .

"These are the shocking pictures of a Roma teenager who was beaten and left for dead in a supermarket trolley. Vigilantes kidnapped the 16-year-old boy, known only as Darius, from the camp he shares with his family near the northern commuter town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine on the outskirts of Paris. The thugs rang the youngster's mother demanding a €12,000 ransom for the safe return of her son. The figure was later reduced to €4,000, but when it was not paid, the gang battered Darius before dumping him in a shopping trolley before leaving it on the roadside. The teenager, known only as Darius, left, was found dumped in a shopping trolley by members of his family, right, after he was brutally assaulted by the vigilante gang on the outskirts of Paris on Friday night . Doctors in a Paris hospital have placed Darius in a medically induced coma following Friday's brutal assault, which has left him fighting for his life. Police confirmed that Darius was set upon on Friday night by a ‘dozen masked men on waste ground around Pierrefitte,’ according to a police source. The boy's mother has told detectives that she received a call from the vigilantes on his abandoned mobile phone. The shocking photographs first appeared on The Telegraph. They . were first alleged to have asked for around £12,000 before reducing the . demand to around £4,000, saying he would be hurt if the ransom was not . met. Nothing was paid in . the end, and Darius was left in the trolley close to the illegal Roma . camp in the northern suburb of Pierrefitte where he lived, according to . local prosecutor Sylvie Moisson. Ms Moisson said Darius was held in a basement by men wearing masks and carrying weapons after he was linked to a burglary. Calling . the attack 'an act of barbarism', she said the burglar's description . fitted that of Darius, who was 'quickly hunted, kidnapped, held, beaten . and left to die.' It was his mother who reported the attack, and the victim was found shortly after 11pm on Friday. A . spokesman for the Lariboisiere hospital in Paris said Darius was . still in a 'chemically induced coma' because of the pain he was . experiencing. Attack: A 16-year-old boy, who lived on this illegal Roma camp, is in a coma after he was allegedly beaten by vigilantes following a suspected burglary . Accusation: The horrific assault happened after the 16-year-old, named only as Darius, was accused of stealing from people's houses in the northern commuter town of Pierrefitte-sur-Seine . Attack: Darius, who lived with his family in one of dozens of illegal camps set up by Roma gypsies, mainly from Bulgaria and Romania, was set upon on Friday night . French president Francois Hollande said the incident was an 'unspeakable and unjustifiable attack on all the principles on which our republic was founded'. In turn, critics said Mr Hollande's government had stigmatised the Roma. Prime minister Manuel Valls last year insisted that the Roma 'could not integrate' and should be sent back to Romania or Bulgaria, even though many are EU citizens. Charity and human rights groups were . furious in April when a leaked police memo called for the 'systematic . eviction' of Roma from Paris. A . spokesman for Charity group Catholic Help described the note as a . 'scandal', saying that it 'stigmatised a poor community' and amounted to . 'racial profiling'- something which is illegal in secular France. Prime . Minister Valls has continued a policy started by former president . Nicolas Sarkozy of razing Roma camps, and trying to deport as many of . their occupants as possible. Demands: Although the vigilantes allegedly asked Darius's mother for a ransom, nothing was paid and he was left in a trolley close to the illegal camp . Anger: French president Francois Hollande said the incident was an 'unspeakable and unjustifiable attack on all the principles on which our republic was founded' This has led to protests from a number of . human rights groups, including Amnesty International, which points out . that most Roma France are Romanian or Bulgarian and as such are EU . citizens with the right to live and work in the country. In 2011, France's then Interior Minister Claude Gueant said the notoriously poor and corrupt eastern European states were responsible for exporting some of the most notorious sneak thieves in the world. It has led to Romanian police arriving in Paris to support their French counterparts in clampdowns on the Roma.

"Apple users are finding the long-awaited iOS 8 update likes to jump the gun when it comes to shooting selfies. The company released the update to the mobile operating system last week with an overhauled Messages app that many were simply not ready for. A reporter for TechCrunch was led astray by what she thought was a shortcut for taking a carefully posed selfie to send over iMessage. Scroll down for video . Accidents: Holding down and flicking the camera button will immediately send out a selfie, instead of giving users a chance to edit . Holding down a button on the left side of the screen brought up two menu buttons, one for video and one to take a photo. Clicking on the photo button, it turns out, snaps a photo and sends it out immediately without the option of editing it. So with no time to get the lighting right or edit the photo just so, you could become a victim of the accidental selfie. The new iOS update has already faced criticism. Co-founder and CEO of messaging app WhatsApp snarked 'very flattering to see Apple ""borrow"" numerous WhatsApp features into iMessage in iOS 8 #innovation' on Twitter back in June. Rash: Frustrated users took to social media to share their dissatisfaction and their awkward selfies caused by a poor rollout of the new Messages app . The Verge pointed out that trying to 'own' all conversations on a single device was a losing prospect, when products like WhatsApp could be used across platforms. It seems likely that Apple will roll out a fix for the accidental selfie issue, but until their iOS is ready for selfies, users will just have to be selfie-ready at all times.","The new Messages app allows users to send photos, video and voice memos .

"[headerlinks] . Test-tube meat has moved a step closer to supermarket shelves after a scientist produced a burger from muscle tissue grown in a laboratory. It promises to be kinder to the environment, reduce animal suffering, and solve the problem of food crises - but will people want to eat it? The meat was produced in huge vats from muscle cells by Dr Mark Post, from the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands. Samples of the in-vitro meat, or cultured meat grown in a laboratory at the University of Maastricht. Other non-meat ingredients include salt, egg powder, and breadcrumbs. Red beetroot juice and saffron are added to provide authentic beef colouring . Scientists are cooking up new ways of feeding the world's ever growing hunger for meat that could save the environment and the lives of millions of animals . Dutch scientist Professor Mark Post examines samples of in-vitro meat grown in his lab. In-vitro meat or cultured meat is an animal flesh product that has never been part of a complete, living animal . The hamburger, built from strands of beef muscle tissue grown in a laboratory and to be cooked and eaten at an event in London is meant to prove to the world — including potential research fund donors — that so-called in-Vitro meat, or cultured meat, is a reality. His work is funded by the Dutch government, as well as an anonymous donation of 300,000 euros - but it remains to be seen, however, whether the pioneering development will find favour with a public that likes to think of its chops, steaks and sausages as having their roots in nature, rather than in test-tubes. His burger consists of about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue, the New York Times reported. Dr Post, who has conducted some informal taste tests, said that even without any fat, the tissue 'tastes reasonably good.' The world's first test-tube burger, made from lab-grown meat, is being cooked and eaten in London today. The 142g patty cost £250,000 to produce and is made from 20,000 strips of meat grown from cow stem cells. This image is of a traditional burger made from beef. Pictures of the test-tube burger have not been released yet . The burger consists of about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue and tastes 'reasonably good' (not pictured) He plans to dish it up at an event in London next month - adding only salt and pepper for flavour. The cell-grown burger is produced with materials — including fetal calf serum, which used to grow the cells — that will eventually be replaced by materials not orginating from animals, the New York Times reported. In-vitro meat or cultured meat is an animal flesh product that has never been part of a complete, living animal, and is quite different from imitation meat or meat substitutes, which are vegetarian foods made from vegetable proteins like soy . Dr Post has all but promised that meat will soon be grown in his lab. Manufactured cultured meat could be sold next to animal meat for a competitive price - but experts claim this development is far into the future. 'This is still an early-stage technology,' said Neil Stephens, a social scientist at Cardiff University in Wales told the NYT. Scientists continue to make developments with test tubes. Some have come a step closer to replacing missing teeth with implants grown from stem cells. Researchers succeeded in engineering hybrid human-mouse teeth coated in enamel with developing roots. In . the future, it is hoped the work will lead to dentures being replaced . by real substitute molars grown from 'seeds' planted into a patient's . jaw. The technique involved growing cells from human gum tissue and combining them with tooth stem cells from mouse embryos.","Hamburger built from strands of beef muscle tissue grown in a laboratory .

"Spring cleaning the house burns more calories than running a marathon, according to new research. But it seems housewives from the Fifties and Sixties have known this all along, if these vintage photographs are anything to go by. The collection of retro images, taken in Britain and Holland, depicts the original female multi-taskers: women exercising while cleaning their homes. Like . the eerily 'perfect' robotic wives from the 1975 black comedy The Stepford . Wives, these women are literally bending over backwards to keep their houses tidy and their bodies trim. A 1957 housewife multitasks by cleaning the doors while performing her daily stretches, left, and who needs a skipping rope or an aerobics step when you can improvise with a potato masher? Good for reaching tins of tomatoes on the top shelf of the larder, kitchen steps are also handy for tightening up stomach muscles, as this 1963 housewife demonstrates . Wearing their trusty pinnies and using household props such as kitchen steps, mops, watering cans, carpet-beaters and even potato mashers, the home-bound women execute stretches and yoga positions to prove you don't need a gym membershp to stay in shape. You just need a good tea towel. One blonde waters the garden while doing a high-kick, . while a fellow wife performs a lunge while throwing out the rubbish. Other . pictures in the extraordinarily archaic series show one wife doing stretches while . sponge-cleaning a door, and another young woman executing what . appears to be a dolphin yoga pose... at the same time as mopping the . floor.

Taking out the bins has never been so much fun, left, and banish dust, cobwebs and bingo wings in one fell swoop, right . One wife decides that raking leaves is very much a man's game, and that she will instead use the gardening tool for a Pilates-style workout of her lower abs .

"David Cameron today insisted it was still possible to win back powers from Brussels and secure Britain's place in Europe, despite last week's humiliating failure to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming EU president. The Prime Minister told MPs the appointment of Mr Juncker over Britain's objections had made his renegotiation plan harder - but insisted that with 'real fortitude and real drive there's no reason why we can't succeed'. He said he still wanted to change Britain's relationship with Brussels before fighting to stay in the EU. But Labour's Ed Miliband said his strategy was in 'tatters' adding: 'You were outwitted, outmanoeuvred and outvoted. You are a defeated Prime Minister who cannot deliver for Britain.' Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister said he had stuck to his principles by refusing to support Jean-Claude Juncker. But Ed Miliband said: 'He just looks absurd' Mr Miliband, the Labour leader, accused the Prime Minister of being unable to reform the EU . Mr Miliband said: 'He started with a divided Europe over Juncker's candidacy, and ended with a united Europe against him.' The Labour leader added: 'Europe isn't unreformable, it's just he can't do it.' Mr Cameron responded: 'We have heard yet another performance worthy of Neil Kinnock  - endless words, endless wind.' The PM said Mr Miliband was 'weak, opportunist and wrong'. He added 'I have to say I won't take lectures on negotiation from the people who gave away the veto, who gave away the rebate, who backed down on the budget every year, and who even signed us up to euro bailouts. We won't take any lectures from you.' Mr Cameron was given vocal support from his backbenchers. Stewart Jackson said: 'I always knew he had lead in his pencil. I'm glad to see he has sharpened it.' Today's Commons debate came after the Prime Minister insisted it was possible to 'do business' with Mr Juncker - despite fighting tooth and nail to block him becoming President of the European Commission. The Prime Minister last night called Mr Juncker to salute his appointment, despite having spent weeks trying in vain to persuade allies not to support him. Mr Cameron insisted he wants to 'move on' from the bitter row, which left him isolated in Europe, and focus on his plans to claw powers back from Brussels. Mr Cameron’s phone call yesterday will be seen by critics as a . humiliation for the Prime Minister, who was outvoted 26 to two in . Brussels on Friday when he tried to stop the appointment of the . arch-federalist. Downing Street claimed that Mr Juncker had pledged his support for a ‘fair deal’ for Britain, and was ‘committed to finding solutions’ for the UK’s concerns about an over-centralised Europe.And Mr Cameron himself struck a bullish tone, writing in a newspaper article that he can still do business with Mr Juncker. ‘I . am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain’s interests in . Europe,’ he wrote in the Daily Telegraph, adding: ‘Anyone in Europe who . thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.’ Responding . to Mr Juncker’s claims during the nomination that he was ready to . deliver a ‘fair deal’ to the UK, the PM wrote: ‘If by a fair deal, we . can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same . place – as some have assumed up to now – then there is some business we . can do.’ Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron today insisted he can still secure reforms to Britain's relationship with Europe. 'I am ready to move on and keep fighting for Britain's interests in Europe,' he wrote. Referring to previous claims by Mr Juncker that he was ready to deliver a 'fair deal' for Britain, Mr Cameron said: 'If by a fair deal, we can agree that we are not heading, at different speeds, to the same place - as some have assumed up to now - then there is business we can do.' Mr Cameron said his decision to stick to his word showed he meant business. He added: 'Anyone in Europe who thought I was going to back down or blink is now thinking again.' Prime Minister David Cameron (left) put in a call to Jean-Claude Juncker (right) to salute his appointment . President of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker  with German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) Mr Cameron . also faced criticism from within his own party, with former Chancellor . Lord Lawson saying his pledge to get powers repatriated from Brussels . was unlikely to be realised. But . the Cabinet rallied round, with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt accusing . other EU leaders of ‘cowardice’ for not following through on their . private opposition to Mr Juncker. William Hague refused to agree it . would be a ‘disaster’ if the UK left the European Union – saying it . would be a matter for the voters in a referendum the Tories want to hold . in 2017 if they are returned to office next year. Mr . Cameron spoke to Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg prime minister and . now Commission President-designate, yesterday afternoon. Downing . Street said: ‘The Prime Minister congratulated Mr Juncker on running a . successful campaign and securing the Council nomination. They discussed . how they would work together to make the EU more competitive and more . flexible. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls branded the failed negotiations a ‘catastrophe for Britain and the British national interest’ Lord Lawson said Mr Cameron has little chance of getting powers repatriated . ‘Mr Juncker said he was fully committed to finding solutions for the political concerns of the UK.’ Mr . Cameron had tried to garner support from other leaders for another . candidate for the top job, saying Mr Juncker did not understand that . voters wanted an EU that was smaller, less interfering, and less bossy. William Hague refused to agree it would be a ¿disaster¿ if the UK left the European Union . But . his failure to persuade them means many are unconvinced he will be able . to get powers back from Brussels before the 2017 referendum. Margaret . Thatcher’s former chancellor, Lord Lawson, who has moved from being one . of the most Europhile Tories to an advocate of withdrawal, said Mr . Cameron had little chance of getting powers repatriated. ‘He’s made it clear he’s going to vote for 'in' irrespective, so he has no negotiating hand to speak of,’ he said. Labour’s . Ed Balls branded the failed negotiations a ‘catastrophe for Britain and . the British national interest’, adding: ‘I’ve never seen a negotiation . so cack-handed.’ The Shadow Chancellor told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘He’s weak, he’s lost control, he’s on the back foot, Britain is suffering.’ Mr . Hague said it was ‘far too early to say’ if the Government would fail . in its bid to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with Brussels. ‘The . Prime Minister acknowledged that the task had got harder when he spoke . on Friday,’ he said. ‘But look at the track record of the last few . years. He is the first Prime Minister to negotiate an actual reduction . in the European budget.’ Asked . if it would be a disaster to exit, he replied: ‘This will be the debate . in the referendum. I have always argued against more power going to the . European Union, but for us to be a member of Europe but not run by . Europe. The British people will decide in a referendum whether that is . sustainable or not.’ Germany’s . finance minister last night said Berlin would do everything in its . power to prevent Britain leaving the EU. Wolfgang Schäuble said a . British exit from the EU was ‘unimaginable’, and that UK membership was . important for Germany because London and Berlin share a market-oriented . reform approach. Fears intensified in Europe last night that Mr Juncker may not be able to cope with his new role because of his drinking habits. Diplomatic sources in Brussels say it is advisable to catch him before lunch, because otherwise the alcohol can take its toll. Celebrating his victory: Jean-Claude Juncker, left, apparently tweeted this picture from a bar on Friday night . There were claims at the weekend from a former Tory minister in the Foreign Office that the new President of the European Commission drinks so heavily that he has been seen to dribble during meetings. The situation is so bad, diplomatic sources claim, that he is often ‘incapable of working after lunchtime’. It has also been repeatedly suggested that he has ‘cognac for breakfast’ and that he has turned up ‘blind drunk’ at meetings. Rumours of Mr Juncker’s drinking were so serious that his habits were discussed at the highest levels by European leaders in advance of Friday’s vote which handed him the Commission crown. But leaders went ahead and voted for him anyway. The newly-elected Brussels boss raised eyebrows by apparently tweeting from a bar about his victory on Friday night. Mr Juncker resigned as prime minister of Luxembourg last year following a spy scandal. One newspaper in the country, the Letzebuerg Privat, has referred to him as the country’s ‘drunken stupor premier’ and alleged that he drank ‘a Campari, three glasses of wine and three Sambucas in only two hours’. In Britain, the former Tory minister told a newspaper at the weekend that ‘all the stories about Juncker’s drinking are true’. ‘I regarded it as pointless talking to him after 12 o’clock because at times he seemed incapable of working, so drunk you couldn’t get any sense out of him,’ he said. ‘It is every bit as bad as people say. I have seen him so p***** that he was dribbling.’","Prime Minister says reform possible with 'real fortitude and real drive'

"Apps such as Tinder and Grindr have created a ‘hook-up’ culture, but sometimes you may not want sex, or even a relationship - sometimes you just want a cuddle. And that’s where the Cuddlr app comes in. Cuddlr is a location-based meeting service that connects and matches people who want to hug strangers. The app encourages you to hug any age or gender user, regardless of whether you find them attractive or not, and provides ‘gentle, no-pressure intimacy.’ Scroll down for video .

Cuddlr was created by Chicago-born Charlie Williams, who is now based in the south west of England. To request a cuddle from a specific person, or respond to someone else’s request, tap the photo of the user. Each request is sent with a brief message, such as ‘let's meet at the park’ or ‘I'm wearing a green shirt’.

To request a cuddle from a specific person, or respond to someone else’s request, tap the photo of the user. Each request is sent with a brief message, such as ‘let's meet at the park’ or ‘I'm wearing a green shirt’. Cuddlr then shows walking directions between the two users, and once they meet and have a cuddle, they give a thumbs-up – as long as everything went well. However, in the event of an awkward or inappropriate cuddle, one user can another. The app also lets users share pictures of cuddles, and, request another hug. When users decide to have a cuddle, the app also gives  walking directions to each other, so they can meet up. 'It's a way of finding people near you who are up for a cuddle, without any pressure or expectation,' said the developers. ‘Our culture doesn't have a space for closeness without pressure. ‘The way we talk about meeting and sharing space and contact with someone assumes that it's centered explicitly around sex and dating, or based on the kind of affection a parent might show a child. ‘We're not getting the right type of contact often enough; we don't give and get enough hugs. ‘Hooking up is certainly not always a bad thing, but there's definitely an under-explored time and a place for a more gentle, no-pressure intimacy, and that's what Cuddlr aims to help with.’ Cuddlr finds the closest ‘cuddlers’ in walking distance and shares their first name, picture, and cuddle history.

The app also lets users share a picture of the cuddle, and, request another cuddle through the app. The app deliberately doesn’t feature a chat function, photo albums or shared interests because, as the developers explained, this can keep users from actually meeting. Instead, on Cuddlr, users are encouraged to get together straight away, and then part ways. Users can choose to share contact details after a cuddle, in person, although this is optional. For potential cuddlers, users will see how many successful and unsuccessful cuddles they've had in the past. Users with a substantial proportion of reports are unlikely to have their requests accepted, and Cuddlr bans anyone who is consistently using it improperly. In addition, the app doesn’t share the user’s location until they’ve indicated they want to cuddle a chosen person, and users can be blocked. The app doesn’t currently have filters for age or gender. ‘We encourage you to consider cuddling with people who you wouldn't date, sleep with, or even find attractive - as well as those you would,’ said the developers. ‘For that reason, while you can scroll past anyone or decline their cuddle requests, and you can block individuals, we do not have built-in filters for categories of people.’ The app is currently only available for iOS, but Mr Williams told the MailOnline the Android app is in the works, but isn't likely to launch until next year.","Cuddlr is a location-based social-meeting app just for cuddling .

"An American fugitive convicted for attempted murder has been found living in Kent after nine years on the run. It has emerged that Sean Lopes, 47,  has a partner, two children and a dog in the UK and even worked at Sainsbury's. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison in his absence for confronting his 22-year-old ex-girlfriend with a gun and a knife and holding her hostage in New York City in June 2004. Last . year U.S. authorities said they believed Lopes, a man named as one of . NYPD's most wanted in 2006, was hiding in Trinidad and Tobago. Caught: Sean Lopes pictured  before fleeing the U.S. in 2004 (right) when released on bail and (left)  after being arrested in Chatham, Kent after nine years on the run . Job: Lopes worked at Pepper Hill  Sainsbury's in Northfleet as a manager, insiders say . The Guyanese-born former science teacher was arrested but fled the country when released on bail. Kent police said yesterday that Lopes had been living in central Chatham, about 33 miles southeast of London. Gina Jones, 29, lived next door to Sean Lopes with her 8-year-old son. Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Jones described Lopes as a ‘weird’ man who was rarely seen out on the street . ‘I've only seen a guy in the garden twice and heard a man in there. He was weird, he never put the bins out or came out the front of the house. 'I reckon he used to go in and out the back way because you can get to the houses from a path at the back. No-one seems to know him so it makes sense now. It was as if they kept themselves to themselves. 'It's scary to think he lives next door to my kid.’ Another neighbour who wished to remain anonymous said: ‘He didn't seem suspicious, but I've only seen him walking up and down the road. 'There's so much going on in this country and not enough punishment.’ Home: The fugitive lived in this house (centre) in Chatham, Kent, and neighbours described him as a nice man . Lopes first moved to the UK in 2010 . and lived in a flat in Basildon, Essex, for about nine months before . moving to the Medway towns in Kent. One woman neighbour said he was a 'smashing chap' and has two little boys that are roughly five years old. 'I met Sean for the first time a couple of days ago. I took a parcel for him,' she said. 'When he came back in his car, I called him over and asked him what his name was. 'He said ""I'm Sean Lopes"". He shook my hand and introduced himself and told me his wife's name. 'He said he was a manager at Sainsbury's. 'He was awfully nice. He was very polite. He was a smashing chap. 'I . just cannot believe who he really is. I was devastated to find out - a . bit shocking to find out you live near a man convicted of attempted . murder.' Another neighbour, who also did not want to be named, said: 'I met the woman who lives there for the first time on Tuesday. She was having a sale in her house. 'She was there with two young boys. She said they were moving back to America where they came from'. Hideout: Kent police said Lopes had been living in the town of Chatham . Another former neighbour said: 'He said he . was Canadian. They just seemed like a normal family – dad, mum, kids and . a dog. Then, virtually overnight, they just left.' A Sainsbury’s spokeswoman confirmed . that Lopes worked at their Pepper Hill store in Northfleet, Kent, but . would not say what position he held. A female staff member at the store, . who would not be named, said: 'He wasn't popular at all - in fact, I . don't know anyone here who liked him. There was something really freaky . about him. 'He was in charge of the night shift when the store was closed and the work involved restocking the shelves and cleaning it. 'He was always moaning at people and didn't like anyone having a laugh at work. 'If someone messed around he would get nasty with them and pick on them. 'But I was shocked when I heard the news he had been arrested because he tried to murder his ex-girlfriend in America. 'It makes my skin crawl to think I worked with him - I dread to think what he could have done.' Officers arrested him Monday after consulting detectives in New York . and he appeared before Westminster magistrates court yesterday. Last year U.S. authorities said they believed Lopes, a man named as one of NYPD's most wanted in 2006, was hiding in Trinidad and Tobago . Yesterday a spokesman for Kent Police confirmed Lopes had been arrested after a member of the public raised concerns about him. In . 2004 the married father-of-one attacked his former girlfriend Amanda . Hopkins, a 22-year-old teacher from Bronx, in her home and held her . hostage at gunpoint. According . to police, Lopes was furious that Miss Hopkins had dumped him after . discovering he was not only married and a father, but also ten years . older than he had claimed. He . broke into Miss Hopkins home armed with a stun gun, a serrated knife, . black gloves and a black ski mask as well as a BB gun altered to look . like a 9-mm handgun. When she arrived home from work, Lopes allegedly tackled her, tried to strangle her and threatened her with a gun. Holding the serrated knife to her throat, he threatened Miss Hopkins, saying he was going to kill her and then commit suicide . Neighbours who heard Miss Hopkins’ screams called the police and the NYPD hostage team stormed the flat. Lopes was found still holding the knife to Miss Hopkins’ throat, yet . upon his arrest claimed she was the one holding him hostage. His wife put up their family home to cover the $250,000 bail, but he fled shortly afterwards. Extradition proceedings are in motion as of yesterday's court appearance and Lopes will remain in British custody until May 14.","American fugitive Sean Lopes, 47, has been arrested in Chatham, Kent .

"Romanians come second on the list of foreign nationals arrested by police for serious crimes, police have revealed. Nearly 28,000 have been held for serious offences in London over the past five years, including violence and sex crimes. That is the equivalent of 15 Romanians being held by the police every day.

"The BP oil spill left an oily 'bathub ring' on the sea floor that's about the size of Rhode Island, new research shows. The study by David Valentine, the chief scientist on the federal damage assessment research ships, estimates that about 10 million gallons of oil coagulated on the floor of the Gulf of Mexico around the damaged Deepwater Horizons oil rig. Valentine, a geochemistry professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, said the spill from the Macondo well left other splotches containing even more oil. Scroll down for video . An aerial photo taken in the Gulf of Mexico more than 50 miles southeast of Venice on Louisiana's tip, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig is seen burning. New research shows that the BP oil spill left an oily 'bathub ring' on the seafloor that's about the size of Rhode Island. The rig blew on April 20, 2010, and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf through the summer. Scientists are still trying to figure where all the oil went and what effects it had. BP was suspended from performing any new government work in America in November 2012, after it agreed to plead guilty and pay a $4.5billion fine (£2.8billion) for criminal charges over the Deepwater Horizon disaster. He said it is obvious where the oil is from, even though there were no chemical signature tests because over time the oil has degraded. 'There's this sort of ring where you see around the Macondo well where the concentrations are elevated,' Valentine said. The study, published in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, calls it a 'bathtub ring.' Oil levels inside the ring were as much as 10,000 times higher than outside the 1,200-square-mile ring, Valentine said. A chemical component of the oil was found on the sea floor, anywhere from two-thirds of a mile to a mile below the surface. The rig blew on April 20, 2010, and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf through the summer. Scientists are still trying to figure where all the oil went and what effects it had. BP questions the conclusions of the study. In an email, spokesman Jason Ryan said, 'the authors failed to identify the source of the oil, leading them to grossly overstate the amount of residual Macondo oil on the sea floor and the geographic area in which it is found.' The rig blew on April 20, 2010, and spewed 172 million gallons of oil into the Gulf through the summer. It's impossible at this point to do such chemical analysis, said Valentine and study co-author Christopher Reddy, a marine chemist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, but all other evidence, including the depth of the oil, the way it laid out, the distance from the well, directly point to the BP rig. Outside marine scientists, Ed Overton at Louisiana State University and Ian MacDonald at Florida State University, both praised the study and its conclusions. The study does validate earlier research that long-lived deep water coral was coated and likely damaged by the spill, Reddy said. But Reddy and Valentine said there are still questions about other ecological issues that deep.","Area the size of Rhode Island affected .

"Minnesota Vikings' running back Adrian Peterson essentially scolded his Twitter followers  for judging him on Sunday by offering a quotation on the topic from an inspirational book after a grand jury indicted him on child abuse charges. 'Come to me and rest. Give your mind a break from its habitual judging. You form judgments about this situation, that situation, this person, that person, yourself, even the weather - as if judging were your main function,' begins the passage from a book titled 'Jesus Calling: Enjoying Peace in His Presence', which takes on the voice of God. 'When you become preoccupied with passing judgment, you usurp My role.' He posted the quote, which is listed in the book under the September 13 heading, on his Twitter feed on Sunday as an image, followed by several Bible references to verses about the harms of judging, such as the famous passage from Matthew 7:1, 'Judge not lest ye be judged'. Indicted: Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson, smiling in this booking photo, reportedly admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping' The tweet also contained references to John 17:3, Romans 9:20-21 and 1 Timothy 6:15. At about the same time as Peterson was tweeting, his team was getting thrashed by the New England Patriots, 30-7 and struggled without its star running back. The team deactivated him after learning that Peterson had been indicted and a warrant had been issued for his arrest. . Peterson, 29, turned himself in to authorities in Montgomery County, Texas, early on Saturday and was freed on a $15,000 bond. The Texas grand jury indicted Peterson on Friday for reckless or negligent injury to a child, four months after the 2012 NFL MVP punished his four-year-old son by beating him with a leafless tree branch. The jury called it 'unreasonable discipline'. His status with the Vikings was in doubt on Sunday after the team's executive vice president and general manager told ESPN that 'all options are on the table'. 'Friday night was the first we heard of the formal allegations against Adrian Peterson, and we decided, as an organization, that to deactivate him this weekend was in the best interest of everybody concerned,' Rick Spielman said. 'We are, as an organization, still in the process of gathering information, and at the end of the weekend we will discuss what we will do going forward.' Vikings fans arrived at TCF Bank Stadium on Sunday wearing Adrian Peterson jerseys to show their support for the running back accused of child abuse . These pictures show the cuts and bruises on the four-year-old's arm that Peterson is said to have caused by using a leafless tree branch . A copy of the indictment issued by the grand jury accusing Peterson of reckless or negligent injury to a child . The NFL, which is reeling from its second public outcry about player misconduct in as many weeks, said Peterson would be disciplined under the league's personal-conduct policy. Peterson admitted to police that he gave his son a 'whooping' last May with a switch - a term he used to describe a leafless tree branch - on two occasions as a form of punishment while the boy was visiting him in Houston. 'Obviously parents have a right to discipline their children, except when that discipline exceeds what the community thinks is reasonable,' Montgomery County assistant district Attorney Phil Grant told the Houston Chronicle on Saturday. 'It wasn't that he just used a switch.'. Peterson said the boy pushed another one of his children off a motorbike video game they were playing. The player then grabbed a tree branch, removed its leaves and struck the child repeatedly, leaving cuts and bruises over many parts of his body, including on his buttocks, legs and scrotum. He then reportedly texted the boy's mother about the incident, saying that one wound in particular would make her 'mad at me about his leg. I got kinda good wit the tail end of the switch,' according to CBS. In further text messages, the football star said he 'felt bad after the fact when I notice the switch was wrapping around hitting i (sic) thigh' and that he “got him in nuts once I noticed. But I felt so bad, n I’m all tearing that butt up when needed! I start putting them in timeout. N save the whooping for needed memories!' He also texted the boy's mother: 'Never do I go overboard! But all my kids will know, hey daddy has the biggie heart but don’t play no games when it comes to acting right.' The child offered police a different version of events, telling them Peterson hit him on the face and that he feared further punishment for talking to the authorities about what happened. This is Peterson's home, where he admitted to beating his son with a 'switch' for punishment for misbehavior . He said that he had been hit by a belt and that 'there are a lot of belts in Daddy’s closet.' The boy also said that Peterson put leaves in his mouth when he was being hit with the switch while his pants were down and told his mother that his dad 'likes belts and switches' and 'has a whooping room.' Peterson's lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said Peterson is cooperating fully with investigators. 'Adrian is a loving father who used his judgment as a parent to discipline his son,' according to a statement from Hardin. 'He used the same kind of discipline with his child that he experienced as a child growing up in east Texas. Adrian has never hidden from what happened. He has cooperated fully with authorities and voluntarily testified before the grand jury for several hours.' The statement adds that Peterson 'deeply regrets the unintentional injury'. A grand jury indicted Vikings running back Adrian Peterson for reckless or negligent injury to a child, and a warrant was issued for his arrest . In fact, Peterson didn't think there was anything wrong with his actions when he was interviewed by police, telling them he only used 'whoopings' or spankings as a last result. When asked if some of the marks on the boy's body were from an extension cord, he said 'Oh, no, I’d never hit my child with an extension cord. I remember how it feels to get whooped with an extension cord. I’d never do that', CBS reported. After Peterson's four-year-old boy returned home to Minnesota, his mother took him to a doctor, who found a number of lacerations on this thighs, bruise-like marks on his lower back and buttocks and cuts on his hand. Tyrese Ruffin, pictured above, died last October in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Peterson, who is his biological father, only learned about him two months earlier . Joseph Patterson, the boyfriend of Tyrese's mother at the time of his death, is accused of second-degree murder. His trial is set for October . A police report obtained by a radio affiliate of CBS said the boy told the doctor that Peterson had hit him with a branch from a tree. A doctor describes some of the marks as open wounds and called it 'child abuse'. Another agreed and called the cuts 'extensive'. Peterson told investigators when they questioned him that he regarded the incident as a normal spanking and not excessive. A grand jury held in the summer had declined to charge him. A new one was impaneled in Montgomery County, Texas, and decided to pursue the indictment. In a statement, the Vikings said it was deactivating Peterson for this Sunday's home game against the New England Patriots. Peterson had plenty of fans and detractors on Twitter. Some thought what he did was nothing out of the ordinary. Others were less than kind. Another fan noted on Twitter that Peterson's image is featured on the tickets for the game this weekend, even though he won't be playing in it. The incident comes just 11 months after another son of Peterson's, Tyrese Ruffin, died in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, after allegedly being beaten by the boyfriend of the child's mother. Peterson only learned about the two-year-old's existence two months before his death. Joseph Patterson faces charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter and aggravated assault, and the trial is scheduled to begin next month. In July, Patterson pleaded not guilty to a second charge of assaulting Tyrese's mother  and holding her against her will for more than an hour. Peterson reportedly has had seven children, including Tyrese and the four-year-old. Erica Syion, a former dancer from Dallas and mother of one Peterson's kids,  said in October that her son knows of 'four other brothers and sisters' but the total number of children remains unclear.","Peterson posted a quote from an inspirational book that condemns 'habitual judging' and cites several Bible passages on the topic .

"Cris Carter, the Hall of Fame wide receiver and ESPN analyst opened up about his own upbringing in relation to the child-abuse charge brought against Adrian Peterson, as he applauded his former team's decision to drop the star on Sunday. Carter, who played 12 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, said he was proud they sidelined Peterson for the game against the New England Patriots, who crushed them, 30-7. 'My mom did the best job she could do raising seven kids by herself, but there are thousands of things that I have learned since then that my mom was wrong,' Carter said. 'It's the 21st century - my mom was wrong. She did the best she could but she was wrong about some of that stuff she taught me and I promised my kids I won't teach that mess to them.'

'Take him off the field,' he said, slapping his hand against the desk during 'NFL Countdown'. “The only thing I’m proud about is the team that I played for, they did the right thing.' A grand jury in Texas indicted Peterson on Thursday on a charge of reckless or negligent injury to a child, his four-year-old son, whom he spanked with a leafless tree branch in May as a punishment.

The Panthers placed Hardy on the inactive list for the game today against the Detroit Lions. 'How could you allow Greg Hardy on the field?' asked ESPN analyst and former Denver Broncos linebacker Tom Jackson. 'Due process has played out. He's convicted. He's appealing. We know the facts of the case. They're undisputed.' Jackson added: 'At least in this instance, Mr. Richardson and the Carolina Panthers got this right for this moment.' Jerry Richardson, owner of the Carolina Panthers, earlier in the week broke down in tears as he discussed the league's growing troubles with some of its players involvement in domestic abuse, USA Today reported. 'When it comes to domestic violence, my stance is not one of indifference. I stand firmly against domestic violence, plain and simple. To those that would suggest we have been too slow to act, I ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge,' Richardson said as he accepted the Echo Foundation Award Against Violence in Charlotte. 'Over the course of our 20 years, we have worked extremely hard to build an organization of integrity and earn the trust of our community. I work hard to continue to earn the trust, and I thank you for this award,' he said.

"Teachers in a U.S. school are being armed with handguns and trained how to take out gun-wielding attackers. Staff at Clarksville High School, in Arkansas, have been undergoing role-play training using pellet guns and with students wearing protective facemasks and jackets. The controversial move comes after parents and teachers raised concerns about children's safety in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy, in which 20 children and six teachers were shot dead. The school has decided to take advantage of a state law which allows licensed armed security guards on campus. Scroll down for video . Role play: Staff at Clarksville High School are undergoing role play training using pellet handguns to learn how to deal to with the worst case scenarios . Students wearing face masks and protective clothing are used in the training exercises, where staff operate pellet guns in role play situations . The district has recruited 20 volunteers made up of teachers, administrators and other staff and from August, after 53 hours of training, they will start carrying concealed 9mm handguns with them on the school premises. The move has divided opinion within the small town, which has a population of just 9,200 and lies 100 miles  north west of Little Rock. The town has never experienced anything like the tragedy in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, and the area is not known for having violence in schools, according to Fox News. But Cheyne Dougan, assistant principle at the school, believes arming staff will give them time to hold off any gunmen until police arrive. He told the news agency: 'This gives them an avenue to protect them until regular law enforcement can get here.' Armed staff at the school are being trained by private security firm,Nighthawk Custom Training Academy, and training will be ongoing, they say. Jon Hodoway, representing the academy, said they are creating role-play scenarios to prepare staff for the worst possible scenarios. A Clarksville staff member, wearing a protective mask, participates in active-shooter training at the city's high school in Clarksville, Arkansas . However, David Hopkins, Clarksville School district superintendent, pointed out to Fox News that this was not a solution to the problem. Arkansas state officials are not blocking the school's decision to exercise its rights to exploit the law, however, the move has not been supported by all. Arkansas's Education Commissioner, Tom Kimbrell, believes law enforcement officers should be hired to protect the children, instead of training up teachers and other staff to use armed weapons. Equally, Donna Morey, former president of the Arkansas Education Association told Fox News she thought arming staff at the school was an 'awful' idea and said school workers should simply focus on educating children. She pointed out the increased risk of children being accidentally shot by staff, or even getting their hands on weapons kept at the school. Supporter: Asst Principle Cheyne Dougan, is one of 20 Clarksville School District staff members training to be armed security guards on campus . During the handgun training, staff use air-powered pellet guns, pictured. From August, 20 school staff will carry concealed 9mm handguns . Colleen Daley, of Illinois Council Against Handgun violence, pointed out that even the most highly trained armed police continue to make mistakes and shoot innocent people. She questioned what will happen when civilians are given that responsibility in schools. One parent has even taken her son out of the school directly because of the new armed staff policy. Sherry Womack told the news service she does not believe teachers should make life-or-death decisions involving students. Ongoing training: The volunteers will  in August initially be carrying concealed armed 9mm handguns after 53 hours training, but the school says training will be ongoing .

"Ariel Castro padlocked the doors leading to his basement, his attic and his garage and never allowed his family inside, his son has exclusively revealed to MailOnline. Chilling photographs from 2001 show a grinning Castro, who is accused of holding three women captive for a decade, standing in front of a locked door - behind which unimaginable horrors would allegedly later unfold in the basement. In an interview with MailOnline, his son Anthony Castro, 31, has spoken of his shock at his father's alleged crimes and revealed how Ariel Castro asked him just weeks ago whether he believed the kidnapping of Amanda Berry - one of his victims - would ever be solved. 'If . it's true that he took her captive and forced her into having sex with . him and having his child and keeping her hidden and keeping them from . sunlight, he really took those girls' lives,' he said.

Among his infrequent contact with his . father, who separated from his mother in the 1990s, one recent . conversation particularly stands out in Anthony's mind. In mid-April, he says, his father . asked him whether he thought police would ever find Amanda Berry, who . escaped the Cleveland home on Monday afternoon. When Anthony said he thought Berry was likely dead because she had been . missing so long, Ariel responded: 'Really? You think so?' At that time, according to police, Berry was locked in the basement of his father's home. 'The . house was always locked,' remembered Anthony, who appeared visibly . tired but reacted with poise throughout the interview. 'There were . places we could never go. There were locks on the . basement. Locks on the attic. Locks on the garage.' 'House of horrors': Anthony Castro and his father stand in front of the door to the basement in 2001 . Family: A photo from the late 1990's shows Pedro Castro (top right) and his nephew Anthony (seated center) Ariel Castro, 52, was arrested with his two brothers, 54-year-old Pedro and 50-year-old Onil after Berry, now 26, dramatically escaped from the house on Monday, a decade after she vanished. Berry was rescued from the home, . along with 23-year-old Gina DeJesus, who disappeared in April 2004 at . age 14, and 32-year-old Michele Knight, who vanished in 2000 when she . was 20. The women and a six-year-old girl who was born to Berry while she was in captivity were whisked away to hospital. They have now been released and are in a safe location, authorities said. Details have started to emerge of the horrors they experienced in the house, with authorities reportedly discovering chains and tape to restrain the girls inside the home. Police sources also told NewsChannel5 that there were multiple pregnancies among the three women but that they suffered miscarriages after they were beaten or because they were so malnourished. The Castros' close links to the long-running investigation have also emerged. Pedro Castro told a TV crew last July that a police forensic excavation being conducted in the neighborhood for Berry's body was 'a waste of time'. Shock: Anthony Castro has said he is horrified at news his father, Ariel Castro, allegedly kidnapped three girls and held them captive at his home for a decade. Anthony's uncles have also been arrested . Missed: Anthony said his mother moved them from Castro's home following years of abuse . Speaking to MailOnline on Tuesday, Anthony Castro, . a banker who lives in Columbus, Ohio, depicted his father as a violent, . controlling man who nearly beat his mother to death in 1993 while she . was recovering from brain surgery. 'Abused': Anthony said his father beat his mother, Nilda Figueroa, who passed away last year . Speaking to MailOnline from his . apartment, which is dotted with numerous family pictures, Anthony said . his father was secretive and barred him from entering certain rooms when . he wasn’t around. Anthony said he last visited his father’s home two weeks ago, though he was not invited inside. He said he never suspected that his father could be keeping three women captive in the basement. 'The only thing I can express is a . tremendous level of shock,' he said. 'To those girls, it's beyond . comprehension what happened to them. It's just a nightmare. I just feel . so horrible for them. Unspeakably horrible.' Ariel's ex-wife Grimilda 'Nilda' Figueroa - Anthony's mother – moved Mr Castro and his three sisters out . of Ariel’s house in 1996 after years of violent abuse. Anthony said he now speaks with his father just a few times a year – and seldom visits his house. 'I haven't been at that house for longer . than 20 minutes for longer than I can remember,' he said. 'And we’re . talking since high school. Late 90s.' Anthony said neither he nor his three sisters have had much of a relationship with Ariel Castro. 'Having that relationship with my dad . all these years when we lived in a house where there was domestic . violence and I was beaten as well... we never were . really close because of that and it was also something we never really . talked about,' he said. Painful memories: Anthony, pictured looking through old family photos, said he rarely spoke to his father . Hurt: Anthony has spoken with family members and they all believe his father is capable of the crimes . 'It’s astonishing to even think about . that I was so close to that. That I was physically at the house two . weeks ago while that was going on, it's a lot to grasp.' Anthony said he has spoken with . several members of his family since his father and . uncles were arrested. After getting over the initial shock of the . horrendous allegations, they all have accepted that Ariel was likely . capable of holding the three women against their will . 'They're all furious. They're livid,' he said. Anthony . said he has no idea what role his uncles could have played in the . ordeal. However, he says he doesn't yet believe that the three women . were kept at Ariel's house for the entire 10 years. He . speculated that his uncle Onil, who also owns his house and lives . alone, might have been involved in keeping the women in captivity. Homeowner: Ariel Castro, 52 . Brother: Pedro Castro, 54 . Arrest: Onil Castro, 50 . Scene: Anthony said he rarely visited his father at his Cleveland home, where the women were found . Mother: Lillian Rodriguez (pictured center), the mother of the Castro brothers, returns to her home in Cleveland, Ohio after being questioned by police on Tuesday . Onil had two sons with a former live-in . girlfriend of 15 years. The sons are now in their 20s, though Onil split . with their mother about 10 years ago. He now lives alone. 'Part of me can believe he had something to do with it,' Anthony said of his uncle. 'Part of me can’t believe that it's something of this magnitude. 'My dad's brothers were the two closest . people to him. My dad’s a really private person. If anybody knew what he . was doing it would be those two. 'My dad is the most – he is the . strongest and most able-bodied about of them. My two uncles are frail. They’ve drunk themselves into terrible health.' Kidnapped: Amanda Berry, left, was 16 when she went missing in 2003, while another alleged victim, Gina DeJesus, right, was just 14 when she vanished in 2004. Both women were found on Monday . Heading home: Amanda Berry is pictured center with her sister, left, and daughter, right . Both men were alcoholics for many years, Anthony said, but Onil has since sobered up. 'When I was a kid, he was always drunk. Both of them, my uncles were always drunk,' he said. His . uncle Pedro, who lived with the mother of the brothers, has been so . badly impacted by alcoholism that it's hard to even carry on a . conversation with him, he said. Pedro, he said, seemed content just living with his mother. 'Every time I went to visit my grandmother, he always just seemed be lying on his bed, watching TV. He was there every time.' Amanda Berry disappeared in 2003 just . a day before he 17th birthday. Her disappearance shocked her . neighborhood in the west side of Cleveland . Celebration: A 'Welcome Home Gina' sign hangs on a fence outside the home of Gina DeJesus . After . the disappearance of Gina DeJesus in April 2004, Anthony Castro penned a . piece for his local paper which included quotes from her mother. He was a journalism student at Bowling Green State University when he wrote the article, entitled 'Gina DeJesus’ disappearance has changed her neighborhood', for the Plain Press in June of that year. Gina's mother Nancy Ruiz told him: 'You can tell the difference. People are watching out for each other’s kids. It’s a shame that a tragedy had to happen for me to really know my neighbors.

Public Information Officer Carter Johnson tells MailOnline they plan to meet with an attorney of the family’s church today to discuss what additional information can be released without damaging their on-going investigation. 'We want to make sure we do our part to do due diligence,' Carter said. Maggie's stepfather, Paul E Hollifield, has served as pastor at Commonwealth Christian Community Church in Crozet since September, according to the Virginia Church of God. In a Facebook page created for the family this week, the church asks for prayers of comfort for them and suggested that in lieu of sending flowers, that donations be made to a fund set up by the church to send children to youth camp, which was one of the victim’s favorite activities. Tight-lipped: Police have yet to identify the shooter or his relation to the victim, with authorities saying they plan to meet with the attorney of the family's church before releasing more information . The young family of six - with three girls, including Maggie, and a single son - is said to have moved to the neighborhood only just before last year. 'I believe they got here around eight or nine months ago. I think, not long before Christmas last year,' their neighbor Susan Coleman told the Daily Progress on Wednesday. 'I met the kids and would see them out there playing, four kids riding their bikes,' she recalled. Coleman described the area as a 'close-knit community' and said that they're 'all just saddened by this tragedy.' WATCH THE VIDEO HERE: .

"The launch of the much-anticipated Apple Watch had a noisy audience on their feet on Tuesday. But despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Tim Cook, there was something he failed to mention: battery life. The telling omission, suggests the Watch’s battery life will be the Achilles Heel of the device when it sold in early 2015. Scroll down for video . The launch of the much-anticipated Apple Watch had the audience on their feet on Tuesday. Despite the range of impressive features unveiled by Tim Cook (pictured), there something he failed to mention: battery life . Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as Pebble and MetaWatch, tend to last up to a week on a single charge. The closest Cook came to talking about the battery life for the Watch was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. A source said that Apple is unhappy with the watch's battery life, according to Re/Code. Another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ‘is about a day now.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging . The watch has a completely new user interface (left), different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown' (right) presented by CEO Tim Cook . The company's chief executive added that the Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion,’ but hourly figures were notably absent. The product costs $349 (£216) and will be sold early next year . A spokesperson for Apple declined to provide battery details to MailOnline and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year. Like many of Apple’s other products, the Apple Watch appears to have a sealed back, which means the battery cannot be replaced. This suggests that the entire $349 (£216) device will have to be replaced, once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use. Another concern is launch of the health and activity-tracking apps on the Apple Watch, which will rely on adequate battery life for round-the-clock monitoring. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a vibrations users feel on their wrist . It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone . If the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy' Companies like Fitbit and Withings have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too, monitoring sleep patterns through movements. However, if the Watch has to be charged at night, vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which Apple says will ‘motivate people to be more active and more healthy.’ Apple did, however, spend some time talking about the Watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging. The long lead time before the product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it's released, since app developers have more time to create apps specifically for the watch. Apple’s silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature. The success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time. The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.","CEO Tim Cook said Apple Watch ‘can be worn all day, for any occasion’

"Islamists fighting for Boko Haram are leaving their forest hiding places after a number of senior militants died as a result of relentless attacks by snakes and bees, it has been claimed. Two suspected Boko Haram gunmen arrested in Maiduguri in north eastern Nigeria claimed that members of the group have now fled the Sambisa Forest, close to the border with Cameroon, following 'incessant snake bites' and bee stings. Nigeria's army have been trying to flush the militants out the area for months, but it appears they are now leaving voluntarily in the belief the attacks are the spirits of their victims haunting them. Scroll down for video . Deadly: Two suspected Boko Haram gunmen claimed that members of the group have now fled Sambisa Forest, close to the border with Cameroon (pictured), following 'incessant snake bites' Guilty conscience: The militants reportedly believe the attacks are caused by the spirits of their victims. There have been widespread anti-Boko Haram protests in Nigeria (pictured) since the April kidnapping of 230 girls . Kolo Mustapha, one of the arrested men told Nigeria's Vanguard newspaper: 'Most of us are fleeing because there are too many snakes and bees now in the forest. Once they bite, they disappear and the victims do not last for 24 hours.' He claimed that the snakes attack the militants first, before dozens of bees surround the injured men and lead a second attack. Many of the Boko Haram members are now of the belief that there is a supernatural aspect to the attacks, thinking the snakes and bees may be the spirits of their victims returning to haunt them. Mustapha said he was only caught by a band of local volunteers because he was taking extra risks to flee the forest in a hurry, such was his belief in the mystical nature of the attacks. He added that other senior figures in his cell fled south east towards Cameroon - forcing young men in the remote villages they pass through to join them. Devastating: An explosion believed to have be linked to Boko Haram killed at least 22 people in a shopping mall in the Nigerian capital Abuja yesterday . Wounded: At least 17 more people were injured in the blast, including this man being helped to safety. The government has said it will check the activities of 'insurgents' The second suspected gunman, Umar Abor, confirmed his friend's account, adding: 'Almost all our comrades are leaving the Sambisa because of constant attacks by snakes and bees.' Describing the attacks as 'a plague', Abor said the Boko Haram members fled the area blaming themselves, due to their brutal campaign of murders and kidnappings in northern Nigeria. The claims were reinforced by local volunteers who say scores of Boko Haram militants have been seen fleeing the forest in recent weeks, but until now the reason for their departure was not known. The bizarre development comes as the death toll from a suspected Boko Haram bomb attack in the country's capital Abuja rose to 22. A person who had been treated in hospital succumbed to their injuries this morning, officials said. Nigeria's government said soldiers shot and killed one suspected Islamist militant as he tried to escape the scene of the attack, and arrested a second. The explosion in a shopping mall occurred just an hour before the national football team played Argentina in the World Cup. Witnesses said the blast left body parts scattered around the Emab Plaza in an upmarket district of Abuja, as billows of black smoke could be seen from a mile away. Brutal: Rescue workers carry the remains of a person in a body bag after the bomb in the crowded mall. Witnesses reported seeing shoppers covered in blood . Devastation: A Nigerian soldier at the scene of the explosion which killed 22 people and wounded 17 more in the capital Abuja. Violence is becoming more frequent . Today security . agents arrested a 'luxury' bus containing 50 suspected Boko Haram . militants in the town of Obollo Afor in the area directly south of . Abuja. Although there is no . indication the suspects had anything to do with the Abuja bombing, they . were believed to be travelling to different locations in southern . Nigeria, raising fears they were planning to carry out an attack, . according to Nigeria's Investigating Reporters website. The . Abuja attack turned what should have been a national celebration into a . national tragedy as Nigeria secured its place in the World Cup's . knockout stages for the first time since 1998. The attack came a week after 14 people were killed by a suicide bomb while watching the Brazil v Mexico match in Damaturu, Nigeria. The country's national football coach Stephen Keshi said after the bombing: 'How much of a victory is football going to give for those lives? What are they doing these guys? They did it the first game, and they now they did it again, it is sad.' Although nobody has yet claimed responsibility, the attack bears hallmarks of Boko Haram extremism. One local man, Shuaibu Baba, was in a . shop making photocopies when the blast hit, killing his taxi driver who . was waiting for him outside. 'I . lost a driver. And why? Because I came to photocopy for 10 naira . ($0.06) a page,' he said. 'I begged him to take me here and this is the . end.' Horror: Surrounded by blood stains on the floor, those injured in the bomb blast waited for treatment at the Maitama general hospital in Abuja, a relatively wealthy city . Officials said the explosion hit while the district was at its busiest, packed with shoppers and rush-hour commuters. 'I . heard a loud blast, it shattered the windows of the shop. We ran out. A . lot of people ran too, some with bloodstains,' said Gimbya Jafaru, who . was shopping nearby. Boko Haram attracted international . condemnation for the April mass abductions of more than 200 schoolgirls, . and is blamed for this week's abductions of another 91 people — 31 boys . and 60 girls and women with toddlers as young as three. In . May, twin car bombs in the central city of Jos left more than 130 . people dead; and a car bomb at a bus station killed 24 people in the . Christian quarter of Kano, a Muslim city. Nigeria's military and government claim to be winning the war in the five-year-old insurgency against the militants. But . the tempo and deadliness of attacks has increased this year, killing . more than 2,000 people so far compared to an estimated 3,600 killed over . the past four years. Boko .

"Alec Baldwin's stalker is in trouble again after she was allegedly seen lurking outside the actor's home again - just months after being released from jail on Riker's Island. Police tell MailOnline one of Baldwin's assistants spotted Genevieve Sabourin, 42, and called the cops about 9am on Friday. By the time officers arrived, she was gone. The French-Canadian actress could be arrested and sent back to jail for violating a no-contact order that prohibits her from going anywhere near Baldwin and his family. The NYPD says she is being sought for questioning on stalking allegations. Neither Baldwin nor his wife Hilaria have given public comment on the stalker's latest alleged appearance at their home in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. Scroll down for video . Violated: French-Canadian actress Genevieve Sabourin (above), 42, allegedly violated an order of protection Friday when, police say, she was found outside of Alec Baldwin's home . Jail: Years of the actress's stalking culminated last November when Sabourin was sentenced to six months in jail for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria . Neither Baldwin nor his wife Hilaria have given public comment on the stalker's latest appearance at their New York home . Years of the actress's stalking culminated last November with Sabourin being sentenced to six months in jail for stalking and harassing Baldwin and his wife Hilaria. She received an additional 30 days for contempt of court, according to People. 'Your relentless and escalating campaign of threats and in-person appearances in private spaces served at a minimum to harass, annoy and alarm Mr. Baldwin,' Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Robert Mandelbaum said in court last year before finding her guilty on all counts including harassment, aggravated harassment, stalking, and attempted criminal contempt, according toNew York Daily News. Cops: Things escalated to a critical point when Sabourin showed up at Baldwin's home in April 2012 and Hilaria (above) called the cops on her . The two reportedly met during a movie shoot back in 2000, and one decade later, Baldwin took Sabourin out to dinner and gave her career advice as a 'favor to a friend,' he told the court, People reports. That friend was 'Scarface' producer Martin Bregman. Bregman claimed that Baldwin was cheating on Hilaria with Sabourin which Baldwin denies. Sabourin said that Baldwin took her on a 'dream date' that ended in a sexual encounter and many empty promises made by Baldwin. Instead, Baldwin dropped her. Begged: Over the next few years, Sabourin would maintain a phone and email relationship.  Baldwin said he would send friendly emails but also begged her to leave him and his family alone . Claims: Sabourin claims that Baldwin took her to dinner in 2010 and the two had a sexual encounter in a hotel afterward .

It seems that since their 2010 dinner, Baldwin has been unable to rid Sabourin.

"A piece of street-art which appeared overnight in Great Malvern, Worcestershire, could be an original Banksy. The stencil, painted in the style of the world-famous street artist, depicts classical composer Sir Edward Elgar using a smartphone. The 6ft tall artwork is thought to have been painted in the early hours of the morning on a wall near a park in Sir Edward’s hometown. Another masterpiece? A Banksy-style stencil painting depicting Sir Edward Elgar using a mobile phone has appeared overnight in Malvern, Worcestershire . This would be the first time Banksy has made his mark on Malvern, with his art more frequently seen in London and his hometown Bristol. The image has been painted next to a red phone box and appears to bear all the classic Banksy characteristics, but could still be a talented copycat. It shows Elgar nonchalantly standing with one hand in his pocket, wearing a bowler hat and clutching a bright green smartphone. A spokesperson for Malvern Town Council said they were in discussions with Banksy and unable to comment further. Today, excited residents living in the spa town said they were sure the work - painted by Rosebank Gardens park - was that of Banksy. Just checking Twitter: Residents were thrilled when they discovered the artwork, which appears to have been painted during the early hours of Monday . Fingers crossed: Although Malvern Town Council were unable to confirm the authenticity of the artwork, they said they are in discussions with Banksy . Checking in: The stencil is located by Rosebank Gardens park in Great Malvern, Sir Edward Elgar's home town . Mother-of-two Sue Langley, 54, from Malvern, who was visiting the park yesterday, said: ‘It looks just like a Banksy. I'm sure it's him. I really hope it is because it would be a real honour. UK-based street artist Banksy is known worldwide for his stencils which often carries political messages or questions society. His most famous artworks include Naked Man - a lover hanging out the window of his mistress - and Balloon Girl, which he has created several of across London including Hackney and the South Bank, and rats can often be found in his stencils. Despite his worldwide fame and his artwork selling for several hundred thousands, he has managed to keep his identity hidden. It has been confirmed that he is originally from Bristol, thought in his 30s, and his name is believed to be either Robin Banks or Robin Gunningham. He has allegedly been photographed three times, in New York last year, In Santa Monica in 2011 and in Hackney in 2007. ‘It's definitely in Banksy's stencil-style that's for sure so there is a good chance it could be him. 'He has been known to pop up in big cities worldwide but to come to our little town is amazing.’ Retired mechanic Bob Smalling, 66, added: ‘It's brilliant. Fingers crossed the council don't decide to remove it. 'It looks lovely and really pays homage to our most famous son.’ However, others were not so keen with accountant Benjamin Lovell, 45, adding: ‘It is vandalism and it should be cleaned off.’ Malvern Town Council has yet to confirm whether the painting would be removed by cleaners. Banksy’s artworks are highly sought after and often fetch hundreds of thousands of pounds at auction. Just last week, a Los Angeles man tried to steal an entire wall in New Orleans bearing a Banksy painting.","The stencil graffiti appeared overnight in Malvern, Worcestershire .

"The wallet and purse have become redundant with the launch of a rubber wristband that can be used to pay for a bus journey or buy a coffee. The bPay band has been developed by Barclaycard although it can be used by anyone, regardless of who they bank with. The band contains a smart chip and a tiny radio antenna that triggers a payment when it is swiped over a terminal on a bus or the security barrier at an underground or train station. Scroll down for video . Barclaycard is trialling contactless payment wristbands (shown) in London. Called bPay the band lets anyone of any bank make payments without cards. If the trial is successful the device will be rolled out nation-wide next year. The bands are pre-loaded with money and can be automatically topped up . The same technology can pay for a cup of coffee or a sandwich when the wristband is waved across a high street till terminal. Initially, the bands will be made available to 10,000 commuters in London, however there is a plan for a national launch next year, presenting them as an alternative to cash for small purchases. Children might wear them to pay for their daily bus journey to school, while workers will be able to travel to work, buy lunch, a newspaper or a glass of wine without ever needing cash. Initially, they are a standard black, however, in time users will be able to personalise them to suit their own style and colour choice. Users effectively load money on to the band from their own debit or credit card via the bPay website and then make purchases up to a value of £20 ($32) on a single item. They can top it up themselves online or arrange for cash to be automatically loaded if it falls below a set trigger point of, for example, £5 ($8). Barclaycard is issuing the 10,000 wristbands to mark the start of a new system of contactless payments on London’s public transport system, which has now banned the use of cash to buy a bus or train ticket. The bands are one of a number of new ways to pay, which include smart tags that can be stuck on the back of a mobile phone or so-called contactless ‘tap and go’ debit cards, which are already held by millions of shoppers.

Children might wear them to pay for their daily bus journey to school, while workers will be able to travel without ever needing cash . In London, the bPay band can be used instead of the blue Oyster cards that commuters use to get around the capital, charging the same fares. The bands are part of a wider revolution in wearable technology which will allow people to negotiate daily life without using cash. Apple wants the plastic credit card to become as rare as the paper check. Last week the company announced Apple Pay, a digital payment system that lets people pay for retail store purchases using their phones rather than cash or credit cards. The service, which will work both with iPhones and Apple's new Watch, is backed by a host of big retailers, along with most major banks and credit card issuers, including Visa, MasterCard and American Express. So-called contactless payment isn't new. Starbucks, McDonald's, PayPal, Google and Square offer their own services, but only a small portion of customers use them. Some experts believe Apple Pay - with its presence on millions of iPhones and its advanced security features - could be the service that leads to widespread adoption of the digital wallet. All the major tech giants, such as Apple and Samsung, have developed smart watches, which will have a range of functions from monitoring heart rate to giving directions. Just last week Apple unveiled its smart watch and a system called Apple Pay, which will allow people to make purchases by swiping the watch or an iPhone over a till terminal. Barclaycard said: ‘Just imagine a typical day in the near future. You leave the house, hop on the train and head to the gym. After your workout, you grab a coffee and go to the office. ‘The money or information you need for every stage of that journey will be integrated into a single device like bPay band - from your travel card to your gym membership to the money for your coffee and lunch. ‘It’s a time that isn’t quite here yet, but it’s not far away. Innovations like bPay band are bringing it closer every day.’ The bPay bands, which are rubberised and waterproof, have the security benefit that they are less likely to be lost or stolen than a wallet or purse. They have already been successfully used in trials at major public events such as the British Summer Time Music Festival and London Pride, where they worked to authorise entry and buy food and drink. However, they are now moving into the mainstream in that they can be used at any one of some 300,000 till terminals around the UK - many in coffee shops and newsagents - that already work with contactless debit cards. The bPay band can be linked to any UK Visa or MasterCard debit or credit card and used to ‘touch and pay’ for transactions with a value of up to £20 ($32) wherever contactless payments are accepted. In London, the bPay band can be used instead of Oyster cards or contactless-enabled cards that commuters use to get around the capital, charging the same fares. The bands are part of a wider revolution in wearable technology which will allow people to negotiate daily life without using cash . Because it is worn on the wrist, there’s no need to dig around in a handbag for a purse, frantically hunt for a wallet or carry around a separate card holder. The band will also help commuters avoid ‘card clash’, which can arise where the card readers on buses, stations or at tram stops in London detect more than one contactless card and either take payment from a card that was not intended to be used or present an error message. Tami Hargreaves, the Head of Contactless for Barclaycard said: ‘Every second counts to Londoners on the morning commute and having to rummage around for your wallet, hunt down your purse from the depths of your bag, or encountering the dreaded red light at the ticket barrier can feel like it’s adding ages to the day. ‘With bPay band you just hold your wrist to the card reader to pay for your travel, you can then also use it to pay for your coffee on the way into the office, and lunchtime sandwich.” ‘bPay band from Barclaycard is about making paying for everyday essentials simpler than ever.’ Banks and retailers are desperate to encourage the public to switch to electronic payments, rather than real cash, notes and coins which are expense to handle and transport. The 10,000 bands that are being released in London will be free of charge, while there is no fee for making purchases in this way - at least for now. The bank said: ‘At the heart of the bPay band is a pre-paid account to which funds are either added automatically when the balance runs low or can be done so online. ‘Customers can easily manage their accounts and instantly see their transactions online using their mobile, tablet or smartphone.’","Barclaycard is trialling contactless payment wristbands in London .

"Amanda Knox has responded to an Italian court's latest decision to reconvict her of murder, saying the decision is not based hard evidence. In an interview with CNN, Knox was mostly composed as she explained her legal defense and her frustration with the court's consideration of circumstantial over forensic evidence. But she became emotional several times, tearing up, when she talked about the relationship she had with British roommate Meredith Kercher. 'I did not kill my friend. I did not wield a knife. I had no reason to,' she said. Scroll down for video . Never-ending legal battle: Speaking with CNN on Thursday, Amanda Knox again state that she didn't kill her British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007 . Close: The 26-year-old from Seattle, Washington got emotional as she spoke about Kercher, saying she wouldn't have killer her friend . The 26-year-old was first found guilty of murdering Meredith Kercher back in 2007. That conviction was thrown out four years later and Knox was allowed to return home to the United States. Victim: Knox was first convicted of killing British roommate Meredith Kercher in 2007. She was allowed to return to the United States four years later when that decision was overturned. But the case was brought up again this year . But the case was brought up again this year and on Tuesday an Italian court issued a 337-page report, which finds that Knox stabbed Kercher to death in a fight over money. According to the report, known as a . 'motivation' of the sentence, Knox inflicted the fatal knife wound to . Kercher, a student at Leeds University. The document states: 'It . is a matter of fact that at a certain point in the evening events . accelerated; the English girl was attacked by Amanda Marie Knox, by . Raffaele Sollecito, who was backing up his girlfriend, and by Rudy . Hermann Guede, and constrained within her own room.' It adds that it's difficult to establish a reason for the brutal slaying . of Ms Kercher, but goes on to cite allegations of tension between Knox and the student. It also refers to a statement that Guede made to police that Ms Kercher believed . Knox stole 300 euros (£246) - and two credits cards - from her, . which is described as a ‘valid motive’ for the murder. Knox is dumbfounded by the court's conclusions, saying she saved up money to go to Italy and wasn't financially strained. That's compared to Rudy Guede, who was seperately convicted of Kercher's murder and testified in this latest case. Couple: Knox and Socellito served four years in prison before being acquitted and released. However, they were reconvicted by the Florence appeals court on January 30, and sentenced to 28 and 25 years respectively . Knox says he was 'a known thief, a known burglar who did this on a regular basis to survive'. Jailed: Rudy Hermann Guede is currently serving a 16-year sentence for the murder of Ms Kercher . She also finds it disheartening that the court seems to value his testimony more than hers. The . latest trial also points to DNA evidence found of Knox and then . boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito at the crime scene, which she says is . unspurising considering she lived there for a month. The crucial difference between Knox and Guede, she says, is that his DNA was mixed up with Kercher's. 'If I were there, I would have traces of Meredith's broken body on me and I would have left traces of myself around Meredith's corpse,' she said. 'And I am not there and that proves my innocence. Knox is currently appealing the case from the United States and it will next go to the High Court. The judge who originally ruled out Knox's conviction responded to the latest decision as well, telling CNN it is a 'result of fantasy'. 'The Florence Appel Court has written a script for a movie or a thriller book while it should have only ocnsidered facts and evidence,' now retired Judge Claudiio Hellmann wrote. Knox says Hellman's statement give her hope that the High Court will again throw out the case, freeing her and Sollecito. But if the High Court confirms the case, which Hellmann believes is likely, Italy could be called back to prison. Support: Judge Claudio Hellmann (left) has condemned a report stating that Amanda Knox (right) murdered British student Meredith Kercher - claiming it is more like a 'script for a movie or thriller book' than evidence . Experts . believe the U.S. wouldn't extradict Knox back to Italy, allowing her to . say in the U.S., but she calls that kind of existance 'not liveable'. Ex-boyfriend Sollecito is in Italy and won't be able to escape the court's sentence. Knox . says she considers herself lucky though, that people have continued to . support her and take an interest in her case - that she hasn't been . forgotten. For now, she's . taking the case step by step and trying not to think of what might . happen in the end. She's holding hope that the case is overturned and . she can move on with her life which has been 'weighed down' by the .

It was further disclosed by officials that Plaskon is showing signs of psychosis. The attack occurred last Friday just hours before the school's junior prom, and police believe it is likely because Sanchez refused to be Plaskon's prom date. Meehan said Plaskon's parents wanted to attend the hearing, but he recommended against it because he believed it would be too difficult. He said they are in seclusion. Moved: Plaskon was transferred to a juvenile detention center and placed under mental health watch during the short hearing . Finally at peace: Maren Sanchez, shown her in an undated photo provided by her family, was laid to rest Friday morning as her confessed killer made a court appearance . 'All their hearts are broken,' Meehan said, referring to Plaskon's family. 'I think the word numb is probably the best word I could use to describe what these people are going through.' Plaskon was arraigned Tuesday at a medical facility, where his attorneys have said he has been undergoing psychiatric evaluation. State's Attorney Kevin Lawlor decided Plaskon will be prosecuted as an adult, and not in juvenile court. A witness saw Plaskon on top of the 16-year-old victim during the attack, and tried unsuccessfully to pull him away, and another saw him discard a bloody knife, according to a police affidavit.

Sad day: A girl stops Friday at a memorial for Sanchez outside Jonathan Law High School . Tragic loss: A sign with a photograph of Maren Sanchez stands among a flowers left the memorial for Sanchez . Plaskon was taken to the principal's office drenched in blood and asked by an officer what happened. 'I did it. Just arrest me,' Plaskon replied, according to the officer. The hearing occurred one day after a wake held for the teen victim, and on the same day as her funeral. The killing rocked the small coastal town perched on the Long Island Sound about 70 miles northeast Manhattan. Friends wore purple, Sanchez's favorite color, and locals lined up for hours to attend her wake.

"Just right! Israeli model Bar Refaeli would past the test, as she looks healthy and is thought to have a BMI of 18.8 . Ultra-skinny models are to be confined to history after the a law came into effect in Israel for the start of 2013. Only healthy looking models with a Body Mass Index of more than 18.5, such as the country's most famous export, Bar Refaeli, will be able to work there. The law, approved by the Knesset (the government's legislating branch) last March, requires models to produce a medical report showing they have maintained a healthy BMI for three months before a shoot or catwalk show. It also bans the use of models who 'appear underweight', meaning advertisers are not allowed to make a model's body look thinner than it really is using air-brushing. Brands who digitally alter photographs to trim away unwanted weight from models will have to clearly mark the resulting images to indicate that they have been manipulated. The law was brought in to discourage the idealisation of excessively thin bodies following a rise in eating disorders in Israeli society, particularly among young girls. Bar Rafaeli is believed to have a healthy BMI of 18.8, at 5ft 8in and 9st 1lb. But the 27-year-old is clearly curvier than some others, and has regularly appeared in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, as well as modelling for Ralph Lauren, Reebok, Gap and Marks & Spencer. The new law was drafted by Danny Danon of right-wing party the Likud and Rachel Adatto of centrist/liberal party Kadima, the Times of Israel reported. 'This law is another step in the war against eating disorders,' said Ms Adatto, a physician, after a preliminary reading of the draft law in 2011. Underweight models, she said, 'can no longer serve as role models for innocent young people who adopt and copy the illusion of thinness.' She added: 'Beautiful is not anorexic'. A report presented to the Knesset in 2002 found that five per cent of young Israelis suffered from eating disorders. Of those, 90 per cent were girls between the ages of 12 and 20. Weigh-ins: Models used in marketing campaigns such as this one, seen on an Israeli billboard, will have to produce medical reports . Models will now have to produce a medical report before they are allowed to work in the country - but this may not affect many, because Israel only has a pool of around 300 working models, according to an article from the time in the Telegraph. Einat Wilf, chairwoman of the Knesset, admitted to a certain level of scepticism over the law at Tel Aviv Fashion Week last month. 'As a legislator, [Knesset] is aware many of our laws do not get enforced,' she said. 'So I'm not sure how well this one will be.' BMI is the globally accepted method for estimating human body fat based on an individual's weight and height. But critics have said the legislation should focus on health, not weight, because some models are naturally thin, and BMI does not take genetics into account. The issue with super-thin models exacerbating probelms with anorexia is a frequent matter of concern. In 2006, countries including Italy and India banned underweight models from the catwalk after two anorexic models in Uruguay and Brazil died. Uruguayan Luisel Ramos, 22, collapsed and died soon after stepping off the runway, reportedly of anorexia-linked heart failure. Other governments have taken steps to prevent 'size zero' medical problems but have shied away from legislation. In 2008, Madrid Fashion Week banned models whose BMI was below 18, while Milan's fashion week bans models with a BMI below 18.5. The UK and US have guidelines, but the industry is self-regulated.","Models must produce medical report for three months before a shoot .

"Canadian soldier Lawrence S Gordon . A family of a Canadian soldier killed during the Second World War believe that they may finally have found his remains after he was mistakenly buried as an unknown soldier in a German cemetery. Like hundreds of British Tommies and . American GIs, Lawrence S Gordon, a Canadian who had volunteered to serve . in France with the U.S. Army, found himself without a jacket having lost . his own during fighting at the Battle of Normandy 69 years ago. It is likely that he helped himself to a German military jacket from a pile of garments taken from prisoners of war who had surrendered. Little did he know that his 'borrowing' of a German battledress top would lead his family to wonder for six . decades what ever had become of him and whether he was really alive or . dead. On August 13, 1944, Private First Class Gordon was killed in Normandy with another soldier in the turret of a machine gun-armored car. When his body was removed his dog-tag . identification was missing but a bloodstained wallet found in his pocket helped to work out who he was. It was eventually sent back to his family in Canada with a letter explaining that his wallet had been found but not his body. The German war memorial at Mont-de-Huisnes, Huisnes-sur-Mer, Normandy, France . His family believe that because Gordon was wearing a German jacket, a mistake was made and he was . believed to be an enemy soldier by the Allies. They think that his remains were . eventually placed in a cask and interred at a German cemetery at Heines . Sur Mer in Normandy along with the bones of 12,000 other soldiers, many unidentified. During the chaos in France following the D-day invasion of Normandy in 1944, supplies of uniforms were low down on . the list of logistical priorities. Allied troops advance on a beach during the invasion of the Allies in Normandy, France on June 6, 1944. Food, guns, ammunition and medical . supplies were paramount as hundreds of soldiers on both sides were being . killed and wounded with each day. Now six decades after his death, . Lawrence Gordon's nephews Lawrence and Sam believe they have traced his body after painstakingly . combing through war records. Last week, they were present along with Jed Henry, whose . grandfather served with soldier Gordon, at the cemetery when the remains of the 'unknown German soldier' were exhumed. The family . now hope that by Christmas, DNA comparison tests will establish whether . the bones are those of Lawrence S Gordon. If the tests are positive the . remains will be returned to Canada.

"Monday night's episode of hit drama Hawaii Five-O, which featured the story of a young girl being held captive for ten years, was broadcast as an eerily similar, real-life ordeal played out for three young women in Cleveland, Ohio. The CBS drama about an elite police unit was on at 10pm (ET), shortly before the escape of Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight from ten years of captivity made the late-night news. The three women - along with a six-year-old girl found at the property who is Miss Berry's daughter - were taken to hospital and are now at an undisclosed location. Scroll down for video . Chilling: The episode of Hawaii Five-O showed a teenage girl trying to escape after being held captive - and was shown on the same night that three women escaped after a decade of captivity in Ohio . Caught: The kidnapper who held the young women is captured in the cop drama Hawaii Five-O at the end of the episode . The 22nd episode of Hawaii Five-O's . third season began with the body of a teenage girl being found in the woods, . who the detectives discover was abducted ten years before. The 17-year-old . had been killed after trying to escape from her locked room. It is soon reported that another child has been abducted with the police team racing against the clock to find the child kidnappers. The episode would have been filmed weeks in advance of its airing on Monday night but the scheduling made for an eerie coincidence. The disturbing Cleveland captivity case also echoes the best-selling novel Room by Emma Donoghue. Best-seller: Emma Donoghue's book Room is about a mother and son held in captivity . Room tells the story of five-year-old Jack who is held captive with his mother after she was kidnapped from college at the age of 19. They . finally become free of 'Room' after Jack plays dead, then escapes and alerts a stranger. The story . charts Jack and his mother's difficulty  in re-adjusting to life outside . captivity. Emma Donoghue has previously said that she was inspired by the Fritzl case which came to light in April 2008. Father Josef Fritzl had kept his daughter captive for 24 years in the sealed basement of his home in Austria where she had seven children and one miscarriage. Ariel Castro, 52, who owned the property in Cleveland where the women were held, and his brothers Onil, 50, and Pedro, 54, have been arrested. Miss Berry managed to escape the home through a flap in the door on Monday and raised the alarm. The disappearances of Amanda and Gina has captured the attention of the entire city of Cleveland for the past decade. Their relatives have continually held vigils and kept the story alive in the press. The three women were kidnapped on the same street and found at the home just three miles away as their alleged kidnappers hid in plain sight. Neighbors said they often saw Castro walking with the six-year-old girl in the neighborhood. Cleveland police believe the women were tied up in the home after they were snatched and local reports noted there were chains hanging from the ceiling.

"A woman convicted of beating her husband to death with a hammer in a plot to collect on his life insurance payout and settle a $300,000 debt with her ex-boyfriend has been sentenced to life in prison. The decision to spare Marissa Devault from death row comes after the jury deliberated for about three days since April 22. Devault nodded when jurors were polled about their decision, and she hugged her attorneys before leaving the courtroom smiling. 'We're happy with the decision they made, thank God,' defense attorney Andrew Anderson Clemency said outside the courthouse. 'They made a decision to spare a life.' Marissa Devault looks at the jury as they are polled after finding her guilty of first degree murder . A judge scheduled a June 6 hearing . where he will formally impose the sentence and decide whether she can be . eligible for early release after 25 years. Devault . was convicted April 8 of first-degree murder in the 2009 slaying of . Dale Harrell. Prosecutors say Devault killed Harrell in a failed bid to . collect on a life insurance policy to repay about $300,000 in loans from . her boyfriend. Devault says she killed her husband in self-defense and . told investigators he had physically and sexually abused her in the . past. Harrell, 34, suffered . multiple skull fractures in the attack at the couple's home in the . Phoenix suburb of Gilbert. He died nearly a month later at a hospice of . complications from his head injuries. Amy Dewey, who lived with Devault and Harrell for about four months in the late 1990s, said she felt justice was served. 'I . hope she can stay in prison for the rest of her natural life,' Dewey . said, adding that her one-time friendship with Devault soured after . Devault made abusive comments. 'For the family, I hope it means they can . heal.' Harrell's relatives and jurors declined to comment. Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery praised the jury for the 'hard work' they put into the case. 'Imposing the death penalty in any . circumstance is difficult and in this one the jurors apparently felt . that a life sentence was appropriate,' Montgomery said in a statement. During . the sentencing phase of her trial, Devault spoke directly to jurors for . 11 minutes. She sobbed and wiped away tears as she said she was sorry . for her actions and the pain she has caused Harrell's family. Devault told court she was acting in self-defense. She said she grabbed a hammer from a bedroom table near her sleeping husband, Dale Harrell (left), and repeatedly struck him in the head . She also said her actions will in some way always shadow her three daughters. 'I am supposed to protect you, and instead I hurt you,' Devault said. Shortly after the attack, Devault told investigators Harrell attacked her as she slept and choked her until she was unconscious. She also told police that when she woke up, she saw another man who lived at their home beating Harrell with a hammer. Devault later confessed to attacking her husband, saying she pummeled him in a rage as he slept after he sexually assaulted her. The case had many salacious elements, including testimony about plots to hire a hit man and the fact that Devault was a former stripper who met her boyfriend on a sugar-daddy dating website. The judge in the case made extensive efforts to keep the trial from becoming the spectacle that enveloped the Jodi Arias case in the same courthouse a year ago. Devault's past as a stripper, for instance, was barely mentioned during the trial. The case attracted nowhere near the attention of the Arias trial despite some similar circumstances. The key prosecution witness was Devault's former boyfriend, Allen Flores, a businessman who met Devault on a sugar-daddy dating website and loaned her $300,000 during their two-year relationship. Flores testified that Devault wanted to either hire someone to kill Harrell, or kill him herself and tell police he tried to rape her after a night of drinking. Devault's attorneys attacked Flores' credibility, noting he was given an immunity agreement on child-pornography allegations in exchange for his testimony. The child pornography was found on Flores' computer during a search that was part of the murder investigation, authorities said.

"It is common to wear gold jewellery to add a little extra glamour to your look, but have you ever considered some bling for your eyes? One doctor has done just that by creating contact lenses infused with nano gold particles. Mumbai's Dr Chandrashekhar Chawan fused the gold with regular contact lenses to create a 'glitter' effect for wearers. But if you want to enjoy the ultimate sparkling eyes, you'll have to shell out between $15,000 (£9,745) and $18,000 (£11,690). The 24-carat particles were added to the normal eyewear at Shekhar Eye Research India in a specialised paste form. In order to avoid contact between the eyes and the gold, an extra layer is applied. Several customers showed off their glittering and spell-binding eyes in Dr Chawan's office. The 24-carat gold contact lenses are supposed to be a way of adding jewellery to your eyes . The gold flecks are added to the contact lenses in a specialised paste format . Each contact weighs 5g and it is not known whether the tiny gold flecks affect vision.

"Prepared: Sir Benjamin Slade with his rifle and Bolly, his hunting companion . You can probably tell from the intrepid get-up and the rifle at his side, but Sir Benjamin Slade is a man on a mission – a mission to protect the public from a big cat that he says is stalking his estate. He’d also rather like to mount its head on one of the walls in his 13th century manor house. The eccentric aristocrat fears the puma-like creature will kill a visitor if it is not shot dead and has put up signs around his 98-acre estate in Somerset, warning ramblers to be on the lookout. Following numerous sightings, a staff member managed to take a photo of the mysterious black animal on his mobile phone. Sir Benjamin, 67, who has named the cat the Beast of North Newton after the village nearest his estate, said: ‘I think it is bigger than most cats, probably bigger than a puma. ‘When I saw the photo, it was visibly huge. The grass in the  picture is two-and-a-half  foot high. ‘We need to get this thing shot because it may kill a young child or dog. ‘Plus, I need the head to put in my collection.’ Tom Baker, 25, the staff member who snapped the creature when he was putting out the rubbish at Maunsel House, said: ‘I saw something about 150 metres away and didn’t know if it was a deer, but it looked strange. I zoomed in and took the images. ‘It certainly looks like a big cat. I have no other explanation for it.’ And he might just be right. There have been a ‘substantial’ number of sightings of big cats in Somerset in the last year, according to Danny Bamping, founder of the British Big Cats Society. Sir Benjamin claims to have seen the creature before, lurking behind a postbox, and in recent months, he and members of staff have found piles of feathers around the estate, as well as the remains of a dead fox. Mysterious: What appears to be a big cat in a picture taken by Sir Benjamin Slade at Maunsel House, Somerset . Taking action: Sir Benjamin has put up a sign saying 'Beware of the big cat' at his grand estate Maunsel House, near Bridgwater in Somerset . He also fears the creature is feeling particularly defensive after visitors said they spotted cubs. The baronet added: ‘I’ve put up signs to warn people and people have been keeping their dogs in their cars and haven’t let their children walk off in case they don’t come back. 'I have a wedding business to run here too. Luckily the guests make a bit of noise so this creature hopefully won’t come near. But they might get gobbled up if they wander off.’ However, Sir Benjamin conceded that Mr Baker’s photo is not conclusive. Warning: Sir Benjamin Slade is warning guests at his Maunsel House to be careful following the big cat sighting . ‘They don’t exactly stand still and pose, which is the problem,’ he said. He said he planned to collect hair and droppings to send off for analysis the next time animal remains are found. Sir Benjamin, a childless millionaire, made headlines last year after police staged a dramatic raid on his home, which saw him charged with possessing a firearm without a certificate and breaching a shotgun certificate by leaving a weapon unsecured. He said he used the shotgun to shoot at foxes from his bedroom window.

"The most-wanted man in New York City was held without bail yesterday after he turned himself in to police following a four-day manhunt over the hit and run deaths of a Brooklyn couple and their baby. Julio Acevedo, . 44, was arrested outside a convenience store after approaching officers in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. He is being held on charges of leaving the scene of an accident, . said Paul Browne, . chief spokesman for the New York Police Department. Police believe that Acevedo was behind the wheel of the speeding BMW that smashed into a cab carrying Raizy and Nathan Glauber, both 21, in Brooklyn on Sunday morning - killing both of them. Raizy Glauber was seven months pregnant and the couple's child was delivered by cesarean section after the accident but tragically died the day after his parents. Scroll Down for Video . Pennsylvania State Police, along with New York City police officers, transport Julio Acevedo, 44, from the State Police Barracks in Bethlehem, the Lehigh County Prison on Wednesday night . Shame: Julio Acevedo was wanted by the New York City Police in connection with fleeing the scene of an accident which caused the death of expectant parents Nachman and Raizy Glauber and their premature child . Arrested: Julio Acevedo was arrested at a mini-mart in Bethlehem, Penn. at 5 pm on Wednesday . Julio Acevedo, 44, was taken into custody by the NYPD Fugitive Apprehension Team at the parking lot of a Turkey Hill store in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania . Julio Acevedo fled the scene on Sunday morning after hitting a cab carrying an expectant couple killing both of them - he was apprehended on Wednesday afternoon at a mini mart in Pennsylvania over 80 miles away . Acevedo, 44, used a friend, Derrick . Hamilton, to act as a go-between with the police and arranged for . detectives with the NYPD Fugitive Apprehension Team to pick him up at a . Turkey Hill Mini Market in Bethlehem, Pennslyvania at 5.10 p.m. Hamilton met officers at New York's Grand Central Station earlier in the day, then led them to Acevedo in Bethlehem, about 80 miles away, police said. 'He walked up to the car and got in,' a witness told the Daily News. 'No words or nothing.' He will be extradited back to New York City . and will be charged with felony offenses after going on the . run immediately after the 12.30 a.m. crash in Williamsburg, New York on . Sunday, where he left the couple to die. Legal options open to prosecutors include charging him with manslaughter as well as leaving the scene of an accident. According to the New York Post, Acevdeo was immediately taken to State Police Troop M barracks in Pennsylvania before as he waits to be taken back to New York City. NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly said that police had been in contact with his friend, Derrick Hamilton ahead of his arrest. 'He said the individual wants to turn himself in, and he was going to do it he believed today with an attorney,' said Kelly, adding that cops weren’t sure if 'this is a game or what.' Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died . Julio Acevedo, had eluded authorities since fleeing the crash but on Tuesday he vowed to turn himself in as he spoke out for the first time since the deaths. 'My . heart goes out to them,' Acevedo said of the couple as he spoke to the New York Daily News over the phone. 'I didn't know they died until I saw the . news.' The suspect added . that he had been fleeing from gunshots when his car smashed into the cab . carrying the couple to hospital. Nachman Glauber died instantly and Raizy Glauber and their unborn child . were rushed to an emergency room. The mother died after delivering the . baby boy via C-section. The premature 7-month-old weighed only 4 pounds when delivered, but died from heart failure caused by low blood pressure on Monday. Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, Acevedo was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the . legal level at .13. He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day . without bail. Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the . family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his arrest and demanded he be charged with three murders. Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers . 'We in the community are demanding that . the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this . couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a . statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even . bothering to check on the people of the other car.' Acevdeo is thought to have hit the Glauber's car at 60 mph and is believed to have rammed the vehicle with enough force that it knocked the car's engine into its backseat. The Glaubers had been heading to . hospital in a taxi early on Sunday morning after Raizy, who was seven . months pregnant, felt an unusual pain. Nachman and Raizy were traveling in the . black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in . Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the . would-be parents. The . livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their . own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, . police said. Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph . The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash. This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong. In New York City, yellow taxis are . hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are . picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles. Meanwhile, police said the registered . owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged . with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car. A . person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car . legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then . gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of . the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, . the person said. A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child . The impact from the t-bone smash sent . Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, . while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue . Nachman and the taxi driver. Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the . city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by . extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries. Tragically, in the initial aftermath of the accident, first responder Yisroel Altman . said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but . their head injuries ultimately were just too much. Missed: A person walks towards the graves of Nathan and Raizy Glauber at the Satmar Cemetery.

"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star went to house when ex failed to respond to her calls and texts . Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Taylor Armstrong was at the house when her estranged husband Russell's dead body was discovered, it has been reported. The 40-year-old reality star became concerned for Armstrong's wellbeing when he failed to show up for a meeting they had arranged for on Monday afternoon and did not respond to her phone calls and texts, TMZ claim. The website alleges that she went to the Mulholland Drive house where her ex was staying with a friend that evening, and raised the alarm with the home owner. Grief: Reality star Taylor Armstrong was present at the house when her estranged husband Russell's body was discovered, it has been reported . The owner then looked through Armstrong's bedroom window and saw his dead body hanging, TMZ claim. According to the site, the estranged couple had been in regular contact despite her recent allegations that he physically abused her during their marriage. Following the news of his death, Russell's . photographer pal Tom Vickers says the father of three - who had a . five-year-old daughter with Taylor - was struggling to cope with the . pressures of fame, saying reality television had ruined his life. Family portrait: Russell Armstrong with wife Taylor and their daughter Kennedy in June when they chartered a private jet . Vickers, who forged a friendship with Russell over recent months, last spoke to him on August 4. He told RadarOnline: 'It's terrible news. But . during our phone call he didn't sound like the Russell that I knew.' Vickers said Russell was depressed after Taylor filed for divorce from him amid allegations he physically abused her. He continued: 'I told him people don't believe everything they read and he told . me: ""It's funny how a reality show can ruin your entire life"".' In the last interview before his death, he spoke to website Rumorfix last month . about how difficult he found it to live with his new fame, and how it . contributed to his marriage break-up. Fatherless: Russell is survived by his daughter Kennedy, who is sure to be devastated at the news . He said: 'The pressure of being in the TV spotlight was pretty overwhelming. 'It took our manageable problems and made them worse. We are very supportive of each other and love each other. 'I will support her as best I can moving forward. 'This is a devastating time. We had a wonderful marriage and I . don’t want you to get the impression that Taylor and I are bitter enemies — . we’re not. 'We have a beautiful five-year-old daughter who we both love.' According to Radar Online, the businessman was also concerned over an alleged tell-all book, which was to include 'extensive details about Russell’s sexual indiscretions and preferences along with sordid secrets which could be deemed by some as deviant behaviour.' His . lawyer Ronald Richards told TMZ he was broke and had been staying at . his friend's house on Mulholland Drive, where he was found. He said: 'I feel bad because his credit cards weren't working. He had tremendous financial problems. Plush: The house on Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles where Russell Armstrong was found hanged . 'He was also extremely bummed out about the divorce with Taylor. 'As far as a will, even if he does have a will, they don't have any assets, so I'm not sure what there would be left to leave. 'I am extremely saddened, I had no idea he was depressed.' Ed Winter of the L.A Coroner’s Office said: 'He hung himself with no suicide note found.' No drugs or alcohol were found in the bedroom where Russell died and he was fully clothed when his body was discovered. Estranged: Despite being embroiled in a bitter divorce before Russell's suicide, the reality star is making preparations for the service . His . wife Taylor, 40, has accused him of calling her names, grabbing her, . shoving her, pulling her hair and throwing objects at her, and had filed . for divorce. According to TMZ she is yet to reveal the heartbreaking news to their daughter. Armstrong has had two separate restraining orders filed against by him. The first was by his ex-wife Barbara and the other  came from an ex-girlfriend. In addition, Armstrong has a criminal record, pleading guilty to battery in 1997. Russell is survived by Kennedy, his . five-year-old daughter with Taylor, and Aiden, a 13-year-old son from a . previous marriage and a an 11-year-old son with former fiancee Milette . Fields.

"New data may link frequent trips to the dentist with preventing you from losing your teeth in old age. Mississippi residents are least likely to say they've been to the dentist in the past year, a new poll says - and that might be tied to the state's high rate of entirely toothless senior citizens. Conducted by Gallup, the poll found that only 53% of Mississippi residents said they'd been to the dentist last year. The bottom ten states in the survey included were Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Texas, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri and Arizona. Open wide! Mississippi had the smallest percentage of residents say they'd been to the dentist in the past 12 months . 178,072 adults were polled in a random sampling in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. Further north, the poll found that 74.9 percent of Connecticut residents said they'd been to the dentist last year. Gallup says it's the third year in a row that Connecticut has taken this position. Massachusetts and Rhode Island rounded out the top three, with 74.5% and 73.8% of respondents saying they had gone to the dentist, as well. Other states in the top ten include Alaska, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, Utah, Delaware and South Dakota. As pointed out by The Washington Post, this data could be correlated to a 2012 Bloomberg chart that ranks states' dental health scores - and notes the percentage of seniors in each state with no natural teeth left. Best and worst: Connecticut did the best in the poll, while Mississippi did the worst. A different 2012 chart said that 27% of Mississippi seniors had no natural teeth . According to that data, Mississippi has the lowest dental health score in the country - and 27% of its senior citizens are toothless. The other two worst states for dental health are Louisiana and West Virginia - where 25.6% and 36% of seniors lack chompers, respectively. Unsurprisingly, Connecticut had the best health score in that chart, with a mere 9.2% of its senior population without teeth. Hawaii, however, had an even lower percentage, with just 7.4%.","Only 53% of Mississippi residents said they'd been to a dentist in a new Gallup poll .

"The list is featured in the twelfth edition of Inspire, the terror group's propaganda magazine . Al-Qaeda has published a chilling list of its top bombing targets, including London's prestigious hotel, The Savoy. In the twelfth issue of Inspire, the magazine published by the terror group, it calls for bombers to attack crowded areas and provides a country-by-country break down of suggested sites. For the UK, these include football matches, the Cheltenham Festival and The Savoy. One of London's most famous hotels, . The Savoy has been a regular haunt for celebrities throughout its 115 . year history, making it a high-profile target. The . magazine encourages readers to build their own car bomb - which it . provides instructions of how to do - and detonate it outside the hotel. It suggests carrying out the attack at 10pm when, it says, 'high profile targets' will be exiting. According to the article, this is 'a perfect place and time to detonate your car bomb.' A . spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said counter-terrorism officers . monitor the magazine closely but would not release details of any . additional security measures. He said: 'The MPS Counter Terrorism Command is aware of the website and appropriate steps have been put in place. The Savoy is one of London's most famous hotels and has been listed as a global terror target by Al-Qaeda . The magazine's editorial taunts the US government for failing to stop the attack on the Boston marathon . The list of global targets for attacks includes Chicago's Sears Tower, left, and the Louvre gallery, in Paris, right . 'As part of our continued work, we regularly work with, and support, industry and crowded places with a variety of briefings and advice.' Both the Savoy and the company that manages it, Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, were contacted but no one was available for comment. An article about dead cleric Anwar al-Awlaki quotes him defending the killing of civilians . The majority of the targets listed in the magazine, published this week by Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, are in America but there are others from the UK, France and 'other crusader countries'. Suggestions for attacks include Bastille Military Day Parade and the Louvre art gallery, both in Paris, Sears Tower in Chicago and popular holiday destinations for western tourists, such as the Dordogne. The magazine carries an article about Al-Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike in 2011. In the piece, al-Awlaki is quoted justifying the killing of civilians by saying: 'Soldiers are expected to die… But a civilian is not. So when you you hit the civilian you hit them where it hurts and that is what our tactics are about.' As well as these sort of instructions, the magazine contains practical advice on how to carry out an attack. These include methods of making bombs, which it claims can be made with easily accessible items and are simple enough to be followed 'in the kitchen of your mom.' The magazine's letter from the editor mocks the American government for failing to be able to 'protect its citizen from pressure cooker bombs in backpacks,' a reference to the attack on the Boston marathon in April 2013. It goes on to ask: 'I wonder if they are ready to stop car bombs.'","Al-Qaeda have published the twelfth issue of their propaganda magazine .

"A gay couple has won the right to be recognised as the legal parents of twin boys after the surrogate mother they paid to carry them disappeared. The woman, believed to be living in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India, handed over the boys last year without giving her formal consent to the handover. The couple arranged to pay a Hyderabad clinic £17,000 to become the children's parents under a commercial surrogacy agreement in 2010. But after the babies were born in India the following year, the surrogate mother did not formally give consent for them to be treated as the British couple's children. Application: The couple, who cannot be named, went to the High Court in London to obtain parental orders after they failed to trace their children's natural mother . The men were in a legal limbo until Tuesday, when Mr Justice Baker granted them 'parental orders' after hearing that they had taken 'all reasonable steps' to find the anonymous donor. It is believed to be the first time that a court in England or Wales has made such an order without the consent of a birth mother. The couple, who cannot be named for legal reasons, have been bringing up the babies since their birth in July 2011 and now have the authority to continue. The judge said that there were lessons to be learned after hearing how the couple entered into the surrogacy agreement with the clinic and the mother in 2010. An 'anonymous Indian egg donor' was selected and one of the men was the 'genetic father'. The judge said the couple agreed to pay about £17,000 for the 'entire package of treatment and costs'. Before the twins were born, the couple’s lawyers wrote to the director of the clinic pointing out the need for the surrogate mother to give consent to parental orders. The director replied that the clinic 'would be happy to be of help'. The judge said after the boys were born, the couple received a document purportedly signed by the surrogate mother and a doctor. The woman is believed to come from the state of Andhra Pradesh, the capital of which is Hyderabad (pictured) The document said the surrogate mother had no objections to the provision of the boys’ exit visas. Mr Justice Jonathan Baker said the couple 'assumed responsibility' for the babies two days after their birth and left India without the surrogate mother giving signed consent to parental orders. The judge said one of the men emailed the director of the clinic setting a 'deadline' for the production of the mother’s signed consent. Three days later they received a package, purportedly from the director, containing a sheet of paper with an 'obscene gesture' printed on it. The couple then asked an 'inquiry agent' to try to find the surrogate mother - but without success. In his ruling, the judge said: 'It is a very important element of the surrogacy law in this country that a parental order should normally only be made with the consent of the woman who carried and gave birth to the child. 'The reasons for this provision are obvious. A surrogate mother is not merely a cipher. 'She plays the most important role in bringing the child into the world. She is a ""natural parent"" of the child ... 'The act of carrying and giving birth to a baby establishes a relationship with the child which is one of the most important relationships in life. 'It is therefore not surprising that some surrogate mothers find it impossible to part with their babies and give consent to the parental order.' The judge continued: 'I accept that these applicants have taken all reasonable steps to obtain the woman’s consent. 'If it is correct that she is living in the state of Andhra Pradesh, then she is one of many millions of women living in that state and there is in my judgment no realistic hope of finding her. 'I accept that it is not the applicants’ fault that they found themselves in this position. 'I am satisfied that they reasonably believed that the clinic and its staff would behave responsibly. 'It seems that they and the twins have been badly let down.'","Men had been in a legal limbo after paying £17,000 to Hyderabad clinic in surrogacy deal .

"This is the dramatic moment a major rescue operation began after a helicopter carrying 19 oil rig workers ditched in the sea. Photographs of the Super Puma helicopter being kept afloat off the coast of Shetland were released for the first time today after every man was helped to safety. Rescuers then faced a race against time to lift the aircraft into a recovery vessel before it sank. Emergency: Rescuers head towards a Super Puma helicopter which was forced to make an emergency landing off the coast of Shetland with 19 oil rig workers on board . Floating: Rescuers then faced a race against time to lift the aircraft into a recovery vessel before it sank . Flotation bags had been fixed to the bottom of the helicopter, but they could only hold it up for a short period. The aircraft was successfully loaded on to anchor-handling tug supply vessel, the Olympic Zeus, today and the vessel was on its way back to the mainland, due to arrive at Peterhead at 3.30am on Wednesday. The helicopter, operated by Aberdeen-based CHC Helicopters, made an emergency landing in the sea 14 miles west of Fair Isle, between Orkney and Shetland, at about 3.30pm on Monday. It landed about 200 metres from a ship, the Nord Nightingale, which was taking a cargo load of diesel on its way from Primorsk in Russia to Belfast in Northern Ireland. Aids: Two life rafts from the ditched helicopter were used to help the oil rig workers to safety . On the waves: Oil rig workers are taken by boat from their ditched helicopter to the Nord Nightingale . Operation: The oil rig workers were lifted from the water and helped to the safety of a passing ship . Recovery: The workers were taken to Aberdeen after they were helped on board the ship Nord Nightingale, which was only 200 metres from where the helicopter landed . In command: The Nord Nightingale's master, Bo Rosenborg, said everyone was 'calm and focused' once the rescue operation got under way . The ship's crew went to help the oil rig workers and brought them onboard the vessel.The men were flown back to Aberdeen today. The ship's master, Bo Rosenborg, said: 'My officer on duty alerted me to the emergency landing. 'It was very close to our ship, maybe about 200 metres behind it. 'We reduced our speed and turned around as quickly as we could and contacted the Shetland coastguard. 'It . was agreed that we would try to commence the rescue operation. It was . very exciting, we were all keen to see if everyone was okay. 'Once the operation got under way, everyone was calm and focused. 'We agreed to try and get the crew on board and sent out a rescue craft. 'We managed to bring all 19 passengers on to the vessel, where they were then transferred to two rescue helicopters. 'We were lucky that the weather was good, which made things easier for us. Thankfully, the controlled landing was so good that there were no injuries.' Investigators from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch are expected to interview the helicopter's two pilots about the incident. The Helicopter Safety Steering Group will also discuss the matter at a meeting on Wednesday. Mission: The Super Puma Helicopter that ditched into the north sea near Orkney this week carrying 19 oil workers is craned back to shore . Salvaged:  The helicopter was tugged through the night to Peterhead harbour . Helicopter locator . Offshore carriers have grounded their fleets of Super Puma helicopters following the emergency. The . incident has concerned unions representing offshore workers, who today . said there was 'growing fear' among members about helicopter safety. The Unite union wants to ban the use of the 'Dacon Scoop', a net and winch device for rescuing people from the water. Unite industrial Officer John Taylor said: 'We go into this emergency meeting of the HSSG with serious concerns about whether these aircraft are fit for purpose and to make clear our members growing fears over wider safety procedures for offshore helicopter rescue, particularly where the rescue fall-back plans involve the use of the Dacon Scoop. 'It's unacceptable to Unite and our members that helicopters should be allowed to fly where conditions are deemed so hazardous that being fished-out of the sea by a mechanical device from a rescue vessel is the last line of safety. 'Mercifully there were no fatalities with this latest incident, largely due to the skills of the pilot crew, the close proximity of the Nord Nightingale tanker in the waters off Shetland and the elements. 'They were lucky but we can't always rely on luck and we need to tighten-up industry safety standards now.' It is the second time in seven months that the crew of the Nord Nightingale has been called out on a sea rescue. In March it helped an injured competitor who had been taking part in the Clipper 09-10 Round the World Yacht Race. He suffered serious head cuts after being hurled across the cabin during severe storms in the middle of the Pacific. The Nord Nightingale, which was in the area at the time, took him on board where he was treated for his injuries. The yachtsman's teammates then continued the race.

The agencies are also debating whether to make a public announcement on potential new security measures at airports after more recent intelligence indicated the 'subset' of extreme terrorists in Syria could be looking to down a U.S. or European-bound plane. New measures: Security measures at airports in the United states and abroad may be enhanced on concerns that terrorists in Syria are building a new generation of bombs to smuggle onto planes (stock photo) '[This threat] is different and more disturbing than past aviation plots,' one source said.

However, the U.S. government doesn't know of a specific target or time frame for an attack. A source told the network the Syrian subset was working alongside operatives from al Qaeda to produce 'creative' new designs for bombs. The Yemen-based al Qaeda group was responsible for the 'underwear bomb' that failed to denote in a plane over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.

"Anyone who studies for a PhD can expect it to involve a lot of hard work. But few students can claim to have completed an assignment as tough as this - catching a crocodile bigger than a car. Luke Evans, of Penwith, Cornwall, was part of a 12-man team which caught the animal - the largest crocodile ever to be tagged and released back into the wild. Haul: British student Luke Evans was part of a 12-man team which caught this 5.2-metre crocodile, the largest ever to be satellite-tagged and released back into the wild . Giant: Luke Evans (left), of Penwith, Cornwall, measures the massive crocodile before releasing it to the wild . The crocodile, called Siganas, is 5.2m long, weighs more than a ton and was caught in Kinabatangan, near the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo. Mr Evans, 24, travelled to the country to study saltwater crocodiles and to trap and tag them with sat-nav technology so that scientists can follow their movements. The scheme is a joint project involving three organisations - the State Wildlife department, the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC) and Chester Zoo. Mr Evans and fellow volunteers dragged the male crocodile to shore and held it down while it was tagged. The animal was then released. Experts believe Siganas is the largest tagged crocodile in the world. Effort: Twelve volunteers were involved in the operation to haul the crocodile ashore for tagging . Massive: The crocodile, called Signas, is 5.2m long, weighs more than a ton and was caught in the Kinabatangan River, near the Sabah region of Malaysian Borneo . Two other crocodiles have been tagged as part of the project - in June last year and in January - but they were smaller and scientists were only able to monitor them for about two months each. Mr Evans said: 'When we first saw the crocodile, it was in a trap and it was clear to me that it was going to measure more than five metres. 'The feeling was pure excitement. These are the kind of days that make me love my PhD. 'It's the third crocodile we have tagged in the Kinabatangan River in Sabah and this one was considerably larger than the other two. 'It eclipses the previous record of 4.65 metres, carried out in Australia. 'We . hope that by mapping the reptile's nesting locations, it will show us . how habitats decline and how human intervention is affecting the . reptile's behaviour.' Teamwork: The scheme is a joint project involving three organisations - the State Wildlife department, the Danau Girang Field Centre (DGFC) and Chester Zoo . Colossal: Two other crocodiles have been tagged as part of the project - in June last year and in January - but they were smaller and scientists were only able to monitor them for about two months each . Hold still: Men sit on the crocodile to keep it in position for tagging. Scientists will use satellite technology to monitor the animal's movements . Team leader Mark Rampangajouw said: 'We needed more than 10 men to pull Siganas out of the trap and carry it to the river bank where we measured it and collared the satellite tag on its neck. 'It was teamwork and we enjoyed the challenge.' Datuk Dr Laurentius Ambu, State Wildlife director, said: 'We were a bit unlucky with the two previous males tagged in June last year, and January, with the tags lasting for only two months. 'Hopefully, this tag will last longer and will provide important data on the crocodile's movements and home ranges.' DGFC director Dr Benoit Goossens said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles. He said: 'In three days, Siganas had already travelled 5km and moved away from DGFC. It seems to be a transient reptile, rather than a resident.' Project: A director of the Danau Girang Field Centre said there were plans to tag several more crocodiles .

"'Mad period of collecting eggs': Former Suffolk policeman Michael Upson raided the nests of rare wild birds . A retired policeman who stole eggs from the nests of rare wild birds was today warned that he could be jailed. Michael Upson, 52, raided the nests while he was a Suffolk police constable and acting sergeant. Police found 649 eggs, along with secret diaries detailing how they had been taken, when they searched Upson's cottage on June 21 this year. Norwich magistrates heard that the eggs were hidden in margarine cartons, kept in a battered suitcase in his loft. The court was told that officers found a fake index card system, which suggested that all the eggs dated back to before 1954 - the year when taking eggs from nests became illegal. But the search also uncovered plastic boxes containing the diaries and another set of catalogue cards, hidden inside Upson's attic water tank. These documents corresponded exactly with the eggs in Upson's collection and indicated that they had been taken from nests of different species between 1991 and 2001. Upson, of Sotherton, near Halesworth, Suffolk, admitted possessing 584 wild eggs - an offence under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act. The married father of two also pleaded guilty to a separate offence of possessing 65 eggs of Schedule One rare birds, which are the most protected in the UK. The court head that the Schedule One eggs comprised seven from a marsh harrier, 53 from woodlark and five from a cettis warbler. A further charge of having equipment to steal eggs was withdrawn. Magistrates suggested he could be jailed, but adjourned sentencing until Thursday so that the probation service can investigate whether a community order is suitable. Prosecutor Judith Piggin told the court that police had found egg-carrying boxes hidden in towels in Upson's airing cupboard as well as the eggs, secret diaries and catalogue cards in the attic. Taken: Some of the eggs from rare species which were found in Michael Upson's Suffolk home . Collection: Diaries kept by Upson indicated that the eggs had been taken from nests of different species between 1991 and 2001 . She said officers had also seized drills for blowing eggs, photographs and around 50 Ordnance Survey maps, including some marked with nesting sites. Miss Piggin said: 'The defendant attended the police station and made admissions that for a number of years he had built up a collection of eggs, but said he had stopped many years ago. 'He was unable to give more information as to when and how they were found and how the collection was built up. 'The defendant admitted that all the eggs found were his and that he was a serving officer throughout the time that he had collected them.' Miss Piggin said the woodlark eggs were all taken from the Dunwich and Westleton Heath in Suffolk and his actions would have had an 'environmental impact' on the bird population in the area. Guilty: Upson admitted possessing 584 wild eggs and a further 65 eggs of Schedule One rare birds, which are the most protected in the UK . She also asked magistrates to make an order for Upson's egg collection, diaries, cards, maps and photographs to be destroyed. The court heard that Upson could not be charged with collecting eggs as charges had to be brought within two years of the offence. Roger Thomson, defending, described Upson as a keen naturalist and ornithologist since he was a child. He added that the retired officer was of previous good character with no police disciplinary issues. Mr Thomson said: 'He is not charged with taking eggs, but we cannot ignore that because he admits that is what he did. 'He said he went through a mad period of collecting eggs in the 1990s at the time when he was having marriage problems with his first wife and suffering from depression. It was a way of getting over it. Hidden: The eggs were stored in margarine cartons, kept in a battered suitcase in the loft of Upson's cottage . Troubled: The court heard that Upson collected the eggs when he was having marital problems and suffering from depression . 'He was a police officer at the time and should have known better, but you have to balance that against the fact that it is ancient history.' Mr Thomson said Upson's collection had been 'gathering dust in his attic' since 2001 and he had not looked at it or attempted to sell or swap any of his eggs. Presiding magistrate Eamon Lambert suggested that Upson could be jailed for 14 weeks. But he adjourned sentencing to allow time for a probation report to investigate whether a 'satisfactory community penalty' could be found. Outside court, Upson, who worked as a training officer at Suffolk Police headquarters in Martlesham before retiring in August, denied that he had taken any eggs while on duty. But this claim was challenged by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, who said that one of Upson's diary entries indicated that he had taken kittiwake eggs from Lowestoft pier while he was on a police night shift. Misleading: Police searching Upson's home found a fake index card system, which suggested that all the eggs dated back to before 1954 - the year when taking eggs from nests became illegal . Diaries: Documents detailing how the eggs had been taken were hidden inside Upson's attic water tank . The charity also said that the diaries suggested that Upson had helped another collector take golden eagle eggs on a trip to the Outer Hebrides in April 1997, although no such eggs were found in his own collection. Mark Thomas, a senior investigator for the RSPB, said: 'That a police officer should knowingly break the law in pursuit of this obsession is shocking, and we welcome his conviction. 'Evidence from the diaries indicates that Upson stole over 900 wild bird eggs in an eight-year period. Not all of these eggs were recovered.' Mr Thomas said that Upson's diaries revealed he had waded through marshes up to his waist to steal the cettis warbler eggs from a reserve at Slapton Ley, Devon. Upson also went to North Wales to steal chough eggs and the New Forest to take hawfinch eggs, he added. Mr Thomas said: 'Upson kept detailed records which linked him to all the eggs in his collection. 'Some of the eggs he had were from very rare species. He took 54 woodlark eggs at a time when there were only believed to be 500 breeding pairs in the country. 'He also detailed his diaries how he had helped another collector take golden eagles' eggs in the Outer Hebrides. 'He said in interview that he felt ashamed about what he did, but he would not say where the eggs were now or who the man was.'

"This extraordinary looking skeleton looks more suited to a Ridley Scott movie than a Lancashire kitchen. The mysterious remains, which bear more than a passing resemblance to the terrifying creature in the Alien horror film, were discovered under a kitchen cabinet in the Rea family home in Altcar, Lancashire. Former record label boss Kevin Rea, 55, found it when he pulled out the footboards between the cupboard and the floor to dry the units out after a leak. Now he is trying to discover what on earth the skeleton may have been. Scroll down for video . What on earth is it? This mysterious skeleton was found under a kitchen cupboard in Altcar, Lancashire . Mr Rea, who has lived at the ancient stone cottage on the Leverhulme Estate with wife, George, 47, and son, Eden, 13, for five years, said he found it in a cocoon-like nest under the cupboard. He said: 'A plumber told me I had to dry out the footboards after a leak, and when I took one of them off, I found a collection of cleaning products but also this weird nest. 'And inside it was this thing. 'I have no idea what it is, but when I saw it I thought of the alien that bursts out of John Hurt's chest in the film.' Mr Rea, who revolutionised dance music with his hit, Technotronic's Pump Up The Jam,  took some photographs of the skeleton, which he said was around six inches long, and then threw it away because it was 'disgusting'. In Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, the Alien stalked and killed the crew of Nostromo after being brought on board the craft using hapless Kane, played by John Hurt, as a host. The terrifying film, which starred Sigourney Weaver as heroine Ripley, became a cult classic and spawned a franchise with three sequels and an Alien Vs Predator spin-off. The creature was designed by Swiss surrealist painter and sculpter H.R. Giger, who won an Oscar for his design work on the film. Today experts were divided on what the remains might have been. Kevin Rea, 55, said the skeleton he discovered in his kitchen reminded him of Ridley Scott's horror film, Alien . Terrifying creature: In Ridley Scott's Alien films, the aliens are terrifying beasts that take over Nostromo . Stuart Hine, who runs the Natural History Museum's Identification and Advisory Service, said: 'Depending on size, it's either a rat or mouse, and the alien appearance is due to the skull being reversed and pointing backwards. 'The front legs and shoulder blades are also absent, which helps give it the alien appearance. The cocoon-like nest mentioned will have been the remaining skin, fur and webbing remaining from the feeding of moths.' He added: 'The tail still looks to be covered in skin so it is only likely to be a year or two old.' Amy Fensome, from the Biosciences College of Life and Environmental Sciences at the University of Exeter, told MailOnline: 'That looks very much like a very large rat, but the head has twisted around so that the skull is turned to look over the shoulder.' Readers were split over what the skeleton was, with squirrels and rats being the options suggested by most, and one suggesting a marmoset.","Former record label boss Kevin Rea had taken his kitchen cupboards apart .

"At first glance, it looked like a collection of dried leaves. But when photographer Nordin Seruyan moved a little closer, this orange bundle suddenly sprang into life - hundreds of lives in fact. These tiny larvae are praying mantis pictured only a minute after hatching. Praying together: These tiny larvae are mantis pictured only a minute after hatching from a single egg . The insects' first priority was to avoid being eaten by predators, but within a few months they will grow into formidable hunters themselves. Measuring up to 12 inches long, adult mantis are capable of taking down flies, moths and crickets. Sighting: Photographer Nordin Seruyan spotted the insects on land near his home in the lush tropical forests of Seruyan, central Borneo . Mr Seruyan, 37, a macro photographer, spotted the insects on land near his home in the lush tropical forests of Seruyan, central Borneo. The father of two said: 'At first I thought it was a collection of dried leaves. 'They were stacked in one egg and it contained hundreds of larvae. 'When I shot them they went one by one from the herd. 'They then go to continue their lives alone and do not return to the nest.' The praying mantis - so called because of the shape of its prominent front legs which are held in a prayer-like position - is an ambush predator. Using camouflage to hide among leaves and twigs, the insects can turn their heads 180 degrees to spot prey before striking with reflexes so quick they are difficult to see with the naked eye. As well as devouring flies and grasshoppers, many praying mantis are also cannibals - and some females even eat males after mating. Mr Seruyan, who has been photographing insects for four years, said it was the first time he had ever seen their birth. He said: 'I have been looking for similar images online but I have never seen one like it. 'I think I could be the first man to capture this moment.'

"Whether as munitionettes, frontline nurses or land girls, the contribution made by women during World War One was a vital one. Now a new book has revealed that it was a stylish one too - and led to wardrobe innovations, among them trench coats and trousers, that remain popular today. But in 1914, both were a long way off with women trussed up in corsets, strapped into awkward hobble skirts and burdened with huge wide-brimmed hats, regardless of class or political inclinations. Patriotic: Servicewomen such as this WAAC helped popularise military styles such as trench coats . By the time armistice day arrived on the 11th November 1918, the nation's wardrobes were almost unrecognisable, with knee-length skirts, billowing harem pants and tailored uniforms taking centre stage. This, argues fashion historian Lucy Adlington, author of Great War Fashion: Tales from the History Wardrobe, is testament to the resilience and adaptability of the women serving on the Home Front as well as an important record of changing circumstances. 'The . changing fashion over the four years of war is arguably one of the most significant . reflectors of the changes happening in women's lives,' she explains. 'Clothes . reveal an immense amount about status, about culture, about austerity . or prosperity. The military . aspect of World War One can't be properly understood without first understanding . the culture. Early years: A glamorous walking suit from 1915 (left) and right, the 'directoire' look popular as war began . Enter the trouser: Trousers were first worn by women in the mines, as this coke backer shows . 'That was what sent so many men and women to serve their countries on the frontline and Home Front. Even uniforms are a . fashion of sorts. 'The Home Front, with all these domestic . details, is every bit as much a part of history as the mud and horror of . the trenches.' Although rationing of the sort seen during the Second World War wasn't introduced until February 1918, clothes became increasingly expensive as the war ground on and shortages began to bite. As a result, most became more streamlined, with the elaborate 'directoire' style of 1914 giving way to simpler garments and comfortable working wear such as trousers. 'Narrow . skirts, wide hats and a high waist were all the rage at the time war broke out,' explains Adlington. 'It was the . Edwardian version of Regency or Jane Austen fashion with lots of whites, creams and pastels. 'Fashionable . women struggled along in hobble skirts, despite the very public demands . of suffragettes for greater social and political freedom. Working . women, as ever, wore what they'd got.' By 1916, the demands of working life in Britain's factories, hospitals and arsenals had forced a sea change in the nation's wardrobes, with shorter, A-line skirts that aped military uniform becoming the ensemble of choice for patriots. 'The new . uniforms for women doing war work required shorter hemlines on A-line . skirts and looser fitting jackets and these were copied by civilians as . a popular and patriotic style,' says Adlington. The new shorter silhouette also reflected . another new reality: With increasing amounts of textiles required to . clothe frontline troops, getting hold of material was becoming an . expensive business. Elegant: Evening gowns also suffered from material shortages, becoming significantly shorter by 1916 . Practical: Munitionettes such as these ones embraced a looser, more practical style and shorter skirts . 'The voracious need for uniforms for the . troops meant that wool, in particular, for civilian clothes could be . hard to come by,' adds Adlington. 'Women were incredibly innovative about finding ways to rework old clothes to suit new styles and to make new clothes last . longer - just like the make-do-and-mend of World War Two. 'Also, as women . became involved in war work, they had to shrug off . pre-war notions about chaperonage and the shorter, looser clothes . reflected this energy and effort.' Not everyone was impressed by the new look, however, with more conservative types raising a haughty eyebrow at the increasing popularity of trousers. Others found them uncomfortable, among them journalist Dorothy . Lawrence who disguised herself as a soldier in order to get to the frontline. Sea change: By the end of the war, early examples of the 1920s 'flapper' style had become hugely popular . Sharp: Some women, Margaret Turner among them, even began to wear their husband's uniforms . 'I was left alone to . struggle with unknown buttons, braces, and the division sum of how to . make a big body go into a small size of trousers,' she furiously wrote from the Front. 'Eventually I got in . by a series of jumps, jerks, and general tightening up!' But many more, among them the poet and author Vita Sackville-West, found them liberating. 'I had just got clothes like the . women-on-the-land were wearing, and in the unaccustomed freedom of . breeches and gaiters I went into wild spirits,' she wrote in 1917. 'I ran, I shouted, I . jumped, I climbed, vaulted over gates, I felt like a schoolboy let out . on a holiday.' 'Breeches were essential wear for railway engine cleaners, motorbike dispatch riders and workers in the new 1917 Women's Land . Army,' comments Adlington. 'Some women struggled to get into them. Some hated being teased . while wearing them in public.  Some adored the new freedom of movement . they brought, and hated having to go back into skirts and petticoats . once the war was over. 'Symbolically, trousers, which had seemed so . splendid and patriotic when needed, were unacceptable after the war, . once women were being hustled back into their domestic roles.' But try though they might, the genie of independence for women had been unleashed from its bottle and in the post-war world of the 1920s, there was no putting it back. 'The war accelerated social change and . the 'flapper' look of the 1920s reflected this,' says Adlington. 'Having tasted freedom in their clothes, women were reluctant to be so confined again.'

"England's key World Cup qualifying tie against Poland descended into farce last night as heavy rain left the pitch unplayable - after officials ignored the weather forecasts and refused to close the stadium's retractable roof. Thousands of fans who had travelled to eastern Europe for the game against Poland were left infuriated as officials stood and watched as a torrential downpour struck in Warsaw. Heavy rain had been falling in the Polish capital for most of the day but still the roof of the £400million state-of-the-art stadium stayed open and gradually the playing surface disappeared under pools of water. The match was eventually called off - but only after fans, and millions watching on television at home, were left waiting 45 minutes for the decision to be made. Game over: England had been due to take on Poland in a World Cup qualifier in Warsaw, but the match was called off due to a waterlogged pitch . Soggy: England's match in Poland was called off after heavy rain made the pitch unplayable . Open goal: Heavy rain falls on the pitch, leaving some fans wondering why the stadium roof was not closed . Italian referee Gianluca Rocchi inspected the pitch at 8pm, when the match was due to start. There . was little prospect of play, but football's governing body FIFA was so . desperate for the game to go ahead that the final decision was not made until 8.45pm. Rain continued to fall and there was no chance of the match being played properly. It was the first time that an England . match had been called off due to the weather since 1979. The FA said . the game would be played at 4pm on Wednesday instead. The decision was greeted with derision by the fans who travelled to the game at Warsaw's National Stadium. It also called into question the Polish authorities' decision not to close the stadium roof during the downpour. Officials are reported to have claimed that the roof could not be closed because the wind and rain was too intense. Wet, wet, wet: England goalkeeper Joe Hart . (left) and coach Roy Hodgson (right) tried to carry on with their normal . pre-match routines, but the rain made play impossible . Making a splash: England boss Roy Hodgson tries to kick a football on the sodden pitch before the scheduled kick-off . Belting down: The massive downpour left standing water all across the pitch in Warsaw . England coach Roy Hodgson claimed the pitch would take plenty of work to be playable tomorrow. He . said on ITV1: 'I'm rather hoping there'll get it (the roof) closed now . as quickly as possible and start to do some work on the pitch because at . moment the pitch is in very poor condition. 'Water is lying on the surface. It's going to need a lot of attention if it's going to be playable tomorrow afternoon.' The England boss said he was happy with the rescheduled time. 'I . think it was the only decision that could be made,' he said. 'There're . no other possibilities. You can't find dates at international level. 'The dates that are available are all taken up so you can't just suddenly decide we'll play it another time.' Damp squib: England fans were given little information as to what was going on as the rain fell . Joker: A Polish fan manages to see the funny side after getting on to the waterlogged pitch . Dive: Another Polish supporter slides on the waterlogged pitch. The conditions meant the match was unable to go ahead . Giving him the slip: A Polish fan evades a steward as supporters took to amusing themselves . 'What . you have to do is to try to organise to get the game played as quickly . as possible. We'll have to go back to the hotel. We're disappointed. 'We . prepared well for this start tonight as no doubt the Poles have too, . but now we've got to do it all over again and hopefully we'll be as . prepared tomorrow as we were tonight.' England fans booked on to flights home . were understandably angry because most of them will now miss the match. A . lack of communication added to their annoyance as news finally filtered . through that the game had been postponed for 20 hours because of a . severely waterlogged pitch. Former England manager Graham Taylor, in Warsaw working for the BBC, . said: 'This is Monty Python. Both sets of supporters are being treated . disgracefully. If I was a fan I’d be booing. 'I thought this was a prime example of how supporters are treated with such disrespect. 'What I mean by that is that it was pretty obvious from the moment the . ref came on the pitch for the very first time that this pitch was not . playable. 'You could see that, yet it was two and a quarter hours later before supporters were actually told it wasn't on. The 2,000 travelling England fans . were also left disappointed that Roy Hodgson and his players did not . come out to see them in Warsaw. Failing to acknowledge supporters is . one of the details contained in England's new code of conduct but the . players were changed and on their bus by the time the game was called . off. Supporters were left to find out details about the game via friends at home watching on television. James Holland and Matthew Newton, both in the RAF and based at Lossiemouth in North Scotland, are just back from Afghanistan. Mr Holland said: 'The FA advised fans to . pack for rain on our fans' website so no-one can say that they weren't . expecting rain. It's a disgrace. 'We had to take two different flights. We're working-class lads, this is a treat for us.' Mr Newton said: 'What disappointed me most was the players could not be bothered to come out and see the fans.' Own goal: The rain had begun to gather in pools on the pitch from the afternoon - yet officials did nothing . Water wings: The area in front of the dugouts was covered with pools of rainwater . Brian Wright travelled from Coventry with his father, also Brian, and David Hartopp, flying from Birmingham to Katowice and then more than six hours on a minibus by road to Warsaw. 'The fact that we were getting our information from friends at home was a disgrace,' said Brian Jnr. 'There was only one announcement in English all night. 'Why didn't they shut  the roof? We knew it would rain.' The FA's Adrian Bevington said compensation is 'something we are looking into, but I can't give any final decision on that'. According to Polish journalists, home manager Waldemar Fornalik had asked for the roof to be left open on Monday because he thought the forecast rain would be a leveller against England. Unfortunately the rain was much heavier than expected, leaving England without the majority of their travelling fans and Barclays Premier League clubs furious that their players will return from international duty a day late. The problems were partly caused by the elaborate but severely flawed design of the stadium, and the fact that the roof cannot be closed when it is raining. In the dry it takes just 15 minutes. When asked why the roof wasn’t used, Hodgson said: ‘I can’t answer that. It was pretty obvious early on that the game was not going to be played. For the Polish federation, it’s a disaster. They had a big crowd so there’s a problem in rearranging tickets for a match tomorrow.’ Desperate measures: Stadium workers tried to clear the pitch of water, but their efforts did not stop the referee calling the game off .

Mr Schulz was backed by MEPs to carry on in the £213,000 a year role, despite the fact that his Socialist group lost May's European elections. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage and other UKIP MEPs turned their backs as an orchestra performed the European anthem in the European parliament in Strasbourg today . Mr Farage dismissed the election of European Parliament president Martin Schulz as a 'stitch up' Newly elected Scottish UKIP MEP David Coburn  climbs stairs as he attends the opening session of the European Parliament today . Mr Schulz was elected by MEPs in Strasbourg today after they observed the European anthem. Although most MEPs stood up for it, British Tory MEPs sat quietly while UKIP MEPs turned their backs on the orchestra and the EU flag. Steven Woolfe said the show of protest was against the 'done deal' for Mr Schulz's election as president of the EU parliament. He said: 'Only the Labour group in the EU and their Socialist partners clapping Shultz in his speech for EU Parliament president.' UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall MEP added: 'We don't recognise or respect the EU flag or anthem. They are both symbols of our servitude inside a political union which the British people reject. 'We will do everything we can in European Parliament to oppose the Federalist system which ignores our national democracy and pushes millions of people across Europe into poverty and unemployment. We stand up for our people, not the EU flag and anthem.' But Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder criticised the UKIP MEPs for their 'shocking disrespect' during the opening ceremony, describing their actions as ""rude'. MEPs from Parliament's three main pro-EU groups agreed to keep Mr Schulz in place after he backed his rival Jean-Claude Juncker to become president of the European Commission last week. In his role Mr Schulz - who has campaigned against budget cuts across Europe - will take home a pay and perks package worth over £213,000 a year. Martin Schulz (left) has been chosen to be the European Parliament's president for another term, risking further anger from the Prime Minister . Former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean Claude Juncker was backed to become European Commission president by German Chancellor Angela Merkel . The EU's 'national anthem' comes from Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy' In 1985 European leaders adopted the tune as its official anthem. According to the EU is the anthem 'expresses the European ideals of freedom, peace and solidarity'. But the EU insists: 'The European anthem is not intended to replace the national anthems of the EU countries but rather to celebrate the values they share.' The Left-wing MEP who has also attacked tax havens will pocket £124,000 of his cash in special allowances without paying any taxation at all. He won today's vote by 409 to 314 - despite refusuing to turn up for a debate between different candidates, including Tory MEP Sajjad Karim on Monday night. Mr Schulz was the spitzenkandidat - or leading candidate - for the Socialists to become the European Commission. But he lost out in the race for Brussels' top job to Mr Juncker who was backed by EU leaders on Friday. Mr Farage said: 'There are no losers among the EU elite after this election. Everyone is a winner. 'This is a big stitch up. For them, it's damn all to do with democracy and it's all about the carving up of power among the EU elites.' Pawel Swidlicki, of the think tank Open Europe, added: 'The re-election of Schulz via a secret ballot following a backroom stitch-up between the main centre-right and centre-left blocks epitomises the EU's democratic flaws and exposes the hollow nature of the arguments in favour of spitzenkandidaten. 'Schulz is an aggressive proponent of increasing the power of the European Parliament and so will be a big obstacle to EU reform.' Mr Schulz has been the president, or speaker of the EU assembly, since January 2012. His reelection makes him the first MEP in the parliament's history to serve two consecutive terms. As president of the assembly, the German MEP will become one of the most well paid parliamentarians in the world. Brussels' three presidents - Herman Van Rompuy, left, Jose Manuel Barroso, centre, and Martin Schulz, right, accepted the Nobel Peace prize on behalf of the EU in 2012. Mr Van Rompuy is the president of the European Council, representing EU leaders. Mr Barroso is the president of the Commission - Brussels' governing bureaucracy - until he is replaced by Jean-Claude Juncker. And Mr Schulz is the president of the European Parliament - representing MEPs . According to the Telegraph he will receive over half of his income in special presidential tax free allowances - with annual 'subsistence' payments worth £89,000 and a 'residence' allowance worth over £35,000. He will also receive an extra 'representation allowance' worth £14,000 a year as well as having two limousines, BMW 7s with drivers for his personal use. The rest of the EU's plumb jobs will be agreed in a fortnight - with the president of the European Council of EU leaders and the new EU foreign policy chief up for grabs. The Danish PM Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Dutch leader Mark Rutte and Andrus Ansip, the former Estonian leader, are in the running to replace Herman Van Rompuy as EU Council president. Federica Mogherini, the Italian foreign minister, meanwhile is the favourite to replace Baroness Ashton as EU foreign minister.","UKIP leader joined his party's MEPs turning their backs as anthem played .

"It has only been used once in the last three years, but a red telephone box in a tiny fishing village will not be removed - after residents mounted a round-the-clock vigil to save it. For nearly 30 years, the phone box in Kilmuir, on the Black Isle north of Inverness, was the community's only means of contact with the outside world and it has come to be cherished as a symbol of life in the Highlands. So when BT decided it should go, the village's 100 residents threw a ring of steel around it. Blocked: Villagers in Kilmuir, on the Black Isle north of Inverness, parked their cars around the red telephone box to stop BT removing it . Locals drew up a rota and took it in turns to park their vehicles around the payphone to prevent workmen from uprooting it. Yesterday, people power won the day when BT relented and allowed the village to pay £1 to adopt the box – even though it has been disconnected. Village association chairman John Hill, 68, said: ‘We were prepared to keep our campaign and vigil going for as long it took but thankfully we didn’t have to wait long for victory. ‘We will all happily chip in to pay for the upkeep but we don’t know if it will be reconnected. ‘It has been used only once in the past three years so it isn’t that vital. But it has affectionately become part of village life.’ No way through: BT has relented and allowed the seaside village to pay £1 to adopt the phone box ¿ even though it has been disconnected . The Kilmuir community was horrified last Friday when a truck carrying two phone booths arrived to take the box away. Engineers stopped at a house in the village to ask for directions to the box. Their request was politely declined and as word swept through the village, locals quickly surrounded the box with their cars to prevent anyone from touching it. Posters were stuck on the windscreens warning anyone approaching that steps were being taken to prevent access to the box. Plea: The residents fixed a message to the red telephone box, urging the company not to remove it . It read: ‘The community only heard of the threat to this local landmark on October 2, 2012, and steps are being taken to preserve it. 'Our immediate response has been to prevent access to the box with our own vehicles. We have informed the police of our actions.’ Mr Hill added: ‘We then discovered a notice pinned inside the box warning us we had 42 days to save it but since no one ever went inside the kiosk, we didn’t know about it until it was almost too late.’ Fellow resident Cathy McRae, 65, said: ‘The box used to sit in the middle of the row of houses overlooking the shoreline for years. 'Then one day about 30 years ago, it disappeared, only to mysteriously reappear for re-installation. The villagers chose the present location. ‘Although rarely used, it was an important lifeline for anyone spotting someone in trouble in the Firth to alert the emergency authorities. ‘We contacted our local councillors and met with the police as well as local BT management and explained our position. ‘We were told there was a phone box 400 metres away and this one was no longer required. ‘But BT didn’t know it was 400 metres away if you were prepared to scramble along the rocks to the village of North Kessock.’ A BT spokesman said: ‘We told Highland Council back in 2008 that we planned to remove it and no objections were raised. ‘A year later we launched our well-publicised Adopt-a-Kiosk campaign, giving local communities the chance to pay £1 to retain their red box and protect their heritage.’ Here to stay: The red telephone box had only been used once in three years and has now been disconnected, but villagers were determined that it should remain .","BT planned to remove box in Kilmuir, north of Inverness, Scotland .

"World of Warcraft is the most popular 'online world' ever created - host to 10 million gamers who explore its Tolkien-esque world to battle huge monsters, or just fight and trade with each other. But new rival Star Wars: the Old Republic has gained ground on the gaming juggernaut - hitting a million subscribers faster than any 'massively multiplayer' online game, including Warcraft. The game, from cult studio Bioware, won 105 awards, and uses voice acting throughout - as well as the universe of Yoda and Darth Vader. It hit a score of 88 on review-aggregator site Metacritic - the highest for any online 'world' game this year. Warcraft recently lost two million subscribers as users complained about the game growing stale - and Electronic Arts's big-budget challenger seems to be ideally placed to pick up these jaded fans. The game, from cult studio Bioware, won 105 awards, and uses voice acting throughout - as well as the universe of Yoda and Darth Vader. It hit a score of 88 on review-aggregator site Metacritic - the highest for any online 'world' game this year . Players can opt to play as lightsaber-wielding Jedi or evil Sith - you can't play as famous characters such as Darth Vader, but a few famous faces crop up throughout the game . 'Massively multiplayer' games such as Star Wars: the Old Republic allow tens of thousands of players to adventure together - battling monsters together or battling one another to become more powerful . Many games have attempted the feat - including several with well-known characters such as Conan the Barbarian - but . the Old Republic is hotly tipped to do it, thanks to the familiar Star . Wars universe, a rumoured £100-million-plus budget, and the fact that . Warcraft subscribers seem to be tiring of the game's fantasy world, with . two million leaving in the past year. The game officially launched on December 20. For gamers, it's easily the biggest launch in a genre that's been ruled single-handedly by Warcraft for more than five years. 'It's happening. It's finally happening,' said game site IGN last week. The game's maker, Electronic Arts, was once the biggest game publisher in the world, but lost ground to rival Activision when Activision acquired Blizzard, makers of World of Warcraft in 2008. The game scored 88 per cent on 'review aggregator' site Metracritic - being praised for its lush graphics, involving plot and vivid game world . Unlike Warcraft, Old Republic uses recorded voice dialogue, rather than text - it has a more voice acting than any previous game, online or off . The game has seen the previous Star Wars online 'world' - Star Wars: Galaxies - switched off, with an announcement that the Rebel Alliance had 'won'. But while previews and gamer reaction to the game is generally good, others are less sure about the business model. The game has been astronomically expensive for Electronic Arts, and faces competition from other, free, online games. The evil Galactic Emperor holds court in the highly anticipated PC title Star Wars: the Old Republic. Gamers will play 'together' in an online world based on Star Wars . Frank Gibeau, President of Electronic Arts, said to Gamesindustry.biz, 'I wish it wasn't so expensive. I think everybody does.' The business model where gamers pay for discs, then pay to subscribe, is also under threat. Many games, such as Sony's DC Universe Online, have switched to a 'free to play' system similar to Facebook games, where the game itself is free, but users pay to upgrade their character with powerful items or new outfits. Gaming site Eurogamer described the game as 'the end of an era' - saying that it's arrived as the world of online gaming changes forever. The game lets players battle monsters - or one another, with the players split into two factions. The resulting mix ensures that both pacifists and more warlike players are catered for . School for scoundrels: the Sith Academy, where players can be trained in using the powers of the Dark Side. You can also join the Jedi - or simply become a trader . The Old Republic does have new ideas, though such as voice acting throughout the game - giving Old Republic a more story-driven feel. It's also driven the price up hugely. World of Warcraft has had up to . 12 million monthly subscribers, earning the company a reported $500 . million a year in subscription fees - on top of disc prices for the game . and its four expansions. The game has been running since 2004. Gamers will team up together to take on hideous alien beasts in a huge 'online world' shared by millions . The game includes hundreds of planets to explore - gamers can captain spaceships, command crews, make millions, and even turn to the Dark Side . The game also has voice acting throughout - . and a greater focus on story than rival Warcraft, which gamers sometimes . complain has 'hamster wheel'-like qualities, as they're forced to . repeat tasks to earn in-game rewards.

"Heavy drinking kills you more quickly than smoking and is especially dangerous among women, a study suggests. Researchers found that alcoholics die about 20 years sooner on average than the general population. People dependent on alcohol also live shorter lives on average than smokers, the findings indicate. Warning: Dependency on alcohol is particularly dangerous among women, a study of mortality rates has found. (Picture posed by model) Academics in Germany studied data spanning 14 years in relation to 149 adults with alcohol problems. They found that the death rate among alcohol-dependent (AD) women was 4.6 times higher than average. Research: Professor Ulrich John said that the findings appeared to show drinking could cause early death more frequently than smoking . The death rate for men with alcohol problems was almost double the level for men who did not rely on drink. The study, reported in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, is groundbreaking because it looks at the impact of alcohol dependency over a long period. Previous research has highlighted the dangers of excessive alcohol, but those findings were largely based on clinical trials. Professor . Ulrich John, of University Medicine Greifswald, said: 'Clinical data . have revealed a higher proportion of individuals who have died than . among the general population of the same age. 'Gender-specific data are rare, even among clinical samples. Furthermore, these studies have two main limitations. 'First, . we know that only a minority of AD individuals receive treatment of . this disorder, but we lack knowledge about how this selection occurs. 'Second, . we have no evidence about potential effects of specialised alcoholism . treatment on mortality among people who had been diagnosed as AD. Alarming: Researchers in Germany found that the death rate among alcohol-dependent women was 4.6 times higher than average . 'We would like to know whether treatment might enhance survival time. 'For ethical reasons, no controlled trials are possible. 'Thus, longitudinal descriptive data as in this study are helpful.' Professor John's team looked at a . random sample of 4,070 respondents between the ages of 18 and 64, of . which 153 were identified as AD. Of these, 149 - 119 men and 30 women - were followed for 14 years. Professor . John said: 'First, we found that annualised death rates were 4.6-fold . higher for females and 1.9-fold higher for males compared to the age- . and gender-specific general population. 'Second, we found that the mean age at death was 60 for females and 58 for males, both of which are about 20 years lower than the mean age at death among the general population. Risk: Researchers found that adults who are dependent on alcohol die about 20 years earlier on average than the general population. (Picture posed by model) Groundbreaking: The study's conclusions are reported in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research . 'None of those deceased had reached the age of life expectancy. 'Third, having participated in inpatient AD treatment was not related with longer survival compared to not having taken part in treatment, meaning that it did not seem to have a sufficient protective effect against premature death.' Professor John said that the findings appeared to show drinking could cause early death more frequently than smoking. He said: 'Smoking-related death cases are more due to cancers which seem to occur later in life than many alcohol-attributable causes of death do. 'Furthermore, drinking can also contribute to other risky behaviours such as smoking, becoming overweight, and obesity. 'Alcohol is a dangerous product and should be consumed only within guidelines.'","Alcoholics die 20 years sooner on average than general population, groundbreaking study finds .

"An Indian textile magnate who made a fortune from his clothing empire is making sure the rest of the world knows about his success - by having a shirt made out of pure gold.

And now, to celebrate his upcoming 45th birthday on Friday, he has commissioned the solid gold shirt that weighs more than four kilos. Scroll down for video . An Indian textile magnate who made a fortune from his clothing empire is making sure the rest of the world knows about his success - by having a shirt made out of pure gold . Although he left school without any qualifications Pankaj Parakh still managed to make a fortune after establishing a multi-million pound textile business in India . He said: 'I wanted to wear something special when I say my thanks for my success at a thanksgiving visit to the Siddhivinayak Temple of the Hindu elephant god in Mumbai.' And after paying just £127,000 to buy the gold and have it turned into a golden shirt, he thinks he got a good deal. According to local media the gold shirt has really got him noticed as he marched along the streets of his home in Yeola, 260 km from the city of Mumbai. He says he gets both admiring looks from women and envious looks from men. He said: 'I never go out with less than two to three kilos of gold jewellery. And now, to celebrate his upcoming 45th birthday on Friday, he has commissioned the solid gold shirt that weighs more than four kilos . 'I have always been fascinated with gold since I was five-years-old and studying in school. And over the years that interest has become a real passion. So it was logical that I would want to make my 45th birthday a golden affair. 'In fact even on my wedding 23 years ago a lot of people said it was embarrassing that I was wearing more gold than my bride, but I just love the Royal metal.' The shirt that has seven solid gold buttons is due to be officially modelled by the clothing magnate on Friday, but he tried it on in advance after collecting it from the Shanti Jewellers at Parel in Mumbai, where a team of around 20 craftsmen collectively spent 3,200 hours over the past two months to 'stitch' it together. The gold used in the shirt has an 18-22 carat purity, without any other metals, and he added: 'Before the taxman starts coming round, I can guarantee that every bit is properly recorded in my company accounts.' Last year wealthy Datta Phuge has splashed out £14,000 on a solid gold shirt to make sure he's a 24 karat hit with women in central India . Despite being made of gold the shirt has been so carefully made that it is as flexible as a normal shirt, he claims, and also just as comfortable because there is a thin cloth lining the inside. He said: 'It is easily washed and can be hung up to dry just like a normal piece of clothing, and a good a lifetime guarantee with it so that if it's torn or damaged it will quickly be repaired.' After leaving school early before graduating he had thrown all of his efforts into developing the family garments business in Yeola, a town of some 60,000. He is married to wife Pratibha and has sons Siddharth, 22, and Rahul, 19, both now in college, and added: 'I am the only one in the family that seems so passionate about gold, the rest of my family is neither impressed or interested in gold. They just accept that it's my passion and it's part of our domestic life. My more extended family however think I'm a bit weird but I guess that's families.' He is a local politician himself and despite criticism that he flaunts his wealth among people who are poorer, he is actively involved in community projects and recently funding 120 operations for polio suffers at the Narayan Seva Sansthan Hospital of Udaipur in Rajasthan. 'I spend at least a week each year offering voluntary services at the 1,000-bedded hospital, the biggest and best for polio treatment in India. I also arrange for any requirements of the poor patients like food, medicines, surgery and blankets, from which I get immense satisfaction,' Parakh said. And he added: 'I admit you need to be brave to wear a shirt like this, brave and also in possession of a gun like my fully licensed revolver which I also carry with me every time I go out.' And the cost of the gold shirt is reportedly a fraction of what he has splashed out to make sure the birthday party is a spectacular affair, with hundreds of guests including Maharashtra tourism minister Chhagan Bhujbal of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and around a dozen MPs from various parties and Indian celebrities.","Pankaj Parakh commissioned the  shirt that weighs more than four kilos .

"Hot for teacher: Kalyn Thompson gave a failing student an A average after having sex with him, police said . An Oklahoma English teacher is in trouble for giving a failing student an A - after he told police they had sex multiple times. Kalyn Thompson, 25, is accused of having sex multiple times with an 18-year-old student in an English class she taught at Kellyville High School until she resigned in mid-April, according to reports. The student in question flunked English during the fall semester, when she started sexting him, but miraculously turned it around to a 98 per cent during the spring semester in which he also turned 18, according to KJRH. Thompson was charged with second-degree rape because a teacher in Oklahoma is not allowed to have a sexual relationship with a current or former student until that person reaches the age of 21 despite the age of consent being only 16, the station noted. She resigned earlier this year upon finding out an investigation into her extracurricular activities had begun, and told school officials she had been texting the student in a ‘sexual nature.’ There were also texts discussing ‘getting high’ exchanged between the teacher and her student, cops said. Investigators questioning the student discovered they began talking outside the classroom in December and became sexually active in March, shortly after the student turned 18, sources told KJRH. Where they met: Thompson taught the boy's English class at Kellyville High School, in suburban Tulsa . The pair had sex at least twice. Once at a nearby lake and then again at a hotel in Tulsa, according to KOTV. They were also seen together in town having dinner and in her pickup truck, the station said. ‘You send your kids to small town schools thinking they’re going to get a better education because there’s more one on one,’ parent Michael Sullivan told KJRH. ‘You don’t expect to hear about a teacher messing with a student.’ Thompson was being held in Creek County Jail until she bailed out on a $35,000 bond.","Kalyn Thompson, 25, began grooming the failing student last year with salacious texts, police said .

"Downing too many glasses of fizzy drink doesn't just make you fat - it could also make your dodgy knees worse. Researchers studied patients suffering from osteoarthritis in their knees, which is a common degenerative condition affecting six million older adults in the UK. They found that the more soft drinks patients consumed, the faster their condition progressed. Slim men were found to be particularly affected. Scroll down for video . Sugary drinks could make knee osteoarthritis worse - a condition that affects most adults over 60 . Study leader Dr Bing Lu from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said: 'Little is known about the course of . disability over time in patients with osteoarthritis. 'This study may offer the . potential to identify a modifiable dietary risk factor for disease . progression, enable evaluation of prevailing recommendations of healthy . diet, and thus have potential public health implications.' Sugary drinks joins the other known risk factors including obesity, aging and joint stress. For the study, researcher looked at data on 2,149 patients who had been diagnosed with osteoarthritis following an X-ray. At the beginning of the study, each participant's soft-drink consumption, not including sugar-free drinks was measured using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The researcher followed up with the participants 12, 24, 36 and 48 months later to track their OA progression as measured by joint space change in their medial knee compartments. Body mass index (a measure of obesity) was also measured and tracked and data for men and women were analysed separately. After controlling for BMI and other factors that may contribute to knee OA, men who consumed more soft drinks per week had worse progression of their condition. The joint space became narrower by an average of 0.29 millimeters in men who drank no soft drinks to 0.59 millimeters in men who drank more than five soft drinks a week. Men classed as normal weight saw their knees get worse than men who were overweight or obese. By contrast, only women of normal weight showed an association between more soft-drink consumption and knee OA progression. The researchers concluded that the more soft drinks men drink, the worse their knees may get. It is unclear whether this problem is due to high-calorie soft drinks leading to excess weight burdening knees, or if there are other ingredients in soft drinks that contribute to OA progression.","Osteoarthritis in the knees affects around six million adults in the UK .

One by one the charging wildebeest throw themselves into the boiling river as they make the annual pilgrimage from Serengeti National Park in neighbouring Tanzania to greener pastures. The river crossing is fraught with danger. Crocodiles lie in wait just a few yards in, hoping to snatch the younger or weaker creatures for an easy meal.

Orderly: Having made their way to the edge of the river, this group form a queue before stepping into the abyss which is littered with danger for them . If that does not get them, they have to fight strong currents as they bid to make it across to the other side. These dramatic images, taken by Moscow-based photographer Sergey Agapov, show one of natures most magnificent migrations. Up to 1.5 million wildebeest are believed to make the journey every year. Mr Agapov, a retired Presidential Security Service officer who turned his attentions to photography four years ago, said: 'Watching the wildebeest I feel excitement and respect because of their bravery in the face of risk, said Mr Agapov. 'These animals know that deadly danger awaits them in the river, yet thousands of them readily jump into death's face. This cannot leave anyone indifferent.'

The migration takes place between July and October each year, but the mass exodus peaks in the month of August. Photographers from all over the world flock to Kenya at this time, with Mr Agapov admitting he had to start planning his trip eight months ahead. He added: 'The most interesting part of photographing the migration is capturing them during the jump from the precipice into the river and during their run through the dust clouds.'

Natasha Vukic, who was working for the UK Border Agency (UKBA) in Nigeria, tried to bring housekeeper Rose Inah back to the UK with her as 'cheap labour', jurors were told. Vukic, 36, and her partner James Mooney, 33, wrongly claimed that Ms Inah had been working for them in Nigeria for a year to ensure that she would qualify for a visa, it is alleged. On trial: Immigration officer Natasha Vukic (left) and her partner James Mooney (right) are accused of faking a visa application in an attempt to bring a Nigerian nanny to Britain to work as 'cheap labour' In reality, they had only employed the woman for six months, Inner London Crown Court was told. Vukic and Mooney, who had also worked as an immigration officer but later took up a management position with the Foreign Office in Lagos, both deny a count of assisting unlawful immigration. They are alleged to have faked Ms Inah's documents so they could bring her to their home in Coulsdon, south London, where she would have worked 11 hours a day, five days a week, looking after their three year-old son for just £300 a month. Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones told the jury: 'The motive is one of greed. Had they succeeded, had Rose come to the UK for a period of a year, she would have worked for what can only be described as a pittance.' Vukic and Mooney are alleged to have hatched the plan in May 2011 at a secure compound where government staff were posted. Miss Karmy-Jones said: 'Their role in this offence is all the more culpable and serious because of what they do, for Natasha Vukic and James Mooney have both considered and approved and refused the applications made by others. 'They have, in effect, stood in judgement over others for the very same offence they have now committed.' Outlining the allegation, Miss Karmy-Jones said: 'Sometime in the spring of 2011 Natasha Vukic and James Mooney decided to return to the UK. 'Natasha Vukic had obtained a transfer back to the UK. She was due to take up a post in the UKBA’s Criminal and Financial Investigations Unit, based in Croydon. 'She planned to take her young son with her. No doubt on her mind was childcare, and specifically the cost of childcare in London was something that she and James Mooney had to consider.' The prosecutor added: 'They hit upon a plan that their Nigerian nanny and maid Rose would be the ideal candidate to continue to look after their son when Natasha worked in London.' Vukic was then said to have filled out a visa application form on their maid’s behalf. Mooney allegedly submitted the form on May 25 last year, together with a copy of the maid’s contract claiming she had been working for the couple since May 10, 2010. However, Miss Karmy-Jones told jurors that Ms Inah had only been working for the couple since November 2010 - six months less than they had written on her visa application. She added: 'In submitting that form, as they did, Natasha Vukic and James Mooney were breaking the law.' Having been granted the visa, Mooney was said to have asked for it to be reissued as it had only been granted for 11 months as opposed to the full year requested, jurors were told. This attracted the attention of issuing officer Lindsey Moore, who knew the couple and recalled visiting their flat in the autumn of 2010 before a night out. On that visit, Mrs Moore had found Vukic annoyed that their maid was late, it is claimed. Mrs Moore is then said to have heard that the couple had sacked the unreliable maid shortly afterwards and found a replacement called Rose - months later than claimed on the application form. Further investigation revealed a log showing the previous maid, Georgina, had not handed in her security pass until November 2, 2011 and that Rose had only been issued her first pass sixteen days later, the court heard. The maid named Georgina was interviewed and confirmed that she had been sacked ‘a few months before Christmas 2010’ after being accused of stealing around £4, it is claimed. A search of Mooney’s staff email uncovered a message sent by him to a colleague, confirming he and Vukic had hired a new nanny, jurors heard. Vukic, who had since returned to the UK, was arrested on June 8 last year. She had allegedly emailed a UKBA colleague, saying: 'It’s not looking good, I’ll speak to you later.' Vukic denied the allegation, as did her partner when he returned to the UK for an interview later that month. Mooney even claimed that Mrs Moore ‘did not like him because he went out drinking with her husband,’ the court heard. The trial continues.

"When a teenager complained that she hadn't been able to eat or drink for days, doctors decided they should look into the problem. And what they found would put anyone off their dinner - a ball of hair weighing almost 4lbs stuck between her stomach and small intestine. Medics in India discovered that the 19-year-old student had a habit of eating her hair and chalk while in class, and the combination had built up inside her body. Unappetising: This ball of hair weighing almost four pounds was found inside a 19-year-old woman, stuck between her stomach and small intestine . A team of gastro-surgeons was alerted to the problem after the woman, from Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh, attended the Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital in Indore last month. Led by Dr Parvinder Singh Lubana, the surgeons were able to remove the giant hairball in a successful operation. The hairball was wrapped around a mass of chalk. Dr Amit Agarwal, one of the surgeons in the team, told NDTV.com that the woman had developed an intestinal obstruction leading to no intake of food and water for a couple of days. Incredibly, the hairball is not the largest to be removed from a patient in recent years. In November 2007, doctors in the US reported having found a 10lb hairball inside a woman's stomach. Treatment: The woman, who had a habit of eating hair and chalk, underwent an operation at the Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital in Indore, India (pictured) The woman, who was 18 at the time, sought help after suffering pain and swelling in her abdomen for five months, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. A scan showed that there was a large mass in her abdomen and further tests showed it to be a ball of black, curly hair. Ronald Levy and Srinadh Komanduri, gastroenterologists at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, wrote: 'On questioning, the patient stated that she had had a habit of eating her hair for many years - a condition called trichophagia.' The ball weighed 10lbs and measured 15ins by 7ins by 7ins, the doctors said. The medics added that, within five days of surgeons removing the hairball, the woman was eating normally and was sent home.","Woman complained she had not been able to eat or drink for days .

"Spared prison: Islamic teacher Suleman Maknojioa sexually abused a young girl as he taught her the Koran . AN Islamic teacher who repeatedly molested a terrified girl of 11 as he taught her the Koran has escaped a jail sentence because his wife’s English is so bad. Suleman Maknojioa, 40, repeatedly rubbed the  youngster’s leg and reached under the folds of her prayer headscarf to touch her chest. He was given a suspended sentence because the court heard the father of six’s family were so dependent on him and he is ill with kidney problems. Maknojioa was supposed to be giving the girl and her two brothers private tuition. He was said to have favoured the girl and claimed the touching was done to reassure her. But his confused victim became terrified whenever lessons were due. He was finally reported to police after the children’s mother overheard her two sons, aged 13 and seven, talking about the incidents. Maknojioa was a respected hafiz – a scholar of the Koran. On the day he was arrested he was due to teach 30 children at a mosque near his home in Blackburn. He was later convicted of five counts of sexual activity but on Monday he escaped with a 40-week prison sentence suspended for two years. A family friend condemned the sentence. ‘This is a total disgrace,’ said the friend, who asked not to be named. ‘What type of message does this send out to paedophiles? He should be behind bars for this type of abuse. We are all horrified.’ Preston Crown Court was told Maknojioa had been engaged by the children’s parents in 2012 to teach them about the Islamic faith up to three times a week at their home in Lancashire. In September that year the girl and her two brothers started tuition of the Koran in Arabic in their living room. Teacher: Maknojioa rubbed the 11-year-old's leg and reached underneath the folds of her prayer headscarf to squeeze her chest whilst giving her and her two brothers private tuition in Arabic . The court heard she was better at her . lessons than her brothers, who were often told off. Maknojioa began . touching the girl’s arms and head, then moved to her legs, feet and . chest and her thigh. The . girl claimed that the touching typically occurred as she prayed or read . from the Koran while kneeling or sitting cross-legged. She . told the jury: ‘I was too afraid to say something. He would put his . hand under my headscarf on my chest and he would squeeze. ‘He . would only use the one hand. The other hand would be writing something . or he would be pointing to my brothers and telling them to pray harder. ‘No matter how hard my brothers tried to pray it wasn’t good enough. He would always say I was better, even if I wasn’t. Convicted: Maknojioa was found guilty of five counts of sexual activity with a child . ‘My . brothers asked me what he had been doing and I didn’t know how to . describe it. I told them he had touched me up. They told me to tell Mum . and Dad – but I just didn’t want to tell anyone. ‘It went on for ages, his hand going up and down. I was afraid of what my teacher would do.’ Her . older brother said: ‘I knew what was happening for about a month before . my parents. My sister would get very upset at the idea of anyone . knowing. It was difficult for me to know what to do. He favoured her. He would give her ten pages to learn and we would only get three. ‘That . way he spent most of the lesson with her. He did it slyly. When it . happened, she was trying to pray. I have seen him touching her thigh in a . stroking motion. It was inappropriate.’ This . went on from September 2012 to June 2013 until the course of lessons . ended. The girl’s father later confronted Maknojioa at his home but he . denied all the charges. Frida . Hussain, defending, said: ‘He is married with six children. His wife . doesn’t work and speaks very little English, they are dependent on him . to lead their lives and with the running of the household. 'One of the children has learning difficulties. Because he doesn’t teach now he is reliant on benefits.’ Judge . Michael Byrne told Maknojioa: ‘The parents invited you into the . sanctity of their own home. They trusted you and left you with their . children. ‘I have read a . letter from the girl in which she sets out her initial confusion at . conduct of this sort from one…who she and her brother were expected to . trust. ‘The older brother felt he wasn’t able to protect his sister. She was of a tender age, young, vulnerable and impressionable. ‘There . could be no greater recognition of trust than between a minister of . religion and pupils whose care is entrusted to him by parents. 'You breached that trust deliberately and repeatedly.’ Maknojioa will be under supervision for two years and made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for ten years.","Suleman Maknojioa, 40, squeezed girl's chest under her prayer scarf .

"A house fire which killed a doctor and four of her children may have been started by arsonists targeting a 'gangster-type' tenant who used to live at the property, neighbours believe. Sabah Usmani, 44, and her children Hira, 12, Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, died on Monday after fire ripped through their home in Harlow, Essex. Detectives are investigating the possibility that they were the victims of mistaken identity, and today nearby residents claimed that the culprits had probably targeted someone else. Blaze: Sabah Usmani, her sons Sohaib, 11, Muneeb, nine, and Rayyan, six, and her 12-year-old daughter Hira, died when fire ripped through their Essex home. Neighbours believe they were the victims of mistaken identity . Tragic: Essex Police initially suspected an arson attack but it is now thought that the fire was a tragic accident . Chris Day, 48, who lives in a flat . next door, described a former tenant whom he and other neighbours . believe may have been the intended victim. He said: 'This guy looked like a proper dodgy bloke and he had a bull mastiff that he used to walk around the neighbourhood. 'He looked like a gangster type - the . kind of person you wouldn’t want to cross. I think he was a cage . fighter - he certainly was that build. 'He used to argue with his partner all the time and I could hear them from across the street. 'I’ve been told he dealt drugs which . would make sense as I used to see dodgy people go in and out of the . house all the time when this guy lived there about a year or two ago. 'When I saw the fire I thought this must have been a revenge attack that went wrong. 'Maybe this guy owed someone money and they came to the house not knowing he’d moved.' Miss Usmani, who was a qualified . doctor, her husband Abdul Shakoor and their five children moved to the . rented house a year ago from Winchester, Hampshire. Doctors: Abdul Shakour (left), pictured with his wife Sabah Usmani (right), fought to try to save his family . Terrifying: Black marks on the wall at the rear of the house show how the blaze damaged the property . Sealed off: Police placed a cordon around the scene of the fire as their investigation into the suspected arson got under way . Devastating: A close-up view of an upstairs window with the glass missing. The frame is also charred . Grim: An aerial view of the scene in Harlow, Essex, hours after the police investigation began . The family were originally from Pakistan but moved to the UK in 2009. Dr Shakoor, 45, an endocrinologist and hospital registrar, suffered severe smoke inhalation as he fought to save his family. He was transferred from the Princess . Alexandra Hospital in Harlow to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford to be . close to his only surviving daughter, Maheen, three, who is in a . critical condition at a specialist burns unit. Mr Day said: 'I’m sure whoever did this did not know that family lived there. 'It seems like a case of mistaken identity - it’s innocent people being killed because of drugs yet again.' Mr Day described the former tenant, . who is believed to have rented the property shortly before the Shakoor . family moved in, as a large bald-headed white man. He claimed that the man lived at the home for around 10 months before moving out. Mr Day's comments came after inquests into the deaths were opened and adjourned at Chelmsford Coroner's Court. Remembered: Floral tributes laid in the street in Harlow, Essex, where a fire claimed the lives of Sabah Usmani and her five children . 'Lovely people': A note left with floral tributes at Barn Mead following a house fire on the Harlow street . The short hearing was told that the . bodies of all five members of the family had been released and a funeral . could be held in days. Coroner’s officer Laura Howarde . confirmed that Dr Shakoor had been through the heartbreaking task of . confirming the identity of the five dead members of his beloved family. Deputy coroner’s officer, Eleanor . McGann, said it had been a 'terrible fire' and asked for her sympathy to . be passed on to Dr Shakoor. A hospital spokesman said there had been 'no real change in the condition' of either Dr Shakoor or his daughter Maheen. Dr Shakoor's friend Abdul Khaliq, a . taxi driver, said the father had spoken of moving the family out of . their rented house to a permanent address elsewhere in Harlow. A white forensics tent is set up at the scene and a special fire sniffer dog can be seen with its handler . Mr Khaliq said: 'He had spoken at the mosque about how he would like to buy a house in the area. 'He planned to settle down in Harlow.' Mr Khaliq said that he saw Dr Shakoor only hours before the blaze as they prayed at the Harlow Islamic Centre on Sunday evening. He added: “That evening I was sitting and praying with him and his children. 'He was a regular at the mosque with his family who were always very well behaved. 'He shook my hand before he left. It is a complete mystery why this has happened. 'We pray five times a day and every time we are praying for him and his family.' Gutted: Police seal off a neighbour's car which was torched at the same time that the blaze swept through Dr Shakoor's house . Harlow Council is to open a book of condolence at its civic centre on Thursday for residents to pay their respects. Speaking at the scene of the fire on . Tuesday, Chief Superintendent Luke Collison, of Essex Police, said: ‘I’m . convinced the answer to this serious crime lies in the community. 'If anyone has noticed anything suspicious we would ask them to come forward. 'There is nothing to suggest we are dealing with a serial arsonist.' Asked about other incidents of arson . in the area, such as two abandoned cars set alight in a nearby street, . he said: 'This house fire has a different MO [modus operandi]. 'The other fires are not untypical for such a town and we would class them as minor.' Although a racial motivation for the . attack has not been ruled out, Chief Supt Collison said there was no . evidence to support it.

"She plays the piano and violin beautifully and has already composed an opera, all at the age of seven. So it's no wonder that classical music lovers are comparing Alma Deutscher with Mozart. The Surrey schoolgirl has her own YouTube channel to show her ability, and she can even count actor Stephen Fry among her growing number of admirers. Scroll down for video . Gifted: Young musician Alma Deutscher, pictured playing the violin at the age of six, has been compared to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart . Natural: Alma Deutscher's playing has gone from strength to strength since she was given her first violin for her third birthday . Fry has posted a link to one of Alma's videos on Twitter, with the accompanying comment: 'Simply mind-blowing: Alma Deutscher playing her own compositions. A new Mozart?' Alma lives near Dorking with her parents Guy, 43, a linguist and amateur flautist, and Janie, 39, an academic. Her father has revealed that she could name the notes on a piano by the age of two, and she received her first violin for her third birthday. Within a year, she was playing Handel. Her videos prove that she has gone on to master works by composers including Schubert, Haydn and Mozart himself. Impressive: Alma (left) can play works by many famous composers, including Mozart himself (right) Arguably most impressive is the footage showing Alma playing her own work, which she has written for piano and violin. Enchanted: Actor Stephen Fry is among Alma Deutscher's growing number of admirers . The home-schooled seven-year-old now has weekly piano and violin lessons at the Yehudi Menuhin School in Cobham, Surrey, but may become a full-time pupil. The YouTube channel has attracted more than 75,000 views and has more than 250 subscribers. Earlier this year, Alma composed a short opera called The Sweeper of Dreams, which she entered into a competition run by the English National Opera to find young classical musicians. The composition narrowly missed out on making the final. 'I want people to know how I play,' Alda told the Independent, adding that when she is older she wants to 'compose like Mozart, play the violin like Perlman and play the piano like Barenboim'. Her father said: 'What she is doing now is definitely no less sophisticated than what Mozart was doing at her age. 'What that says about the future, only the future will tell.' Mozart was composing pieces by the age of five, which he played to his father Leopold who wrote them down. He went on to compose more than 600 works. He died in 1791, aged 35.

"First Lady Michelle Obama was frustrated with her husband’s advisers and clashed with then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel, especially over the push for health care overhaul. A book slated to be released this Tuesday tells of a divided White House where tensions developed between Mrs Obama and Mr Emanuel, with their relationship became increasingly frosty. The two rarely saw eye to eye. The book reveals several fascinating bits of information - from Mr Emanuel rebuffing the first lady’s chief of staff, Jackie Norris, from attending a morning meeting of top staffers, to Mrs Obama’s reticence to campaign in the 2010 midterm elections. Clash of the titans: Jodi Kantor's book reveals Michelle Obama (left) and Barack's former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel (right) 'butted heads' Arguably the most prominent point of . contention New York Times reporter Jodi Kantor reveals between the first lady and Mr Emanuel was . the friction over healthcare reform and Mrs Obama’s scepticism of . so-called backroom deals being cut. The tensions originated after the seat left open by Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy was eventually lost to Republican Scott Brown, jeopardizing the success of her husband's legislation. The president received the brunt of his wife’s fury, Ms Kantor writes in her book, The Obamas. He reportedly told his aides: ‘She feels as if our rudder isn’t set right.’ Mrs Obama ‘made it clear that she thought her husband needed a new team, according to her aides,’ Ms Kantor said. Influential: The book claims that Michelle Obama is more powerful within the White House than previously thought . She writes: ‘To her, the Scott Brown victory provided grim evidence for what she had been saying for months, in some cases years: (her husband) had been leaning on the same tight group of insular, disorganised advisers for too long. ‘They were not careful planners who looked out for worst-case scenarios.’ According to Ms Kantor, early in 2010 as the president's health care agenda seemed in danger of collapsing, Mrs Obama let it be known she was annoyed by how the White House was handling the strategy. After media reports indicated Mr Emanuel was unhappy pursuing the health care overhaul, he offered to resign, Ms Kantor wrote. The president declined the offer. ‘Your punishment is that you have to stay here and get this bill done,’ the president said, according to then senior adviser David Axelrod. ‘I’m not letting you off the hook. Not welcomed: Michelle Obama's chief of staff Jackie Norris (pictured) was rebuffed from a morning meeting by Rahm Emanuel, the books says . From past sour experiences with another White House wife – former first lady and current Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton - Mr Emanuel tried to avoid Mrs Obama. Ms Kantor writes that the East and West wings became so separate from each other that some referred to the East Wing as ‘Guam – pleasant but powerless.’ For one thing, Mrs Obama's former chief of staff Jackie Norris was rebuffed by Mr Emanuel to attend a top-staff 7:30am White House meeting. But that is only one of many startling anecdotes Ms Kantor reveals. 'Michelle . and Rahm Emanuel had almost no bond. They were the president's two . spouses, in a sense, one public and official and one private and . informal.' In 2009, Mr Emanuel told Rep Allen Boyd (D-Florida) that the first lady would make an appearance at an event to lobby for an energy bill, without asking Mrs Obama’s permission first. Mrs Obama was depending on Rep Boyd’s vote on the health care legislation. Rep Boyd, meanwhile, was banking on her support in defeating a challenger in his predominately black constituency. The East Wing staff reportedly knew Rep Boyd was planning to vote against the health care overhaul – though he later voted in favour of the final bill. Upheaval: Rahm Emanuel, left, offered to resign as Chief of Staff over health reform . Rep Boyd told the Huffington Post that the event was held in Miami, more than 600 miles away from his district, and said: ‘I never heard any words like that or spoke any words like that,’ referring to the link between Michelle Obama’s visit and the environmental vote. Mrs Obama manifested her frustration by remaining reluctant to campaign for the midterms, former aides said. Anger: Mrs Obama and Mr Emanuel clashed in 2009 over a visit to Rep Allen Boyd (D-Florida, pictured) The two were often jockeying to win the president's opinion. ‘Michelle and Rahm Emanuel had almost no bond,’ Ms Kantor writes, saying that from the get-go, the two were awkward. ‘They were the president’s two spouses, in a sense, one public and official and one private and informal.’ In an excerpt published by the Times Friday night, Ms Kantor also revealed Mrs Obama's priorities. 'She does think there are worse things than losing an election,' Susan S. Sher said after the 2010 midterm elections. The first lady's former chief of staff added: 'Being true to yourself, for her, is definitely more important.' The Times's adaptation of the book . portrays Mrs Obama as having gone through an evolution from struggle to . fulfillment in her role at the White House, but all the while an . 'unrecognised force' in pursuing the president's goals. She is seen publicly as the friendly and popular face of the softer side of the White House, the one reading to school kids or promoting exercise as a means to reduce child obesity. Preceding the 2010 elections, the three were at odds at how to best approach them. Mrs Obama, having just been confronted by a second-grader whose mother didn’t have immigration papers, was strongly pushing for her husband to address the importance of immigration reform. 'To her, the Scott Brown victory provided grim evidence for what she had been saying for months, in some cases years: (her husband) had been leaning on the same tight group of insular, disorganized advisers for too long; they were not careful planners who looked out for worst-case scenarios.' Mr Emanuel, however, didn’t see the need, as he thought the legislation didn’t stand the chance for approval. Though Mr Obama ended up making the speech, his remarks were widely forgotten because, as Ms Kantor says, the media was questioning an issue that had not been cultivated enough in the public eye. She writes: ‘Obama became quietly furious at his team for not giving the address more support… . 'The first lady fumed too: she took it as more proof that her husband’s advisers were poorly serving him.’ Controversy: Remarks made by Mrs Obama to Carla Bruni-Sarkozy required a damage limitation exercise in the White House . Among the more provocative anecdotes, Ms . Kantor recounts a scene in which Mr Gibbs, frustrated after tamping . down a potential public relations crisis involving the first lady, . exploded when presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett told him the first . lady had concerns about the White House response to the flap. The initial commotion had been over an alleged remark by Michelle Obama to French first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy that living in the White House was 'hell.' Mr Gibbs cursed the first lady, who was . absent. Ms Kantor writes that Mr Gibbs later said his anger was . misplaced and that he blamed Ms Jarrett for creating the confrontation. The White House had a cold reaction . to the book, calling it an 'over-dramatisation of old news' and . emphasising that the first couple did not speak to the author, who last . interviewed them for a magazine piece in 2009. New responsibilities: The first lady was at first unsure of her role, despite her glamorous reception . 'The . emotions, thoughts and private moments described in the book, though . often seemingly ascribed to the president and first lady, reflect little . more than the author's own thoughts,' White House spokesman Eric . Schultz said. 'These secondhand accounts are staples of every administration in modern political history and often exaggerated.' Ms . Kantor, who began reporting on the Obamas in 2007, said that in 2008, . Mrs Obama was thinking of delaying her move to Washington so her . daughters could adjust to being the first children, perhaps not fully . realising the message that would project. Adviser Valerie Jarrett said she . chose to move to the White House after her husband was elected because . of ‘wanting her family to be together.’ Aides said in her early tenure as first lady, Mrs Obama struggled with insecurity about her new role, despite a public outpouring of admiration for her glamour and poise. The Harvard-educated lawyer battled with the traditionally ‘shapeless post.’ She was deeply frustrated with elements of her new life, including the fact that she could no longer take her daughters to school functions without fear of causing a commotion. Next to normal: Aides said the first lady was at first unsure about her very public role, which meant no more shopping trips without the Secret Service and a handful of staffers . Other rituals that many consider mundane – grocery shopping for one – were now a dangerous endeavour which required sweeps of stores and an arsenal of Secret Service agents. One aide said she felt additional pressure because she is the first African-American first lady. She wanted to bring grace and sophistication to her new post, but was discouraged of being lavish by the president’s advisers because of stormy joblessness reports and corporate bailouts. She felt as though ‘everyone was waiting for a black woman to make a mistake,’ the former aide said. The Times posted a 3,300-word adaption . of the book, The Obamas, on its website Friday night. The accounts are . based on interviews with 30 current and former aides, though President . Barack Obama and the first lady declined to be interviewed for the book.","Michelle Obama and Rahm Emanuel clashed over health care reform, new book reveals .

"Syrian rebels have turned to making their own improvised weapons as they continue to fight more heavily armed forces loyal to the country's embattled president, Bashar al-Assad. A portable rocket-launcher, a hand-grenade and various explosives are among the home-made arms which have been developed by the rebels, who have even resorted to using a PlayStation games console controller to fire mortar rounds. Lacking in ammunition and anti-aircraft weaponry, they have produced the makeshift arsenal from all the materials they can muster. Improvised: A Syrian rebel uses a home-made slingshot to fire a bomb in the northern city of Aleppo. Opposition forces have turned to making their own weapons to use against troops loyal to the government . Makeshift: Slingshots like these have been made by rebels starved of resources as their conflict with pro-government forces continues . Sparks: A bomb is ready to be fired at the enemy from the home-made slingshot created by rebel engineers . They are trying to combat pro-government forces who are able to call upon tanks, artillery and warplanes. Arms-maker Abu al-Fadhel demonstrated the unlikely weapons at a location in Aleppo province, which has become a key battleground in the conflict which has ravaged the country for 19 months. He showed rockets with ranges of up to several miles, which the rebels direct by referring to Google and a compass. Wearing a keffiyeh scarf to hide his identity on camera, he said he was a scientific researcher and inventor. He said he had been an explosives engineer in the Syrian Arab Army in the 1970s but had since become opposed to the regime. 'I did not decide to make rockets or weapons only,' he told the AFP news agency. 'I decided to fight this tyrant and unjust ruler who is raining shells... on his people, who killed our children and displaced our women. Needs must: Arms-maker Abu al-Fadhel showed rockets with ranges of up to several miles, which the rebels direct by referring to Google and a compass . Under pressure: Arms-maker Abu al-Fadhel said the rebels needed to make their own weapons because they lacked foreign aid . Rudimentary: Abu ad-Falhel showed off a row of improvised weapons including a hand-grenade, a portable rocket-launcher, and various rockets with explosive warheads . 'Even my son was martyred in one of the battles.' Abu al-Fadhel said the rebels needed to make their own arms because they lacked foreign aid. He said that, working with other technicians on a 'production line', he was able to produce hundreds of weapons a day. The engineer said the materials for the weapons came from local sources and the arms were despatched as far as Homs, another major conflict zone. They aren't perfect, though. In the Old City area of Aleppo, witnesses saw rebels struggling to unload a mortar powered by a car battery and fired using a Sony PlayStation controller.

"Acquitted: Doctor Terence Burley was found not guilty of all charges after a judge ruled that the evidence against him was 'contradictory, unsatisfactory and unreliable' A doctor who was cleared of sexually assaulting one of his patients has described his ordeal as a 'living nightmare'. Dr Terence Burley, 63,  of Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, had faced eight charges after a woman claimed that he abused her during regular consultations at his surgery. But he was acquitted of all counts after a judge described the evidence against him as 'contradictory, unsatisfactory and unreliable'. Judge Gareth Hawkesworth, sitting at Cambridge Crown Court, instructed a jury to deliver not guilty verdicts on the charges - five counts of indecent assault, two specimen charges of sexual assault, and one count of causing a person to engage in a sexual activity without consent. The complainant, who is now in her sixties and cannot be named for legal reasons, had claimed she was assaulted by Dr Burley while she was a patient of his between January 1996 and February 2009. Dr Burley told the Peterborough Evening Telegraph: 'It is almost impossible to put into words the enormous sense of relief that this has finally been resolved and I thank everyone who has supported me during this time. 'The justice system travels at a snail’s pace. It’s been a living nightmare for the entire family. 'My lawyer said they had never experienced such an extraordinary outpouring of support and were overwhelmed by the amount of testimonials that came flooding in, from within the city and beyond.' Ruling: A jury at Cambridge Crown Court (pictured) was directed to find Dr Burley not guilty of all charges .","Dr Terence Burley had faced eight charges at Cambridge Crown Court .

"Phrases like 'you plonker' - Del Boy's favourite insult from Only Fools and Horses - have long since passed into common usage. But new research has shown how the origins for the term - along with a variety of other modern phrases - lie in the trenches of World War One. According to new research by staff at the Oxford English Dictionary, British soldiers came up with new slang to describe trench life - which quickly filtered back into common language. And although many can now be identified, help is still needed to find out what other common expressions grew out of the Flanders mud. British soldiers in World War One, like these troops pictured during the 1916 Battle of Somme, gave us many of the expressions still used today . To mark the centenary of the start of the Great War, the Oxford English Dictionary is revising a set of words thought to have their roots in the 1914-18 conflict. According to the research, the term . 'plonker' came from soldiers describing the terrifying scream of . Howitzer shells as they approached or exploded in the trenches. And analysis of the soldiers' expressions has revealed that French troops were not only allies - they also gave us some of our most common expressions. The word ‘skive’ for example is thought to have originated during the Great War, and may have come from the French verb 'esquiver', meaning to escape or to avoid. Other words commonly used in the war include 'Blighty', meaning Britain, England or home, and ‘cushy’ meaning easy, or comfortable. But their roots originally came from further afield. 'Bilayati' was used to refer to foreigners in Urdu during the 19th century before later becoming a common way of referring to Britain. 'Kusi' which then became 'cushy' was originally an Urdu word meaning pleasure. The Germans also left their stamp on the British language. The airships which terrorised the home front gave rise to the slang ‘Zeppelins in a cloud’ for bangers and mash, which fell out of use soon after the war. Not your average airship: The German Zeppelin airship lent its name to a favourite British dish, bangers and mash, which became known as Zeppelins in a cloud . The term 'Zepps in a cloud' or 'Zepps in a fog' was used to refer to sausages and mash . And though . it was common to refer to Germans as 'Krauts' (the German word for . ‘cabbage’), the word sauerkraut itself was deemed unpatriotic by some soldiers. Instead the expression was replaced with 'liberty cabbage' - a precursor to the expression 'freedom fries', used to describe French fries in the USA during France's opposition to the Iraq war. The WW1 expression 'packet', slang for bullet has also . stood the test of time. The phrase to cop, stop or get a . packet means to be killed or wounded. You're a plonker Rodney: The famous Only Fools and Horses jibe was born in the trenches. World War One troops referred to shells falling as plonkers . The OED now wants to find out more about where World War One expressions came from. Kate Wild, the OED’s senior assistant editor is urging members of the public to come forward. She said: 'With the centenary, people are particularly interested in the history of the First World War and the language of the period. 'The war clearly had quite an impact on the vocabulary of the time. 'By studying the vocabulary we can build up a more accurate picture of what was going on in the war. 'The phrase ‘Zeppelins in a cloud’ we first saw in a dictionary of World War One slang, first published in 1925, but we are sure we will be able to find an earlier reference to it. 'People can find information in letters, diaries, newspapers and magazines and a lot of war diaries have now been digitised by the National Archives.' The OED is looking for evidence of the expressions below being used during World War One. Click here for a full list of the terms being researched by the OED. Skive: May have come from the . French verb esquiver, meaning to escape or to avoid . Pipsqueak, whizz-bang, fizz-bang, crump and plonker: Used to describe the terrifying scream of German shells as they exploded in the trenches . Zeppelins in a cloud: The airships which terrorised the troops, known as ‘Zeppelins in a cloud’, turned in to a slang expression for bangers and mash . Liberty cabbage: A translation of Krauts or sauerkraut used to the describe the German soldiers. Liberty cabbage was seen as more patriotic . Packet: To be killed or wounded. Expressions include: to cop, stop or get a packet, . Camouflage: The French word was first used in the English language in WW1, after English troops came into contact with French soldiers, staff at the OED believe. The development of . aerial warfare and accurate long-range artillery in the First World War . meant that weapons, vehicles, and troops needed to be concealed from . enemy view. Demob: . The term ‘demobilisation’, referring to the release of troops from . military service, has been in use since the 19th century, but the . abbreviated form demob seems to date from the First World War. Eyetie: An Italian soldier. During WW1 Italians were British allies. Following WW2 the term became offensive. Do you have any evidence of these expressions being used during World War One? If you do, the OED is appealing for more information. Sam Browne - An officer: The first evidence of this slang is from 1919. Sam Browne belts, designed by Samuel James Browne and originally worn by commissioned army officers, were first used in the 19th century. The belts were worn by American and British troops during WW1. From the term Sam Browne belt arose the U.S. military slang term Sam Browne meaning simply ‘a commissioned officer’. Example: 'You..went to the movies chaperoned by a Sam Browne'. Trench foot - A medical condition caused by the conditions in the trenches: . The earliest use of this expression found by the OED is 1915. It was then used again in 1917.'The so-called cases of trench pain or trench feet usually have no tissue destruction, no blebs, and not even any discolouration of the skin,' quoted in medical journal The Lancet in 1915. Conchie - Someone who refuses to serve in the armed forces. During the war, conscientious objectors were often colloquially referred to as conchies. But the OED's first written evidence of this is from 1917 in a Daily Mail article.","Research has revealed that many modern expressions originate from WW1 .

"Mo Farah won his second gold medal of the week to become the most successful athlete in European Championship history on the best ever day for British athletes at major championships. His 5,000m title was the second of five golds in one afternoon, together with two bronzes, to put Great Britain comfortably top of the medal table for only the third time in the 76-year history of this competition. There were faint echoes of Super Saturday at the Olympic Stadium with Farah storming by the long jump pit en route to glory as Greg Rutherford prepared for his fourth leap, which eventually sealed gold. The household names did their job here. VIDEO Scroll down for Mo Farah previously won 5000m gold in Moscow 2013 . Job done: Mo Farah celebrates with his familiar MoBot celebration as he crosses the line in Zurich . World No 1! Farah gave his competitors no chance with a show of dominance at the European Championships . The best: Mo Farah was joined on the podium by fellow Brit Andy Vernon, who took bronze in the 5,000m . But it was Andy Vernon, a journeyman 28-year-old from Aldershot, who got Great Britain’s 20th medal of the Championships. Vernon, built like a middleweight boxer and partly funding his athletics career by babysitting, took bronze behind Farah, breaking the previous record of 19 medals, achieved in Barcelona in 2010. Established members of the team have had curious but delightful breakthroughs this week. Jo Pavey, a 40-year-old mother of two, won her first major gold 25 years after her senior debut and Martyn Rooney, 27, finally fulfilled the promise he showed as a teenager by winning two titles here. Rooney admitted he has been driven forward by the presence of talented 19-year-old Matt Hudson-Smith, who takes one gold and one silver back from Zurich to Wolverhampton. Gold: Conrad Williams, Matthew Hudson-Smith, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney won the 4x400m title . Sprint success: James Ellington, Harry Aikines-Aryeetey, Richard Kilty and Adam Gemili celebrate 4x100m gold . Golden glory: Great Britain sprinters show off their gold medals after winning the Men's and Women's 4x100m . ‘It’s an incredible medal haul,’ said Rooney. ‘There are a lot of very talented young kids coming through and seeing that makes the older guys step up, so they have to fight for their place on the team. It’s a really cool team, too, one of my favourites to have been on.’ Other talented upstarts, such as sprinters Adam Gemili and Jodie Williams, have got their first taste of victory on the main stage, a point from which to push towards the World Championships next year and the Rio Olympics in 2016. Farah, though, remains the most likely gold-medal prospect on the world stage. He might not be at his best but, in the watery afternoon sunshine at the Letzigrund Stadium, he achieved what no athlete has before — a triple-double of Olympic, world and European 5k and 10k titles. Double medallist: Jodie Williams won silver in the 200m and then gold in the 4x100m relay out in Zurich . Taste of success: Along with his 4x100m relay gold medal, Adam Gemili also won gold in the 200m . ‘History is important to me and it feels great to make my country proud,’ said Farah. His numerous entries in the record books are indelible but it is the personal moments that will live longest in the memory. ‘My twins (Aisha and Amani) are here,’ said Farah. ‘They are almost two now and it is the first time they’ve been old enough to properly watch me race. I got a kiss off them at the end. That means a lot.’ Farah has spoken recently of feeling vulnerable on the start line. He has collapsed twice this year — once at the end of the New York half-marathon and once again after a training run in Park City, Utah, which he said reminded him of the fragility of his career. But if he was feeling nervous, his rivals appeared petrified by his presence yesterday. They knew they were up against a runner who is a class apart. The 31-year-old’s personal best of 12:53.11 is over 11 seconds quicker than next best, Jesus España of Spain. British glory: Greg Rutherford won gold in the long jump during a record medal winning day for Great Britain . In the end Farah wrapped up victory in a pedestrian 14:05.82. He has not run as slowly since 2005, at the European Under 23 Championships. Only Azerbaijani Hayle Ibrahimov took it to Farah, making a charge with 600m to go. Farah sailed past him and looked almost back to his best. ‘Next year will be interesting,’ he said, firing a thinly veiled warning shot in the direction of his East African rivals. Rutherford, meanwhile, joked he was ‘the biggest fluke going’, after taking his third major title in two years. It was a swipe at witless detractors who mock him for winning without breaking world records. Rutherford, now the reigning Olympic, Commonwealth and European champion, jumped an impressive 8.29m in the fourth round, improving on his second-round effort of 8.27m. ‘I had the luxury of four rounds and leaving it,’ said Rutherford. ‘I had a slight tightening after the fourth and thought I’d wait and see if someone could jump further.’ Nobody did and the 27-year-old celebrated by sprinting down the track draped in the Union Jack. Performance director Neil Black gave himself plenty of wriggle room before these championships, targeting a better finish than Helsinki in 2012 (seven in total, four gold) and worse than Barcelona in 2010 (19, six gold). In the end they achieved their best haul of 23, with 12 gold, five silver and six bronze. ‘Yes, these are the European Championships, not global,’ said Black. ‘But there were still some seriously impressive results and we are top of Europe. It was an incredibly special Sunday.’","Farah won his second gold of the European Championships in the 5,000m .

The ATR-72 operated by Taiwan's TransAsia Airways was carrying 58 passengers and crew when it crashed while trying to land in the Penghu island chain in the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and China . The plane was flying from the city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan. The victims included 46 Taiwanese and two French medical students who were interns in Taiwan. The crash came hours after Typhoon Matmo passed over Taiwan. About 200 airline flights at Taiwanese airports had been canceled earlier in the day due to rain and high winds. Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau had warned of heavy rains Wednesday evening even after Matmo moved west into China. 'According to what we can understand so far, this was due to weather, the influence of the typhoon,' a TransAsia representative, Phoebe Lu, told The Associated Press. She said the carrier was waiting for Taiwanese authorities to complete an investigation to get confirmation. A spokesman for Taiwan's air regulator, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, noted the bad weather but said an investigation still was under way. 'Even though there was bad weather, whether to land or not was up to the pilots. It is confirmed that before landing, the pilots circled, but the cause is yet to be determined,' the spokesman, Lee Wan-lee, told reporters.

A forensic team recovers human remains at the wreckage scene today . Family members were flying to Magong airport near the crash site to visit a morgue and identify victims, the airline said. Penghu, a scenic chain of 64 islets, is a popular tourist site about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the Taiwanese capital, Taipei. The 14-year-old plane lost contact with the tower after saying it would make a second landing attempt, according to the head of Taiwan's air regulator, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Jean Shen. Visibility as the plane approached was 1,600 meters (one mile), which met standards for landing, and two flights had landed shortly before GE222, the aviation agency said. The Central News Agency, citing the county fire department, said it appeared heavy rain reduced visibility and the pilot was forced to pull up and attempt a second landing. The plane showed no defects and there was ample visibility to land safely, said Lee, the air agency spokesman. In the village of Xixi, where the plane came down, television stations showed disaster crews picking through the remains of the aircraft cabin, demolished houses and a smashed car. The airline said it was offering the family of each victim about $6,600 and paying another $27,000 for funeral expenses. Taiwan's last major aviation disaster was also near Penghu.

"Nearly three million children in Syria are absent from the classroom as the devastating effects of the civil war take their toll on the country's education system, a new report today revealed. A fifth of schools have been bombed, damaged, transformed into shelters and military barracks, as war rages into its fourth year, Unicef said. Nearly half of Syria's school-age children have been prevented from studying, the UN children's agency said. Unicef: A new report by the UN's children's agency has revealed nearly three million Syrian children are absent from the classroom as the civil war takes its toll on youngsters, leaving them unable to go to school. This group of children are pictured today playing in the town of Azaz, near the Syrian-Turkish border . Vast change: Prior to the civil war, primary school enrollment had been almost universal for a generation, the report states. Literacy rates were more than 90 per cent and the country was investing five per cent of its annual GDP on national learning . Scarred: Hamida Lasseko, Unicef's deputy representative in Syria's capital Damascus, said: 'When one says that it is the worst place to be as a child, in Syria, for now, I would agree. Children are missing from education, they are out of school. Children have the hidden wounds, and these wounds form scars' The majority of the 2.3million Syrian . children who should be in classes remain within the country's borders . but are unable to attend school as education and health services have . collapsed. The new report, titled Under Siege: The Devastating Impact On Children Of Three Years Of Conflict In Syria, shows the wide-reaching effects of the conflict and the impact it is having on the country's youngest victims. In total, 40 per cent of all school-age children in Syria are out of school, the report said. Agency officials in Geneva said another 300,000 Syrian children are out of school in Lebanon, along with 93,000 in Jordan, 78,000 in Turkey, 26,000 in Iraq and 4,000 in Egypt. Prior to the civil war, primary school enrollment had been almost universal for a generation, the report states. Literacy rates were more than 90 per cent and the country was investing five per cent of its annual GDP on national learning. But during the course of the conflict, that investment has been all but wiped out. Many . teachers no longer turn up for work as nearly a fifth of the country's . schools have been destroyed, damaged, turned into shelters, or taken . over by armed groups and forces. 'When one says that it is the worst place to be as a child, in Syria, for now, I would agree,' said Hamida Lasseko, Unicef's deputy representative in Syria's capital Damascus. 'Children are missing from education, they are out of school. Children have the hidden wounds, and these wounds form scars.' Report: The study reveals 40 per cent of all school-age Syrian children are unable to go to school as nearly a fifth of all classrooms have been bombed and damaged or transformed into shelters or military barracks. These children are pictured in the doorway of their tent shelter, in the Bab Al Salame camp for internally displaced persons, near the border with Turkey . Support: Unicef has estimated that two million children affected by the fighting are in need of psychological support or treatment . The report states: '""I used to want to be a teacher,' Hassan, said as he tended to a fire outside his family's tent in . Lenanon's Beka'a valley. 'But where are the schools to learn or teach in . now?' 'Shaza, 15, used to live in Aleppo. She said: ""Many buildings, including schools, were attacked and burned down. Children were not allowed to walk outside freely since many snipers weres shooting every day. Security was getting worse day by day, and violence was part of our daily life.""' Unicef estimates two million children affected by the fighting are in need of psychological support or treatment. For Syrian children living in refugee camps, the chance to learn is scarce. Half of all refugee school-age youngsters are not in school. Children . fight for spaces in classes in their new home, while families struggle . to cover the cost of school books, tuition and transport. Children struggle to understand classes in languages they are not familiar with. But . many families face the hurdle of not having the correct papers to . enroll their children in schools in countries that have become their new . homes. Poor diets are also having an impact, leaving children struggling to concentrate as they battle extreme hunger. Thousands . have lost limbs, parents, teachers, schools, homes and virtually every . aspect of their childhood, according to agency officials. And . they are the ones lucky enough to be alive. More than 10,000 children . have been killed in the violence, the agency said, and 1.2 million are . now refugees living in camps and overwhelmed neighbouring communities . where clean water, food and other basic items are scarce. Overall, the number of children suffering from the civil war has more than doubled to 5.5 million in the past 12 months alone, Unicef said. Many are forced to grow up fast. One in 10 refugee child is now working, the agency estimates, while one in five Syrian girls in Jordan is forced into early marriage. The report, reveals that by the end of January this year, 37,498 Syrian children had been born as refugees. A Unicef blog states: 'Every child touched by this conflict has experienced things no child should.'Fear has become as way of life and the past three years has left too many with deep developmental and emotional scars. 'The children of Syria cannot afford . another year of conflict. The coming months are our last chance to save a . generation that will otherwise be lost. 'They need our support to . grow, learn and develop the skills that will rebuild their war-ravaged . country and restore its diverse and multicultural society.' More than six million people have been displaced within the country, meaning a third of all Syrian children are no longer living in their own homes or communities. Refugees: Syrian children attending a Unicef supported tented school at Kawergosik Refugee Camp in Iraq. But for those living in camps, it is just as hard to attend classes. Half of school-age children in refugee camps are absent from school, as parents face barriers, including securing their children places .","Unicef publishes new report Under Siege: The Devastating Impact On Children Of Three Years Of Conflict In Syria .

"A television weatherman was left unable to speak on air after he was reduced to a flood of giggles by his colleague's joke on the morning news show. Joe Crain was laughing so hard he walked off camera and crouched on the floor when newsreader Natalie Sparacio recounted the story of a Russian woman who had 69 children. When the anchor quipped, 'She's got quite the uterus,' Mr Crain dissolved into laughter and could not deliver the weather forecast. Scroll down to watch the video . Banter: Natalie Sparacio, left, and Joe Crain, right, joked about a woman with 69 children on WICS . The hilarious blunder came during the 'Sunrise This Morning' segment on WICS, the local ABC affiliate in Springfield, Illinois, around 6.30 yesterday morning. The two presenters swapped jokes and banter as Ms Sparacio was preparing to deliver a quirky historical anecdote for the benefit of early-morning viewers. She claimed that a woman living in Russia during the 17th century had given birth to 69 children - four sets of quadruplets, seven lots of triplets and 16 pairs of twins. Mr Crain compared the fertile mother to the story of the old woman who lived in a shoe, while Ms Sparacio commented, 'How is that even possible? It's crazy.' Laughter: Mr Crain was unable to present the weather forecast because he was giggling so much . When the weatherman chuckled and joked, 'Let's leave it at that,' the newsreader concluded: 'She's got quite the uterus, we'll just say that much.' As the camera then cut to a map of the state, a shriek of laughter could be heard, and Mr Crain walked on camera saying, 'I can't believe you just said that.' He tried to deliver the weather forecast, but was unable to get out more than a few phrases through his giggles. Helpless: Mr Crain was doubled over with laughter and could only stammer out a few phrases . On the floor: Eventually the weatherman was squatting on the ground as he continued laughing .

"Incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson has been drawn into a scandal surrounding a late British television presenter who is believed to have sexually abused children. Mr Thompson, who is due to start his new role next month, was director-general of Britain's public broadcaster, the BBC, when its Newsnight current affairs programme dropped an investigation into allegations against Jimmy Savile. Savile, the eccentric host of the BBC's Top Of The Pops music show, died in October last year at the age of 84. Police have since described him as one of Britain's worst sex offenders. Drawn in: Incoming New York Times chief executive Mark Thompson (left) has denied having any knowledge of a BBC programme's investigation into alleged sexual abuse by television host Jimmy Savile (right) Mr Thompson, who left the BBC after eight years last month, today said he would be happy to give evidence to British politicians investigating the scandal. He denied any knowledge of the details of Newsnight's investigation into Savile. He said he only learned about the planned documentary at a party last December when another journalist told him: 'You must be worried about the Newsnight investigation.' Mr Thompson said he did not ask for any more details, but made informal enquiries from BBC News the next day and was told that the programme had been dropped for 'journalistic reasons'. He added that he did not ask what allegations against Savile were being investigated, and only found out about them almost a year later after he had stood down from the BBC. Paedophile: Police have described the late Top Of The Pops presenter as one of Britain's worst sex offenders . 'No knowledge': Mr Thompson said that, during his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Savile (pictured) After Savile died, BBC journalists for the Newsnight programme spent six weeks investigating allegations that the presenter abused pupils at a school in Surrey, south-east England. They spoke to at least four women who claimed they had been abused or knew about abuse at the school, but the programme never aired. More allegations came to light when a rival British broadcaster, ITV, aired a programme about Savile's behaviour. British police have received a flood of claims since the ITV documentary was shown, and more than 200 alleged victims have come forward. 'Exceptionally grave': Mr Thompson denied any knowledge of the Newsnight investigation in a letter to Conservative politician Rob Wilson (pictured) It is alleged that Savile abused victims in hospitals and on BBC premises. Details of Newsnight's aborted investigation into Savile were revealed on Monday in another television documentary, Panorama, shown on the BBC. In a letter to the Conservative MP Rob Wilson, Mr Thompson described the claims about Savile as ‘exceptionally grave’ but said that the Director-General very rarely became involved in investigations before they were broadcast. He said: 'Given the many hundreds of investigations the BBC does every year, the personal involvement of the DG (Director-General) in a given investigation would inevitably be unusual and noteworthy and could therefore have a distorting or chilling effect on the journalism involved.’ The Newsnight expose was also not in a list of 'potentially sensitive programmes' drawn up as part of BBC’s editorial policy as far as he could recall, he said. Mr Thompson added that, during his time as Director-General of the BBC, he never heard any allegations or received any complaints about Savile, adding: ‘His name scarcely came up at all.’ He said he finally heard about the claims when the ITV programme was publicised last month, after he had left the BBC.. This was despite reports about the BBC's decision to drop the Newsnight investigation having previously appeared in five newspapers, including the Daily Mail.","Mr Thompson denies knowing details of investigation into Jimmy Savile .

"It was the photograph that made Helen Mirren’s hourglass figure the envy of women worldwide. And now the Oscar-winning actress has revealed her secret to looking sensational in a red bikini in your 60s. Dame Helen claims that the famous picture of her standing on a beach in Italy in 2008 was just a flattering angle. The star, who turns 69 on Saturday, has confessed to being a ‘classic yo-yo dieter’. She has always fluctuated by 10lb and is currently ‘at the top end of those 10lb and I have got to get back to the bottom end’. But rather than hit the gym, she said that it takes her just 12 minutes of exercise a day to become fit. Scroll down for video . Dame Helen Mirren, wearing a red bikini on the beach during a holiday to Italy, six years ago . She follows the Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan, which was created by a doctor in the 1950s. It is a stretching and toning regime originally designed to keep the men and women of the force fit in a quick way without gym equipment. The routine comprises five exercises for men and ten for women such as push-ups, sit-ups, running on the spot and arm circling, which work all the muscle groups. There are targets to aim for, with more exercises at a harder level to be completed within the 12 minutes once strength starts to improve. Dame Helen said she returns to the plan whenever she feels her fitness slipping. ‘I’m not very fit at all actually,’ she told this week’s Hello! magazine. ‘Just this morning I started my exercises, which I haven’t been doing for months, maybe years. I do a thing that leads me into exercise. It is the Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan; it is 12 minutes and they have charts you follow… Each day, you have to do the exercises within the 12 minutes and until you can, you can’t move up. ‘It is the exercise I have done off and on my whole life. It just very gently gets you fit. Two weeks of doing that and you think: “Yeah, I could go to the gym now”.’ Dame Helen was photographed in 2008 wearing the red bikini on a beach in Italy where she has a home with her husband Taylor Hackford. The actress says she keeps fit by following a Royal Canadian Air Force exercise plan, which was devised in the 1950s. She revealed her stay fit secrets in this week's Hello! magazine . The picture went around the world and cemented her reputation as a sex symbol at 62. But despite the shot being very flattering, Dame Helen has previously said it will ‘haunt’ her for the rest of her life. She said: ‘I don’t actually look like that and I know that that is going to haunt me forever and I’ll be forever trying to bury it unsuccessfully.’ ‘The truth is I don’t really look that good, it was just a flattering picture. I am beyond the bikini-wearing age, really. I wouldn’t normally wear one. I look like a woman in her 60s. I’ve always looked awful in a bikini, even when I was young.’ Dame Helen won her Academy Award for Best Actress for her role playing the monarch in The Queen. She learnt her trade in the theatre before going on to star as detective Jane Tennison in popular TV series Prime Suspect and in dozens of films.","Actress says she follows plan designed for the Royal Canadian Air Force .

"Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel defended the daring July 4 mission to rescue James Foley and claimed it was 'flawless', even though the special forces mission assaulted the wrong camp and failed to bring him home. Speaking at the Pentagon on Thursday, Hagel claimed the mission personally authorized by the president went exactly according to plan and categorically denied the assault was a failure of intelligence. Speaking alongside Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Defense Secretary said, 'The fact is you all know intelligence doesn’t come wrapped in a package with a bow. 'It is a mosaic of many pictures of many factors. 'The enemy always has a say in everything. The fact is, you have to work that reality in to any decision you make, but the underlying objective was to do everything we could as the president has said to rescue these hostages, knowing their lives were in danger, clearly in danger.' Scroll Down for Video . Flawless: US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (L) speaks next to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey during a press briefing at the Pentagon in Washington on Thursday . Mission: US Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel (L) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey hold a press briefing at the Pentagon in Washington on Thursday . Mission: Six weeks before a $132 ransom was sent to the family of James Foley, a special forces raid on an ISIS base named camp ISIS was launched . Six weeks after the bungled strike to . rescue Foley, 40, his captors sent his family and the US government a . $132 million ransom demand. This . was ignored and one week later the revolting video of his beheading was . released and justified by ISIS as retaliation for US air strikes . against them in Iraq. Now, . the failure to free Foley or negotiate his release has backed the . president into a corner as he deals with the threat to kill the second . hostage paraded in front of the camera on Tuesday, Steven John Sotloff. Indeed, . at the end of Tuesday's grisly video, Foley's executioner, who is . widely believed to be British, delivers an ominous threat towards the . White House. 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,' Up until very recently, ISIS had been trying to extort millions from the US in exchange for Foley, no doubt encouraged by the lucrative trade in hostages between the terror group and European countries willing to pay. FRANCE   $58.1m . QATAR AND OMAN  $20.4m . SWITZERLAND   $12.4m . SPAIN   $11m . AUSTRIA   $3.2m . The New York Times estimates that the Islamic State and al-Qaeda has siphoned off as much as $125 million from compliant European governments such as France and Germany, while the United States and Britain steadfast refuse. Four French and three Spanish hostages were released in 2014 from Al Qaeda affiliates after the two countries handed over millions reported the New York Times. However, now that American citizens are dying, and in such public and barbaric fashion, the United States is having to work out how it will free Sotloff and at least two other hostages kept in custody. The policy of non-negotiation, which the US shares with UK, now puts it increasingly at odds with many of it NATO partners. In an opinion piece for Reuters, David Rohde, who works for the news agency argues that by launching a mission and not paying the ransom contributed to Foley's death. 'The payment of ransoms and abduction of foreigners must emerge from the shadows. It must be publicly debated,' wrote Mr. Rohde, who escaped from the Taliban himself by climbing out of a window. 'American and European policy makers should be forced to answer for their actions.' According to the New York Times, ISIS has sent a list of demands to the US for prisoner swaps, including Aafia Siddiqui, an M.I.T. trained neuroscientist from Pakistan currently incarcerated in Texas. In the aftermath of Foley's death, many have asked whether swapping prisoners could be an effective manner of keeping up the policy of non-negotiation. Frightening: James Wright Foley tenses as his executioner addresses the camera who says this act of revenge is in responce to US airstrikes on Iraq . Raid on Camp Osama bin Laden: The special forces team flew in from Turkey and attacked the northern Syrian base to free James Foley . However, the offer to spare Foley's life in exchange for money and the flat out refusal to negotiate has left the White House sensitive to growing criticism of its policy in dealing with American hostages abroad, especially the Middle East. So sensitive in fact that the White House confirmed on Wednesday that they had launched a mission to save Foley, six weeks ago, but unfortunately it failed. Over the weekend of July 4, troops from 'nearly ever US military service' tried and failed to rescue James Foley from an ISIS terror base in Syria named Camp Osama bin Laden, according to new details on the attempt. An operative working inside the Islamic State said that the fruitless raid was carried out by two dozen soldiers, who launched from an airbase in Turkey and touched down on Syrian soil to make their assault on the ISIS stronghold, named after the dead al-Qaeda chief. Authorized mission: Obama delivered a statement from Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, during his vacation on Wednesday. Hours later it was revealed he authorized a mission in July to save James Foley. It failed . The mission, the first known incursion by US troops into Syria since the civil war erupted in 2012 was personally authorized by President Obama and according to McClatchy, the unsuccessful assault left five militants dead and countless others wounded. It was over Independence Day weekend that Delta Force commandos, backed-up by helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and surveillance craft began their assault from southern Turkey in the hope of freeing the kidnapped American citizen and his fellow hostages. The battle-hardened soldiers touched down in the al Ikairsha area of Raqqa province and prepared to storm the Islamic State base named after the dead al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the atrocities committed on 9/11. The ground team failed to find any trace of Foley or other hostages and was attacked by ISIS forces as they attempted to extract themselves from Syria. Watch Video Here . Dignified: Diane and John Foley talked to reporters after the death of their son, photojournalist James Foley, at the hands of ISIS . One American soldier was injured in the fierce gun battle that ensued, but American officials have so far declined to divulge how long troops spent searching or how long the battle between US forces and those of ISIS lasted for. 'The president authorized action at this time because it was the national security team’s assessment that these hostages were in danger with each passing day,' said Lisa Monaco, an assistant national security adviser. 'The US government had what we believed was sufficient intelligence.' Confirmation of the failed attempt to rescue Foley came one day after the barbaric footage of his beheading was published online to the revulsion of the world. The mission to save the journalist and others was carried out in early July but was unsuccessful because the hostages - being held by a group of British jihadists known as 'The Beatles' - could not be found. 'This operation involved air and ground components and was focused on a particular captor network within ISIL [also known as ISIS and IS],' the White House said in a statement last night. 'Unfortunately, the mission was not successful because the hostages were not present at the targeted location.' No mercy: Global Post President and CEO Philip Balboni revealed the Foley family had received a 'rage'-filled email from ISIS threatening to execute the journalist a week ago, and that the White House had been aware of the threat . It came as President Obama's conduct attracted growing criticism after he played golf immediately  after he gave a speech condemning the murder of Mr Foley. Four minutes after leaving the podium Obama teed-off and was seen laughing with friends and fist-bumping them during a five-hour round at Farm Neck Golf Course on Martha's Vineyard  - his seventh 18-holes in ten days. Meanwhile his administration was briefing on its rescue attempts this summer and said it would not release more details on the raid, but sources told the New York Times that the mission was carried out by two dozen special-ops members, who were dropped off in Syria in early July and were met with gunfire. 'While on site, it became apparent the hostages were not there,' one of the officials said. The sources wouldn't say where the raid was held, but pointed out that if it had happened in a heavily-populated area - it likely would have already made news.  They also wouldn't comment on how many hostages were believed to be held captive at the location, or their names. During the fight the ISIS forces suffered 'a good number of casualties' while only one American was slightly wounded. The American team was then able to retreat back to their helicopters and escape. The administration kept the raid a secret until now in order to 'preserve future opportunities' for another mission. Details of the mission were revealed after President Obama spoke about the execution of James Foley and promised new strikes on ISIS.","Chuck Hagel defended Delta Force mission to rescue James Foley and said it was 'flawless'

"Kai Lambe, from Hatton, Derbyshire slipped into the weir at Tutbury Mill and got into difficulty. His parents paid tribute to their 'happy, outgoing' son . A nine-year-old boy has died after slipping into a weir while playing with friends. Kai Lambe is thought to have drowned after he fell into the river Dove in Tutbury, Staffordshire, on Friday evening. The youngster was pulled from the water by firefighters - but died later in hospital. It is believed his horrified pals witnessed the incident, and raised the alarm. Kai's devastated family was being supported by specially trained police officers. In a statement they said: 'Kai was a happy, outgoing and lovely little boy. We are heartbroken and devastated at the loss of our vibrant, happy, bubbly little man, Kai Joseph, 'ginge' to all who knew him. 'He was our ray of sunshine who brightened up the darkest day. We, as a family, are overwhelmed with the support of everyone in the close-knit village of Hatton and from people afar. 'He was always out and about, whether it was fishing, taking his beloved dogs for a walk with his dad or just in the village. He would smile and put his thumb up to everyone.' 'He was a much-loved son of Dawn and Ali, little brother of Ellie-May and Tom, grandson, uncle, nephew, cousin and loved by many. RIP wee man.' Staffordshire Police have now launched an investigation to work out exactly what happened, but Kai's death is not being treated as suspicious. It is believed he was playing with a group of other children at the weir, around half a mile from his home in Hatton, Derbyshire, at 6.15pm when he fell into the river. Bunches of flowers were left at the scene of the tragedy, and tributes have also been paid online to Kai, where a fund has been set up to raise money for a memorial. Leanna Turner wrote: 'Such a special boy that has touched the community, RIP little man, you will be missed.' Chloe Springall said: 'My thoughts are with his family and friends, He deserves something special from all of us! Sweet dreams Kai.' And Lisa Cook posted: 'RIP Kai. Such a lovely boy taken too soon.' On Facebook, the community group Hatton through the years posted: 'Hatton is such a close community and today it mourns the death of a beautiful little boy who was tragically taken away from us. Kai Lambe, pictured here with his mother Dawn, was playing with a group of other children at the weir, around half a mile from his home in Hatton, Derbyshire, at 6.15pm when he fell into the river . 'I know this will have an effect on everyone in the village. He was such a little character. I'm sure everyone will join me in sending our thoughts and prayers to his family at this very sad time, I can't even begin to think how they are feeling. He was taken away from them far too young.' A spokesman for Staffs Police said: 'He was rescued from the water by colleagues from the fire service and taken to Queen's Hospital in Burton where he sadly died. 'His death is not being treated as suspicious and a report will be prepared for HM Coroner. 'Specially trained officers are now supporting the boy's family and friends at this very difficult time.

"These huge paintings are the work of a secretive graffiti artist who travels the world tagging walls, often painting his quirky pieces in a hurry to avoid arrest. Chinese-born DALeast lives in South Africa but spends six months of the year travelling and has tagged walls on nearly every continent. His unusual paintings, which are sometimes hundreds of feet across, can look 3D and as if they are created out of thousands of tiny metal shards, but in fact they have been spray-painted onto a flat surface. Original style: This mural of two big cats fighting was painted by secretive Chinese-born graffiti artist DALeast in Hanbury Street, near London's Brick Lane . Astonishingly lifelike: This beautiful mural on a wall in the artist's home city Cape Town, South Africa, looks like slowed-down footage of the animal leaping . DALeast's works can be seen in Cape Town, Miami, New York and London's Brick Lane, as well as his native China. The 29-year-old, who keeps his real name a secret, has been making art since he was three. He said: 'I worked on everything when I was in China - painting, sculpture, installations, synchronising performance, and digital art, but I only started painting in public spaces in 2004.' DALeast, who now lives with his wife, also an artist, in Cape Town, said he creates his pieces 'Spiritually, in the mind' before embarking on his painting trips. Much of his work portrays wild animals hunting prey, often showing them in motion. The nature of the artist's work has landed him in trouble before, most notably just before the 2008 Beijing Olympics when police raided a house he was staying in and arrested him and his graffiti crew. Ambitious art: This enormous mural of a flying bird in Honolulu, Hawaii, is one of the dramatic works by DALeast on walls across the world . This breathtaking image of a dolphin leaping out of the water is painted on a building in Melun, in the south-eastern suburbs of Paris . He said: 'Life always give one troubles but my work gives me a lot of opportunity to face these troubles.  Any situation can arise when you work in the public space. 'But I hope I am creating illusions through my paintings that can be a switch for people's minds.' He added: 'I like to express life-emotions and the environment, and use different artistic forms to speak.  I prefer people staring at my work without saying any words - it means they are taking it in.' This detailed mural showing a string of camels in the desert was painted on a wall of a parking lot in Miami, Florida, by Chinese-born graffiti artist DALEast . Astonishingly lifelike: This huge painting of a horse painted on some chipboard walls in Tin Town, South Africa, looks like a model from a fairground carousel . Imperious: This magnificent picture of a stag takes up most of a wall in Vienna, Austria - the graffiti artist has tagged walls on most continents . This mural of a lion looking at another beast is painted on the wall of a boutique in New York City, another destination for the globe-trotting DALeast . Change of subject: This mural in Miami, Florida, depicts a car splintering into tiny pieces as it crashes into a pipe on the outside of the building . Using buildings and walls as his canvases, the graffiti artist can paint pictures of astonishing breadth, as with this eagle mural in Cape Town, South Africa . Violent image: This work of art, entitled Eclipse Of The Halo, has been spray-painted on a wall in Miami, Florida, and shows the artist's DALeast tag . This enormous image of a whale by the graffiti artist takes up nearly the entire wall of a storage warehouse in Rochester, New York City . An undated image painted onto the end of a building in the artist's home town of Cape Town, South Africa, depicts a magnificent bird of prey . This image of a slithering serpent in Rochester, New York City, is one of the artist's longest works, painted underneath a bridge - below is the work in its entirety . This invigorating portrait of a big cat pouncing is painted on the wall of a house in Brick Lane in London's East End - another work showing animals splintering in two . In a departure from his normal style, the artist painted an astronaut planting a flat on the moon on the wall of this abandoned and overgrown building in Paris . Fast as a cheetah: A wild cat speeding away on what look like bicycle tyres has been painted onto the side of a building in Johannesburg, South Africa .

"Neil Lennon is a leading contender for the Cardiff City managerial vacancy after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's eight-month reign was brought to an end on Thursday and three potential candidates ruled themselves out. A source close to the former Celtic manager, who is currently without a job, told Sportsmail that Lennon is keen to discuss the position, with the Welsh club looking to make a quick appointment in the wake of Solskjaer's departure. A senior club source confirmed Lennon is under consideration. Lennon is known to have admirers at Cardiff, who have handed caretaker control to player-coach Danny Gabbidon and academy coach Scott Young for this weekend's trip to Derby. Former Celtic manager Neil Lennon votes on Scottish indepence referendum in Glasgow on Thursday . Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has left Cardiff City  after a disappointing spell that lasted just eight months . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan instructed chairman Mehmet Dalman to hold exit talks with the Norwegian . Vincent Tan has already been informed by Dundee that Paul Hartley is keen to stay in Scotland, while Tony Pulis would prefer to take his next job in the Premier League and Craig Bellamy said he would not be ready for management another two years. Bellamy also revealed on BT Sport 2 that he turned down the chance to manage Cardiff after Malky Mackay was sacked last year. He said: 'I had the opportunity at Christmas to do it - when Malky left they offered it to me then. I didn’t really give them the chance to get into a conversation. 'I’m not right for the club at this present moment. They need to go a different direction and the club’s not right for me at this present moment.' Cardiff want to appoint Dundee manager Paul Hartley as the new boss, but the Scottish club are resisting . Solskjaer's team lost 1-0 to Middlesbrough on Tuesday night as their poor run of form continued . It was ultimately Cardiff's lowly position of 17th in the Championship that caused Solskjaer's exit, though the 41-year-old claimed 'differences (with Tan) in philosophy on how to manage' was decisive in him leaving, albeit on amicable terms. Solskjaer said: 'He (Vincent) has my full respect and I really wish him all the best in his pursuit of making this football club successful. 'However, our difference in philosophy on how to manage the club made me decide to step aside and allow the club to move forward in the direction Vincent wants.' Cardiff are also interested in  Tony Pulis but the Welshman wants a job with a Premier League club . There are some at the club who are keen on giving the manager's job to former player Craig Bellamy . Solskjaer (right) applauds the fans as the Welsh club are relegated from the Premier League at Newcastle . Tan said: 'Ole was hired by Cardiff City on our understanding and belief that he would help us fight relegation from the Barclays Premier League. Unfortunately that did not happen. 'After the club was relegated many people advised me to let him go, but I decided to keep Ole on for the Championship season. Regrettably our recent results do not justify Ole’s continued role as manager at Cardiff. 'Ole has therefore decided to step down and I have accepted this. During my short association with Ole, I have found him to be an honest and hard-working professional, but unfortunately the football results were not in his favour.' This weekend's trip to Derby will be overseen by player-coach Danny Gabbidon and academy coach Scott Young.

"Readmitted: Dr Rick Sacra, who contracted the deadly virus while working in Liberia has returned to hospital suffering from persistant cough and chest pains . An American Ebola patient who was rushed back to the hospital with a persistent cough and fever did not relapse, doctors said today. Dr Rick Sacra, 51, the third U.S. citizen diagnosed with the deadly disease, appears to have an upper respiratory infection and is recovering. Dr Sacra was rushed to UMass Memorial Medical Center on Saturday - two weeks after he was cleared of the disease. He contracted Ebola while working in Liberia and was flown to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for treatment last month. Dr Robert Finberg, the infectious disease expert leading Dr Sacra's medical team, said results of an Ebola test will not be back until Monday. However, Dr Finberg said he doesn't believe Dr Sacra's recent health problems are a relapse of the deadly virus. Dr Sacra is eating and his condition improved today. 'People who have Ebola don’t feel like eating they feel like throwing up. The fact that he’s eating and he feels pretty good, I think is a very good sign,' Dr Finberg said at a press conference today. At the end of September, following his release from hospital, Dr Sacra told reporters he wanted to return to the disease-ravaged areas to help fight the outbreak. He had fallen ill while working at a hospital in Liberia, where doctors have been fighting a historic outbreak of the deadly virus. 'The odds of my ending up back there are pretty high. I don't have any specific plans, but that's where my heart is. 'It's heartbreaking for me to see Liberians suffering from Ebola and other diseases right now.' Facility: Doctors at UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcestor, Massachusetts, are conducting tests to make sure the deadly disease hasn't returned, but have claimed it is not a relapse . The world is currently experiencing its worst outbreak of Ebola in history, with the disease killing nearly 3,000 people in West Africa during the past six months. Medical experts estimate some 20,000 cases could be reported by November. 'Though my fight with Ebola is finished, unfortunately it appears that West Africa's fight with Ebola is continuing to increase in intensity and severity,' Sacra said. Dr Sacra was the third patient in the US to be treated for Ebola. He returned to his home in Massachusetts on September 24 following three weeks of treatment. He was kept in the special isolation unit, where he received an experimental Tekmira Pharmaceuticals drug called TKM-Ebola for a week.

"Giant transparent screens such as those used by Tony Stark in the hit film Iron Man could soon become a reality, researchers have claimed. They say the smart glass breakthrough could even make your phone more intelligent - building health monitoring sensors directly into the glass. They say the breakthrough already works with Gorilla Glass, found in the majority of smartphones, and could be implemented into handsets within a year. The breakthrough will allow transparent screens such as the one used by Tony Stark in the hit film Iron Man to become a reality. To make their see-through temperature-sensing and phone-authentication systems, the researchers turned to photonics. While electronic devices transmit information via electrons, photonic devices use light. The researchers used lasers to carve out transparent pathways called waveguides into the glass. These waveguides act as tunnels that channel light, analogous to the way electronic wires convey electrical signals, and form the basis for a host of applications. The technology developed by researchers from Montreal and the New York-based company Corning Incorporated has led to the first laser-written light-guiding systems that are efficient enough to be developed for commercial use. This revolutionary work could open up new real estate in the phone by embedding the glass with layer upon layer of sensors, including ones that could take your temperature, assess your blood sugar levels if you're diabetic or even analyze DNA. The researchers have already used their new technology to build two completely transparent systems -a temperature sensor and a new system for authenticating a smartphone using infrared light - into a type of glass that's currently used in most smartphones. In addition to biomedical sensors, the technology could also eventually allow computing devices to be embedded into any glass surface, such as windows or tabletops, creating the transparent touchscreens seen in movies like Avatar and Iron Man, the researchers say. 'We're opening the Pandora's box at the moment,' says paper co-author Raman Kashyap, a professor of electrical engineering and engineering physics at Polytechnique Montreal in Canada. Now that the technique is viable, 'it's up to people to invent new uses' for it, he says. An invisible waveguide (pathway for light) being written via laser into a smartphone's display glass is shown. The waveguide is a horizontal line from the left side of the screen . They describe their work in a paper published today in The Optical Society's (OSA) open-access journal, Optics Express. Although people have used lasers to make photonic waveguides before, this is the first time anyone has applied the technique to Gorilla Glass, a tough glass with high internal stress and low irregularity, developed by Corning that's now used in billions of electronic devices. According to first author Jerome Lapointe of Polytechnique Montreal, this new photonic waveguide is the best that's ever been made using lasers. While no waveguide is perfect—light will inevitably leak out due to imperfections—the new waveguides created by the team are 10 times better at minimizing such loss than previous ones made with lasers, he says. 'We are actively looking to partner with industry to exploit this technology,' Kashyap says. With focused development, he adds, the two systems could potentially be integrated commercially into smartphones within a year. To demonstrate their technique, the researchers built a standard type of temperature sensor that consists of a straight and a curved waveguide. When the glass heats up, it expands and changes the path length of the waveguides. By measuring how the light that emerges from one waveguide interferes with light from the other, the device can measure temperature – yours or that of anything it touches. The waveguide is a horizontal line from the left side of the screen. By measuring how the light that emerges from one waveguide interferes with light from the other, the device can measure temperature ¿ yours or that of anything it touches. The researchers also developed a new method for authenticating a smartphone based on waveguides with holes at various locations. The light that escapes through those holes creates a pattern that is unique to their arrangement. The idea is that each phone would have its own unique pattern, like a fingerprint, which could then be read by an infrared detector to confirm the identity of the phone as an additional layer of security for making financial transactions using smartphones. Such transactions could be relatively safe because instead of using radio frequency they use infrared light, which is blocked by most materials and therefore cannot be copied through a pocket or purse. Both the temperature sensor and authentication system are being patented and the team is hoping to optimize them for use in consumer devices. And because Gorilla Glass has greater internal stress and less irregularities than other types of glass, the waveguides are smoother and better at preventing light from escaping. This also means the researchers can use lower energy ultra-short laser pulses at a high repetition rate, which results in smoother and more efficient waveguides. Current techniques such as photolithography—which uses light-sensitive chemicals to etch or deposit material—are very good at minimizing light loss, but the team's laser method is cheaper and simpler, Lapointe says. Also, photolithography restricts waveguides to the surface of the glass. But using lasers enables researchers to make waveguides at any depth, allowing them to create many applications, one on top of each other, like layers in a cake. Layering the waveguides within the glass itself paves the way for more compact devices, which means you could squeeze more apps into your phone.","Breakthrough allows sensors to be etched directly on glass .

"Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s tepid endorsement this week of President Barack Obama’s decision to swap five Guantanamo Bay detainees for an American soldier held hostage by terrorists is raising red flags among parties familiar with her position on the issue when she was in the president’s cabinet. Asked Monday about the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Clinton refused to levy criticism at her former boss for trading terrorists for the soldier, who professed unpatriotic views of his country and willing left his post on the night the Taliban captured him. ‘This young man, whatever the circumstances, was an American citizen – is an American citizen, was serving in our military,’ Clinton told her audience during a lecture in Broomfield, Colorado. ‘I don't believe in second guessing people who have to make these hard choices,’ she said of the ‘tough’ decision Obama made. The former Obama administration official may be second-guessing her own choices, however. Her support for Bergdahl's freedom conflicts with descriptions of her perspective three years ago. Change of heart: Secretary of States Hillary Clinton lobbied the White House against trading five Taliban leaders for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, but potential presidential candidate Hillary Clinton now refuses to criticize the Obama White House's deal . Sent home: Video released by the Taliban and obtained from the 'Voice of Jihad' website shows Bergdahl prepared to be handed over to U.S. Special Forces on Saturday . In a 2012 Rolling Stone article, journalist Michael Hastings described Clinton as being 'very wary about making a swap for Bowe.' Hastings, now deceased, insinuated that Clinton and then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta didn't want to make the trade because they didn't want the U.S.'s counter-insurgency strategy, the Afghanistan troop surge, to be viewed as unsuccessful. 'Panetta and Hillary don't give a s*** about getting him home,' a senior U.S. official with knowledge of the negotiations reportedly told Hastings. 'They want to be able to say they COINed their way out of Afghanistan, or whatever, so it doesn't look like they are cutting and running.' A Clinton spokesman did not return MailOnline's request on Tuesday to confirm Hastings’ characterization of the former secretary of state’s previous views on Bergdahl’s release, and a follow-up question asking what had changed Clinton’s thinking. Since then, three former administration officials familiar with Clinton’s position on the issue when she worked at the State Department told The Daily Beast that Clinton was in fact ‘wary’ of making a deal, and that her unwillingness to make the trade stemmed from distrust of the Taliban or Bergdahl’s captors, the Haqqani network in Pakistan. ‘She was heavily involved from the beginning, she was very skeptical of the arrangement, she was very wary of it,’ one official said. ‘If we had come to some agreement she perhaps would have backed it, but we never got to that point.’ ‘She was felt that the Haqqani network were really bad guys,’ Democratic Congressman Jim Moran said. ‘She was reluctant to enter into negotiations with them.’ Three intelligence officials also confirmed to the Daily Beast that then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta was also against the deal, as was Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who still serves in the administration. If Clinton had her way, they said, the U.S. would have released three of the detainees as a show of good faith, and released the other two prisoners 60 days later. At that point Bergdahl would have been released as well. It begins: Clinton has attracted controversy since her days as first lady, but with a likely presidential run in her future conservatives are ramping up the pressure; this pair demonstrated against her outside a Broomfield, Colorado speaking engagement on June 2 . Clinton’s plan would have also required the Qatari government to surveil the released Taliban fighters, and the prisoners wouldn’t have been allowed to travel out of Qatar ‘until there was peace,’ The Daily Beast reported. ‘Break ties with al Qaida, renounce violence, and abide by the Afghan constitution, and you can rejoin Afghan society,’ Clinton told the Taliban in 2011. ‘Refuse and you will continue to face the consequences of being tied to al Qaida as an enemy of the international community.’ The plan that president Obama ultimately went with only slaps the released Taliban fighters with a one-year travel ban. Other details of the deal are being kept secret. ‘The talks evolved. The fact that we are going to be pulling out of Afghanistan shortly meant that the likelihood of retrieving Bergdahl was diminishing,’ Rep. Moran said. ‘And once the war in Afghanistan is over, some will argue that we no longer have a legal right to detain the Taliban.’ Moran, now in his twelfth term in Congress, is retiring at the end of this year, and has less to lose from sharing sacred details of the Obama administration’s talks with the Taliban than many of his colleagues, who may have to work with Clinton, a presumed 2016 candidate and frontrunner, again some day. Bowe Bergdahl (R, with pipe) was photographed in Afghanistan a month after he walked away from his post and into the arms of the Taliban; the White House traded away what one senator called 'the Taliban dream team' to get him back . Clinton’s . comments on Monday about the delicateness of negotiations do not . directly contradict with her past sentiments, as described by others. ‘You . don’t want to see these five prisoners go back to combat. There’s a lot . that you don’t want to have happen. On the other hand you also don’t . want an American citizen, if you can avoid it, especially a solider, to . die in captivity,’ Clinton said. Selective memory: Clinton dished to People magazine this week about her aspirations, her health and her marriage, but didn't touch on the history of how Bergdahl's release was negotiated . ‘I think we have a long way to go before we really know how this is going to play out.’ But Clinton did not come out and disparage the plan, which she was reportedly against as secretary of state, either. Clinton may have decided not to vocalize her disappointment with the deal after secretly meeting with president Obama late last week. Lawmakers believe its possible that Obama discussed his already announced decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan with Clinton, as well has the Bergdahl deal, as the meet-up came just two days before Bergdahl was officially released by the Taliban. ‘It would be 'fair game' to ask Clinton if she did indeed know about the trade before it took place, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told The Hill. ‘“Did she know about this, what does she think about it, does she agree with the decision to withdraw troops in 2016?”’ ‘These are all really good questions potential candidates for president need to answer,’ he said. 'This has ramifications long term for the U.S., this prisoner swap.’ 'If Mrs. Clinton remains politically active, people will want to know what her advice was on the subject,' Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said. If Obama did tell Clinton, 'it would be outrageous that he notified someone who's outside government before he would even notify members of Congress,’ Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told MailOnline. Neither Obama’s nor Clinton’s camps will give out details on the meet-up other than to say Obama and Clinton had an 'informal' lunch at the White House.","On Monday former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tepidly endorsed President Barack Obama's decision to trade five terrorists for an American solider being held hostage by the Taliban .
Asked about the deal that secured Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl's freedom, Clinton declined to 'second-guess' the president's 'tough' decision .

"Monarch Airlines has agreed a rescue deal which will see an investment firm pumping more than £100 million into the company, but also involves pay cuts of up to 30 per cent for staff and hundreds of redundancies. The company, whose headquarters are in Luton, Bedfordshire, said it had secured £125 million of permanent capital and liquidity facilities from Greybull Capital, anchored by a £50 million capital commitment. Greybull acquired 90 per cent ownership interest in the company, with the remaining 10 per cent passing to Monarch's defined pension scheme and ultimately the Pension Protection Fund. Monarch Airlines has been saved after a £125m deal was agreed for the sale to Greybull Capital . The Civil Aviation Authority has renewed Monarch's ATOL licence. Under the new arrangements, the fleet will be 'optimised' from 42 aircraft to 34, and long-haul and charter flying will end by April. The network will specialise in Monarch's 'heartland' of scheduled short-haul European leisure routes. Staff have agreed reductions in pay of up to 30 per cent, with more than 90 per cent of unionised staff voting to accept changes, and 700 redundancies, two-thirds of which were voluntary. Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said: 'I am delighted to welcome the Greybull team as the new owners of the Monarch Group. We have a shared vision for the strategic direction and prospects for the business, and I am looking forward to working with them to implement the exciting plans for building our future.' Speaking on behalf of the selling shareholders, Fabio Mantegazza said: 'We are very proud to have created one of the most loved aviation brands in the UK over the last 46 years. We think that now is an appropriate time to allow new shareholders to take Monarch into the future with secure financial backing and clear strategic goals, and we wish the group every success.' Staff have been praised, many of whom have accepted a 30% pay cut (File photo) Jim McAuslan, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), said: 'Monarch's continuing presence in the marketplace is good for customers so this new investment is welcome. We have met with the new owners and look forward to working with them to secure quality jobs in a strong and growing company. 'The investment is in no small part due to the painful sacrifices made by pilots and other staff, who have accepted redundancies and a substantial cut in pay and conditions to help secure jobs. 'And the announcement comes with a further sting in the tail with the proposed entry of the pension scheme into the Pension Protection Fund. This will mean more pain with many innocent scheme members losing a significant amount of their pensions. Balpa will leave no stone unturned in securing justice for those affected, including pressing the Government to change the pension cap rules which unfairly hurt honest savers.'","Company  sold to Greybull Capital after deal agreed with shareholders .

"When Ashlee Hammac's newborn son died just five days after being welcomed in the world, she decided to pay a special tribute to baby Ryan - by building a sandbox on his grave so that his older brother could come and spend time with him. Last week, the 24-year-old mother from Lake City, Florida, shared a touching and heart-breaking photo on the Facebook page Sawyer's Heart depicting her 3-year-old son, Tucker, playing with toy cars in the blue sand by his brother's headstone. Over the past week, the image has gone viral, drawing more than 173,000 'likes' and just shy of 50,000 'shares.' Scroll down for video . Viral tribute: Photos of Ashelee Hammac's 3-year-old son, Tucker, playing with toy trucks in a sandbox set up on top of his brother's grave became an Internet sensation, drawing tens of thousands of 'shares' Initially, Hammac, 24, planned to place glass pebbles on baby Ryan's tombstone, but ultimately she decided to create something that her son could relate to as well . Hallowed playground: Tucker, age 3, loves playing with trucks and often asks his mother to take him to his brother's sandbox at the cemetery . Hammac's younger son, Ryan Michael Jolley, was born October 11, 2013, and passed away October 16 from Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephlopathy: a condition that occurs when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain. Following baby Ryan's funeral, Miss Hammac decided to adorn his burial place with glass pebbles, but thinking of her son Tucker and his grieving process, she decided to come up with the kind of tribute that he could relate to as well. Together, the mother and son embraced the idea of turning the newborn’s black-granite gravesite into a play area filled with sand. ‘He always goes out there with me, and sits out there, and sings lullabies, and talks to him just like he was there,' Miss Hammac told People Magazine. 'So I wanted it to be special for him too. His favorite thing right now is trucks.’ Too young: Ryan Michael Jolley was born October 11, 2013, prematurely and died only five days later after being deprived of oxygen for several hours . Precious memories: As the infant lay in the neonatal ICU, fading each day, Hammac held him and read book to him . The Florida mom said 3-year-old Tucker often asks her if he can go to 'baby Ryan's sandbox.' In the months since Ran passing, Miss Hammac and her family have launched a non-profit organization called Pages to Memories to help raise awareness of her son's condition. As little Ryan, who was delivered prematurely, slowly faded in the intensive care unit last fall, Hammac was able to share a few precious moments with him by reading him books. Now, her organization donates books and blankets to hospitals so that other parents could bond with their newborn children. Ashlee Hammac went into an early labor on the morning of October 11 after experiencing a severe migraine. During the delivery, her placenta burst, depriving Ryan of oxygen for several hours. Once the tiny infant was hooked up to tubes and wires in the neonatal ICU, doctors said he only had 1 in 8 chances of survival. Life after death: Hammac, pictured with her son Tucker and her boyfriend, has founded a non-profit organization that donates books and blankets to children in neonatal care . After a five-day struggle between life and death, an MRI test showed that the child’s brain showed no activity. Even though he was alive for less than a week, the infant's death was not in vain, as his healthy little heart was donated to another ailing baby. Ashlee Hammac said she hopes one day to meet the mother of the child in whose chest Ryan’s heart continues to beat.","Ashlee Hammac, 24, gave birth to son Ryan Michael Jolley October 11, 2013, but he passed away five days later .

"Officials in Florida released Thursday a surveillance video showing Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston shoplifting crab legs from a Tallahassee supermarket. The silent clip recorded inside a Publix grocery store April 29 shows the Florida State University star football player sauntering into the supermarket dressed in shorts and sandals, and heading to the back. Winston, 20, could be seen picking up a $32.72 order of crab legs and craw fish served on a trey wrapped in plastic from the seafood counter. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Officials in Florida released this surveillance video showing FSU quarterback Jameis Winston, 20, leaving a Publix supermarket without paying for an order of crab legs and crawfish . Watchful eye: Winston dressed in black is seen picking up a $32.72 order of seafood from a counter (left) and then heading to the dairy section for butter . He then stops by the dairy section to pick up a pack of butter and heads out the door after allegedly waiting for an off-duty sheriff's deputy to pass. Winston told deputies he walked out and forgot to pay for 3lbs worth of Old Bay seasoned steamed crab legs and a pound of Cajun seasoned crawfish. But he said he didn't take the butter. He said he decided on the way out of the store that he didn't need it and placed it in a sale bin instead of returning it to the dairy cooler. Leon County Sheriff's Deputy Michael Crego who reviewed the security video wrote in a report released last week that the quarterback and FSU baseball closer appeared to hang back at the exit to avoid walking in front of a law enforcement official. Evasion tactic: Officials say Winston paused at the exit to avoid being seen by this off-duty sheriff's deputy . Getaway: The 20-year-old college football star marched out of the store without paying for his food - but he later told police he simply forgot . Local news, weather, sports Savannah | WSAV On Your Side . ‘Mr. Winston paused visibly near a series of sale bins and allowed Deputy Graves to pass in front of him. The pause appeared to be an attempt to avoid walking in front of Deputy Graves,’ Crego wrote . ‘Mr. Winston then walked behind Deputy Graves, passed all points of sale, and exited the store without paying for the merchandise.’ The report goes on to state that deputies were unable to determine whether Winston took the butter or placed it in the sale bin. Winston signed a civil citation admitting he committed petit theft and was suspended from FSU's baseball team for three games until he completed 20 hours of community service. ‘Mr. Winston apologized repeatedly and stated he wanted to “make it right,""’ Crego wrote. The 20-year-old Alabama native has also released an apology. 'I went to the supermarket with the intent to purchase dinner but made a terrible mistake for which I'm taking full responsibility,' Winston said in a statement April 30 after news of his misdeed--and punishment--had quickly spread. Hungry? Quarterback Jameis Winston #5 of the Florida State Seminoles pictured here after the 2014 Rose Bowl victory over Auburn, is likely not currently celebrating after news broke Wednesday of a criminal citation he received Tuesday for allegedly shoplifting crab legs from a Florida grocery store . 'In a . moment of youthful ignorance, I walked out of the store without paying . for one of my items,' continued the youngest ever Heisman winner. 'I . realize that I am in the public spotlight and my conduct needs to be . above reproach.' Officials pointed out that the college student made no attempt to contact the supermarket and alert someone at Publix to his mistake. Winston has had . previous run-ins with the law, including a 2013 investigation over an . alleged rape for which he was never charged. 'Over the last year I've learned that my accomplishments on the fields can be a wonderful thing for my school, teammates, friends, and family,' the athlete's statement said. 'At the same time, I must realize that my mistakes are magnified and can bring great embarrassment to all those who support me every day.' Winston was not arrested. Unless he fails to show up to community service, his record will remain clean. 'He got an adult civil citation,' a police source told Tomahawk Nation of the arrest alternative usually reserved for juveniles. 'If he completes the sanctions it will never show up on his record,' said the source. 'They are now doing it for minor misdemeanors for adults to lower crime rate.' The source also revealed the quarterback will be fined $30. No arrests: The current Heisman trophy holder also has an impressive record pitching for his school's baseball team, but he has a history of near misses with the law outside the alleged seafood incident . The incident allegedly occurred at a Publix, a staple in Florida grocery stores . According . to the SB Nation report, Winston was once investigated by police after a . Burger King employee accused him of stealing soda using a ketchup cup. He also faced police questioning for an alleged involvement in a long-running BB gun battle, SB Nation reports. News of Winston's wrongdoings come just weeks after the NCAA changed its rules to allow colleges to offer their athletes as much free food as they want. There was previously a cap placed at three free meals per day. The announced rule change came after Connecticut basketball guard Shabazz Napier's announcement during the Final Four in which he complained of players 'starving.' Hungry: UConn guard Shabazz Napier complained early in April that he often goes to bed hungry because he can't afford food. Days later, the NCAA announced a lifting of restrictions on free food provided to college athletes . It was unclear if Winston was able to take advantage of the rule at the time of his encounter with authorities. Winston is the nation's top-rated passer . and has led the top-ranked Seminoles (13-0) to a spot in the BCS . championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. The . former five-star recruit from Bessemer, Alabama, made college football . look easy from his very first game. On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston went 25 for 27 for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh. 'I . can't explain how truly intelligent he is,' Florida State coach Jimbo . Fisher said. 'He always wanted to know why he had success or why he had . failure so he could either repeat it or fix it.' There . wasn't much failure on the way to becoming the third Seminoles . quarterback to win the Heisman. The last was Chris Weinke in 2000. Winston and . Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke . of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the . Tallahassee Police Department last December. The . dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full . investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of . rape. Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual.

"Ed Miliband was facing a  ferocious Labour backlash last night following a botched attempt to cosy up to Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper. The Labour leader, who boasted of standing up to Mr Murdoch during the phone hacking scandal, attempted to mend fences in the run-up to the next election by posing with a World Cup souvenir edition of the tabloid. But the picture provoked anger among Labour activists, particularly in Liverpool, where the newspaper is boycotted due to its coverage of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. Backlash: Ed Miliband faced fierce criticism in Liverpool for his Sun stunt . Mr Miliband was forced to issue a humiliating apology yesterday, saying he was ‘very, very sorry’ for causing offence. The apology came on a torrid day for the Labour leader on which he was attacked from all sides of the party over his ‘disastrous’ immigration policy and ‘divisive’ slogans, and a close aide warned that Labour was struggling for credibility. His latest problems began when he was pictured holding a special edition of The Sun that was sent to millions of homes free to mark the start of the World Cup . Despite his apology, the storm showed no sign of dying down last night, with one Labour councillor in Liverpool quitting the party and local MPs warning Mr Miliband he was wrong to have even considered the stunt. Liverpool councillor Martin Cummins . David Cameron and Nick Clegg posed for similar pictures and also faced criticism, but the most hostile response was reserved for Mr Miliband, who was accused of betrayal. Liverpool councillor Martin Cummins quit the party, saying: ‘Seeing Ed promoting The Sun has rocked me to my core.’ The city’s Labour mayor, Joe Anderson, said: ‘For the leader of the Labour Party to make such an offensive gesture insults not only me but every person in the city. ‘This is just another example of how out of touch the politicians in their ivory towers are from the lives of ordinary people.’ Liverpool Walton MP Steve Rotheram said he welcomed the apology but that Mr Miliband should not have allowed himself to be pictured with the newspaper in the first place. Even members of Labour’s front bench team were critical. Shadow health minister Luciana Berger welcomed his apology, but her notably unsympathetic statement read: ‘When asked to pose for a picture to support the England football team at the World Cup, Mr Miliband agreed. He has today apologised.’ Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan admitted that Labour was struggling to persuade voters its policies are ¿credible' in a frank interview . In a statement yesterday, a Labour spokesman insisted that Mr Miliband had not meant to cause offence. ‘Ed Miliband was promoting England’s bid to win the World Cup and is proud to do so,’ a spokesman said. ‘But he understands the anger that is felt towards The Sun over Hillsborough by many people and he is sorry to those who feel offended.’ The apology capped a dismal day for the party leader. His new slogan ‘Hardworking Britain Better Off’ was condemned as ‘divisive’ at a meeting of Labour’s ruling national Executive Committee (NEC). NEC member Ann Black said a poll she conducted of more than 200 party members found that 98 per cent ‘hated’ it because it appeared to criticise the unemployed. She said activists described the slogan as ‘divisive, meaningless’ and ‘sounding like a Tory slogan’. On immigration, senior Labour MP John Mann said that the ‘metropolitan elite’ had no idea about its impact on the lives of ordinary people. He accused Miliband and other members of the leadership of living ‘different lives to the voters whose support they need’. He said the Labour leadership was ‘reluctant to recognise the downsides’ of mass immigration. The MP for Bassetlaw, in Nottinghamshire, insisted he was not a ‘plotter’ seeking to dislodge Mr Miliband. But he said the leader’s ‘hands-off’ approach to dealing with the threat posed by Ukip in last month’s elections was ‘an unmitigated disaster’.

In a further blow, one of Mr Miliband’s closest allies warned that voters ‘just don’t believe what we say’. In a frank interview, Shadow Justice Secretary Sadiq Khan admitted that Labour was struggling to persuade voters its policies are ‘credible’. ‘The public just don’t believe what we say,’ Mr Khan, a close friend of the Labour leader, told the Huffington Post website. ‘The challenge for all politicians is to persuade the public that politics can make such a positive difference. ‘The issue isn’t so much, “Should we have more policies on housing?”, it’s persuading the public that the policies we have are credible and can be delivered.’","Miliband attempted to mend fences with The Sun in run up to election .

"If disgraced weatherman John Bolaris had plans of staying under the radar following that infamous 'real-life Hangover' trip, then his fiancée appears to have other ideas. Former Playmate model Erica Smitheman, 33, took over 'J-Bo's' Twitter account for a few hours on Sunday night to post a flurry of . messages about their sex life and curse the 'haters'. In what appeared to be late night, drunken antics, Smitheman even offered to tweet nude pictures of herself, but never made good on that promise. Exhibitionist: Erica Smitheman, the former Playmate fiancée of disgraced weatherman John Bolaris, hijacked his Twitter account on Sunday night . Racy: The 33-year-old fiancée of 54-year-old former weatherman John Bolaris treated his 13,000 followers to this self-portrait . Friends and fans tweeted back with . enthusiastic and confused responses, such as: 'what the f*** is . happening and why am i getting tweets from john bolaris?' Bolaris was apparently asleep during the online shenanigans, according to his Twitter feed. 'Obviously my fiance had a little party on Twitter last night, she has . been by my side through everything, I love her,Hmm interesting tweets' he tweeted on Monday to his 12,737 followers. The weatherman, whose story was dubbed the 'real-life Hangover' after he was drugged and swindled out of more than . $40,000 by Eastern European bar girls, has suffered a wave of humiliation, including getting fired from his job at local Fox affiliate channel. Bolaris appeared in a Miami court on November 16, to testify against the crime ring which allegedly stole $43,000 from him. His moment of retribution however was tainted by one of the accused's testimony that during his wild weekend in 2010, he defecated in his pants. Saucy posts: There was a flurry of late night messages on Bolaris' Twitter feed on Sunday night which appeared to have been posted by his fiancée Erica . Bold tweets: Smitheman's sexy posts offered to reveal nude shots of herself . Ladies' man: Mr Bolaris, 54, is a notorious ladies' man and is pictured here with his former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman . The 54-year-old denied the embarrassing incident when asked about it in court and later told Philly.com: 'No. 1, it didn't happen. If it did happen, I would say it happened. He added: 'I am trying to have some dignity.' Earlier this year, Mr Bolaris gave several interviews where he pieced together the weekend's hazy events. The weatherman said he was having a drink at a . South Beach bar in Miami in March 2010 when he was approached by two . women with Russian accents. He explained: 'They come over and they . said, ""Do you want to do a shot?"" And I go, ""No I don't want to do a . shot"". 'Then one comes behind me, rubs my shoulders, pulls back my head . and says, ""Come on, do a shot"". And I said, ""All right, I'll do a . shot"".' Weathering the storm:  John Bolaris has been further humiliated after being scammed out of $43,000 in Miami when one of the accused told the court that he defecated himself . Party time! Mr Bolaris, 54, spent $43,000 in a single weekend in Miami after falling victim to a Russian honeytrap scam . After having a few drinks with the . women they took him in a taxi to their friend's art shop. He said after . that the details are very sketchy. 'I remember standing up ... signing something, vaguely. Next thing I know, I'm in a cab with a big painting [of a woman's head]. 'Then I woke up, I had red wine on my shirt, fully clothes and I'm thinking - something happened, but what?' Surprisingly, one of the 'B-girls' called him to say she had his sunglasses and they agreed to meet up . later so he could return the piece of art. He . said he got in a taxi with them and 'next thing I know I'm passed out'. Prize: The women, two pictured from left . Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, . were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs . Baited: As part of the scam, women were flown in from Russia and the Baltic States to manipulate men at private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia . He woke up the next morning feeling sick and very worried before receiving a . call from American Express to tell him $43,712.25 had been charged to . his card - including $2,480 for the painting. American . Express wouldn't let him dispute the charges because a man called Stan . Pavlenko - who was later arrested in the case - supplied them with a . photo of the weather man at the bar showing he was using his own card. Mr Bolaris won a court case in June with American Express to get his money back plus damages. After he gave interviews about his experience to 20/20 and Playboy, his employer, Philadelphia Fox 29 affiliated WTXF where he had worked for four years, fired him. The company issued a statement saying they 'mutually agreed that it was time to part ways'. Mr Bolaris, who recently got engaged to former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman, said: 'On face value, it looks like a ''Hangover''-type movie. It's easy to sit outside and make fun of it.' He added that if it wasn't for the fact he approached the FBI, the gang would not have been caught. After contacting the FBI, they launched a criminal investigation of the Eastern European criminal activities in the South Beach clubs, using an undercover cop to get information. Alec Simchuk, who was arrested in July, ran some of the Miami clubs where girls would get patrons drunk - while they were throwing out their own drinks - and charge them exorbitant amounts for drinks, enforcing Florida's 'innkeeper law' to force customers to pay. The law requires patrons disputing a charge to challenge the bill with their own credit card company rather than the vendor. Patrons who refuse to sign their bill risk getting arrested. After spending more than a year and an estimated $1million investigating the case, 16 suspects - including almost a dozen b-girls and a handful of male managers and accountants - were arrested after a fake birthday party was thrown by the undercover officer. The case is ongoing.","Erica Smitheman, fiancé of disgraced weatherman John Bolaris, had some late night fun on his Twitter account .

Israel and Hamas militants fought for 50 days before reaching a truce on Tuesday, with both sides declaring a victory. Abbas told Palestine TV in remarks broadcast Friday that 'it was possible for us to avoid all of that, 2,000 martyrs, 10,000 injured, 50,000 houses (damaged or destroyed).' More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, including hundreds of civilians. Seventy one people on the Israeli side, including six civilians, were killed. Several Egyptian mediated cease-fire attempts failed. Hamas eventually accepted almost the same truce offered at the beginning.

Paul Hirschson, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, said that the country is ready to consider any proposal but must be convinced that monitoring will work. In Gaza, Hamad al-Rakeb, a Hamas spokesman, described Hollande's proposal as ‘mixing poison in the honey.’ Riyad Mansour, Abbas' ambassador to the United Nations, on Thursday welcomed the idea of international monitors as a ‘useful deterrent’ to more fighting.

"Smartphones are to be subject to extra checks at airport security for airlines flying directly into the U.S. amid fears terrorists could be converting them into 'stealth bombs'. American officials have called on terminals in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to bring in stricter checks on electronic devices after warning Islamic extremists are making explosives which are undetectable to airport scanners. U.S. officials have identified iPhones and . Samsung Galaxy models as the biggest concern as authorities urged passengers to allow extra time to get past the additional measures. Scroll down for video . Queues at Manchester Airport on Friday morning, the day after new security checks were brought in to search for so-called 'stealth bombs' which are feared to be undetectable to airport scanners . Passengers joined queues starting outside Manchester airport, with many complaining of delays . An official familiar with the matter said the United States believes that while it is possible there may be some additional delays at security checkpoints, at most major airports passengers will not be seriously inconvenienced. The official said most passengers taking long-distance flights arrive well in advance of scheduled departures, leaving time for extra screening. But he said the United States could not rule out disruptions in countries where airport infrastructure and security procedures are less sophisticated. In Britain, where the controls have been implemented for two days, long lines of people have already built up at airports, with passengers taking to Twitter to vent their anger. Ian Moreno-Melgar, who was trying to get to Belfast this morning for a wedding, tweeted: '“Airports operating normally”. Queuing in the car park for security isn’t normal.' He added: '[Manchester] staff obviously under a lot of pressure,but no priority or care for passengers potentially missing flight because of security. 'Genuinely awful service from the usually reliable airport today. 90mins in security, no communication about changes to bag searches.' Chantel McGregor added: 'Ahhhhh bless Manchester airport baggage check, we're finally half way down the queue which started OUTSIDE!' Another passenger said: 'This is the absolute worst security queue I have ever been in. It's like wading through treacle.' There were queues at passport controls at Gatwick airport last night after tougher checks were brought in . Passengers wait at Heathrow Airport this morning as security staff carry out more stringent security checks . Last night, Matteo Pescarin posted a . photo of queues filling a terminal at Gatwick airport's North Terminal as hundreds of . passengers waited to go through security. Other . passengers took the delays with good humor, with David Silvester . tweeting: 'Just had my croissants x-rayed and then inspected... #Airportsecurity' At Glasgow Airport, passengers said they noticed longer times from previous journeys, having to wait up to 40 minutes in queues. Norma . Decent, 59, from Stranraer,  said: 'It seems absolutely ridiculous to . me. You had to queue to get through the first gate and then queue again . to put your bags through security. Ibrahim al-Asiri is the Al-Qaeda bomb-maker thought to be working on the new 'stealth explosives' which have led to the heightened alert . 'I understand why they're doing it, but it all seems a little excessive to me.' Laura . Macpherson, 42, from Paisley, who was traveling with her two children, . said: 'Normally it only takes about five or 10 minutes, but I think we . were queuing for about 30 minutes. 'The problem was that lots of things were being taken from people's bags to additional checks - probably because of the tighter control, but it's better to be safe than sorry.' And Kenny Stafford, 25, from Dumfries, added: 'My lap-top was given an extra check by the security officials. It probably took me about 30 minutes to get through and I had to run to my gate.' It is feared the scenes could become commonplace during a summer of travel chaos following a security alert over bombs that 'cannot be detected' by traditional scanners. Authorities around the world are introducing tougher checks after U.S. security officials said they fear bombmakers from the Yemen-based 'Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula' (AQAP) group have figured out how to turn phones and other devices into 'undetectable' explosive devices. American officials also are concerned that hard-to-detect bombs could be built into shoes and have previously raised fears that explosives may be surgically-implanted into extremists' bodies. Authorities are now hunting a Saudi bomb expert thought to be a leading figure in Al Qaeda's bomb-making team. Ibrahim Al-Asiri, 32, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights from the UK. U.S. officials say iPhones (left) and Samsung Galaxy phones (right) could be subject to greater checks . In 2010, an Al Qaeda group crammed explosives into computer printers before smuggling them onto planes . French soldiers patrol through a terminal at the Charles de Gaulle International Airport July 4. France is tightening airport security for U.S. flight destinations for the summer holiday period at the request of American authorities, an official statement said on Friday . The alert led to the number of sophisticated body scanners at British airports being raised from 10 to 21 yesterday. Manchester Airport has insisted today's queues were unrelated to any security changes and were due to the busy summer holiday season. A spokesman said: 'July is a busy month for the airport and many passengers will be using services from Manchester over the next few weeks. 'Our security officers are on hand to give advice and we ask that passengers work with us so that we can ensure we get people to their gate on time, in a safe manner. 'We ask that passengers leave enough . time and arrive two hours before their flight to ensure that we keep the . security process moving.' A spokesman for Gatwick said there were no additional delays due to security, with customers only having to wait at baggage reclaim. France today followed Britain in increasing security on flights to the U.S., with the French civil aviation authority announcing stepped-up security measures 'for the summer period' which will begin next week.","Stricter checks will focus on smartphones after U.S. officials highlight risk .

"Taliban suicide bombers have attacked a government building in Afghanistan sparking a six-hour armed battle gun fight with Kabul police, resulting in eight deaths. Insurgents launched the attack on the police traffic headquarters before dawn in the Afghan capital, by setting off a suicide bomb in a car outside the gates, which killed two Taliban. Three insurgents then stormed the building sparking the standoff which resulted in the deaths of three police officers and the attackers. Scroll down for video . Attack: Smoke rises from the building of Kabul traffic police headquarters during insurgents' attack, in Kabul, Afghanistan, before dawn today . Operation: Afghan security forces pictured on the roof of the Kabul traffic police headquarters following the attack . Response: Armed Afghan police officers run towards the Kabul traffic police headquarters following the attack . Shooting and explosions could still be . heard outside the compound shortly after noon, but police insisted the . situation was under control and that the insurgents were surrounded. Kabul police officer Mirza Mohammad . said at least one insurgent blew himself up at the entrance to the . compound and a number of others wearing suicide vests entered the . building. Nine hours after the attack began,  the second such Taliban raid in Kabul in five days, police commandos killed the last two insurgents holed up in the headquarters. Kabul Police chief Mohammad Ayub Salangi said two Taliban died at the gate when their suicide vests exploded, another blew himself up inside the building and two more were killed by security forces before they managed to detonate their explosives. Alarm: Officers were involved in a gun fight that lasted more than four hours in the Afghan capital .

Afghan border police headquarters and a police training facility, which may have been the actual target of the attack. The traffic police facility, usually . teeming with civilians seeking to get drivers licenses and registrations . for vehicles, was nearly empty at the time of the attack. Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said the assault began with a suicide car bombing near the building. Two insurgents, he said, were then shot and killed by Afghan forces. Four Afghan police commandos have been injured. Defense: Afghan security officials secure the scene near the attack in the early hours . A NATO soldier is seen near the traffic police headquarters during an insurgents' attack, however NATO forces were reported not to have taken part . Aftermath: The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack which took place in Kabul before dawn today . Mr Sediqi said there were no civilian casualties in the attack. The area has been surrounded by Afghan security forces, he said, and police commandos are conducting the operation. He . said: 'This shows the ability of the Afghan forces, that they are . leading the operation. There are no foreign forces are involved.' A unit of NATO special forces that trains and mentors Afghan police was at the scene but not taking part in the operation. Gul Rahman, who owns a nearby shop, said he heard at least two explosions when the attack started just before dawn. Eyewitnesses said a number of big explosions were heard in and around the building along with heavy gunfire. One police officer Abdullah Hamidi said two of the explosions were caused by a man in a suicide vest and another by a car bomb. Aftermath: A Norwegian soldier with the NATO-led forces runs near the Kabul traffic police headquarters during the insurgents' attack . Damage: Flames can be seen rising from behind a government building following today's Taliban attack . Last Wednesday, six Taliban suicide bombers attacked the gates of the Afghan intelligence agency in downtown Kabul, killing one guard and wounding dozens. Security forces killed all the attackers. The insurgents carried out the attack by driving a minivan loaded with explosives into a gate of the intelligence agency compound in the capital at noon. The other five attackers wearing suicide vests were in a second minivan that was also loaded with explosives. They were shot and killed and security forces later defused the bomb in their minivan. The attacks highlighted ongoing violence in Afghanistan and the determination of the insurgency to continue fighting even as President Hamid Karzai and the U.S. negotiate for a quicker pullout of American forces. President Barack Obama said after meeting Karzai in Washington earlier this month that the U.S.-led military coalition would hand over the lead for security around the country to Afghan forces this spring - months ahead of schedule. Obama also said he agreed with Karzai that the Taliban should open a political office in the Gulf state of Qatar to facilitate peace talks.","Insurgents attacked the Kabul traffic police headquarters before dawn .

"Lord Nelson's famous warship HMS Victory may have been painted the wrong colour after historians examining the ship found no evidence of the well known 'bumblebee' design in its original paintwork. Hundreds of fragments of the ship's original paint have been studied, with experts concluding that the hull was mostly black with varnished timber - not the pale orange and black design adorning the ship in a Portsmouth drydock today. The paint analysis may lead to HMS Victory being repainted in its traditional colours, and casts doubt on the legend that the current design was introduced on Lord Nelson's orders during an 1803 refit. Wrong colour: HMS Victory may have been painted the wrong colour after historians examining the ship found no evidence of the well known 'bumblebee' design in its original paintwork . Questions: The paint analysis casts doubt on the legend that HMS Victory's current design (masthead pictured left) was introduced on the orders of Lord Nelson (right) during an 1803 refit . Experts at the University of Lincoln's conservation institute described the current design as a 'hideous orange' that was brought in about 100 years after the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar. By that point HMS Victory had become a symbol of Britain's naval strength, and it is thought the bumblebee pattern was added during a renovation to give Nelson's flagship a more distinctive look. 'What you see today is largely an early 20th century invention of what an 18th century warship looked like,' the institute's founder Michael Crick-Smith told The Times - adding that the team's work was inspired by a item on the Antiques Roadshow. Mr Crick-Smith's team were able to peel back 72 layers of paint one-by-one to by the reveal the ship's changing decoration since it was first launched on May 7, 1765. According to the research, the ship was originally a simple black and vanished wood design when it first saw action at the Battles of Ushant in 1778 and 1781, the Siege of Gibraltor in 1782 and the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1797. Is this really how it was? HMS Victory was depicted with two-tone paintwork in this painting of the Battle of Trafalgar by Turner from 1822 - 17 years after the event . History: Mr Crick-Smith's team were able to peel back 72 layers of paint one-by-one to by the reveal HMS Victory's changing decoration since its launch on May 7, 1765 . Later in 1797, HMS Victory was . declared unfit for service as a warship and was converted to a hospital . ship to hold wounded prisioners of war. Within . two years the ship returned to war service and, by the time Lord Nelson . hoisted his flag in Victory on 18 May 1803, it had been painted a light . shade of ochre - a kind of pale, rust colour. The research also suggests HMS Victory's deck - on which Lord Nelson was shot and killed by a French sniper during the Battle of Trafalgar - was a pale cream colour, not the bare wood often depicted in classical paintings. Meanwhile cabins on the ship, including the one belonging to Lord Nelson, are thought to have been much plainer than they look today. 'These were working spaces, not country houses at sea as they appear now,' Mr Crick-Smith said. Although it had been in service for 40 years by the time, HMS Victory's most famous moment came during the Battle of Trafalgar, when it was used as Lord Nelson's flagship. During the battle, Victory led 27 British ships to triumph over 33 from the French and Spanish navy. The Franco-Spanish fleet lost twenty-two ships, without a single British vessel being lost. The battle was seen as confirmation of Britain's naval supremacy - in part due to Nelson's unorthodox tactics. He went against traditional naval convention and divided his smaller force into two columns directed perpendicularly against the larger enemy fleet. The result was a decisive British victory, with the commander of the joint French and Spanish forces, Admiral Villeneuve, captured along with his ship Bucentaure. The battle is widely seen as Britain's greatest naval victory, but during the action Nelson was fatally wounded by a French sniper on the deck of HMS Victory. His body was brought back to England where he was given a state funeral. Nelson's death secured his position as one of Britain's most heroic military figures and numerous monuments, including Nelson's Column in London's Trafalgar Square have been created in his memory.","Paint fragments suggest orange and black pattern was a modern addition .

Police said that the couple, though separated, seemed friendly enough. But around 10pm Saturday night, the couple got in an argument. Grapevine police said that Kelly Suckla shot his wife several times in the neck and torso. He then shot himself in the head a few moments later in her parents’ front lawn. Kelly was pronounced dead at the scene; his wife Kristi was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. Witness: Rachel Suckla, 16, was having a dinner at her grandparents' house; though she did not witness the shooting, she and her brother saw her parents afterward . Police said that the couple’s 16-year-old daughter and 21-year-old son were in the house at the time of the shooting but did not witness it. Though the investigation is on-going, authorities have called this a murder-suicide. A Grapevine police spokesperson told MailOnline that the teenager and their 21-year-old son came out after hearing gunshots. ‘At that point, the witnesses that were inside the house heard some gunfire. When they went out, the witnesses saw the bodies lying there,’ he said. The crime has rocked the quiet, upscale town of Grapevine, with many of its residents in disbelief. Kelly Suckla’s neighbor, Jeff Barr, told WFAA that there was no indication that Suckla was angry or that he was going to commit such a heinous act. ‘They seemed normal – never thought anything was going wrong,’ the shocked neighbor said. The station notes that this is the latest in a string of extreme domestic violence cases against women. Last week, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings spoke out in a news conference demanding police officers to ‘redouble those efforts’ against abusive partners. ‘This is not going to be at the bottom of the heap,’ he said. ‘We’re going to take it right to the top.’ According to WFAA, domestic violence-related murder rates more than doubled in Dallas in the past year.

"Early man began to walk on two feet because of rocky terrain and not climate change, according to a new study. Researchers have said that our upright gait may . have its origins in the rugged landscape of East and South Africa which . was shaped during the Pliocene epoch by volcanoes and shifting tectonic . plates. Hominins, our early ancestors, would . have been attracted to the terrain of rocky outcrops and gorges because . it offered shelter and opportunities to trap prey. But it also required . more upright scrambling and climbing gaits, prompting the emergence of . bipedalism. It was previously thought that climate change and a reduction in tree cover forced early man to stand up, but now experts believe the rocky African landscape played a far more significant role . The new study, carried out by archaeologists at the University of York, has challenged evolutionary theories behind the development of our earliest ancestors from tree dwelling quadrupeds to upright bipeds capable of walking and scrambling. The study, ‘Complex Topography and Human . Evolution: the Missing Link’, was developed in conjunction with . researchers from the Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris. The York research challenged the traditional theory that suggested our early forebears were forced out of the trees and onto two feet when climate change reduced tree cover. Dr Isabelle Winder, from the Department of Archaeology at York and one of the paper’s authors, said: 'Our research shows that bipedalism may have developed as a response to the terrain, rather than a response to climatically-driven vegetation changes. Archaeologists at the University of York said the rocky African landscape  - such as Granitberg Mountain in South Africa (pictured) - provided shelter and opportunities to trap prey for early man . Neanderthals breastfed their babies for over a year - just like humans, according to new research. Chemical analysis of a neanderthal child's tooth reveal it was reared on mother's milk for seven months with suckling continuing for the same period coupled with solid food. The change from breastfeeding to plants and grains can be established by looking at differences in the distribution of barium – a similar compound to calcium -  in teeth enamel. This enabled Dr Manish Arora and colleagues at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York to discover the early life diet of a 10 to 12 year-old child that lived in a cave in Belgium around 100,000 years ago. 'The broken, disrupted terrain offered . benefits for hominins in terms of security and food, but it also proved a . motivation to improve their locomotor skills by climbing, balancing, . scrambling and moving swiftly over broken ground - types of movement . encouraging a more upright gait.' The research has suggested that the hands and arms of upright hominins were then left free to develop improved dexterity and tool use, supporting a further key stage in the evolutionary story. The development of running adaptations to the skeleton and foot may have resulted from later excursions onto the surrounding flat plains in search of prey and new home ranges. Dr Winder said: 'The varied terrain may also have contributed to improved cognitive skills such as navigation and communication abilities, accounting for the continued evolution of our brains and social functions such as co-operation and team work. 'Our hypothesis offers a new, viable alternative to traditional vegetation or climate change hypotheses. It explains all the key processes in hominin evolution and offers a more convincing scenario than traditional hypotheses.” The findings were published in the journal Antiquity.","Traditional theory suggested that our ancestors were forced out of the trees and onto two feet when climate change reduced tree cover .

"Most wanted: Saudi bomb maker Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who is described by a US official as 'an evil genius' The hunt is on to find Al-Qaeda's 'evil genius' - an explosives expert believed to be behind a terrifying plot to target trans-Atlantic flights using human bombs. Ibrahim Al-Asiri, who has survived numerous assassination attempts, is understood to have perfected a device which can be sewn into a human body making it almost impossible to detect by airport security scanners. The 32-year-old is believed to have led a team of bomb makers based in Yemen which has already produced several of the devices after linking up with extremists fighting in Syria. The technology is already thought to have reached British jihadists in Syria and Iraq. It is now feared they will return to target flights leaving the UK. In response, security at airports across . the world is being stepped up after US counter-terror chiefs received . what they described as a 'credible' terror threat. In April this year Al-Asiri survived a US special forces ambush in southern Yemen, when a 4x4 he was believed to be travelling in was targetted in a drone strike and ground assault. Security expert Will Geddes yesterday described Al-Asiri as Al Qaeda's ‘number one bomb maker.’ He said: ‘Security experts are worried that there has been more bomb training in some of the terror cells across the Arabian peninsula . ‘The technology for bomb making is better than it was ten years ago. That makes it easier to share the information. ‘It could be using a chemical that the scanner doesn't recognise, at a chemical level. ‘We're talking about objects that are made from innocuous materials, chemicals that slip under the radar. ‘Think of it as a way to confuse the technology in scanners. It could be the substances in a printer cartridge. ‘With all the warnings about Al-Asiri, it means airport security teams have to be a lot more vigilant. ‘As we know there's a lot of linkage between Al Qaeda and this man. He's a constant threat. He's their number one bomb maker. ‘They have been after him for years. It's believed he has been training other members of Al Qaeda to create devices. He operates across Yemen and the Arabian peninsula.’ In response to the threat, security was . being ramped up at airports across Britain. Passengers at Heathrow were . being asked to switch on laptops and mobile phones to prove they were . functioning properly. In addition, . electronic equipment, clothing and shoes were being swabbed to test for . traces of explosives and the number of sophisticated body scanners at . British airports has been raised from ten to 21. At . Manchester, extra machines were sent to departure gates on . transatlantic flights to allow staff to swab hand luggage at boarding as . well as at security. Electronic devices and footwear are being . subjected to greater scrutiny. The measures are likely to lead to delays during the summer holidays when Heathrow alone has 200,000 passengers a day. British prime minister David Cameron insisted yesterday that safety comes first. He . said: 'This is something we’ve discussed with the Americans and what we . have done is put in place some extra precautions and extra checks. ‘The safety of the travelling public must come first. We must not take . any risks with that. I hope this won’t lead to unnecessary delays but . it’s very important that we always put safety first.’ Airports . last night insisted planes would not be delayed – but passengers may . have to arrive at gates earlier to go through the new procedures. Security has been stepped up across airports in Britain with new state-of-the-art scanning equipment being brought in and passengers being warned to expect delays . Al-Asiri's sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009 . 'It has also been suggested that ‘sky marshals’ – undercover armed police – could be brought in on some routes.' Deputy Prime . Minister Nick Clegg warned that the new checks were unlikely to be ‘a . one-off, temporary thing’. He said: ‘This is the world we now live in. ‘I don’t want people to think that this is some sort of blip for a week. 'This . is part of an evolving and constant review about whether the checks in . our airports - and indeed other places of entry and exits from countries . - keep up with what we know from intelligence and other sources about . the nature of the threats we face.’ Al-Asiri's . bombs are of particular concern as they contain no metal elements, . meaning they are virtually undetectable and can evade airport security. Incredibly he carried out one test using his willing younger brother, Abdullah, who had a bomb implanted in his body for an assassination attempt on a Saudi Arabian prince. Although the device went off as planned, Abdullah succeeded in killing only himself and not his target. Al-Asiri’s . sinister creations have also been used on two high-profile terror . attempts in the US, including the underwear bomb carried by Nigerian . Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in his attempt to blow up a plane carrying 300 . passengers over America on Christmas Day 2009. In 2010, his devices were found in printer cartridges on a cargo plane bound for the US. They were intercepted in the UK. In . May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an . improved version of the underwear bomb, which was given to a . Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight. After . the discovery of the printer cartridge bomb, then US deputy national . security adviser John Brennan said analysis of the devices showed they . were made by the same person who was behind the underwear bomb. In May 2012, US officials said they believed Al-Asiri had built an improved version of the underwear bomb (pictured), which was given to a Saudi-recruited double agent to blow up on a US-bound flight . He . said: ‘He’s a very dangerous individual – clearly somebody who has a . fair amount of training and experience. We need to find him and bring . him to justice as soon as we can.’ US . congressman and former homeland security committee chairman Peter King . said Al-Asiri was an ‘evil genius’, adding: ‘He is constantly expanding, . he is constantly adjusting.’ Intelligence . sources believe Al-Asiri, who is known as Abu Saleh, has been passing . on his lethal bomb-making expertise from his base in Yemen to Syria, . with plans to attack transatlantic flights. He is also feared to be training British fanatics in Yemen, where MI6 and MI5 believe extremists pose a real threat to the UK. All . his bombs use a chemical fuse and a high-level industrial explosive . known as PETN, or pentaerythritol tetranitrate. The same material was . used in 2001 by British shoe bomber Richard Reid when he tried to . destroy a transatlantic flight. Ben . Friedman, a US expert in defence and homeland security, said the . authorities were worried about bombs implanted inside people or . explosives made from non-metallic elements. But he said it was important to remember that previous attempts to blow up planes had failed. ‘These . guys are serial failures,’ he added. ‘It’s not like they have a track . record of unmitigated success. It’s closer to the opposite.’ They surfaced in Yemen in 2009, where it emerged they had joined the newly-formed Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. In August of that year, Abdullah pretended to be an Islamist militant who wanted to reform, and was given an audience with Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi Arabia’s top counter-terrorism official. Once stood next to the royal, he detonated the bomb, hidden inside part of his intestine. But the blast went straight downwards meaning Abdullah was torn in two and the prince escaped with minor injuries. Al-Asiri was named as one of Saudi Arabia’s most wanted terrorists in 2009 and in 2011 joined the US wanted list.","Ibrahim Al-Asiri was born into respectable middle class Saudi family .

"A police chief in India has sparked outrage after a woman was gang raped on a bus by saying women should carry chili powder to defend themselves. Commissioner KP Raghuvanshi, head of police in Thane, in the state of Maharashtra, suggested women can avoid rape by not traveling at night and trying to defend themselves. Activists condemned the commissioner's remarks as sexist and 'idiotic'. Anger: Students in New Delhi take part in a candlelit vigil outside Safdarjung Hospital where the gang-rape victim is being treated . Police use water cannons to disperse the students demonstrating against the recent gang rape case, at Delhi Chief Minister's residence in New Delhi . Ranjana Rumari, director of the Center for Social Research in Delhi, said: 'This is just a sexist sort of solution. 'They want women to stay home. And how is chili powder going to help against six or seven men?' Rape has become the subject of national discussion in India since the violent gang rape of a 23-year-old student on a bus in New Delhi. The victim remains in critical condition at the hospital with severe internal injuries, doctors said. Police said six men raped the woman and savagely beat her and her companion with iron rods on a bus driving around the city - passing through several police checkpoints - before stripping them and dumping them on the side of the road Sunday night. Delhi police chief Neeraj Kumar said four men have been arrested and a search is under way for the other two. The attack has prompted massive protests across India, as thousands of demonstrators gathered in the streets in front of New Delhi police headquarters, near Parliament, and outside the home of the city's top elected official before police dispersed them with water cannons. Women light candles during a candlelight vigil in support of women safety in Mumbai . The police chief's comments sparked outrage across the country and a series of demonstrations were held . Indian activists shout slogans outside police headquarters during a protest in New Delhi . BJP women members raise slogans during a protest demonstration against the recent gang rape case, at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi . 'We want to jolt people awake from the cozy comfort of their cars. We want people to feel the pain of what women go through every day,' said Aditi Roy, a Delhi University student. As protests raged in cities across India, at least two girls were gang-raped, with one of them killed. Police on Wednesday fished out the body of a 10-year old girl from a canal in Bihar state's Saharsa district. Police superintendent Ajit Kumar Satyarthi said the girl had been gang-raped and killed and her body dumped in the canal. Police were investigating and a breakthrough was expected soon, Satyarthi said. Elsewhere, a 14-year old schoolgirl was in critical condition in Banka district of Bihar after she was raped by four men, said Jyoti Kumar, the district education officer. The men have been identified, but police were yet to make any arrests, Kumar said. Rapes in India remain drastically under reported. In many cases, families do not report rapes due to the stigma that follows the victim and her family. In other instances, families may decide not to report a rape out of frustration with the long delays in court and harassment at the hands of the police. Police are reluctant to register cases of rape and domestic violence in order to keep down crime figures or to elicit a bribe from the victim.","Comments by Commissioner KP Raghuvanshi, head of police in Thane .

"Former First Lady Hillary Clinton isn't ashamed of the massive amount of money she and husband Bill Clinton have earned over the last decade through high-paying speaking gigs. Hitting the speaking circuit was a necessity in order to maintain their lifestyle after Bill's term as the 42nd President of the United States ended, Clinton told ABC's Diane Sawyer in a sit-down interview ahead of the release of her book Hard Choices. 'We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt,' Clinton said. 'We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.' 'You know, it was not easy.' The couple has earned millions since moving out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue through plum speaking gigs that are said to run hosts $200,000 a pop and advance payment on their books of $8 million or more . Hillary Clinton, right, talks with ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer, left, for her first television interview in conjunction with the release of her new book, Hard Choices, airing during a one-hour ABC News prime time special on Monday, June 9 beginning at 9 pm EST. The interview took place in Clinton's Washington, D.C. home . The couple has earned millions since . moving out of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue through plum speaking engagements that . are said to run hosts $200,000 a pop and advance payments on their books . of $8 million or more. CNN reported a year ago that Bill Clinton had earned a sweet $106 million in speaker's fees since leaving the White House, and that he made $17 million off of 72 speeches in 2012 alone - a personal best. The news station combed through the Clintons' financial disclosure forms and found that Bill Clinton once charged $750,000 for a single speech. 'Bill has worked really hard -- and it's been amazing to me -- he's worked very hard,' Hillary told Sawyer during a segment of their interview that aired this morning. 'First of all, we had to pay off all our debts, which was, you know, he had to make double the money because of obviously taxes and then pay off the debts and get us houses and take care of family members,' she said. Lap of Luxury: Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky bought a $10.5 million apartment overlooking Madison Square Park last year . Beauty: The four-bedroom condo features high ceilings and . elegantly decorated rooms. Built in the new-Georgian style in 1924, the . property has been completely renovated . Comfort: The building has been fitted with a top-of-the-range kitchen complete with the latest high quality appliances . Space: There is plenty of room for the couple's . toothbrushes in the apartment's huge bathroom, which is fitted out in . Italian marble . A comprehensive analysis of Hillary's speeches conducted by Mother Jones puts the former secretary of state's haul to more than $5 million since last year. A sizable portion of that money has come from the same financial institutions and 1 percent of society that many progressives claim to loathe. Rather than take money from any one organization or lobbyist group, Hillary Clinton has welcomed them all. 'Let me put it this way,' she told Sawyer. 'I thought making . speeches for money was a much better thing than getting connected with . any one group or company as so many people who leave public life do.' 'I happen to have given lots of free speeches,' Clinton said. Hillary does not take payment for speeches she gives on behalf of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, the family's non-governmental organization. Home for the summer: Bill and Hillary Clinton rented out this sprawling mansion in the Hamptons for approximately $200,000 a day last summer . The Clintons have also made anywhere from $31 - $37 million off of their books since 2003 in advance payments. Knopf . Publishing Group paid Bill Clinton $15 million for his 2004 . autobiography My Life. Simon & Schuster gave Hillary Clinton an $8 . million advance for her 2003 book Living History. Her advance for Hard . Choices, which comes out tomorrow, is not known, but guesstimates put . the payout between $8 and $14 million. A 2013 USA Today analysis put Bill Clinton's net worth at $55 million. More recent estimates put he and Hillary's combined net worth at $100 . to $200 million. The amount of money the couple has made since . the beginning of last year is a mystery, though. As a public office holder and . an administration official Hillary Clinton was required to file . financial disclosure statements each year. Now that neither Clinton is . officially working in politics, that information is private. The former first couple and their only child, Chelsea, don't seem to be doing too shabby for themselves, though. Chelsea and her husband Marc Mezvinsky bought a 5,000 sq ft apartment in Manhattan last spring for $10.5 million. The four-bedroom,six and a half bath luxury apartment is located next to Madison Square Park in the trendy Flatiron District. Bill . and Hillary Clinton are known to own two homes - one in Washington, . D.C., where Clinton did her interview with Sawyer, and another in . Chappaqua, New York - in addition to an apartment in Manhattan. The colonial style Chappaqua, New York, home has five bedrooms and takes up 5,200 sq ft. Their three story, 5,152 sq ft home in Washington, D.C. has four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half bathrooms and a basement.The average home in their neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia. The Clintons have spent their past three summers at homes they rented out in the Hamptons. Bill and Hillary reportedly paid $200,000 a day to rent out the six bedroom Sagaponak mansion of former senior managing director at Bear, Stearns & Co and Republican donor Michael Saperstein last summer. The property is valued at $11 million. The former president and his wife have also made enough money over the years that they were able to donate $13.2 million to Hillary's failed presidential bid in 2008. The couple had intended the money to be a loan, but they were never able to make back the initial amount or the $77,900 of interest that had . accumulated on it. Bill and Hillary Clinton's Chappaqua, New York house, taken in June 2008 when Hillary was running for president . Hillary Clinton sat down with Diane Sawyer as part of the rollout of her memoir Hard Choices. Hard Choices will not be officially released until tomorrow, but a number of news outlets have already gotten their hands on the book in whole or in part, including a chapter on the September 11, 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. In the 34-pages dedicated to discussing the assault, Clinton explains the administration's now debunked belief that a crude, anti-Muslim YouTube was the cause of the disruption that ended in the death of four Americans that day. She also ridicules her critics and those of then-U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice as  engaging in a 'political . slugfest on the backs of dead Americans.' 'Those who insist on politicizing the . tragedy will have to do so without me,' Clinton wrote. The former State Department official told Sawyers during their chat that she does not yet know if she will be testifying before the House of Representatives committee tasked with investigating the attack. 'That's going to be up to the people running the hearing,' Clinton said. 'We'll see what they decide to do, how they conduct themselves, whether . or not this is, you know, one more travesty about the loss of four . Americans, or whether this is, in the best tradition of the Congress, an . effort to figure out how – what we can do better.' Asked by Sawyer if there was anything she could have 'personally' done to prevent the deaths of the American citizens in Libya, Clinton said the gave 'very direct instructions' to 'the people who have the expertise and experience in security.' 'That is personal.' 'I'm not equipped to sit and look at blueprints, to determine where the blast walls need to be or where the reinforcements need to be,' she said. 'That's why we hire people who have that expertise.' Bill and Hillary Clinton also own a three story, 5,152 sq ft home in Washington, D.C. that has four bedrooms, six bathrooms, two half bathrooms and a basement. The average home in their neighborhood is valued at $6,586,000, according to real estate website Trulia . Clinton has events scheduled in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Diego, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., among others, to promote the book, as well as interviews on every major network. The full, hour-long pre-taped interview with Sawyer will air tonight on ABC at 9 pm EST. Clinton will also join ABC's Robin Roberts on Good Morning America tomorrow for a live interview. In another clip of Hillary's interview with Sawyer that has already aired, the potential 2016 presidential candidate said that after her book tour she would campaign for Democratic candidates competing in 'the midterm elections in the fall and then take a deep breath and kind of go through my pluses and minuses' and decide if she wants to make an second attempt at the presidency. Clinton said she had no definite timetable for the decision and that she would do it 'when it feels right for me to decide.' In the meantime, the Democratic Party's other 2016 hopefuls should 'do whatever they choose to do,' she said.","Hillary Clinton said in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that her life 'was not easy' after she left the White House because she and her husband .

"Security camera footage from inside homes, offices and shops across Britain is being intercepted and broadcast live on the internet – without the owners’ knowledge. A Mail on Sunday investigation can reveal that ‘home hackers’ are easily able to spy on people going about their daily lives through cameras that were installed in homes to improve security. During a two-hour period last week we watched an internet website – available to anyone in the world – and saw footage from British locations of: . Scroll down for video . A baby in her cot: These personal webcam images were all easily accessible online last week . If you have installed a camera of the type that can be hacked in this way, you could be being watched now. Vulnerable devices include baby monitors, domestic security cameras and CCTV units that monitor offices, shops and factories. Hacking can be prevented simply by changing the factory-set default security codes that every camera comes with. Last night Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert, who sits on the influential Home Affairs Committee that scrutinises internet crime, said manufacturers had to do more to protect customers. ‘It’s absolutely shocking. We should get the companies which sell this to force customers to change default passcodes,’ he said. ‘This should be a wake-up call to anyone who has a camera in their home or business.’ Some 350,000 individuals and businesses buy such cameras every year in the UK and many fail to change the default passcode – leaving them exposed to hacking. A large number of buyers will be parents who use the devices to monitor babies and young children. They will be horrified to learn that footage they assumed could be accessed by them alone has, in some cases, been made available by hackers for the world to see. A young child asleep: Parents using home security cameras often fail to reset factory setting codes . An old lady relaxing: Not resetting passwords makes it easy for hackers to seek out and broadcast live film on the internet . Our investigation found that nearly 60,000 hours of live feed from UK surveillance cameras can be viewed every day on one website alone. As well as raising a number of security concerns, experts said it also represented an appalling invasion of privacy. Professor Alan Woodward, a cyber security specialist, said: ‘The really scary thing is that people buy these cameras for their own security. But they have no idea that thousands of people might be spying on them at any one time.’ Much of the footage is mundane and reflects the enormous growth in home security systems, but there are also huge amounts of live feed from offices, restaurants, bars, swimming pools and gymnasiums. Cashiers and hotel receptionists are observed in close-up from cameras fixed to walls behind them; there is footage from inside a London hair salon; women can be seen having their nails manicured in Eastleigh, Hampshire; and another stream shows men lifting weights in a Manchester gym. Technology expert Shawn Day said there was worrying potential for the footage to be exploited by criminals. He said: ‘There was one camera in an office and I could actually read the screen of the computer where they could be entering private information such as passwords, but it’s fully displayed to the world. ‘It’s not just the creepy feeling that you are being seen, which is the main concern, it’s also the content of what is being seen. We’re talking about financial information, private information – exactly the sort of stuff the camera is designed to protect, but is doing the opposite.’ Many home webcams, such as these, are easy targets for hackers, and 350,000 are bought in the UK everyday . The Mail on Sunday was able to watch footage showing scores of people inside their homes, who were oblivious to the fact that they were being observed. Many cameras were fixed on babies and small children sleeping in their beds. There was also close-up footage of an elderly lady relaxing in Aberdeen. Another camera in a London home filmed a schoolboy texting on his mobile phone. A man in Crawley was seen on a sofa with a cup of tea, with family photographs on the wall behind him. In the past there have been some incidents of computer hacking to seize control of built-in webcams. That process is called ‘ratting’, as the hackers send out a virus that allows them access to a person’s desktop computer or laptop without their knowledge. But we discovered that the hacking of stand-alone security cameras – IP (Internet Protocol) cameras – is a much simpler process and more widespread. Most cameras that connect to the internet come with a default username and password which most people do not realise they can – and must – change. If owners fail to do so, their live feed, which they can access from smartphones, could also be picked up by hackers who scan addresses on the internet until they find an exposed IP camera. Experts fear large numbers of such cameras are vulnerable to hacking. The Mail on Sunday visited a travel company, pictured, which had no idea its security camera images were being streamed online . Our reporter, right, showed staff how their meeting was being shown live on the internet . A computer showing the reporter waving at the camera after revealing to the office workers that their footage was available online . The hackers then input a number of commonly used default passwords until they gain access. Finally they stream the results on to their own websites for all to see. For security reasons, the hacking website is not being named by The Mail on Sunday. The site keeps the exact locations of the cameras deliberately vague, providing only names of cities and towns. During our investigation we discovered footage being beamed from a travel agent’s office in London. Our reporter visited the office to alert the owner, who had no idea his daily business was being broadcast to the world. As our reporter helped him log on to the hackers’ website, staff at The Mail on Sunday’s office we were also monitoring it. We saw the reporter walk into the shop and explain that the six CCTV cameras had been hacked. Our reporter waved at the camera and the businessman was astonished to see it broadcast on his computer. 1. Ensure the camera you buy allows you to change the default password. 2. If manual doesn't explain how to do this, call manufacturer and get clear guidance. 3. Take time to set up a strong password and change it regularly. The shop could easily be identified to any criminal watching because one of the hacked cameras partially revealed its address on a hoarding. ‘This is absolutely appalling,’ said the manager, who asked not to be named. ‘The system was installed three months ago and they didn’t tell us anything about passwords. I can assure you they will be changed.’ His cameras were manufactured by China-based Hikvision, which insisted last night that it does ‘everything possible’ to warn of the need to change default passwords. In another case, we identified a house in Southend, Essex, because the Hikvision cameras at the property – fixed on the drive, back door and side gate – included the owner’s name and address on screen. The owner said: ‘We got these cameras to try to keep our property safe but we never imagined that people are looking at our house and what we’re doing. Burglars could see when we’re out.’ After being alerted, the travel agent and homeowner both changed their passwords. Their footage is no longer available online. Many of the hacked cameras used by parents are made by another Chinese company, Foscam. A spokesman said it was aware of hacking and will now ‘force’ users to change passwords. It is not clear who is behind the hacking website, but The Mail on Sunday established that it is ‘hosted’ by a company called MediaNet based in the Moldovan capital, Chisinau. A spokeswoman said: ‘We were not aware of this. Thank you for letting us know.’ She could not say what action, if any, would be taken. Tony Neate, of the Government’s Get Safe Online campaign, said: ‘The most important thing to take away from this is how important it is to change the default password on the device. Camera instruction manuals should explain how to do this, and if not, then you should contact the manufacturer for guidance.’ It is unclear what can by done by police, who have spent more than £20 million investigating phone hacking. The National Crime Agency said: ‘It is vital that individuals and businesses take all possible steps to protect themselves from having personal or financial information compromised, making sure operating instructions are followed, security software is up to date, and passwords are strong and regularly changed.’","Investigation reveals 'home hackers' are spying on people through webcams .

"Hero: Former FDNY Lt Martin Fullam, 56, was laid to rest Saturday in Staten Island . A hero firefighter who bravely served on September 11th alongside hundreds of other first responders has died of a rare lung condition, and was laid to rest yesterday. FDNY Lt Martin Fullam contracted polymyositis in 2005, and had also suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, which left him breathless and exhausted after the simplest of tasks. The late firefighter, 56, was one of the men carrying fatally wounded FDNY Chaplain Mychal Judge through the still-smoking rubble on 9/11. The image of Lt Fullam and four others carrying the chaplain has remained one of the most poignant and haunting pictures from that horrific day. Hundreds of members of New York’s bravest gathered Saturday afternoon on Staten Island to say farewell to Lt Fullam, who fought tirelessly for first responders of 9/11 and those living near ground zero. ‘Marty is an inspiration to all of us,’ FDNY Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said outside of Our Lady Star of the Sea in Huguenot. After Lt Fullam heard of what happened at the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11, 2001, he rushed to the site, even though he wasn’t on duty that day. First responders: Lt Fullam, far left, was one of the rescue workers carrying fatally-injured FDNY Chaplain, Father Mychal Judge, from one of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 . He spent the following weeks and months working at Ground Zero, looking for survivors, and later bodies. The Staten Island Advance reports that he was one of thousands who filed claims against the city over his chronic illness. Later, he fought for the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which President Obama signed into law in 2010. Lt Fullam suffered from pulmonary fibrosis in his lungs, and was diagnosed in 2005 with polymyositis, an inflammatory disease that led to pain and extreme muscle weakness. New York's bravest: Lt Fullam was an advocate for the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which gave first responders and lower Manhattan residents access to benefits and care . He also was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, which made breathing extremely difficult. In April of 2009, he received a lung transplant at New York Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center. ‘I truly think I’m the luckiest person in the world,’ he said at the time from a wheelchair as he left the hospital. Dozens of uniformed servicemen were applauding his continued courage. In total, Lt Fullam served 27 years with the FDNY, working in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Manhattan.He is survived by his wife, Patricia, and his daughters, Caroline, Emma, and Kelly. Fight: Sen. Chuck Schumer, right, argued for more funding for those like Lt Fullam, center in 2007; then Sen. Hillary Clinton, third right, looks on . Hero's welcome: Lt.

"A weightlifter who lost her right arm in a car crash is beating all of her old records and says it is 'the best thing that could have happened'. Krystal Cantu, 25, from Texas, had her arm amputated last year after the car she was travelling in with her boyfriend flipped over - painfully crushing her limb. But this has increased her ferocity in the gym and she can now can lift a 210lb bar clear above her head with just her left arm, more than she could lift before the crash. Scroll down for video . Weighlighter Krystal Cantu, 25, from Texas, had her arm amputated last year, but she is beating all her records .

'I had people trying to help me and I was trying not to look at my arm but I could see it in the reflection of one guy's sunglasses.

He added: 'Everyone sees that what she's doing may look difficult but she's still going through it and trying her best. 'You can feel that the intensity is really turned up when Krystal is in the gym.' But shockingly, despite her courage, Miss Cantu still falls victim to Internet trolls. She added: 'There are some really mean people out there that just don't understand that I do things the right way. 'I don't just do this to get attention, I do this because I love to train but I do attract some negative comments.'

"Manchester United are watching £30million-rated Palermo striker Paulo Dybala. Club scouts were present at their weekend game against Inter Milan where they also watched Inter striker and Chelsea target Mauro Icardi who scored twice in a 3-0 win. The 21-year-old Dybala, who has been tipped as the new Sergio Aguero in Argentina, can play as a striker or right winger and has impressed in what has been his breakthrough season. Palermo's Paulo Dybala celebrates after scoring against Hellas Verona in February . Dybala has impressed this season and has been watched by representatives of Manchester United . The Argentine has netted nine goals in 17 appearances this season and that has not gone unnoticed by those at Old Trafford. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool have also been represented at games this season and Palermo president Maurizio Zamparini is resigned to his departure in the summer but has hit out at his purported agents. Inter Milan's Mauro Icardi finds the back of the net against Palermo at the San Siro stadium . 'This year he has exploded, but I already knew that he was very good,' said Zamparini. 'The boy is now in the hands of some people who don’t wish him well. It’s difficult to see him staying at Palermo. 'He’s a great lad, who has been corrupted by bad advice. Now he’s advised by people who only see him as money making tool and nothing else. Arsenal, Tottenham and Liverpool have also been to watch Dybala this season . 'Dybala is worth over €40m but I won't sell him until June. Many foreign clubs asked after him, including Manchester United. 'I told the English side that he is not for sale right now, but we can talk about it again in six months. In my view, he is the best striker in Europe at the moment.'

On to a winner: 'Little Fat' may be the heaviest baby ever to be born in China, beating off the competition with an extra 0.5lb . Exactly . why the world is seeing more and more overweight newborns is unknown, . but experts say it could have to do with rising obesity rates and poor . diets in mothers. One danger . is that big babies are at risk of shoulder dystocia, where a newborn's . shoulders are too big to fit through its mother's pelvic bone during . delivery. This can lead to babies having of broken or fractured bones, and mothers can suffer trauma and tearing. The largest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879, a boy weighing 23lb 12oz, who died 11 hours later. In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton dos Santos. He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was caused by gestational diabetes.

"Yesterday I witnessed the extraordinary sight of hordes of suicide bombers, dressed in black and brandishing Kalashnikovs, marching through the slums of Baghdad. Grouped into makeshift platoons – some wearing white shrouds to denote their readiness to die – they demonstrated their deadly skills in an astonishing display by ‘detonating’ the bombs they carried. They were part of the private army of powerful cleric Moqtada al-Sadr,  an enemy of Britain and the US who inflicted terrible damage  on Western troops after the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq. Scroll down for video . Captured: A Saudi man fighting with ISIS is arrested by an Iraqi soldier (left) and a member of the elite SWAT team . He has now raised a militia of tens of thousands of fighters to combat the threat posed by ISIS extremists – and yesterday I saw their brutal power for myself. The Mahdi Army – which has vowed to protect Baghdad and its holy shrines to the death – is now  battling alongside government troops to defend an Iraq on the verge of collapse against advancing Sunni militants. Their march came on yet another day of fighting and bloodshed as: . The reappearance of the Mahdi Army comes a few months after al-Sadr announced his withdrawal from politics citing disillusionment with the corruption of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki’s government. But it has taken less than two weeks for him to mobilise his  private army again in response to the ISIS attacks in the north. Al-Sadr himself headed up a  military show of strength in Najaf city, his headquarters, while I and thousands watched a fighting force of men, women and young boys in combat gear and balaclavas brandished rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and truckloads of ground-to-air missiles march through the heart of Baghdad for several hours. Display of strength: Mahdi fighters, loyal to the Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, take part in a military parade on the streets of Baghdad . They closed off the highways as they made their way through Sadr City, a slum area home to more than a million Shia Muslims. The platoons assembled according to their city districts. Many were from Sadr City, which has become a no-go zone due to roadside bombs and tension between the poor militant Shia population there and displaced Sunnis, many of whom feel excluded from the government. As the sheikhs on the podium recited the Koran, I saw fighters fall to their knees in prayer. It was a day when almost everyone had come out to fight, the aggressive platoons, boasting of their  engineering, bomb-making skills. The suicide-bomb brigade broke ranks as it passed the podium. At a sign from the sheikhs, the men in balaclavas and ammo-vests went into operational mode, staking out  a target, crouching low on the ground and ‘detonating’ their charges with bravado. The message over loudspeakers all along the route was threefold: ‘Let the Dash (ISIS) militants see our power today; let Prime Minister  al-Maliki see we are stronger than his government and his army; and tell the Iraqi people not to be afraid, we will win this  war for you.’ The clerics boomed out encouragement: ‘To all those willing to die for Iraq, your souls will go to heaven. We will pray for you.’ Not a shot was fired during this showy . parade. But later yesterday, four people were killed by four roadside . bombs in Baghdad, two of them in Sadr City. It was twice the daily average for this volatile city. Al-Sadr’s . powerful display in Baghdad came as ISIS militants claimed to control . 75 per cent of the crucial Baiji oil refinery in the north-east, flying . its signature black flag over the installation. Weaponry: Thousands of Shiite militiamen marched through the slums as the ISIS surge continued in parts of Iraq . It boasted of trapping 270 Iraqi soldiers inside and threatened to starve them into surrender. European workers there were evacuated before the attack, but Indian, Chinese and Turkish employees are believed to be hostages. The effect on oil prices has been instantaneous with Brent Crude  rising to a nine-month high of $115.06 a barrel by Friday. Meanwhile, around 400 troops  were flown to Mosul and Tikrit to fight the militants now running both cities, extorting money from local firms, and raiding shops and banks. Iraq’s army, stretched to the limit in fierce battles in cities and surrounding towns, and at Tal Afar airport, has been forced to work with former foes such as the vicious Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq – the League of the Righteous, and other free-ranging Shia militias. Baghdad itself, the seat of government and the last  bastion standing against ISIS, which has total control of Fallujah to  the west and is winning the battle for important towns in Diyala  Province to the north-east, was yesterday in lockdown. Parade: They have signalled their readiness to take on the Sunni militants. However some have questioned the army's ability to take on ISIS . Hundreds of new checkpoints, both police and military, have appeared over the past few days. Traffic comes to a standstill as  documents, vehicles, drivers and passengers are thoroughly and  laboriously checked. In the siege mentality which prevails, many are determined to sit it out come what may. Despite reports of people fleeing, there are seats on most flights out and no flood of traffic away from the city centre. At Baghdad’s only Anglican church, St George’s, yesterday Father Faiz Jerges said: ‘I am  staying here and my congregation is staying here. If necessary I will die with my people. ‘We have our communion services and our youth meetings and our Mothers’ Union. We pray for peace all the time of course, now more than ever, but we also take food rations to the soldiers at the checkpoint outside and we encourage our Muslim friends to join us when they can. ‘We have heard it all for many years and still we are finding the strength to go on. We pray for peace all the time of course, now more than ever. Against all odds we have a good relationship with peace-loving Muslims. We hope for a miracle, to see Baghdad free again one day.’ Sinister: Moqtada al-Sadr, a powerful figure in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein . The man leading the Shia show of strength against ISIS is Moqtada al-Sadr, a powerful figure in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. After the toppling of the dictator in 2003, the radical cleric called for a national rebellion against Western troops, sending out his Mahdi Army militiamen to confront the British and American ‘invaders’. His followers patrolled the streets of Baghdad’s Shia suburbs, taking on many functions of local government and renaming the Saddam City area to Sadr City, which became a no-go area for coalition forces. Last year, he said he was laying down his arms. But now he is allying his forces with the Iraqi troops defending Baghdad from ISIS’s Sunni extremists. Last night, a Shia cleric loyal to al-Sadr said their anti-Western views remained and that the 300 US military advisers en route to Iraq would be attacked.","Hordes of suicide bombers, holding Kalashnikovs, paraded the streets .

"A lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the Abercrombie & Fitch-owned company of discriminating against disabled customers . Many of its stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch making it for difficult for wheelchairs to enter . Abercrombie & Fitch brand Hollister Co. must redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly. An advocacy group for the disabled says a federal judge is giving the surf-inspired clothing label, which has more than 500 locations worldwide, until January 1, 2017, to make the changes. Many of its stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch and a lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the company of discriminating against disabled customers. Problematic: In August Hollister was found guilty of disability discrimination with its stepped store entrances, modeled after California beach shacks (a store front in Park Meadows Mall, Lone Tree, Colorado) The Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition says a ruling Friday by a federal judge in Denver requires Hollister to make changes at a rate of 77 stores per year so they are more accessible. The ruling says the company has options including leveling out stairs at entrances or installing ramps. It also can close off stairway entrances so that all customers, not just those who can't walk, would use secondary entrances. The lawsuit was filed in 2009 against . J.M. Hollister LLC and its owner, Ohio-based Abercrombie & Fitch . Co., on behalf of several Colorado customers. Last month a federal judge ruled that A&F¿s surf-inspired clothing label Hollister has until January 1, 2017, to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly . In March the district court for Colorado ordered company executives to comply with disability advocates but according to The Colorado Independent the two parties failed to reach an agreement and the steps remained a problem. The long-running case originally grew from complaints filed . against two Hollister stores in Colorado by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition. Julie Farrar, 45, one of the plaintiffs in the four-year dispute, said she visited the Orchard Town Center store, which has since closed, to buy items for her 12-year-old daughter but her wheelchair couldn’t make it up the steps. 'Hollister markets beauty as a stereotype, the reality is they still need the rest of us' Lawyers for the Equal Rights Center, a . national civil-rights organization, found similar access problems at . Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister stores in nine States and filed a . similar lawsuit in November 2009 in Maryland. In 2012 the Colorado-focused case grew into a . class-action suit targeting the 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. that . feature imitation porch steps as a main entrance. Despite the uproar, Hollister vigorously defended the use of stairs in its stores. A company spokesman said that the raised entrances were designed to create 'an entry to a . house in Southern California that you would walk up onto the porch or . walk down into the porch, to enter, like you would do at a beach house.' Widespread: 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. currently feature faux porch steps as their main entrance . The firm argued that it complies . with the law because the stores include side doors disguised as . shuttered windows that are wheelchair accessible. However . plaintiffs said these . doors are often are blocked with tables stacked with merchandise and . they should not be made to enter through an 'inferior' entrance. Ms Farrar, who was born without a sacrum - the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine - told The Colorado Independent: 'I would never go through a side door. It’s not something I would do. I’m philosophically opposed to that. 'These stores are designed to look . shuttered and hidden, as if to keep out the riffraff' 'These stores are designed to look . shuttered and hidden, as if to keep out the riffraff. I want . people to know that, as a society, we have evolved over the past 25 . years. 'Despite the fact that [Hollister] market[s] beauty and athleticism . as a stereotype, the reality is they still need the rest of us people . who are short, chubby and maybe with acne and wheelchairs.' In March U.S. District Judge Wiley Daniel agreed that Hollister’s inaccessible porches violate the American with . Disabilities Act, also known as the ADA. The 23-year-old law prohibits discrimination against people with . disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, . communications, and governmental activities. Judge Daniel ruled that customers who use wheelchairs must be entitled to the same experience as all other customers. Image conscious: Hollister, like all of the Abercrombie & Fitch brands, markets its clothing as a lifestyle, its main inspiration being Southern California's beach and surf scene . He suggested that Hollister could flatten out its entrance ways and remove the steps or install wheelchair-accessible ramps. Commenting on the ruling, a spokesman for Hollister told . MailOnline  'We are surprised by the Judge’s decision that the Hollister . entrances are not compliant with the ADA. 'We’ve maintained throughout the . litigation, and continue to maintain, that the stores comply with the . ADA and allow access to all patrons. 'We want all of our . customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores' 'Beyond that, we want all of our . customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores. While we reserve the right to appeal the underlying legal issue, we are . currently working with the court and the plaintiffs to reach a mutually . agreeable resolution.' Hollister, . like all of the Abercrombie . brands, markets its clothing as a lifestyle, its main inspiration being . Southern California's beach and surf scene. The website explains that . it is the 'coolest destination for genuine SoCal style clothes for guys . and girls.' And a 2013 . report to shareholders reads: 'It’s . all about hot lifeguards and beautiful beaches… Young and fun, with a . sense of humor, Hollister never takes itself too seriously. Hollister’s . laid-back lifestyle and All-American image is timeless and effortlessly . cool.' The . U.S. Justice Department has also weighed in on the discrimination case. It highlighted that the Hollister stores were built long after the ADA . came into play and therefore the entrances violate both the 'spirit and . letter of the law.'","A lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the Abercrombie & Fitch-owned company of discriminating against disabled customers .

"A 21-year-old has told how he was left paralysed after suffering a simple bout of tonsillitis. Jack Kelly, from Coventry, developed a rare nerve disease, called Miller Fisher syndrome, which was triggered by the tonsillitis. It left him with blurred vision, unable to walk and confined to the stroke unit of his local hospital. Jack Kelly, 21, from Coventry, was paralysed and unable to see for more than a week after a bout of tonsillitis triggered a rare nerve disease called Miller Fisher syndrome . Now, the Fitness First employee has recovered and is competing in gruelling Tough Guy competitions. Mr Kelly told MailOnline: ‘It’s given me a real appreciation for life. You never know what is around the corner and what will happen. ‘While it was a horrible experience, I was lucky in a way as I now know how much I have.’ Mr Kelly was 18-years-old and a student at the University of Plymouth when he fell ill. A week after recovering from tonsillitis he returned from the gym and noticed he was struggling to walk normally up a flight of stairs. He dismissed the problem assuming it was a result of his muscles being tired from his workout. Mr Kelly spent a week in Derriford Hospital's stroke unit (pictured) after developing double vision, poor muscle coordination and weakness. Doctors were so worried they offered him a visit from the hospital's pastor . Mr Kelly had intensive physiotherapy to help him walk again and has made such a good recovery that he is now taking part in Tough Guy challenges (pictured) which involve completing long assault courses . However, as the day progressed his legs became progressively weaker and he began to suffer double vision. Mr Kelly had previously suffered from migraines so thought he might be getting another one. He hoped he would be able to sleep it off and so went to bed. During the night, he got much worse and when he tried to get out of bed in the morning he collapsed. He had to be carried to an emergency GP appointment by his housemates and the doctor immediately sent him to Derriford Hospital where he was admitted and diagnosed with Miller Fisher syndrome. Mr Kelly said: 'It's given me a real appreciation for life. You never know what is around the corner and what will happen. While it was a horrible experience, I was lucky in a way as I now know how much I have' During his illness, Mr Kelly was dependent upon a wheelchair as his legs were to weak to support him. He says the experience was awful as he had no idea what was happening to his body . He said: ‘You never think about getting out of bed in the morning – you just take for granted that your feet will take your weight – so it was a shock not to be able to do that. ‘I was in a total panic – I had no idea what was happening.’ He added: ‘I was worried about my mum and dad – I didn’t know what to say to them. They were worried sick.’ Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare, acquired nerve disease that is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome. It causes abnormal muscle coordination and paralysis of the eye muscles. It can also cause general muscle weakness and breathing problems. Mr Kelly (left, with his mother, Linda, and friend, Luke) said while he was ill he was concerned about his parents because they were 'worried sick' about his health . Mr Kelly said he decided to take part in the Tough Guy competitions as he wanted to prove he had fully recovered and that he didn't need 'nannying'. He says after his illness he had been 'wrapped in cotton wool' Symptoms often develop after a viral illness and most patients start to recover within two to four weeks. Mr Kelly’s condition continued to deteriorate while he was in hospital and he says that at one point the hospital staff asked him if he would like a visit from the pastor. He said: ‘I had no idea what was going on – I didn’t know how bad it was going to get. ‘When they offered a visit from the pastor, that was the worst.’ Mr Kelly spent a week in the stroke unit during which time he received intensive physiotherapy in an attempt to help him walk again. He said: ‘I was easily the youngest person in the stroke unit – it’s not a pleasant place. Mr Kelly said: 'I am very lucky. Many people who have the ability to walk, or to see, taken away don't get it back. I appreciate things so much more now - you don't realise how lucky you are until these things are taken away' ‘A lot of the people there were much worse than me – that kept me going as I could see that my situation could be much worse.’ After a week and a half in hospital, Mr Kelly was able to walk again with support and he was released from hospital to continue his recovery at home. He said: ‘I am very, very lucky. Many people who have the ability to walk, or to see properly, taken away don’t get it back. ‘I appreciate things so much more now – you don’t realise how lucky you are until these things are taken away.’ Mr Kelly will take part in his next Tough Guy competition in January and he will be raising money for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital . Since his recovery, Mr Kelly has taken part in Tough Guy competitions which involve completing long assault courses which are littered with obstacles such as fire, electric cables, barbed wire and half-flooded tunnels. He said: ‘I was wrapped in cotton wool after being in hospital so I wanted to prove that I had come through it. ‘I wanted to prove to everyone that I didn’t need nannying – my parents told me not to do it but I decided to give it a go anyway.’ Mr Kelly will take part in his next Tough Guy event on January 26 to raise money for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

"On any normal day you would be forgiven for raising a speculative eyebrow at scaremongers professing that the sky is caving in. But on Saturday it really did fall, as many star-gazers were lucky enough to see. The first peak of the annual Lyrid meteor shower happened just after midnight, putting on an eye-catching display, visible across the world. NASA scientists tracked the shower with a network of cameras on earth, the International Space Station and a research balloon as they attempted to capture the display in 3D for the first time. Scroll down for video . Impressive: This picture of the Lyrida meteor shower was taken in Hungary . Sky show: This year's shower was better than in previous years because of a new moon setting darker skies and providing perfect conditions for meteor watching . This year’s show was better than in previous years because of a new moon setting darker skies and providing perfect conditions for meteor watching. Bill Cooke, NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office at the agency's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, told MSNBC: ‘The moon messes a lot of stuff. I like the moon … but it can keep us from getting work done.’ Technology: A 'Meteor Counter' iPhone app was created to allow members of the public to join in, counting the number of meteors and sending the data to NASA . At its fiercest there were between 15 . and 20 meteors every hour.  A ‘Meteor Counter’ iPhone app was created to . allow members of the public to join in, counting the number of meteors . and sending the data to NASA. In past years rate has reached . heights of 100-per-hour but Cooke warned wannabe-astrologers not to set . their hopes to high and expect to see just a handful each hour. In some areas the Lyrids were seen as well as heard. A loud explosion, likely caused by a meteor, was heard across Nevada and California at around 8am on Sunday morning, rattling windows and shaking houses. Excited witnesses said they saw a fireball streak across the sky at the same time and experts said the reports indicated the meteor broke up somewhere over the Sierra southwest of Reno. For those plagued by local cloud cover, unable to see the show themselves. Cooke . hosted a ‘NASA up all night’ webchat to discuss the Lyrids in . real-time and . there is a second chance to see it. Tonight the shower is set to happen . again, with its best display running from 11pm to 5am. The Lyrids occur every year as a result of the Earth passing through debris left by Comet Thatcher, and the shower has been occurring for at least 2600 years. Specks of Thatcher’s dust hit the top of earth’s atmosphere at 110,000 mph and disintegrate in a flurry of meteors, enjoyed by spectators worldwide. The actual comet is far from earth at the moment – orbiting the sun once every 415 years – but debris from it has spread out along its path, mostly pieces of dust or rock smaller than grains of sand. As the meteors push through the atmosphere they burn up 50 to 70 miles above the ground, producing a vivid display of light. Meteors best seen in places away from light pollution. Lyrids are typically about as bright as the stars of the Big Dipper, making them relatively easy to spot for the novice gazer. Giving advice to amateurs, Cooke said: 'The last thing you want to do is look at Lyra, which is the direction of the radiant, because the meteors in that direction have very short tails and will appear as a dot to you. 'The best thing to do with any meteor shower is to go out there, lie on your back and look straight up.’ Starshine: Lyrids are typically about as bright as the stars of the Big Dipper, making them relatively easy to spot for the novice gazer .

"People who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the Moon's cycle . People who have heart surgery when there is a full moon stay in hospital for less time than those who have surgery at other stages of the Moon’s cycle, research suggests. A study carried out by Rhode Island Hospital, in the U.S., revealed that surgery, especially that to correct acute aortic dissection, tends to result in a lower death rate when the Moon is waning. The research was carried out to establish the effect of natural time variations on survival rates and length of hospital stay following heart surgery. ‘While there has been previous research on the seasonal impacts of cardiovascular disease, there has not been any data about the effect of the lunar cycles on cardiac cases, until now,’ said senior author Dr Frank Sellke. He added: ‘We focused the study on patients having aortic dissection and found that the odds of dying following this procedure were greatly reduced during the waning full moon, and that length of stay was also reduced during the full moon.’ Aortic dissection occurs when there is a tear in the lining of the aorta. This tear allows a column of blood to enter the aortic wall forcing the layers apart. This causes severe pain and is classed as a medical emergency as it can quickly lead to death without treatment. Researchers studied the impact of lunar cycles and seasonal variation on two surgical groups – one of patients having repair of ascending aortic dissection, and another of patients having aortic dissection and either aortic valve surgery, coronary bypass surgery, or both. They also studied the relationship between the lunar cycle and the length of the patients' stay in hospital. The study also revealed that surgery, especially that to correct acute aortic dissection, tends to result in a lower death rate when the Moon is waning . The study indicated that patients who . have aortic dissection repairs performed during the full moon phase had a . significantly shorter length of stay than those who were treated during . other stages of the Moon’s cycle – 10 days for the full moon cycle . compared to 14 days for the other phases. ‘Can we always plan for such procedures to be performed around lunar cycles? Of course not,’ Dr Sellke said. ‘But better understanding the effects of the environment – including seasonal and lunar cycles – on our health can help us to better understand these rhythms, and ultimately provide better care for our patients.’ The research was published in the journal Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery.","Lower death rate was observed following heart surgery which takes place when the Moon is waning (getting thinner)

"A bus driver is being investigated by his bosses after he was apparently caught on film urinating on his vehicle. The film, which was shot by a passerby, appears to show the driver zipping up his flies after relieving himself out of a gap between the central doors of his empty bus. Johnson Rotimi, 24, captured the moment through the window of the Arriva bus parked in Crouch End, London. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Caught on camera: The bus driver appears to have been caught urinating on his bus (left) before turning around and zipping up his flies (right) Mr Rotimi said: 'I just happened to walk by and I saw him doing his thing. 'He actually hadn’t left the bus at the time. 'You know the second doors? He was actually peeing in the corner with his back facing towards me, through the little gap between the doors and the bus. 'When I saw him I was kind of shocked to be honest, then I quickly got my phone and started filming it. Zipping up: The footage was captured by a passerby through the window of the Arriva bus which was parked in Crouch End, London . 'He was quite angry when he realised. He did give me a bit of a middle finger.' The moustached driver is understood to have been taking a break to check his bus - the W3 from Finsley Park to Northumberland Park - when he stopped to urinate in Elmfield Avenue. Trainee forklift driver Johnson, of Hornsley, London, added: 'I just want people to be aware of what is going on on the bus. 'Angry': The passerby said the bus driver was 'quite angry' when he realised he was being filmed . 'I’m not very pleased about it. It is not nice as lots of elderly people and children they have to use the bus, and you know kids, they touch everything, and they could touch that bit when they climb on and off the bus easily.' Bosses at Arriva said they were looking into the incident which happened around two weeks ago. An Arriva spokesman said: 'This is not the sort of behaviour we expect from our drivers. A copy of the video will be passed to the management team in order to identify the driver and take the necessary action.'","Bus driver appears to have been caught on film urinating on his bus .

"Victim: Reema Ramzan was killed by her boyfriend Aras Hussein in June last year, a court heard . A man decapitated his teenage girlfriend while she was still alive then stabbed himself in the chest, a court heard today. Aras Hussein, 21, had allegedly blackmailed 18-year-old Reema Ramzan by taking sexual photographs of her and threatening to share them with her family if she broke up with him. Sheffield Crown Court was told that on June 4 last year, he killed her by cutting off her head with a knife before inflicting stab wounds on himself. Prosecutor Graham Reeds QC outlined the case against Iraqi-born Hussein, who denies murder and actual bodily harm. 'Bruising into tissue wounds suggest that Reema was still alive as the defendant started to remove her head,' the lawyer said. 'The process of decapitation would require considerable motion with corresponding considerable force which needed to be sustained until all the tissues had been cut through. 'Force would also be needed to restrain the victim who is likely to have been struggling. Severe force would have been needed to cut through the spinal vertebrae with a knife in order to remove the head.' Mr Reeds told the jury that Hussein was seen naked outside his flat in Sheffield with blood pouring out of his chest, and told emergency workers: 'I don't know why I did it. 'She like me but I raped her. What I did was wrong. I need punishing for it.' He also allegedly asked the paramedics: 'Why are you helping me? I've murdered someone.' The lawyer said Hussein was likely to claim he was suffering from diminished responsibility due to schizophrenia at the time of the attack. Home: The alleged attack took place at Hussein's flat in Sheffield, pictured, on June 4 last year . Investigation: Forensic officers pictures scouring the block of flats at the time of the incident . Mr Reeds said that Miss Ramzan's family disapproved of her relationship with Hussein, who repeatedly came into conflict with her relatives. On one occasion, the QC said, the defendant was warned by police for taking sexually explicit pictures of his girlfriend and threatening to show them to her family if she ever left him. In another incident, Miss Ramzan's brother Sohail argued with the defendant after seeing red marks on her neck, but Hussein told him 'he'd do what he liked'. Mr Reeds said it was known that on the day she died, Miss Ramzan went to Hussein's flat with her passport and a large amount of money. 'She did not tell anyone from her family she was going there,' he said. 'She did not tell anyone why she had her passport and this money with her.' A neighbour of Hussein's later heard a woman 'screaming for dear life', the prosecutor said. Horror: Neighbours reported seeing Hussein naked and covered in blood after stabbing himself, jurors heard . The defendant stabbed himself in the chest with a large kitchen knife, removed his blood-stained clothes and went outside, the court heard. One neighbour who saw him in the car park holding his passport and a wad of money thought he had been shot. Hussein was calm when he was first arrested, but after he was taken to the nearby Northern General Hospital for treatment he attacked staff trying to help him, Mr Reeds said. He allegedly assaulted a cardiothoracic surgeon and an anaesthetist as well as police officers who tried to restrain him, biting one of them, before he was injected with a sedative. Mr Reeds said the prosecution rejected Hussein's likely defence of diminished responsibility. He said he had 'no history of mental illness', adding: 'He was able to function perfectly well - he held down a job, he lived on his own, he had his own flat and, it's a self-evident truth, he had a girlfriend.' The lawyer continued: 'The prosecution case is that his behaviour right up until the time of the killing was entirely ordinary. Of course the killing itself was anything but ordinary. 'The prosecution say that his behaviour at the time of the killing is much more likely to be explained by the fact he had a propensity towards violence and his controlling behaviour towards Reema.' The trial continues.

"New photographs of Alice Gross were released by her family today as they finally said farewell to the teenager at a humanist funeral service designed to 'focus on the joy of Alice's life'. As the family of the murdered teenager described her as 'so spirited, so present, so vital and so full of promise', they joined Alice's friends and teachers at a humanist funeral service near their family home in Hanwell, west London. Her parents, Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross, and sister, Nina, said: 'We find it almost impossible to understand what has happened and that we have to say goodbye to her', . But they said they wanted the schoolgirl's funeral - held eight weeks to the day since she left home for the last time - to 'focus on the joy of Alice's life and the joy of having known her'. Scroll down for video . New photos of Alice Gross were released by her family today as they held a private funeral for the 14-year-old . Alice's family also released this photograph today showing Alice, centre left, with her parents and sister, Nina . Traffic stopped and local residents came out of their houses and bowed their heads as the funeral procession swept past the flower-covered clock tower in Hanwell, west London, which has become a focal point for those mourning the 14-year-old. The hearse carried a brightly coloured coffin which had been painted by Alice's grandmother and decorated with a meadow scene showing Alice's pet cats and dog. The schoolgirl's famly thanked people in their local community in Hanwell 'for being so kind and supportive', and said the funeral was a 'humanist celebration... full of music, with videos of Alice playing and singing songs she wrote herself'. Alice's parents and sister paid tribute to their daughter, while her grandfather read Surprised By Joy by William Wordsworth, written by the poet at the loss of his own three-year-old daughter. The coffin, featuring Alice's cats Lottie, Louis and Pattie, and dog, Peggy, was painted to reflect her love of nature by her grandmother, Anne Hodgkiss, and family friend, Carole McCourt. Meanwhile, mourners sang You Are My Sunshine, while Alice's music teachers performed musical tributes to the schoolgirl who was known for her musical talent. The clock tower near the murdered teenager's home in west London has become a focal point for mourners . Cortege: A hearse bearing Alice's yellow-painted coffin drove through Hanwell, west London, this morning . Paying their respects: Alice's murder this summer left the local community in west London devastated . The disappearance two months ago and murder of the Hanwell schoolgirl devastated the local community . Yellow ribbons - once a symbol of hope that Alice would be found alive - festooned trees, railings and traffic signs along the funeral cortege's route. Locals lit small candles arranged to spell out 'We love you Alice' and watered flowers, many of them yellow, ahead of the funeral. One note left at the clock tower said: 'You will always be in our hearts.' Marion McCarthy, 39, a nurse from nearby Ealing, said the effect on the community had been 'horrendous'. She said: 'It has brought a sense of shock. We have been united. I'm a mother of a girl the same age. It's every parent's worst scenario ever.' Only family and friends were invited to attend the funeral today, but there will be a public memorial ceremony for her on 2 November at Greenford Town Hall. The family said they wanted to thank local people 'whose outpouring of support and grief has touched them very deeply'. The beautifully decorated coffin was a reminder that Alice had barely entered her teens before she was killed . Yellow flowers and ribbons covered the clock tower which has become a shrine to the teenager's memory . The streets of Hanwell have been covered with yellow ribbons since the school went missing on 28 August . Alice Gross was last seen on 28 August and her body was found on 30 September in the River Brent . Mourners wiped their eyes as the funeral procession for the 14-year-old schoolgirl passed by this morning . 'You will always be the brightest star in the sky': The hearse was filled with wreaths and notes to Alice . The community in Hanwell, west London, was deeply affected by the murder of the well-loved teenager . They added: 'We would like to thank everyone for being so kind and supportive. 'We have been moved by the depth of sympathy and compassion around us, not only from close family and friends but also from the local community.' And they asked those who wanted to make a donation to give to the Youth Music charity in Alice's memory. In a statement released by the family, they spoke of her love for music, saying: 'A tribute and donation page has been set up in Alice's memory with Youth Music. 'We feel this is a fitting tribute to our daughter Alice. She loved music and loved making music and would have wanted other children to experience this joy.' Ealing Council leader Julian Bell said: 'Even on this most difficult of days, it is testament to the family's generosity of spirit that they would rather people remembered Alice by making a donation to the charity the National Foundation for Youth Music.' Flags were flown at half-mast over Ealing Town Hall, symbolising the grief of the local community which was devastated by Alice's disappearance and murder over the summer. Grief: Alice lived with her parents Rosalind Hodgkiss and Jose Gross and her elder sister, Nina Gross . Alice left her family home in Hanwell at around 1pm on 28 August, telling her mother she would be home by 6pm. At 4.26pm she was captured on CCTV walking along the canal under Trumper's Way, a bridge crossing the canal, heading back towards Hanwell.  CCTV also showed a cyclist, later identified as murder suspect Arnis Zalkalns, cycling a few minutes behind her. On 1 September her parents appealed for her to get in touch, saying they desperately missed her. On 3 September convicted murderer Arnis Zalkalns, 41, was last seen at home in Ealing, where he lived with his partner and child. Latvian builder Arnis Zalkalns, left, is believed to have murdered the 14-year-old who went missing in August . The next day Zalkalns, a builder from Latvia, failed to meet a friend and bike to work with him - Zalkalns, who rode a red Trek mountain bike, would always cycle along the Grand Union Canal to work on a building site in Isleworth. On 5 September Zalkalns was reported missing from his home to police. Six days later, police say builders found Alice's bag in undergrowth near the canal the day after she went missing.  It contained the trainers she was wearing when she left her house, underwear, and rubbish from her packed lunch, but not her white iPhone, which was last used on 28 August. On 16 September detectives appeared on BBC Crimewatch appealing for help in tracing Alice and saying they wanted to find another missing person, Arnis Zalkalns. Two days later, they admitted they were treating him as a suspect, and the day after that, a reward of £20,000 for information leading to Alice was announced.  Police said the hunt for Alice and her killer was the biggest manhunt staged by the Met since the 7/7 London bombings in 2005. On the weekend of 20/21 September, British detectives finally asked police in Latvia, where Zalkalns had a conviction for murdering his wife, for help. On 30 September, Alice's body was found in the River Brent, covered in plastic and hidden under logs. Zalkalns' body was found hanged in woodland in Boston Manor Park, just a mile from where Alice's body was found, on 4 October. The general labourer, who worked at a building site in Isleworth, west London, is believed to have come to the UK in 2007, but authorities here are thought to have had no record of his murder conviction. A review of how the case was handled is currently being carried out by Scotland Yard. Inquests into both their deaths have been opened and adjourned, with further tests going on to find out how Alice died.","Alice's family say they are 'devastated by appalling circumstances of death'

"Ross McCormack says he is motivated to help Fulham return to the Premier League at the first attempt and not by his earnings from his big money move from Leeds. McCormack scored 29 goals for Leeds last season, but quit the club in the summer after claiming his and the club’s ambitions were moving in opposite directions. The striker is getting used to his new surroundings at Fulham and says he is enjoying life under new manager Felix Magath. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Top 10 Ross McCormack transfer memes . Ready to go: Ross McCormack took part in Fulham's open training session alongside fellow summer signing Thomas Eisfeld . Speaking to club sponsors Marathonbet.com, McCormack said: ‘When I had a chat with the manager and the chief executive in the summer it was all about me coming here and being part of the squad that gets Fulham back to the Premier League. ‘People talk about footballers being motivated by money but I would like to look at it at the end of my career and put my finger on this point where I helped Fulham get back to the Premier League. I will remember that more than what I was earning. ‘Obviously the club paid a bit of money to get me here, so it is always nice for another club to want you that much. Up for the challenge: McCormack says he is motivated to get Fulham back into the Premier League . ‘With me and Leeds our ambitions were going in different directions. ‘I felt as if my time was up there and I was lucky to have a club like Fulham just coming down from the Premier League who wanted me that much.’ There has been a huge turnover of players at Craven Cottage this summer with a lot of older players like John Arne Riise, Giorgos Karagounis and Brede Hangeland all leaving the club and Magath promoting players from the successful youth academy, and McCormack has been impressed with what he has seen. Always wanting more: . The striker added: ‘We have a lot of good kids, Pat Roberts is a special talent. ‘George Williams has surprised me more than most because I did not really know much about him before I came here, but he is a fantastic little player, he’ll play a big part during the season. ‘Moussa (Dembele) will score a few goals and then you have got the obvious like Scott Parker, the captain, who has been around and is a good influence on everyone.’ Special talent: McCormack is impressed with England youngster Patrick Roberts . Surprise package: George Williams could play an important role for Fulham this season . German manager Magath is well known for his tough training techniques and putting the emphasis on fitness, but McCormack has no complaints. He added: ‘He is always trying to improve us. He is always on our backs to keep doing more, and if you feel you have no more to give he is trying to find another gear still so it is pretty good to have a manager motivating you that way. ‘Everything has been about professionalism since I have been here, from the training, coming down for meals at the same time and everyone wearing the same gear so it is just professionalism.’","Scottish striker looking forward to new challenge at Fulham .

"A huge road, rail and house-building programme worth £100billion is to be unveiled by the government tomorrow. George Osborne promised huge new investment in infrastructure projects, spending £50billion every year until 2020. But Labour dismissed the package as a ‘con’ claiming there was no new money with budgets actually being cut. Dig for victory: George Osborne boasted the the government was ordering a record-breaking investment in construction projects, including rail, roads and homes . Clash: Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) accused Mr Osborne of a 'con' and funding on capital spending was falling in real terms . The government is pinning its hopes on securing the economic recovery by diverting money into large-scale construction projects. Ministers will tomorrow unveil details of billions of pounds of road and rail upgrades, new energy projects including investment in nuclear and renewables and thousands of new affordable homes. Mr Osborne told the Commons: ‘Successive governments of all colours have put short term pressures over the long term needs and refused to commit to capital spending plans that match the horizons of a modern economy. ‘Today we change that. We commit now to £50 billion pounds of capital investment in 2015. ‘From roads to railways, bridges to broadband, science to schools… it will amount to over £300 billion of capital spending guaranteed to the end of this decade.’ But Labour dismissed the statement as a ‘con’, pointing out that there was no new money for infrastructure. Infrastructure: Billions of pounds in extra building projects have been directed towards transport, justice and business in an attempt to kickstart growth . The £50 billion capital spending announced for 2015-16 amounted to a 1.7 per cent cut in real terms, Labour claimed. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘They have done nothing – zero. It's a complete capital spending con. There is nothing here.’ In March the government pledged £300 billion of capital spending by 2020. Mr Osborne said the first £50 billion would be spent in 2015-16, the year covered by the spending review. That was more on average as a proportion of national income over the decade than between 2000 and 2010, he said, as he sought to counter criticisms he has failed to do enough to spur growth. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander will tomorrow give details of where the first £100billion of the £300billion total will be spent. The Department for Transport capital budget has been boosted to a guaranteed £9.5 billion a year for the rest of the decade. Mr Osborne said this would pay for the biggest investment in roads for 50 years and ‘the largest investment in our railways since the Victorian age’. Mayor of London Boris Johnson welcomed a big boost - a grant of £925 million in 2015/16 rising to just over £1 billion by 2020/21 on top of enhanced borrowing powers to fund transport in the capital. Science - an area the Government has been accused of neglecting - will see its capital budget increase from £0.6 billion to £1.1 billion as part of a 9per cent rise in capital investment at the Department of Business Innovation and Skills. Mr Osborne also outlined commitments to new flood defences. Investment: Mr Osborne (left) promised £50billion for 2015-21 to spend on infrastructure projects, details of which will be set out by Treasury minister Danny Alexander (right) tomorrow . Capital funding for education would be £4.6 billion in 2015-16 - part of a £21 billion package over the 2015-20 parliament - which would ‘tackle the backlog of maintenance in existing schools and invest in new school places’, he indicated. And there would be £3 billion capital investment in affordable housing. John Cridland, CBI Director-General, said: ‘Infrastructure is rightly singled out as the most effective engine for growth, as we urged. ‘While the Government talks a good game on infrastructure we've seen too little delivery on the ground so far. ‘It is critical we see a real pipeline of projects announced tomorrow, so investors know what schemes are going ahead, where and when.’ Institution of Civil Engineers director general, Nick Baveystock, said: ‘The severe infrastructure investment cuts made in the 2010 spending review have begun to bite and are undermining the sector's ability to stimulate growth or job creation, so we are encouraged to see a review with actual infrastructure investment at its heart. ‘The increase in capital expenditure and funding certainty for key programmes appears to be positive news and could provide a platform for the industry to deliver on national needs more effectively. ‘It is however, not all good news for infrastructure. Departmental cuts will inevitably place further pressure on local authority budgets, with road maintenance likely to suffer the brunt.’","Osborne promises £50billion for infrastructure every year until 2020 .

"An Italian construction engineer abducted in Libya four months ago has been freed and is on his way home after the militia holding him was paid one million euro ransom. The Italian Foreign Ministry confirmed Marco Vallisa, 54, had been released, but provided no details of how he came to be liberated. But a security source in Libya said he had been held by 'an armed militia' who freed him after they obtained a 'ransom of around one million euros (£790,000).' The practice of paying ransoms has been heavily criticized by both U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron. They claim 'tens of millions of dollars' have been paid to extremists in what ultimately promotes terror against Britain and other Western countries. Italian engineer Marco Vallisa was working in the coastal city of Zwara (pictured) when he was kidnapped . The fierce fighting which engulfed Libya in 2011 (pictured) has now ceased although the country remains divided by factions of militias . The source, who declined to be named, did not identify the group but also confirmed that Vallisa was on his way home. Three years after dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in a NATO-backed revolt, Libya is awash with weapons and powerful militias, and run by rival governments and parliaments. One of the militias, the Fajr Libya coalition of Islamists, controls the capital, Tripoli, and areas in the west of the North African country. Former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi (pictured) was toppled and killed in a NATO-backed revolt . Vallisa was working in the coastal city of Zwara, west of Tripoli, for Italian building group Piacentini Costruzioni when he was kidnapped on July 5. Two colleagues taken with him, Bosnian Petar Matic and Emilio Gafuri from Macedonia, were released two days later. At the time Italian media said the abduction was thought to have been motivated by the possibility of securing a ransom. Marco Bricconi, the mayor of Mr Vallisa's hometown Cadeo, said his release was 'the end of a nightmare'. Vallisa's liberation leaves a total of five Italians who are thought held by abductors in various hotspots around the world. Aid workers Vanessa Marzullo and Greta Ramelli went missing in July in Syria, where Jesuit priest Paolo Dall'Oglio was kidnapped in July 2013. Engineer Gianluca Salviato was kidnapped in Libya in March and another aid worker, Giovanni Lo Porto, disappeared in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area in January 2012.","Italian engineer on his way home after huge ransom paid for his release .

"Britain could see a repeat of the North Sea oil boom after  it was confirmed that vast deposits of gas lie beneath much of the country. Ministers said ‘today is the day that Britain gets serious about shale’ gas after revealing resources are many times greater than estimated. The British Geological Survey has estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the North of England alone. Industry experts claim even if only 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the North Sea – it will be enough to power Britain for 50 years. Heat: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said reserves of shale gas were double the size previously thought . The BGS said the best estimate for shale gas deposits in northern England is 1,329trillion cubic feet, although their research suggested the figure could be as high as 2,281. With a similar study for shale being carried out in the Weald basin, which covers parts of Kent, Sussex and Surrey, it will fuel hopes the UK energy landscape can be transformed like the US, where drilling – or fracking – has driven down prices. Hot air: Mr Alexander took a swipe at shadow chancellor Ed Balls (pictured) Energy minister Michael Fallon said it would be ‘irresponsible’ to ignore the potential of shale gas. He added: ‘Today is the day that Britain gets serious about shale. ‘It has the potential to contribute to our energy security, increase investment, to create tax revenues, and to generate significant income for local communities.’ Asked whether it would reduce consumers’ bills, Mr Fallon said: ‘It has the potential to be a game-changer for energy security, it’s another source of home-grown, indigenous energy supply, which we certainly need. ‘We don’t know yet whether it could be a game-changer on price to the scale it’s been in the US. 'That’s why it would be pretty irresponsible not to encourage people to . . . have a look.’ Tax breaks and a more streamlined planning process were also announced yesterday in a bid to boost shale exploration. So far, only one investigative dig has taken place – near  Blackpool in Lancashire – although experts expect up to 50 investigative wells by the end of 2015. To encourage exploration, the industry has offered ‘community benefits’ to residents willing to allow drilling. As well as receiving £100,000 for each well, communities will be given 1 per cent of production revenues. Campaigners say drilling could scar the . countryside, pollute water supplies, and clog roads with hundreds of . lorries transporting gas and dirty water. Protest: Opponents say the process of fracking can trigger earthquakes and shale gas cannot solve Britain's energy problems . Friends of the Earth energy campaigner Tony Bosworth said: ‘Shale gas is not the solution to the UK's energy challenges. Its potential has been hugely over-hyped and there's little evidence it will drive down fuel prices. ‘Extracting shale gas will have a significant effect on local communities and our environment - the more that's extracted, the bigger those impacts will be. ‘The North could be at the heart of Britain's green energy and economic transformation, but not by turning it into another 'gaslands'.’","1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under UK - double previous estimates .

"The White House said Monday that President Barack Obama is prepared to go it alone – 'regardless of borders' – if he decides to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) inside Syria. 'I'm not going to speculate about what sort of congressional approval would be requested or required' if the president decided to chase ISIS across the invisible border between Iraq and Syria, spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. He noted that Obama 'has not made a decision to order additional military action in Syria.' But 'the president has already demonstrated a willingness,' Earnest insisted, 'to use military force to protect the American people, regardless of borders.' Scroll down for video . No Congress, no problem: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest won't say what kind of permission Obama might need before attacking ISIS inside Syria . Happy warrior: Obama headed back to Washington from his vacation paradise on Martha's Vineyard Sunday night, but not before posing for photos with a cheering airport throng . America's recent mini-campaign of targeted airstrikes against ISIS positions in northern Iraq is in part the result of an engraved invitation from the topsy-turvy government in Baghdad. No such welcome has been extended by Bashar al-Assad, the decidedly anti-American dictator in Damascus. ISIS enjoys influence across a wide swath of land in both Iraq and Syria, presenting the Pentagon with the possibility that decisive victories in Iraq could drive the group to safe haven in Assad's country. Defeating them there could present the Pentagon with an unwelcome outcome if the terror group's forces regroup inside Syria. ISIS also represents a threat to Assad's rule, meaning that crushing ISIS once and for all could have the unintended consequence of strengthening the strongman. Calling on the example of Navy SEAL raid that killed al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on Pakistani soil, Earnest suggested Monday that Assad's assent to chase ISIS past where Iraqi territory ends wouldn't be required. 'The United States was not invited in by the Pakistani government' to take out bin Laden, Earnest reminded reporters. 'That was a decision the president made.' But members of Congress were kept in the loop about the bin Laden raid for months as tactical options were weighed. One aide to a Republican who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee told MailOnline that if Obama were to make a unilateral move in Syria, his boss 'would be beyond upset.' 'No one wants it to come to that, given how much friction there already is between the White House and about half of [Capitol] Hill right now,' he said. A spokesman for the House Armed Services Committee told MailOnline that Rep. Buck McKeon, the committee's chairman, is even more concerned with Obama's failure to present Congress and the American people with a coherent strategy for defeating ISIS. Earnest took pains to point out that Obama had 'hosted a meeting here the last week that Congress was in town' in July, 'where he invited up members – both Democrats and Republicans, from both the House and the Senate – to talk through some of these issues.' Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad (L) could be a big winner if Obama sweeps into his country and rids it of ISIS, but Rep. Buck McKeon (R) says Obama hasn't come up with a plan to fight ISIS -- much less a request to Congress for military authority . 'There's also consultation that can be done, and has been done, at the staff level,' Earnest said. 'But in terms of what may be required if the president were to take or order a specific action, I'm just not in a position to speculate.' Obama sought permission from Congress nearly a year ago to launch military strikes against Assad, after international observers reported that his regime used chemical weapons against rebel groups that had opposed him since 2011. 'The military has positioned assets in the region,' he said in an August 31, 2013 speech. 'We are prepared to strike whenever we choose, and I am prepared to give that order.' But he added that he would 'seek authorization for the use of force from the American people's representatives in Congress.' Obama made it clear then that he believed he had the authority to strike without the say-so of Congress, but said that he believed America would emerge 'stronger' if he involved legislators. Earnest said Monday that there are no lessons to be taken from that episode. 'That was a different situation, right?' he said, 'precisely because what the president was talking about in that scenario was ensuring that the Assad regime didn't use chemical weapons, or would pay a price for what the intel community had assessed was his use of chemical weapons.' 'What we're talking about now isn't the Assad regime, but about this threat that's posed by ISIL' – the White House's preferred name for ISIS – 'that's operating both in Iraq and in Syria.' 'These are complicated situations and they always will be,' Earnest added later. 'But what's not complicated is the president's willingness to act decisively and authoritatively in ordering military strikes to protect the American people.'","Spokesman Josh Earnest compared the idea to killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan without permission from that nation's government .

"Outspoken: Michael Buerk has hit out at presenters who say they are victims of ageism, claiming many only got their jobs because of their looks . BBC veteran Michael Buerk says TV presenters who got their jobs through their beauty have no right to complain if they're axed when their looks fade. While the anchorman has expressed his satisfaction that broadcasters are now featuring more and more experienced talent, such as Great British Bake-Off presenter Mary Berry, he says many of those that complain about ageism should not have been given their roles in the first place. He said: '""Presenter"" in any case is a very recent job description dreamt up to provide somebody who fronts a programme without any special reason for being on it. 'And if you got the job in the first place mainly because you look nice, I can't see why you should keep it when you don't.' A number of stars have accused the BBC of ageism over the years. Anna Ford, 70, has accused the corporation of discriminating against anyone over 60. Meanwhile, former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an age discrimination case against the BBC in 2011 after she was dropped from the rural affairs show. Buerk's comments come as ITV executive Peter Fincham admitted that it is the older age group who drive viewing figures and they need to be given programmes they have an appetite for. The BBC’s hit drama Last Tango in Halifax, a love story between elderly Celia and Alan, played by Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi, and the box office smash hit film The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which tells the tale of pensioners looking for a warm place in India to retire, are recent examples of the value of courting older viewers. In his interview with the Radio Times, Mr Buerk he also turned his ire on BBC3, describing most of the channel's output as 'the embarrassing end of drivel'. Journalist Anna Ford, 70, has accused the corporation of discriminating against anyone over 60, while former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly won an age discrimination case against the BBC .

It will be replaced with a BBC1 +1 service and an extra hour of children's programmes - and some of its existing shows will be shown on BBC1 and BBC2 with the majority available on the iPlayer. Buerk, whose BBC career includes stints on The One Show, The Moral Maze and BBC Breakfast, described Snog, Marry, Avoid? - which has run on the digital channel for six series - as 'cutting-edge tripe'. He told the Radio Times: 'The BBC had BBC3, a channel much maligned in its lifetime, mourned unconvincingly in its passing, rather like Tony Benn.' Mr Buerk's comments are featured in the 12-18 April edition of the Radio Times . He added: 'It did launch a few good comedies, but a lot of what I saw was at the embarrassing end of drivel. 'Britain's bravest youth media brand', as the BBC put it, will be relegated to the internet. 'We're told that's where youngsters forage for their entertainment these days, but everybody's still acting as though BBC3 has had a bullet in the back of the head.' Among the shows launched on BBC3 are Gavin and Stacey, Little Britain and the award-winning documentary Our War.

"Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had one more surprise in his bag of upsets, beating second seeded Roger Federer 7-5 7-6 (3) to cap a scintillating march to the Rogers Cup title on Sunday. After knocking off world number one Novak Djokovic in the third round, taking out twice champion and eighth seed Andy Murray in the quarters and seventh seed Grigor Dimitrov in the semis, Tsonga denied 17-time grand slam winner Federer a landmark 80th career title. 'I played well all this week, I beat many good guys,' said Tsonga. 'It's a big achievement because I worked really hard to come back from my knee injury last year.

It marked the first time since 2002 that a player had beaten the four top seeds to win a Masters series event.

In a week of superb performances, Tsonga may have saved his best for last, the second seeded Swiss unable to manage a single break chance the entire match. Federer did not allow Tsonga many break opportunities himself but the one he did, in the first set, was all the Frenchman needed converting the chance to clinch the set and a 1-0 lead. Play remained tight in the second with no break points, the set going to a tie-break won by Tsonga, who took four straight points after the breaker had been deadlocked at 3-3 . 'What is achieved is achieved and I will just continue on this way, continue to work hard,' said Tsonga, when asked about his U.S. Open chances. 'This win gives me a lot of hope for the rest of the year, of course. 'But I will continue to do my work like I did last couple of months and I hope I will continue to win.'

"Liquid nitrogen cocktails are ‘unsafe’ because drinkers’ bodies cannot cope with the freezing ‘extreme cold temperatures’ inside their bodies, the government has warned. Health minister Anna Soubry even suggested the latest drinks craze is against the law. She spoke out after teenager Gaby Scanlon had her stomach removed after being bought two 'Nitro Jagermeister' cocktails to celebrate her 18th birthday this month. Cooling cocktail:  Liquid nitrogen is used in some luxury cocktails and is known for freezing everything it comes into contact with . Miss Scanlon downed both drinks in quick succession before becoming breathless and being rushed to hospital with 'horrendous stomach pains'. Doctors diagnosed a perforated stomach and she later tweeted: 'I nearly died.' Health experts said she was the victim of a 'irresponsible alcohol industry. Now Ms Soubry has warned against the drinks, and revealed inspectors are being trained to crackdown on pubs and clubs who are putting their customers’ lives at risk. Health minister Anna Soubry warned food standards inspectors could take action to strip pubs and clubs of their licence if they serve dangerous drinks . ‘Although liquid nitrogen is not a toxic substance, its extreme cold temperature makes it unsafe for people to drink and eat because the human body is unable to cope with such a cold internal temperature,’ Ms Soubry said. ‘All food and drink sold to consumers has to comply with the general requirements of food safety legislation under which it is an offence to sell food which is injurious to health. ‘The sale of food or drink which is unsafe is prohibited under food law.’ Popularised by celebrity chef, Heston Blumenthal, liquid nitrogen - which vapourises at -196C - has been increasingly used in recent years in the preparation of drinks. It is used to chill glasses and is a crowd-pleaser thanks to the dramatic-looking water vapour it releases at room temperature. But it is highly dangerous and can cause very serious cold burns if it comes into contact with skin or tissue and should never be ingested. It is believed the cocktails drunk by the Miss Scanlon still contained drops of the liquid nitrogen which then caused horrendous burns to her stomach. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is responsible for food safety issues. Responding to a series of parliamentary questions, Ms Soubry said the FSA does not need additional laws to govern the use of liquid nitrogen in drinks. She added: ‘If businesses selling alcohol are convicted of food safety offences, this can lead to their alcohol licence being reviewed by the local licensing authority. ‘There are industry safety and handling guidelines around the use and storage of liquid nitrogen. It is the business owner’s responsibility to make sure that their staff have been trained and are aware of potential risks of using liquid nitrogen.' ‘They also have to have appropriate safety measures in place to protect both their staff and consumers.’ Food manufacturers, retailers and . businesses in the UK have a legal obligation to make sure that any and . all food they are serving to the public is fit for human consumption. Liquid nitrogen is formed by cooling down the harmless gas nitrogen to such a low temperature that it becomes liquid. It . is intensely cold (-196°C) and if not used properly can cause frostbite . or cryogenic burns when it comes into contact with living tissue. Professor . Peter Barham, of the University of Bristol's School of Physics, said: . 'As with any very hot or very cold liquid proper safety measures must be . taken - just as no-one would drink boiling water or oil or pour it over . themselves, so no-one should ingest liquid nitrogen. 'Liquid nitrogen can be used safely in the preparation of foods. However, . since it is not safe to ingest liquid nitrogen due care must be taken . to ensure that the liquid has all evaporated before serving any food or . drink that was prepared with liquid nitrogen.' In fact, liquid nitrogen is used in cryotherapy medical treatment to burn away skin abnormalities, such as warts. But it will have the same effect if consumed, burning internal tissue in the stomach. Where . the burn causes a hole or perforation in the stomach wall it will allow . gastric acid to leak into the abdominal cavity, which can be fatal. This is a surgical emergency and in cases where the damage can't be repaired, the stomach will have to be removed. The oesophagus, the muscular tube that transports the food, is connected directly to the small bowel. In the short term a feeding tube may be necessary. But . surprisingly, the body soon adapts to digesting food without a stomach, . where the food is normally stored and mixed during the initial phase of . digestion. The small intestine will act more like a stomach over time and keep food there for longer while it is broken down. Most . normal foods can be eaten after a total gastrectomy - whole stomach . removal - but in smaller portions and more frequently. The operation is . most often performed in cancer patients. Doctors may advise avoiding meals made up of foods high in added sugar. This . is because food will be entering the bowel rapidly and sugar-laden . foods exacerbate the problem, potentially causing a transitory drop in . blood pressure and unpleasant symptoms such as feeling dizzy or faint. People . without a stomach need to have regular injections of vitamin B12 as the . stomach controls its absorption and deficiency can lead to anaemia. Colin Houston, the FSA’s head of . incident management, said: ‘'The FSA will be making local enforcement . officers aware of the practice of using liquid nitrogen in the use of . cocktails and it will be something officers can incorporate as part of . their inspection regime. 'We’re also working with other . departments and agencies to investigate the issue and whether we need to . take any further action.' Miss Scanlon was celebrating her 18th birthday when she fell ill. Dr John Ashton, director of public health for Cumbria, said she was a victim of a dangerous gimmick used to sell more alcohol. He said: 'This girl is the victim of an irresponsible alcohol industry that's now competing on gimmicks. 'People should not be playing chemistry in public houses. This is a very, very cold substance and it is similar to subjecting your oesophagus and stomach to frost bite. 'As this case highlights there are major safety implications and it is time there was better regulation put in place to prevent things like this dreadful incident happening again.' He said a total ban would only lead to increased demand for the dangerous cocktails but said there should be 'stringent regulation.' Dr Ashton said it was time the Government brought in better regulation of the drinks industry to stop such tragic incidents. He added: 'It is shocking that a teenage girl goes out to celebrate her 18th birthday and ends up in intensive care with life-changing injuries. 'The alcohol industry uses these types of gimmicks to make alcoholic drinks more enticing - yet staff can use liquid nitrogen without any proper training. 'These things are allowed to continue in this country because of the Government's lack on control over the drinks industry. 'Essentially it amounts to a form of cowardice because there are drinks industry interests in every constituency and the Government is worried about repercussions.' He said it was time dangerous substances like liquid nitrogen formed part of the licensing application with staff being properly trained to handle it. Consultant gastroenterologists say the teenager will face a lifetime of specialist medical treatment in order to live a normal life. As well as being unable to digest certain things Miss Scanlon will have to avoid some sugary foods and drinks and have regular vitamin injections. Lancashire Police said the Oscars wine bar have ceased selling the liquid nitrogen cocktail. Popularised by celebrity chef, Heston Blumenthal, liquid nitrogen - which vapourises at -196C - has been increasingly used in recent years in the preparation of drinks. It is used to chill glasses and is a crowd-pleaser thanks to the dramatic-looking water vapour it releases at room temperature. But it is highly dangerous and can cause very serious cold burns if it comes into contact with skin or tissue and should never be ingested. It is believed the cocktails drunk by the Miss Scanlon still contained drops of the liquid nitrogen which then caused horrendous burns to her stomach. Trendy: TV chef Heston Blumenthal has pioneered the use of liquid nitrogen in his restaurants including making ice-cream using it . A number of witnesses at the wine bar . were interviewed by police and the premises has stopped selling drinks . containing the liquid gas.

"Opponent: Doctor Chaand Nagpaul, the chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee and a family GP in north-west London . GPs are to hold a vote on charging for appointments. The idea is to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £160million a year. The fees – possibly between £10 and £25 – would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948. One GP said an entire morning's work was lost when 14 patients failed to turn up. Others believe the free care offered by the Health Service is unsustainable in the face of an aging and increasingly obese population. It is feared however that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units. The proposal is to be debated at the British Medical Association's local medical committee conference in York on May 22. If . the vote is passed, the BMA would then have to decide whether to ask . the Department of Health to impose a national charging system. It is likely that the elderly, children, pregnant women and others will be exempt or charged less. Patients could be charged when they book an appointment – an incentive to turn up. The . GP practice would pocket the money – as happens with charges for . writing letters or signing forms – to be reinvested into services. In France patients pay a flat rate of 23 euros (£19) to see a GP and most are reimbursed by insurers, leaving them with a bill of about six euros (£5). But campaigners and many family doctors – including the leaders of the BMA – oppose the idea in Britain. Dr Mike Smith, who chairs the Patients Association, said: 'A move to charge for routine appointments will have a devastating impact on many vulnerable patients. 'This will put pressure on already stretched A&E services as people would be reluctant to pay to visit their GP and will present themselves at the emergency services. 'There are many people today who cannot afford to pay for every GP appointment. 'This practice can be seen as nothing less than profiteering from the most vulnerable as they attempt to access healthcare which is theirs by right.' But there are fears that charging would stop patients seeking help or encourage them to go to overstretched casualty units . Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee and a family doctor in North West London, said: 'The BMA policy still is that we do not support charging patients because it is against the NHS's care being provided at the point of delivery. Anyone who is ill should not have to consider cost as a barrier to seeing their GP.' But Alex Wild, of the TaxPayers' Alliance campaign group, said: 'Missed and unnecessary GP appointments cost taxpayers a fortune so it's no wonder that charges are being considered. 'But until GPs drastically improve the service they provide by working out of office hours and reintroducing more responsive appointments, they should not be asking hard-pressed families to cough up even more cash for a substandard system. 'Primary care must be run for patients, not for doctors.' Dr Nigel Watson, chief executive of the Wessex local medical committee, which is proposing the motion, said: 'Personally I feel that services should be free at the point of access. 'The problem we have at the moment is that the resources that are available don't meet the demand. This is about having a debate about how we move things forward. 'General practice is still seen around the world as one of the strengths of the NHS. To continue this and to build on out-of-hospital care we need more resources. 'If that can't be obtained by taxation it's going to have to come either from closing hospitals down – which is incredibly difficult – or resources need to come from elsewhere. 'Many of us wouldn't want it to come from charging patients but that's why we need a debate.' The motion – uncovered by Pulse magazine – calls on the BMA to 'explore national charging for general practice services with the UK governments'. GPs will also vote on whether to defy the Government's plans for them to keep surgeries open from 8am to 8pm to make it easier for patients to get appointments.","The fee would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948 .

"From incredible devices designed to make humans stronger to clever gadgets that can cut noise pollution and waste from manufacturing processes, engineers have created amazing products designed to make our lives easier. They are fighting it out to win the James Dyson Award, which recognises ideas large and small that have the potential to solve significant problems. A total of 20 ideas have been shortlisted and they range from tackling large problems like renewable energy by generating power from waves, to ripening fruit and vegetables at the best time. A group of U.S. engineers have invented the 'Titan arm' to protect warehouse workers who frequenly lift heavy loads from the risk of arm and back injuries. Their robitic arm is an upper-body exoskeleton that augments human strength and braces the back to prevent poor lifting technique . Handie is an affordable prosthetic hand with inbuilt sensors that can read brain signals. All its parts are easily modified and made using a 3D printer . The winner will be announced on November 7 and will win £30,000. The engineer will follow in the footsteps of Dan Watson, who won the award last year for his SafetyNet device, which encourages sustainable fishing. A total of 650 projects were entered by creative scientists from 18 countries. 'Bold ideas big and small can solve significant problems. The entries into this year's award, from young engineers and scientists around the world all show promise, but are only at the start of the long process towards commercialisation,' Sir James Dyson said. A handful of the engineers set out to solve health-related problems. Karl Price and his team from the University of Waterloo, Canada, have invented a robotic surgery tool to replace manual suturing, saving valuable time in the operating room. AWARING is a device that indicates a speaker's location using a light and volume.

Jake Evill's distinctive looking 3D-printed Cortex cast could keep arms rigid to help them heal after a fracture and is created from waste plastic. Other designers also focused on the challenge of reducing wastage and recycling materials. British engineer Dan McLoughlin . observed that the coarse wool industry creates a lot of waste product . that goes to landfill and found that he could use this material to make a . biodegradeable, flame resistant plastic, which he called BioWool. The . material is made by carding the wool and then uses needles to shred and . pull the fibres together to produce a material similar in feel to . plastic or softer like a felt.

While Britain has 11,073km of . coastline and the potential to produce 40-70KWh per metre, the country . currently harnesses just 1 per cent of the free resource. But Mr . Etherington hopes his invention could change that. Other scientists came up with innovative gadgets to transform everyday tasks. Diabetics use a device that breaks the skin to measure their blood sugar levels but Gluco could change that.

"Scotland Yard faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar ‘admitted’ carrying out  500 break-ins. Four officers are under investigation amid fears the offender may have been encouraged to confess to crimes he did not commit, to help improve clear-up rates. Last night the force suspended a system whereby crimes are ‘taken into consideration’ over concerns of widespread abuse. It also stripped from its system the 500 ‘TICs’, a tacit admission the man’s confession was not credible. Probe: Scotland Yard faces a new corruption inquiry after a burglar 'admitted' carrying out 500 break-ins . The announcement of an investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission’s corruption unit is the latest blow to embattled Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe. This week he was criticised by MPs for failing to get a grip on historic corruption allegations linked to the Stephen Lawrence investigation and the mass shredding of documents. The Metropolitan Police is already under scrutiny over crime recording methods after a whistleblower revealed widespread fiddling of the figures. Last night, Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, which has been investigating crime recording practices said: ‘It is a concern that some crimes may have been written off as having been dealt with by those who have no responsibility for their commission.’ Concerns: Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee . MPs have also raised questions about whether the Met is giving sufficient priority and resources to investigating internal corruption. There are only 36 staff probing disturbing allegations that Met police officers stole and trafficked in drugs, took bribes and sold confidential intelligence to criminals. By contrast the Yard has 88 staff working on phone hacking by the media and 17 on allegations of computer hacking by journalists – a total of 105 – at a cost so far of £19.4million. A further 40 staff are investigating the historic allegations of sexual abuse by the dead DJ Jimmy Savile and others at a cost of £3.75million. Scotland Yard said the case of the 500 burlgaries taken into account emerged as part of a review ordered after concerns over ‘integrity’ in a routine sampling of cases. The Met said the investigation covers almost all of south-east London, from Lambeth to Lewisham and Croydon to Bexley. Three detective constables and a sergeant are under investigation but have not been suspended. It is understood that, after admitting the offences, which span a nine-year period from 2004 to last year, the suspect, who has not been named, withdrew his confession. Under the ‘taken into consideration’ system, criminals can admit offences which do not form part of the main charge they face in court. As a result they can never be prosecuted for them, but they will not face a longer punishment as a result of admitting them. Crucially, the crimes count as solved for the purpose of clear-up rates. Police say the system gives closure to victims, and allows offenders to ‘wipe their slate clean’ and move on. But critics say it is ripe for abuse and any admissions should result in a tougher punishment. Explosive details of police . corruption contained in files shredded by Scotland Yard could have been . preserved by a second secret investigation into rogue officers, it has . emerged. The . Metropolitan Police has admitted that it destroyed a number of . documents relating to Operation Othona – a multi-million pound inquiry . examining criminal behaviour by its officers – more than a decade ago. But . the force later launched another anti-corruption probe, codenamed . Operation Zloty, which lasted for nine years and uncovered a network of . rogue police who were working with organised criminals. A leaked police anti-corruption report from 2002 refers to Operation Zloty, stating: . ‘Operation . Zloty is a long-term intelligence operation to assess the threat that . organised criminals and their associations with serving and retired . police officers pose to the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service). ‘These . subjects have been undermining the MPS with virtual immunity for the . last ten years and were identified during the course of two previous . intelligence-gathering operations, “Othona” and “Centaur”.’ The . revelation raised hopes that some of the Othona material, described by a . former head of the Met’s anti-corruption branch as ‘gold-dust stuff’, . may have been saved. If found, it could shed light on concerns that . corrupt officers undermined botched investigations into the murders of . the black teenager Stephen Lawrence and private eye Daniel Morgan.","Four Metropolitan Police officers are currently under investigation .

He claimed it was unfair that girls were allowed to wear skirts while boys were banned from wearing shorts. Forcing boys to wear long trousers during warm weather had a negative effect on their concentration, he argued. Around 30 friends joined him at the school gates to beg headteacher Robert Campbell to reconsider. They displayed banners reading ‘Cool Shorts Not Hot Pants’, ‘Shorts For The Long-term’ and ‘Boy’s Legs Deserve Better’, . Equality: Chris had argued it was unfair male pupils were made to wear trousers even in sweltering summer months . Yesterday Chris claimed victory after the school announced that boys would be allowed to wear shorts after half-term for the rest of the school year. The youngster, who hopes to become a politician, welcomed the decision but added: ‘It’s a shame that only a little has changed after such a long uniform review. It seems that the adults influenced the decision more than the students themselves.’ The 1,368-pupil school, which was classed as ‘good’ in its latest Ofsted inspection in 2006, imposed the shorts ban two years ago after a consultation with parents and teachers. Its code stated that students must wear ‘plain black tailored trousers or knee-length skirts without slits’ – but did not specify gender. This meant that while shorts were prohibited, boys were free to wear skirts as long as they were ‘free-moving, not tight against the legs’. Chris won support across the country, with Daybreak presenter Adrian Chiles donning a skirt in solidarity. The schoolboy was even named runner-up in Liberty’s human rights young person of the year competition in London. Yesterday his parents Brian Whitehead and Liz Hill said: ‘We hope that Chris’s campaign inspires other young people to take a stand for things they believe in. ‘In this case, he has won his campaign for shorts – if only for a trial period – but in the future there will no doubt be other more significant issues for him to engage with.’","Chris Whitehead had protested against 'discriminatory' uniform rules .

"A new gel containing an ingredient previously used in eye drops could be the solution to embarrassing and often painful facial flushing. Mirvaso will be available on prescription only for patients with the skin condition rosacea, which causes blushing and also permanent redness. The gel contains brimonidine, a drug used to treat the eye disease glaucoma. The new use for  it was discovered by accident when patients with both conditions found that their skin around the eyes became clear when they used the drops. Skin aid: The new gel, Mirvaso, will help patients with the skin condition rosacea, which causes blushing and also permanent redness . Rosacea is a genetic condition that affects about one in ten people in the UK. Usually appearing in people from their mid-30s onwards, it causes blood vessels in the face to dilate, leading to redness and uncontrollable flushing. The condition can be triggered by sunlight, saunas, spicy food, alcohol or stress. In severe cases, rosacea can cause acne-like pustules on the face and can even thicken and distort the skin of the nose. Although Mirvaso is not a cure, it causes the vessels to contract and become less visible for about 12 hours. Dr Anthony Bewley, consultant dermatologist at Bart’s Health NHS Trust in London, recently conducted UK trials on Mirvaso. He found patients responded well to the treatment. ‘Rosacea sufferers often find the facial redness very disfiguring and even disabling,’ he says. ‘The flushing can appear at the most inopportune times, such as when people are at a job interview or are trying to impress someone. New purpose: The gel contains brimonidine, a drug used in eye drops to treat glaucoma . ‘Patients often also suffer a burning sensation at the same time. It makes them feel wretched and out of control. Some become depressed and a few even feel suicidal. ‘Until now there hasn’t been much that effectively treated the redness and flushing. Even  if patients have expensive laser treatments, the redness tends to come back. To have this is helpful not just for my patients’ skin, but their self-worth too.’ Mirvaso was cleared by the  US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in August 2013 and by European regulators last week, meaning it can now be introduced in the UK. Dr Bewley says he found that Mirvaso cleared redness within a few minutes in some patients. And studies conducted by Galderma, which manufactures Mirvaso, suggest it may be effective at reducing visible redness  in about 70 per cent of patients. Between one and four per cent of users can have side effects, including, ironically, rebound redness and skin irritation. If Mirvaso is applied patchily, the face will have red areas where the cream was missed. Dermatologist Dr Nick Lowe,  of the Cranley Clinic in London, says: ‘I have been interested in brimonidine for some time now, and think Mirvaso is going to  be very helpful when treating rosacea. It can be used in conjunction with other medications such as antibiotics and lasers. However, some of my patients who have used it say they have experienced stinging and increased redness.’ Despite these issues, some desperate patients are already buying Mirvaso over the internet from the US. Dr Lowe and Dr Bewley say they will be keen to consider prescribing Mirvaso to patients when it becomes available next month. Health trusts will now have  to decide whether to offer it to patients in their area – it is expected to cost the NHS as little as 50p a day per patient. Mirvaso will be also be available privately. A 30g tube that lasts between 30 and 60 days should cost less than £35.","New gel with ingredient used in eye drops to help skin conditions .

"John Kerry has revealed that he does not believe that President Kennedy's assassin worked alone as the government claimed in their official finding. The Secretary of State added more credibility to conspiracy theories surrounding the former president's death by becoming one of the highest-ranking politicians to openly admit to being suspicious of the official finding. 'To this day, I have serious doubts that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone,' Kerry told NBC's Tom Brokaw in an interview timed with the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death. Suspect: Secretary of State John Kerry said that he believes that an outside force- possibly in the Soviet Union or Cuba- influenced Lee Harvey Oswald's decision to kill President Kennedy . Moments before: Kerry rejects some of the more far-flung theories about President Kennedy's death- saying that there wasn't a second shooter and the CIA was not involved- but he does think there is more to learn . 'I certainly have doubts that he was motivated by himself, I mean I'm not sure if anybody else is involved- I won't go down that road with respect to the Grassy Knoll theory and all that- but I have serious questions about whether they got to the bottom of Lee Harvey Oswald's time and influence from Cuba and Russia.' The particular theory that Kerry mentioned is one that was ignored by the Warren Commission who investigated the 1963 shooting. A number of witnesses recalled seeing smoke and smelling gunpowder near a grassy knoll along the parade route, hinting that there could have been a second shooter who fired from a different angle. The connections that Lee Harvey Oswald had to Russia and Cuba that the Secretary of State mentioned are far more factual convictions, as it is known that Oswald defected to the Soviet Union and moved there. He only returned to the U.S. the year before Kennedy was shot. Back in the day: Kerry, seen at the bottom right corner of the 1972 photo, volunteered for Ted Kennedy's Senatorial campaign a decade earlier in 1962 and the two became close, staying friends throughout Kennedy's life . Working together: Then-Senator Kennedy is seen on the Washington Mall speaking with the Vietnam Veterans Against the War, a group that Kerry (circled) led . When he did come back to the U.S., Oswald lived in New Orleans and rented out a room from am advocacy group called Fair Play For Cuba. He spent a good deal of time with communist sympathizers, and travelled to Mexico in September 1963- just two months before Kennedy's assassination- in hopes of obtaining a visa and going on to Cuba, but his visa application was rejected. ‘I think he was inspired somewhere by something and I don't know what or if or any- I can't pin anything down on that,’ Kerry said in the interview. In spite of his lingering feelings about there being ‘more’ to the assassination, Kerry categorically rejected the idea that the CIA was behind the assassination, which has been a favorite alternate scenario among anti-government conspiracy theorists. Kerry was being interviewed as part of a series on the influence of the assassination, and though he was a college student at the time, the former presidential candidate did have a connection to the Kennedy family. Looking back: The interview was part of a series being compiled by Tom Brokaw (left) about the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's death . As a Massachusetts native, Kerry chose to volunteer for Ted Kennedy’s senatorial campaign in 1962 and they remained close for the rest of the Senator’s life. Kerry told Brokaw about the one time that he met John F. Kennedy at the White House when he was working for his brother and got a call saying that they were all going to go out for a sail in Washington. ‘I'm in between high school and going off to college and he said ""Where you going?"" and I said Yale and I grimaced knowing he was a Harvard guy and he looked at me and he said ""No, no that's great now because I now have a Yale degree,"" Kerry said. ‘He had just gotten his Yale honorary degree and he couldn't have been nicer about it and talked to me about the campaign and what Teddy was doing, and we raced off and went sailing. ‘It was totally surreal.’","Secretary of State John Kerry thinks that the shooter was influenced .

"Natalie Hawkins, the gymnastics star's mother, said Missy Parton and her family from Iowa don't know how to care for her daughter's hair . The mother said there are 'no black salons in their area' The 16-year-old double gold medal winner . became the topic of debate on Twitter last week as critics argued that . her ponytail looked messy . The mother of women's gymnastics all-around champion Gabrielle Douglas has blamed her daughter's white host family for failing to correctly care for her hair. Natalie Hawkins, the 16-year-old Flying Squirrel's proud mother who does not live with her daughter, told Fashionista.com that Missy Parton and her family from Iowa 'don't know anything about taking care of her hair'. Miss Douglas moved to their home in order to train with the elite gymnastics coach Liang Chow. It was a move fully supported by Ms Hawkins. She added: 'She [Gabby] lives with a white host family... and there's no black salons in their area [Iowa[] - not one. We had to work really hard to find a stylist to come and do her hair.' Pointing fingers: The mother of U.S. gymnast Gabrielle Douglas, who won her second gold medal last week, has claimed that her host family, including mother Missy Parton, have failed to care for the teenager's hair, above . Support: Gabby's mother (centre) claimed that her host mother (left) knows 'nothing about her hair'. They witnessed the 16-year-old's gold medal win alongside 2008 Olympic gymnastics medalist Shawn Johnson . The teenager said two days ago that she . was a little confused when she logged onto her computer after winning . her second gold medal in three days to discover that people were debating . her pulled-back look. Miss Douglas uses gel, clips and a ponytail holder to keep things in place while she competes, a style she's worn for years. Her mother, who allegedly filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, also touched on her daughter's hair regime which she claims she is still very much apart of. 'She gets relaxer but we try not to relax it too much,' she said. 'It's really been African-American women that have come out and attacked her. They don't know about gymnastics. She has to keep her hair in a ponytail 28-30 hours a week,' Trouble: It seems as though a week of high drama has taken its toll on the Flying Squirrel who fell during a performance on the women's gymnastics balance beam today at the Olympics, seen above . Winner: The teenager, above, became the fourth straight American to win gymnastics' biggest prize . Support: Miss Douglas' mother, above, does not live with her daughter but has been a major supporter . She continued: 'In gymnastics, you're . tumbling around on your hair... any hair stylist will tell you that . foam on African-American hair is destructible. It breaks the hair . horribly.' She added said people began offering their opinions on her daughter's hair months ago. 'I started hearing about [her hair] . earlier this year actually,' she said. 'What is funny is I had someone . come do her hair before the Olympics. We put all this effort into . getting her hair done and they still didn't like it.' She, like many others, are confused over what people don't like about her hair, exactly. 'She didn't have flyaways,' she said. 'When you look at pictures, it's tight back just like everyone else's and all of the girls had the messy ponytails which is just their generation. 'Most of the women who were commenting I think are a little bit older'. Ms Hawkins filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, according to documents submitted earlier this year in Virginia, reported TMZ. The . documents show that Hawkins, who has previously spoken out about . gymnastics being an expensive sport, has debt totalling $79,754.14. Tousled: Critics believe Miss Douglas, above, should have had her hair put up in a neat ballerina-esque bun . The documents state that Hawkins has . assets totalling $163,706.10 and show she owes Capital One, Sprint, and . T-Mobile more than $6,000. Her creditors also include an Orthodontist in . Iowa, where Gabby trained aged 14, and a student loan of $4,350.23. Regardless . of the financial woes, the mother recalled laughing with the sporting . star, who lives with a white host family, when she discovered that . people had been discussing her hair. 'She said,""Really? I won two gold medals . and made history and my hair is trending?"",' the mother told the fashion news site. 'So we laughed about it. We . made a huge joke out of it and I was quick to try to diffuse that . situation.' She continued: 'Are . you trying to ruin her self . confidence? She has to go out there and feel good about herself, and if . she feels good about herself on that floor, who are you to criticize . her?' What have you done to help contribute to her dream, that you felt . it necessary to put it out there so that she could see it.' The . young athlete told the Associated Press that she only discovered the . debate after checking online after she had won her second gold medal. 'I . don't know where this is coming from. What's wrong with my hair?' said . Douglas, the first U.S. gymnast to win gold in team and all-around . competition. 'I'm like, ""I just made history and people are focused on . my hair?"" It can be bald or short, it doesn't matter about [my] hair.' 'Nothing is going to change,' she . said. 'I'm going to wear my hair like this during beam and bar finals. You might as well just stop talking about it.' Not a fan: One user, above, took to the social networking site to announce his disapproval over her hair . Critic: Another Twitter user, above, stated that fixing the teenager's hair would prove an Olympic sport itself . Critics . have argued that her dark locks should in fact mimic the tight, . ballerina-style bun that gymnasts usually tuck their hair into. 'I don't think people should be . worried about that,' she said. 'We're all champions and we're all . winners. I just say that it's kind of, a stupid and crazy thought to . think about my hair.' The bubbly teenager was the first . African-American gymnast to win her sport's biggest prize. She had no . idea she was lighting up social media until she Googled herself hours . after winning her gold medal. In the Flying Squirrel's defense, her . hair had been kept securely in place with ample gel and hair clips as . she has leaped and twirled her way to glory. One user wrote on Twitter: 'Gabby . Douglas gotta [sic] do something with this hair! These clips and this . brown gel residue aint it!'. Another posted: 'In Olympic news, why hasn't anyone tried to fix Gabby Douglas' hair?'. Support: Other users have defended the young athlete, as shown above. They believe the topic is nonsense . Defense: Another user, above, expressed expressed that critics should watch what they say . To which a further user replied: 'That's an Olympic sport too!'. The teenage superstar was also defended on Twitter by her supporters. One . user wrote: 'People busy talking about Gabby Douglas not having her . hair done?? She's busy sweating & WINNING GOLD MEDALS... you're on . TWITTER. Right'. Another . person wrote: 'If you want to ride Gabby Douglas for her hair, you . should be open to her coming over to critique your muscle tone'. A . further user wrote: 'Gaby [sic] Douglas may not have her hair done, but . she accomplished something more than half of us didn't. Focus'. Peculiarly, Miss Douglas' hair is possibly the neatest out of her whole team leading many to wonder what all the fuss is about. Her teammates, Jordyn . Wieber, McKayla Maroney, Alexandra Raisman and Kyla Ross, have each been . spotted with unruly strands of hair poking out of their buns and . ponytails. Hard work: Disappointingly, the teenager came last in today's uneven bars competition, seen above . It may be Miss Douglas' incredible talents that have put her into the firing line as she outshines the rest of the competition. For whatever reason, it is not the first time the styling of black hair has come under debate. Solange Knowles was forced to defend her natural afro, which she wears proudly, after it was slammed by critics who called it 'unkempt' and 'dry as heck'. One even compared her natural locks to those of a homeless person. Miss Douglas finished . last week with a score of 62.232, less than three-tenths ahead of Viktoria Komova . of Russia, to win claim the . all-rounder title. While her U.S. teammates hopped up and . down in the stands, Miss Douglas simply grinned.

"Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS . Prince Charles and Mohamed Al Fayed are being contacted by police as they assess claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana. Scotland Yard said they are also getting in touch with Lord Justice Scott Baker, the judge who presided over the inquest into her death. Diana, 36, Mr Al Fayed's son Dodi, 42, and chauffeur Henri Paul, 41, all died in a crash in Paris in August 1997. Police are currently carrying out a 'scoping exercise' as they look into claims that the trio were murdered by a member of the British Military. They have not launched a full investigation. Royal . bodyguards and MPs have brushed off accusations that the Princess of . Wales' death 16 years ago was carried out by British special . forces who then 'covered it up'. The sensational allegation surfaced in the second court martial of Sergeant . Danny Nightingale, the SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a . pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom. The claim was contained in a letter from the parents-in-law of Soldier N, Sgt Nightingale's former housemate, which was sent to the SAS's commanding officer in September 2011. Scotland Yard confirmed in a brief statement this morning that they will be contacting members of the Royal family to inform them about the new developments. 'We are in the process of notifying Princess Diana's family, the family of Dodi Al Fayed and Lord Justice Scott Baker,' a spokesman said. Contacted: Police will be getting in touch with Prince Charles (left) and Mohamed Al Fayed (right) to inform them about the 'scoping exercise' they are carrying out into claims Diana was murdered . Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel . Scotland Yard routinely contact relevant parties to keep them informed about what is going on when there are new developments in a historic case. The . eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that . had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’. The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed there was a murder plot . Sergeant . Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a . pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N. Soldier . N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the . same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from . whom he is now separated. The letter was sent to Soldier N’s . commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service . Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial. All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA. The . paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his . wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that . has been covered up.’ The . letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of . his unit use for private jobs’. ‘They put in the box the name, address . and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to . earn extra money does that job.’ When . Soldier N was challenged by his mother-in-law, he is accused of saying: . ‘Let me stop you right there – I kill women and I kill children.’ As well as hiding weapons in his . house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked . his son after mistaking him for the Taliban. The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said . His . children were also allegedly driven around in the boot of his Land . Rover and he had hung his son 30ft above the ground in a tree. An inquest in 2008 found that Princess . Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross . negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who . had been drinking. Henri Paul's mother Gisele . said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al . Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass. Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997. ‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’ The . new information was also welcomed by Dodi’s father, former Harrods . owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who also insists the couple were murdered. He . said he trusted the Metropolitan Police would investigate the new claims . ‘with vigour’. A Royal spokesman said there would be no comment from the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry or Clarence House. Scotland Yard confirmed officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it by the Royal Military Police.

"Strolling along a country lane in hiking shoes with a rucksack on her back, she makes for an unlikely muse. But this is the woman who inspired one of America’s greatest songwriters and helped launch his career to international stardom. The humdrum life she now leads in a quiet Welsh-speaking village gives little clue that Kathleen Chitty’s name is known to millions worldwide. Kathleen Chitty is the woman who inspired one of America's greatest songwriters and helped launch his career to international stardom . Paul Simon  - half of famous duo Simon and Garfunkel - was once so besotted with English teenager that they appeared together on his first record cover. He also mentioned her in several of his greatest hits - including ‘America’ - and immortalised their romance in the haunting ‘Kathy’s Song’. But Mrs Chitty could not cope with the huge attention from music journalists and fans while in a realtionship with Simon. She now lives in a small, detached three-bedoom house on a quiet cul-de-sac, and catches a bus each day to her job as an administrator for a technical college, where she has worked for 25 years. Paul Simon once described his relationship with Mrs Chitty as ‘his most peaceful time’ and it was captured in his care-free lyrics. It is in stark contrast to the singer turmoil he has endured this week as Simon, 72, appeared in court alongside his third wife after police were called to break up a violent dispute at their home. Paul Simon - half of famous duo Simon and Garfunkel - was once so besotted with English teenager that they appeared together on his first record cover . Half a decade on from when he first met Miss Chitty, the 68-year-old grandmother with her grey hair tied back in a bun, still bears a strong resemblance to the teenage girl that won his heart. In 1963, aged just 18, her love of folk music brought her to the nearby Railway Inn folk club, in Brentwood, Essex, where she sold tickets. Simon, who had dropped out of New York law school, had decided to tour England’s pubs and clubs after struggling to make a name for himself in America. Her elfin qualities, huge eyes and aura of gentleness through her shy personality caught his attention and an intense love affair followed. During their relationship he wrote dozens of hits that were later performed alongside his friend Art Garfunkel in Simon and Garfunkel. Kathy is mentioned by name twice in ‘America’ and the song ‘Homeward Bound’ is about returning from a gig in Widnes to see her in Essex. But perhaps the most poignant is ‘Kathy’s Song’ which he wrote about missing her while in New York. It includes the lines: ‘I gaze beyond the rain drenched streets, to England where my heart lies... My thoughts are many miles away, they lie with you when you’re asleep, and kiss you when you start the day.’ But with his initial success, the shy and sensitive Kathy became frightened of the huge attention from fans and returned home from the US in the mid-1960s. Now living on the outskirts of a remote mountain village in North Wales, her partner Kenneth Harrison, whom she has been with for more than 40 years and had three children, said they moved from Essex to ‘escape’ in the early 1970s. ‘She wasn’t very comfortable with it,’ he said. ‘We’re very good friends with Mr Simon and there’s never been a rift.’ Singer Paul Simon, left, holds hands with his wife Edie Brickell at a hearing in Norwalk Superior Court. The couple were arrested on disorderly conduct charges by officers investigating a family dispute at their home . In fact, Mr Harrison, 67, admits that he knew both Simon and Miss Chitty before they met as a musician on the 1960s folk scene. ‘I was there. I was part of that crowd as the second person to meet Paul Simon when he came to Britain in 1963. ‘America is the one [hit song] which we’ll never escape from because it’s a song about America losing its way.’ At 68, Miss Chitty still retains her 5ft4in boyish figure, huge eyes and sensitive features. Her hair is now grey but still cut in the same bob as when pictured sat on cobblestones playing with toys alongside Simon on his first album, The Paul Simon Song Book, released in 1965. Despite being of retirement age, she remains a part-time administrator at a technical college – the same job she has had for more than 25 years. Ironically, she still has requests for interviews from music biographers across the world about her time with Simon, but all they have received is the sound of silence. ‘Kath always was and remains a private person,’ added Mr Harrison, a former local journalist, on her behalf. ‘She has never spoken publicly about her past and while understanding that there is a huge public interest in this matter, has no intention to do so.’ A friend told the Mail: ‘The break-up (with Simon) was very traumatic. It was ultimately a world that didn’t do Kathy any favours. She simply couldn’t cope with the public attention.’ Each morning Mrs Chitty walks the half mile route to the edge of the quiet Welsh-speaking village to catch the bus in a nearby town to work. Miss Chitty has had the same administrative part-time role at a local technical college for more than 25 years. She leaves mid-morning and returns late afternoon while greeting neighbours on the way. Her three children now all live in London. Neighbours say she is still incredibly shy, but friendly to those she has got to know over the 40 years she has lived in the hamlet. Simon married Peggy Harper in 1969, but split after having one son, Ben, in 1975. He then had a two-year marriage to Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher after proposing during a live New York Yankees baseball game in 1983. He has three children, Adrian, Lulu and Gabriel, with Brickell, the singer with the 1980s band the New Bohemians, after marrying in 1992. Police were called to their family home after receiving an emergency 911 call that hung up. They were both arrested when officers saw they had received minor injuries during a dispute last Saturday night. In court on Monday the pair held hands and Simon told the judge ‘the both of us are fine together’. Speaking on Simon’s court appearance in his home town of New Canaan, Connecticut, with rock singer Edie Brickell, 48, Mr Harrison said: ‘There’s nothing to it, but again it’s going to be an embarrassment to him as he is very private.’ Simon has won 12 Grammys both as a solo artist and with Simon and Garfunkel.

"A new laser therapy that bores microscopic holes in the skin is being touted as a way to erase stretch marks on the stomach, thighs and breasts, with minimal pain and downtime. The Icon system is the first treatment for the common form of scarring to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. All scars are notoriously difficult to treat, yet exceedingly common; most people have at least one. The laser treatment bores microscopic holes in the skin and being touted as a way to erase stretch marks on stomach, thighs and breasts . And stretch marks are estimated to affect up to 90 per cent of women during pregnancy. Icon has a fractional laser that uses heat to create microscopic channels deep within the skin, while leaving the surface almost untouched. These tiny injuries break down  scar tissue and are said to trigger a natural healing response. An inbuilt scanner assesses skin type and automatically adjusts settings to avoid pigment changes. Studies show that on average, Icon reduces stretch marks by between  51 and 75 per cent, including those that are many years old. It can also be used on acne, surgical and burn scars. Kim Kardashian was recently filmed having laser treatment on pregnancy-related stretch marks on her breasts . Skin expert Dr Tapan Patel, medical director of the PHI Clinic in London, the first in the UK to offer the treatment, said: ‘No two scars are ever the same, so no one treatment will be suitable for all of them. 'However, I am seeing some good results with the Icon. It does not harm the top layer  of skin, which means it’s a more comfortable treatment than some other lasers. 'Patients don’t need pain relief and have less downtime.’ In general, scars form if a wound takes longer than three or four weeks to be covered with new skin. Stretch marks most often occur during puberty and pregnancy when the skin expands rapidly. Reality television star Kim Kardashian was recently filmed having laser treatment on pregnancy-related stretch marks on her breasts. However, conventional laser treatments have not always been effective. They have a reputation for being very painful, and only helpful on new, red scars. Another side effect is pigment changes such as a permanent darkening of the skin. Dr Patel said: ‘I had previously treated a woman with a burn mark  on her chest using a different laser that was effective but left her so red and sore that she had to take several days off work. But when I treated her with the Icon, the redness went away within a few hours.’ Patients usually require two to six treatments costing £350 each, four to eight weeks apart.","'Icon' laser therapy bores microscopic holes in the skin .

"Meet the man who built Moscow… from paper. Sergei Tarasov recently completed this remarkably detailed modular origami models of Saint Basil’s cathedral using folded bits of paper. The school teacher spent the past year meticulously building the incredibly accurate replicas of the historic landmark in the Russian capital with tens of thousands of pieces of paper. The 42-year-old, from the village of Tigritskoye in southern Russia, has plenty to show for all his hard work, as he unveiled the awe-inspiring work he built at home, which stands at 1.5 metres tall. Remarkable: Sergei Tarasov, 42, puts the finishing touches to his incredible modular origami model of Saint Basil's Cathedral at his home in Tigritskoye . Meticulous: Tarasov has spent a year working on the detailed model, even adhering to the bright colour scheme of the beautiful building . Tarasov said he didn’t even take a sketch of the impressive building, but was still able to produce his glorious interpretations of the cathedral for a Russian arts and crafts festival. The art teacher has been fascinated by the Japanese art form origami for some time, and says that most of his free time is spent cobbling together the modular pieces which make up the parts of his models. He has begun teaching origami to the children at the schools he works at, some 300 miles from the nearest major city, Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. Proud: Art teacher Tarasov spends much of his spare time building the carefully crafted modular origami models, and even teaches it to his pupils . Complex: Tarasov built the cathedral using more than 60,000 components, all made from folded pieces of paper . Better than the real thing? His creation looks remarkably similar to Saint Basil's in Moscow, even though Tarasov claims he didn't even use a sketch . The talented modeller has somehow found the time to build animals like rabbits and roosters, as well as dragons, trains and other buildings. A perfectionist, Tarasov is often forced to disassemble his works midway through building them to make crucial refinements, improving their accuracy and authenticity. So detailed are his creations, that they even adhere to a similar colour scheme as their giant, real-life counterparts. The orange-red brick of Saint Basil's is reflected by red pieces of paper in Tarasov's model. St Basil’s is not the only cathedral Tarasov has built from paper. He also unveiled his take on the awe-inspiring Svyato-Spassky Cathedral in the southern Siberian town of Minusinsk. Modular origami is a demanding practice and makes use of multiple pieces of paper to create more detailed and sophisticates models than would be possible using a single sheet. Tarasov folds each individual piece of paper into a module and attaches those together to assemble parts before adding the larger shapes together to create his spectacular models. But Tarasov is by no means finished building his models. The talented modeller is aiming to construct his own complete versions of the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow to add to his astounding collection. The real-life version of Saint Basil's, a Russian Orthodox church also known as the Cathedral of Saint Vasily the Blessed, was constructed under the orders of Ivan the Terrible between 1555 and 1561. And another one: Tarasov managed to find the time to craft this amazing replica of the Svyato-Spassky Cathedral in the Siberian town of Munusinsk . The key is in the detail: The talented origami modeller occasionally disassembles his marvellous models to ensure they are true to their real-life counterparts .","Sergei Tarasov completed his incredible modular origami models of Saint Basil's Cathedral, Moscow .

"The cookie diet is being endorsed by a U.K. doctor who is suggesting it is prescribed by the NHS . A British doctor is calling on the NHS to prescribe a radical new diet for obese children - which encourages youngsters to eat nine biscuits a day. Currently three in 10 children in the UK aged between two and 15 are overweight and many are in severe danger of developing heart disease. Dr Sarah Brewer is recommending that the NHS, including GPs, prescribe a controversial U.S. diet comprised of eating cookies, as well as fruit and vegetables for dinner, to tackle the problem. The diet says children can eat nine biscuits spread across the entire day, plus a 500 to 700 calorie evening meal as long as they obtain their recommended daily quota of five fruits and vegetables. Dr Brewer believes that such radical measures are needed to tackle the alarming pattern of chronic obesity that faces British children. She said: 'The size of the UK's childhood obesity crisis is staggering and it's . time for decisive action. 'Many different approaches have been tried but, . so far, traditional approaches have failed to make an impact. 'It's . time we tried a new approach and while extreme diets should be a last . resort for our children, too many British kids are already facing up to a . life of medical problems and misery. 'If we can't . recreate the old days of healthy eating and children playing in the . great outdoors more often, we have to take a 21st century approach to a . 21st century problem. The cookie diet encourages children to eat nine healthy biscuits a day - as long as enough fruit and vegetables are also consumed . 'Let's swap the unhealthy snacks kids are currently . eating for a healthier version that helps them feel full yet comes in . the reassuringly familiar shape of a cookie.' The cookie diet was developed in the U.S. by Dr Sanford Siegal to help combat obesity in a new way. Currently 3 in 10 children in the UK aged between 2 and 15 are overweight, and many are in severe danger of developing heart disease through overeating . The . biscuits he recommends contain a healthy blend of hunger-satiating . amino acids derived from milk, egg white, oatmeal, rice and other . grains. Made using rapeseed oil, they also provide healthy mono-unsaturated and essential fatty acids. His approach has since become incredibly popular as a new-age diet throughout Hollywood and even Australia. According . to the company: 'The cookie diet's high protein, low sugar cookies are . designed to fill you up without taking away your ability to enjoy the . kind of snack food we all love tucking into.' Numerous methods have been tried by the NHS and the government to tackle growing obesity, such as fitness routines and improved diets. Some parents have turned to extreme measures, such as gastric band operations on the NHS, to help their children lose weight, with some children as young as 15 needing  surgery. Rather than going under the knife, Dr Brewer believes that every diet option should first be explored. Dr Brewer said: 'Rather than putting children on the operating table, we should explore . other weight loss options that have been shown to work in other . countries.' Recent headlines show that the childhood obesity crisis is reaching desperate levels in the UK, with 74 children under 11 being taken away from their parents by the authorities for being overweight. In addition, 183 youngsters in England, Scotland and Wales have weighed in at 16 stone or more in the last 3 years. Dr Brewer believes that older methods are not working, so the NHS must turn to newer, more creative methods to help stop the obesity crisis.","Currently three in 10 children in the U.K. aged two to 15 are overweight .

Healing: The aromatic substances is being hailed as a medical marvel that could help treat tumours . Ovarian cancer is symptomless in the earliest stages and usually not diagnosed until it is too late, making it the deadliest gynaecological cancer. There are more than 7,000 cases a year in Britain and 4,300 of these women will die from the disease - around 12 a day. Frankincense, the resin of the Boswellia sacra – a small tree found in Oman, Yemen and Somalia – is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and has long been used in folk medicine, along with resin from other types of Boswellia. It is being studied as a treatment for several cancers. The Leicester University researchers said: ‘Frankincense is taken by many people with no known side-effects.

"A mother who kidnapped her children from their custodial grandmother and sailed with them to Cuba wants a divorce from husband so she can be with a female former inmate. The news came as Sharyn Hakken and her husband Josh both took separate plea deals to avoid going to trial. The couple, from Tampa, Florida, were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April after they allegedly kidnapped two-year-old Chase and four-year-old Cole from the boys' grandparents, who had been granted custody of them just a week earlier. Joshua pleaded guilty to four charges and could serve as many as 15 years in prison while Sharyn accepted a deal that includes a potential 10-year prison sentence on two counts of kidnapping. Joshua (left) and Sharyn Hakken, (right)  from Tampa, Florida, have taken separate plea deals to avoid going to trial. Now it has emerged that Sharyn wants to end her marriage to Josh as she has fallen for a former inmate . Today it was revealed that that Sharyn wants to end her marriage to Josh in order to be with a former jail mate. 'They have no relationship as far as she is concerned,' attorney Bryant Camareno said, reports Fox 13. 'She does want to get a divorce and she is currently in another relationship.' Earlier this month prosecutors shared a bizarre love letter Sharyn Hakken sent to a 26-year-old woman whom she met in prison, in which she tells the former inmate she is '100% committed to you and our relationship'. Only last week jail cell footage was released showing the couple desperately urging each other to stay quiet with Joshua Hakken saying to his wife: 'When everything goes down I'll come find you' The woman, Lacrecia White, gave an interview to ABC Action News and explained that they had hit it off while playing cards together in jail in July. As part of the documents prosecutors released in the Hakken case, they shared a letter written from Sharyn Hakken to a woman. The woman, Lacrecia White, told ABC Action News that they had met in prison in July before she was released. Here are some excerpts from the letter from Hakken:'I hope I dream about you tonight. I need to see you and feel you. 'I love you. Ugh I so badly wish we could hold each other right now. I wanna play with your hair! 'I am so super excited about our future together...I want to talk to you and hear your voice sooo bad... So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. 'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship! 'Let's get married! (I'm totally serious unless you think I'm crazy then haha jk [just kidding])' 'I've been nervous that yours and my relationship could hurt my case in some way and that my lawyer would find out and tell me to stop talking to you. I don't think I'd be able to! One letter from Hakken reads: 'I want to talk to you and hear your voice sooo bad. So how are you my beautiful girl? I miss you so much. I'm glad I stayed up so late writing to you last night. 'I love you so much. I hope you really do know that by now... I am 100% fully committed to you and our relationship!' White, who has since been released on probation and is training to become an electrician, said that Hakken spends her days doing yoga and missing her children. 'I know that her overall goal is to get her kids back. She says that when she gets out of jail, she wants to start in with a case plan, if that's even possible,' said White. 'We'll definitely keep writing each other. I need her support and she needs a friend right now.' After the couple were tracked down in Cuba and returned to the U.S., they were held in a Hillsborough County jail, where surveillance cameras filmed their conversations on April 10. 'Be careful what you say to your cellmates,' Joshua Hakken, 45, says to his wife. 'No one can know about this.' 'I know, I know, I know,' responds Sharyn Hakken, 34, later adding, 'I said too much on the plane', as her husband comforts her, ABC News reported. The couple also apparently discussed their release from jail. When everything goes down I'll come find you,' Joshua Hakken said, with his wife adding: 'If I get out before you, I promise I'll wait for you.' Prosecutors plan to present the footage as evidence at a trial later this year. They also released photographs taken inside the Hakken's sailboat that show two child car seats, a gun and ammunition. The letters called White her 'soul mate' and tell her she is 100% committed to their relationship . Prosecutors said the Hakkens had become paranoid about living in the U.S., claiming the government was trying to hack their computers and poison them. They had asked 11 countries for asylum, documents show. They lost custody of the boys last year after police officers in Louisiana found them and the children in a hotel room surrounded by weapons and drugs. On April 3, Joshua Hakken allegedly forced his way into his mother-in-law's home, tied her up and put the boys in his car, before setting sail for Cuba. Officials in Cuba learned that the parents were wanted in connection with a kidnapping and contacted U.S. authorities, who flew them back. The couple's boat, 'Salty', is pictured moored at the Marina Hemingway complex in Havana on April 9 last year, six days after the couple allegedly set sail from Florida with their sons on board . Chase, two, and four-year-old Cole were safely returned to the care of their grandparents last April after allegedly being abducted by their parents . When the boys were returned, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob Hauser revealed that the youngsters, who were not harmed, did not know they were allegedly kidnapped. They have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - 'another country', as they call it,' Mrs Hauser said at a press conference. 'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a vacation.' Mr Hauser said that they had never imagined they would be bringing up Cole and Chase - but that the 'smart, chatty' boys were a joy each day. 'It was initially a change of life-style for us, but having these boys here is just amazing,' he said. 'I come home from work at the end of a bad day and the two will come running up hugging and kissing me [saying] 'Papa's home! Papa's home!' It's just wonderful. We wouldn't trade it for anything.' If convicted of the kidnapping charges at trial, the Hakkens could have been sentenced to life in prison. They will be sentenced October 8.","Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, from Tampa, Florida, were charged with kidnapping, interference with child custody and neglect in April .

"A pet cat was blinded in a brutal attack and left for dead in a bin by thugs because he looks like Hitler, his shocked owner has claimed. Baz, a seven year-old tomcat, has a distinctive patch of black fur under his nose, which resembles the Nazi dictator's moustache. Owner Kirsty Sparrow became worried when her pet, who also has dark fun on the top of his head, failed to return home after a weekend on the prowl in Tredworth, Gloucestershire. Likeness: Kirsty Sparrow, 26, believes her cat Baz was attacked and dumped because he looks like Hitler . Likeness: Baz, a seven year-old tomcat, has a distinctive patch of black fur under his nose, which resembles the Nazi dictator's moustache . A neighbour found him days later, dumped in a bin having suffered severe injuries. Ms Sparrow, 26, rushed Baz to the vet for emergency treatment, but the cat's left eye had to be removed because it was so badly damaged. She believes her pet was targeted because of his unfortunate likeness. 'A lot of people say he looks like Hitler but he is so timid and gentle,' said Ms Sparrow, who has been left with a £600 care bill for her cat's treatment. Lookalike: Many of Ms Sparrow's friends have told her that Baz looks like Adolf Hitler,  pictured in 1937 . Rescue: Baz had disappeared and was found days later by a neighbour. He had been dumped in a bin . Injuries: After he was discovered in the bin Baz was rushed to a vet for emergency treatment. His eye had to be removed because it was so damaged . Cause: Vets do not think that Baz was hit by a car, as he had not suffered any other injuries . 'I couldn’t believe the state of him. His eye was all swollen, it was like a marble. 'They said he was unlikely to have been hit by a car as there were no other injuries, and that he was probably kicked. 'I took a call at work from the vet to say he had been found in a bin, but was in a bad way. He’d been there for a while. 'It’s shocking someone would do something like that.' Ms . Sparrow, who has just left her Tesco job to go on maternity leave, . added: 'I put a photo on Facebook of Baz as he has a distinctive black . mark under his nose and asked if anyone saw him to contact me.' Before: Pet cat Baz as he looked before the attack .

Ms Sparrow, who has owned Baz since he was a kitten, says the cat has . looked like Hitler since birth but it has never drawn any negative . attention before. She said: 'He's always looked like this way. I don't know why anyone would do that to any animal, no matter how they look.' Ms Sparrow said that Baz's moustache gets a lot of attention from her friends. 'His moustache is what makes . him, him. It's the first thing I asked about when I turned up at the . vets, if his features were all still there. I was crying,' she said. 'People say that he looks like Hitler. He is so cute and he does look like Hitler. People can't believe it . when I show them pictures. He's also bigger than my nan's dog.' Other than the loss of his eye, Baz is . set to make a full recovery following the attack but will be kept . inside for quite some time. 'People say that he looks like Hitler. He is so cute and he does look like Hitler' Kirsty Sparrow . He will be heading back to the vet on Sunday to has his stitches removed. The bruising below his ribs will heal over time. 'The vet said not to let him out yet. I don't want to though. I'm scared it will happen again.' The police are currently in contact with her grandmother, Cath, as Ms Sparrow is too shook up to deal with the situation. 'I'm quite traumatised by it so she is dealing with it for me. I was crying my eyes out at the vets,' she added.

"Three years: Quanique Thomas-Hameen was inside a Wichita Taco Bell on December when his friends raided the belongings of a dying woman . A Kansas man was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday for the role he played in the theft of a dying woman's wedding ring and other belongings as she slumped over dying in a Taco Bell drive-thru. Quanique Thomas-Hameen was inside a Wichita Taco Bell on December when his friends Daquantrius Shaquill Johnson and Keith Hickels, Jr. allegedly raided 43-year-old mother and wife Danielle Zimmerman's belongings as she died of a brain aneurysm behind the wheel of her car. Zimmerman's family got some items back, but not her ring. Johnson and Hickels are awaiting trial. All three are charged with robbery, theft and aggravated burglary, reports KAKE. The story caused outcry across the states when news broke of the horrific treatment of Mrs Zimmerman. 'Instead of trying to help her, somebody robbed her,' her distraught husband of 21 years, Kris, told the Wichita Eagle. 'What really appalled me - the wedding ring. How could you take somebody’s wedding ring off their finger?' While Thomas-Hameen did not physically remove Zimmerman's belongings after she crashed into the Taco bell drivethru speaker box, prosecutors said he benefited from those who did. He also did nothing to stop the events from taking place.

While Thomas-Hameen did not physically remove Zimmerman's belongings after she crashed into the Taco bell drivethru speaker box, (pictured) prosecutors said he benefited from those who did . Thomas-Hameen apologized to the Zimmerman family in court Thursday and said he takes responsibility for not speaking up when he had the chance. Mr. Zimmerman responded to Thomas-Hameen's apology by asking the judge to throw the book at him. 'While he may not have been directly involved in the crime, he benefited from the results. He also showed he was a coward for not standing up to help,' Zimmerman said. 'You never know if she would be here today if you would have just stopped.' Daquantrius Shaquill Johnson (right) and Keith Hickels, Jr. (left) allegedly physically took Zimmerman's belongings as Thomas-Hameen was inside. They are awaiting trial . Some of Zimmerman's belongings were recovered but her grieving husband never got her ring back . The purse, including photos of her two teenage sons, has been found by children sledding near to the Taco Bell. The thief took $150 and credit cards from inside. Mr Zimmerman was watching football and waiting for his wife to return home with dinner, which they were to share with one of their teenage sons. After 30 minutes, he called her to no answer, and 15 minutes later, he decided to go and find her. But as he was leaving his driveway, police arrived and told him his wife was in the hospital. There, a chaplain told him that she had suffered a serious aneurysm - although she had never had one before - and that she had blood on her brain. The family soon made the decision to switch off her life support. Her organs were prepared for donation.","Quanique Thomas-Hameen of Wichita, Kansas was punished Thursday for his role as accomplice in the sickening December crime .

"Another year, another Eurogamer. But where only hints of next-gen gaming blessed last year's meeting, this year, the Playstation 4 and Xbox One took centre stage. And generally, both fared very well. Earlier in the year, Daily Mail Games reported that PS4 exclusive Drive Club looked extremely rough around the edges - even being eclipsed in the visual department by current-gen racer, Gran Turismo 6. Out of first gear: at this year's Eurogamer, Drive Club looked far more impressive than the E3 demo . But what a difference a few months make. Dive Club is noticeably sharper, and car models have been given a much-needed spit and polish. Environments are no longer plagued with pop-up, and there's now a subtle motion blur, giving the racer a next-gen sheen. Still, Microsoft's Xbox One exclusive, Forza 5, raced ahead of the pack with regards to graphics. Pixel-perfect cars and dynamic lighting make this one of the best-looking racers yet. Critics may have noticed some of the environments looking slightly bland, but the demo is far from representative of the final game. Stunning: Forza 5 boasted the best visuals of any racer at the event, closely followed by Need For Speed Rivals . Need For Speed Rivals added a much-needed dash of arcade racing to the mix, while The Crew's intriguing multiplayer mechanism is sure to win over fans. Here, players have to work together in a pack of modified super cars to complete objectives - such as ramming a target vehicle off the road. Up close, The Crew's visuals still look slightly raw, but it's hugely impressive in motion - with Burnout-style slow-motion takedowns and intricately-detailed car models. Dark Knight rises: Origins explores a much younger Batman and his animation and fighting style reflects that . Away from the racing scene, and Batman: Arkham Origins was unveiled in all of its glory. It's extremely similar to the last two games - which may leave some fans wanting more. What is noticeable, however, is Batman's movement. He's younger in Origins and so is more agile and graceful than the blunt, heavy-handed hero we've played in the last two games. Being a current-gen game in a sea of next-gen offerings is always hard, but Origins still looked impressive. The sense of scale and the realisation of a snow-covered Gotham create the most visually-striking backdrop yet. Silky smooth: New Order was a masterclass in gaming, boasting a consistent framerate and great visuals . Although queues stretched long and far for Battlefield 4, Call of Duty Ghosts and Titanfall, it was Wolfenstein: New Order that really stood out for us. Running on middle-powered PCs, the visuals still looked breathtaking. Shooting mechanics were incredibly responsive, as were death animations, while a clever lean function emphasises the need to rely on cover (to let health regenerate) and not just running in. Lighting up next year: Dying Light is looking like a much more dynamic version of Dead Island. The free-running component is inspired, too. It's set for release next year . Dying Light, too, a mix of Mirror's Edge and Dead Island was incredibly impressive, too. You play a survivor who must scavenge for weapons and food and must use free-running to escape hordes of zombies. During the day, they are slow and clumsy, but at night they change into frenzied, merciless animals. Boasting dynamic lighting, photo-realistic textures and  next-gen motion blur and draw distance, it looks to be the most impressive, open-world zombie game ever created.

"Sir Stuart Rose: The former M&S boss has told firms to stand up to militants . The former boss of Marks & Spencer yesterday told firms to show some ‘backbone’ and stand up to anti-capitalist  protests over the Government’s work experience scheme. Sir Stuart Rose, who started out shelf-stacking and sweeping floors 40 years ago, said it was ‘baffling’ that anyone would complain about unemployed youngsters being given similar opportunities. He said parents should tell their jobless children to ‘get stuck in’ and snap up any opportunity at a time of high youth unemployment. Ministers are preparing for talks this week with some of the firms taking part in the scheme, in which youngsters on jobless benefits are invited to volunteer for work experience placements of up to eight weeks. So far, more than 34,000 under-24s have taken part in the programme and half have come off benefits as a result. But the scheme has been thrown into turmoil by protests led by a campaign group called Right to Work, which ministers say is nothing more than a front organisation for the hard-Left Socialist Workers Party. The SWP advocates the overthrow of capitalism via a Marxist revolution. Though only a tiny cabal of extremists appear to be leading the campaign to brand work experience ‘slave labour’, several companies have been sufficiently rattled to announce that they are reviewing their involvement. Employment minister Chris Grayling insists that no firm signed up at national level has withdrawn, although some have done so locally. Tesco, Waterstones, TK Maxx, Poundland, Oxfam and Burger King are among those which have expressed concern. Sir Stuart, who restored the fortunes of Marks & Spencer, urged firms not to bow to the campaign to ‘sabotage’ the scheme. ‘We’ve got the economy which has been through terrible times, we’ve got a need to get people’s confidence going, get the country back to work. We’re offering young people the opportunity to really understand what the workplace is about and it appears there is some plan to sabotage this, which I think is nonsense,’ he told Sky News’s Murnaghan programme. Militants: Right to Work campaigners occupy the Tesco Express store at Portcullis House, Westminster . ‘It’s about getting people into the routine of working, making sure they are up in the morning, making sure they’re presentable, make sure they arrive on time, make sure they know what it’s like to have a properly constructed work programme, and shelf stacking is just a part of it. ‘When I started off in my retail career as a management trainee in Marks & Spencer’s 40 years ago, I was put to shelf stacking and indeed to sweeping out the warehouse for a day. ‘If you are drawing unemployment benefit and you are looking to get into the workplace and somebody says to you, “We’ll give you some experience” and you have got a week apparently to withdraw from it if it doesn’t suit you, why would you not do it? ‘If I was the parent of one of these people I’d say, “Go on to it, lad, get in there, get stuck in”. ‘So I find it quite baffling and I think it’s very, very sad, with I think it’s 20-odd per cent of unemployment around the age of 18, that kids are being led to believe that big business is exploiting them, which is nonsense.’ Sir Stuart said firms were apparently being ‘intimidated’ by the campaign against the scheme, adding: ‘One or two have shown a little less than backbone, if I might say so. ‘I think you have got to stick with it. If there are one or two issues of administration in the process that need sorting out, then let’s sort it out, but it seems to me quite straightforward. Defiant: Chris Grayling, Minister for Employment, has said it would be a disaster for young people if the scheme was derailed . ‘You can come in, you can get work experience and if you like it you can stay here and possibly get offered a job; if you don’t like it after the first week you can go away. I don’t get it, what’s the problem?’ Mr Grayling told the Daily Mail he would deliver a similar message to company bosses when he meets them on Wednesday. ‘I hope now that everyone involved in the scheme realises we have been targeted by a small group of extremists who created a noise utterly disproportionate to their number, they agree it would be a disaster for young people if we allowed that campaign to prevail,’ he said. He is prepared to discuss firms’ concerns about sanctions attached to the scheme which mean that benefits can be withdrawn if youngsters who have not opted to leave a placement after a week fail to turn up without good reason or are rude and unco-operative. But he added: ‘I don’t think any employer wants to be in a position where somebody behaves badly and faces no consequences.’ Tory MP Harriett Baldwin said: ‘I’m disappointed that some leading employers appeared frightened at the first whiff of grapeshot from a bunch of socialist campaigners. I hope they realise what an important role they have to play in giving youngsters a chance.’","Sir Stuart Rose said it was 'baffling' anyone would complain about the scheme .

"A Florida police officer is on paid leave and facing an internal affairs investigation after a video captured him shooting a 62-year-old woman in the back with a stun gun Tuesday. Viola Young approached officers shortly after they had taken three individuals into custody on a narrow Tallahassee street close to the governor's mansion. She can be heard on a video apparently shot with a cellphone from a neighbor's porch shouting 'I have some some questions.' Scroll down for video . Tased: Viola Young, 62, was hit in the back with a stun gun after Officer Terry Mahan ordered her to back away and tried to grab her arm . The officer by the vehicle closest to Young tells her to stay back as Officer Terry Mahan walks from the other end of the street. He reaches out to grab her arm but Young twists away from him. As she looks to be walking away, Mahan raises his stun gun and fires into Young's back, causing the woman to fall face first into the road. Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo announced at a late-night press conference after the department had obtained and reviewed the video. 'Based on the video, I have enough concerns to call for an internal investigation,' DeLeo said. 'We will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. We want to be transparent with the community by sharing what we can at this point, including the video.' Voices in the video can be heard advising Young not to approach officers and after she falls to the ground, the person with the cellphone says police 'tased a lady for nothing.' Young was handcuffed on the ground as officers walked over to Young to help her up and escort her to a squad car. Citizen: A neighbor shot what appears to be cellphone video of the moment where Young was hit by the stun gun and collapsed to the pavement . According to police, Young was medically cleared by paramedics and charged with resisting and obstructing an officer without violence. The first-degree misdemeanor carries a sentence of up to 12 months in jail or a fine of up to $1000. Young told the Associated Press her attorney instructed her not to speak about the incident. The Tallahassee Democrat reports Chuck Hobbs, a Tallahassee attorney, wrote a letter to State Attorney Willie Meggs asking him to 'strongly consider' charges against Mahan. 'I am asking you to strongly consider filing charges directly,' the letter stated, 'if you and your top investigators conclude that this incident was unjustified.' Tallahassee police have been scrutinized in recent months. In September, the city settled for $475,000 in a case where a woman had her nose broken following an arrest and an altercation with officers. The arrest of Christina West last year was also filmed, showing officers throwing her against a police car and then onto the ground as West screams. West can be heard screaming in the video. A grand jury declined to press charges against officers.","Viola Young of Tallahassee approached officers making arrests of three people asking about 'what is going on'

Starter Pack, you get Sulley, Captain Jack Sparrow and Mr Incredible and . all ooze the charm that made them such favourites with fans. Even .

After the magical introduction, the game is split . into two areas - the Toy Box mode and The Play Sets.

"Australian TV star and former model Charlotte Dawson killed herself after receiving abuse from vicious trolls on Twitter. Famed for TV shows such as 'Australia's Next Top Model, the New Zealand-born star, 47, had a history of depression. She was found dead in her Sydney apartment on Saturday morning. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Model and TV personality Charlotte Dawson has died at the age of 47. Reports are emerging that she had battled depression for years . Scene: Police were seen outside the Wololoomoolloo wharf apartments where Charlotte's body was said to be found. Actor Russell Crowe and his children were seen making their way inside the building where the actor also lives, on Saturday afternoon . In 2012, she was admitted to a Sydney hospital after a suicide attempt following an ongoing tirade of abuse on Twitter. Dawson spent hours defending herself, but signed off at 2.07am with the message: 'you win x', with a picture of a hand holding tablets. She also tweeted: 'Hope this ends the misery,' reported the Sydney Morning Herald. She later made fighting bullying her personal mission, waging an anti-bullying media campaign on television and radio and in newspapers and magazines as well as her beloved Twitter. Her efforts and high public profile on the issue were recognised by the National Rugby League, a major Australian football association, which last year made her an anti-bullying ambassador. Last pictures: This is one of the last pictures of Charlotte, which she posted on Instagram page on Friday, just one day before she was found dead . Model and mentor: Charlotte is seen here with her fellow Australia's Next Top Model co-stars, Didier Cohen, Jennifer Hawkins and Alex Perry in July 2013 . The NRL's One-Community campaign is an extension of its zero-tolerance policy toward racial abuse in football. Dawson revealed in her 2012 autobiography 'Air Kiss & Tell' that she was frequently visited by the 'depression bogeyman'. She had long graced the pages of women's gossip magazines and scenes in reality TV shows. Her modeling career had taken her to Italy, Britain and Germany during the 1980s. New Zealand Prime Minister John Key tweeted he was 'shocked and saddened' by the news of her death. The Sun-Herald newspaper in Sydney reported Sunday that her body was found only minutes before her luxury waterside apartment was due to be sold at auction. Happy and playful: A photographer's picture set from Thursday shows Charlotte smiling and playfully poking her tongue out at the camera outside the Woolloomooloo apartment she would be found dead in two days later . 'In tears': Australian actor Russell Crowe looked clearly distressed when he was pictured in Sydney after hearing the news of the death of his good friend . The tragedy was discovered the day after the birthday of her former husband, Scott Miller, an Australian Olympic silver medal-winning swimmer who became addicted to the drug ice and accrued multiple convictions for illegal drug and firearm possession. Dawson professed her enduring love for Miller and sadness at his fall from grace ahead of Australian '60 Minutes' broadcasting an exclusive interview with him on February 16. Kate Carnell, chief executive of Beyond Blue, a not-for-profit organisation promoting depression awareness, criticised Twitter for failing to sign up to an Australian government complaint-handling program designed to remove hateful material from social media sites. Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft signed up to the project last year. 'There's lots more work that people like Twitter need to do,' Carnell told The Sun-Herald.

They got the better of me and they won.’' She also touched on the topic in her book, Air Kiss And Tell, which was released in October 2012. However, her appearance on TV prompted . even more abuse on Twitter, with some social media users writing . comments such as: 'please hang yourself promptly' and 'neck yourself you . filthy s***.' At the time, Charlotte also revealed she had received several death threats during the ordeal. 'I’ve never had death threats of this ferocity. I’ve never had a campaign of this ferocity,' she told the Daily Telegraph. Recently . Charlotte hinted in November that she was looking to step away from the . spotlight after it was reported she was axed from Australia's Next Top . Model due to a cast 'shake-up'. Successful: Charlotte has had considerable success on Australian television following her career in modelling . Model: Charlotte, pictured here in 2005, left her native New Zealand at the age of 16 to model in Europe and with Ford Models in New York . She told the Herald Sun Confidential at the time: ‘I’m tired of the anxiety that comes with working in media, especially as a woman because you’re scrutinised daily and abused about the way you look.’ According to the Daily Telegraph, Charlotte took the producers' decision to cut her from the show badly, but was looking forward to new 'ventures.' She said she intended to become an estate agent at Sydney’s Regency Road estate agents. Foxtel Chief and Charlotte's former boss Brian Walsh also released a statement on Saturday afternoon, saying that the entire staff at Foxtel were 'devastated' over Charlotte's death. 'This is tragic news and deeply sad. Everyone at Foxtel is devastated. Our sympathies are with Charlotte’s family and friends,' he said.

"Smiling broadly for the cameras at the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns, director Bryan Singer wraps his arm around the British teenager who filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight sexually assaulted him. Now aged 25, the British man accuses X-Men director Bryan Singer of sexually abusing him when he was 17 at a London hotel along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard. Holding the pictures up to the media today at a Los Angeles press conference, the unidentified man's attorney, Jeff Herman, said that his client was spurred to bring a lawsuit against the filmmaker after Singer was sued by another man on similar allegations. Today: Attorney Jeff Herman produces a picture of his client (left, with face muzzed out) alongside director Bryan Singer (center left), producer Gary Goddard (center right) and actor Frank Langella (right - who is not connected with the allegations in any way) from the London premiere of Superman Returns in 2006 . The lawsuit in federal court in Los . Angeles said that Singer, 48, and entertainment industry executive Gary . Goddard, 59, coerced the British man into sex acts as a minor with the . promise of helping him in an acting career. The man was not identified . in court papers. This is . the second lawsuit naming Singer ahead of the May 23 release of his film . X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is expected to be one of the year's . top grossing movies. Singer's . lawyer has called the allegations in both lawsuits false and . fabrications, and a bid to win money from the director behind other . films in the X-Men superhero franchise. A lawyer for Goddard also denied . the allegations, calling them spurious. The . plaintiff's lawyer, Jeff Herman, also represents Michael Egan, who last . month sued Singer, Goddard and two other entertainment executives over . allegations that they abused him as part of an underage sex ring in . Hollywood. 'He did this to . support Mike, he realized he wasn't the only one this happened to,' Herman said at a news conference as he held aloft pictures of his client . with Singer and Goddard from the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns in . London. According to The Daily Beast, Singer, along with Broadway musical producer Gary Goddard, allegedly engaged in inappropriate acts with a British teenager in the bedroom of a London suite around the time of the release of Superman Returns - which Singer directed - in 2006. Pictured arm-in-arm: The British man (left) who is accusing Bryan Singer (center left), producer Gary Goddard (center right) of abusing him pose for a picture at the 2006 Superman Returns premiere in London. Also pictured is actor Frank Langella - who is not connected with the allegations in any way . Evening: Bryan Singer (right with a friend) is seen sitting next to his British accuser (center with face blurred) and actor Frank Langella (left) The suit has been filed by Egan's attorney, Jeff Herman, on behalf of plaintiff 'John Doe No. 117'. It claims Goddard contacted the teen when he was 14 via social media, commenting John Doe was attractive and that he knew people who could help kickstart his acting career. One of those people, Goddard said, was Singer. Thereafter, Goddard told the boy he was in love with him, and 'convinced' the boy to send him nude photographs and a video masturbating. They then allegely engaged in a webcam session which involved Goddard masturbating. When John Doe was 16, Goddard invited him to London and plied with the boy with alcohol, before he  'engaged him in anal intercourse'. When the teenager was 17, the suit alleges, Goddard told the teenager he and Singer were coming to London for a Superman movie premiere. At the after-party, the suit alleges that Singer offered the teenager a Quaalude, which the teenager rejected. Besieged: Longtime friends Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer - seen here in New York in 2009 - have been accused of sexually assaulting two men when they minors . In the bedroom of the hotel suite, where an 'after' after-party was being held, Singer and Goddard, the suit says, 'starting grabbing John Doe in a sexual manner'. The teenager asked the men to stop. Goddard allegedly returned to the room with a 'large, musclebound man' who began to smack the teenager around, using physical violence, according to the complaint. The bodyguard held the boy down while Singer allegedly grabbed his buttocks. Singer and the large man stripped John of his clothing before Goddard, who was naked on the bed, told the man to leave the room. Singer grabbed John Does's penis kissed John on his waist and thighs, and then placed his mouth on John’s penis, the suit says. Fresh allegations: A second man has stepped forward claiming Bryan Singer sexually abused him when he was a minor . 'Singer told John to fondle his penis, but John refused,' according to the complaint. 'Singer then grabbed John's buttocks and attempted to insert his fingers into John’s anus. 'Singer then removed his boxer shorts and John said, ''I do not want to do that''. 'In response, Singer said to John: ''Then just sit on top of me and [masturbate]; I want you to [ejaculate] on me.' 'John Doe, believing that the only way for him to leave safely without being anally raped was to comply with Singer's demands, sat on top of Singer and masturbated, ejaculating on Singer.' The next morning, according to the complaint, Singer contacted the teenager to apologize. The teenager, the suit contends, “only recently became cognizant that he has suffered psychological and emotional injuries, mental anguish and loss of enjoyment of life as a result of the Defendants’ sexual acts. Such injuries are ;severe, continuing, and permanent'. The suit contends that Singer violated the law by sexually assaulting the teenager, traveling to a foreign country for 'illicit conduct with a minor,' that he had arranged to 'meet with a minor to engage in lewd and lascivious behavior', and that by allegedly coercing the teenager in the way he did, Singer committed an act of 'gender violence' against him. Marty Singer, the lawyer for Bryan Singer, told The Daily Beast the allegations contained in the latest lawsuit were 'totally untrue'. Garth Ancier - who produced and/or developed shows like 21 Jump Street, Married ... with Children and The Simpsons - has adamantly denied laying a finger on the Michael Egan . Accused: Disney TV president David Neuman, pictured, was also named in a recent lawsuit by Egan . Singer is already fighting the claims brought forward by Egan, who said he was given drugs and promises of a . Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los . Angeles and Hawaii. One . of Egan's alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was . convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but it was the first time Singer was named. Singer's lawyer said credit card receipts, telephone records . and production schedules show that he was not in Hawaii when the lawsuit . claims he sexually abused Egan. Singer . was mainly in Toronto working on the first X-Men movie from August . through October 1999, defense attorney Marty Singer told The Associated . Press. 'This . was Bryan's first studio film,' Marty Singer said. 'Clearly, he's not . going to take a break in the middle of this movie while you're shooting . and prepping it to go to Hawaii.' X-Men . was released in July 2000. Singer has directed three films in the . blockbuster franchise, including the fifth installment, X-Men: Days of . Future Past,  as well as other films including The Usual Suspects. His . lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about . the claims made by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts . and doesn't know why charges were not pursued. Days . after filing the suit against Singer, Egan filed additional . suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, . former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head . Gary Goddard. Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'. Egan . appeared at a news conference last month alongside his mother and sex . abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills. 'Hollywood . adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said . Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to . really make kids careers.' Herman said that he's already got witnesses to the crimes waiting in the wings. One reporter asked Egan what he had to say to his alleged abusers. Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past . 'You . won't have another chance to hurt another child,' he said as his mother . wept beside him. 'And for the people who have been abused, please come . forward.' The lawsuit was filed under a Hawaii law that temporarily suspends the statute of limitations in sex abuse cases. The law has led to several lawsuits against clergy members and others. MailOnline does not typically name . victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly . about his allegations.

"An Australian man, whose American husband of almost forty years died in 2012, made a renewed pitch on Monday for a green card after the Obama administration eased policies on gay marriage. Anthony Sullivan, 72, asked federal immigration authorities in Los Angeles to reopen a 1975 petition filed by his late husband Richard Adams, which would grant him residency as the surviving spouse of a U.S. citizen. Mr Sullivan and Mr Adams met in Los Angeles in 1971. They wed in 1975 after hearing about a county clerk in Boulder, Colorado, who was giving marriage licenses to gay couples. Anthony Sullivan holds up his marriage license from his 1975 wedding to husband Richard Adams. Though the marriage license was legally issued, the couple's relationship was not acknowledged by immigration officials . The men applied for a green card for Mr Sullivan but were denied. The reason cited on the rejection letter was that: 'You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots'. After the courts shot down their appeal, they left the country and stayed with friends in Europe in the mid-1980s but soon returned to Southern California where they lived until Mr Adams died in 2012. Mr Sullivan, who overstayed his visa, would have celebrated his 39th wedding anniversary on Monday. The renewed immigration request comes less than a year after the Obama administration started issuing green cards to gay couples who marry. 'It doesn't matter how much time has passed and it doesn't matter how long it took to figure it out,' said immigration attorney Lavi Soloway. 'He and Richard sustained a constitutional injury for 40 years, and that should be corrected.' Richard Adams, left, passed away in 2012 in the couple's California home. They would have celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary on Monday . American Richard Adams and Australian Anthony Sullivan were married in 1975 and applied for Anthony to get a green card. They were turned down on the grounds that their marriage was not legal . Claire Nicholson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, declined to comment on the case. The agency that oversees immigration benefits began issuing green cards to married gay couples last year after a Supreme Court ruling struck down a law that prohibited the federal government from recognizing married same-sex couples. Since then, Mr Soloway said he has represented more than 100 couples seeking immigration benefits related to marriage, including those whose American spouse died before they got green cards. The difference in Sullivan's case is that his marriage predates the law, and the reason given for denying the couple's petition was simple 'bigotry and discrimination,' Mr Soloway said. Clela Rorex, the former Boulder clerk, said she is amazed that issues surrounding gay marriage are still not resolved. She issued a marriage license to a first gay couple in 1975 after they were denied by a clerk in nearby, more conservative Colorado Springs, and the local district attorney said the law didn't bar her from doing so. 'I really want to live long enough to see marriage equality across the country and not a piecemeal thing among the states,' said Ms Rorex, who resigned after two-and-a-half years because of opposition to her decision.

"A man charged with having sex with a 12-year-old girl whom he 'married' in NSW is set to be sentenced next year. There was a long silence at Sydney's District Court on Friday when the 27-year-old, who cannot be named, was asked to stand and formally enter a plea. The man has been charged with having sexual intercourse with the girl on at least three occasions between January 11 and February 5 this year at Raymond Terrace in the Hunter and elsewhere in NSW. A 27-year-old man, pictured at Burwood Local Court in May, has formerly pleaded guilty in Sydney's District Court on Friday to having sexual intercourse with the girl on at least three occasions . The Entrance to the Downing Centre, Sydney's District Court, where the man formally entered a plea on Friday . After he failed to get a response from the man, Judge Norman Delaney said: 'I will ask the question again, `How do you plead, guilty or not guilty?'' 'Guilty', the man eventually replied through an interpreter. Police allege the man married the girl in an Islamic ceremony in January. The man has had his student visa cancelled and is now in immigration detention in Villawood. The girl's father has also been charged over the 'marriage', with the court hearing the 27-year-old is due to give evidence at a trial into the matter next year. The 27-year-old Lebanese student, who can't be named, is set to be sentenced next year. Police allege he organised his daughter's marriage to the Lebanese immigrant because he wanted to stop her from 'committing a life of sin'. He has been charged with procuring a child under 14 for unlawful sexual activities, and being an accessory before the fact to sexual intercourse with a person under 14. Court documents say the Hunter Valley girl met the 27-year-old student at a mosque last year after he approached her father and asked to meet her. Police allege the young girl's father enabled his daughter's sexual assault by organising the unlawful marriage - including allowing them to swap phone numbers and meet three times in the family home before the ceremony. The couple spent their wedding night at a motel in the Hunter region where they had sex several times, police allege. A week after the wedding, the father asked the girl's older siblings to put two single mattresses next to each other to make a queen size bed so the couple had a bed in the family home. The imam who performed the ceremony pleaded guilty to solemnising the marriage and was fined $500 after. In court documents it is claimed that since the marriage the pair engaged in sexual activities on a daily basis until February when their relationship was discovered by a Centrelink worker, when the man tried to get registered as the girl's legal guardian in order to obtain welfare benefits. 'The girl has expressed a strong desire to start a family with the [then] 26-year-old,' the police report states.","Man pleads guilty  to persistent sexual abuse of a child in Sydney District Court .

"Liverpool and Barcelona will hold further talks over the sale of Luis Suarez this week after the Spanish club made an opening offer understood to be around £72million.

"With the stripes of a zebra and the tongue of a giraffe, okapis are constantly compared to their more recognisable cousins. But today at Bristol Zoo, the reclusive okapis commanded the public's attention. The notoriously shy creatures made a public appearance at the zoo, where the newborn okapi took her first steps outdoors. Unusual: Visitors at Bristol Zoo would have to look closely to see that these bizarre-looking creatures aren't zebras or striped horses . Maternal instinct: K'Tusha takes her first steps outdoors with her mother's encouragement . The baby Okapi, named K'tusha, took tentative steps outside the stable doors in her enclosure. The apprehensive foal was encouraged by her mother, Lodja, who nuzzled her young in an affectionate display. Bristol Zoo was the first in the UK to care for an okapi in 1961 and the first UK zoo to breed one in 1963. Since then, 37 foals have been born at the zoo. Okapis are also bred in London and Chester. The okapi's striking markings are on the back of its legs so its offspring can follow it through dense jungle. Inseparable: K'Tusha is the latest addition to the 37 foals that have been born at Bristol Zoo . Known as the 'African unicorn' the herbivore has a long blue tongue that strips leaves from branches. The female okapi has one foal every . two years. Their pregnancy lasts 15 months and foals typically stay with . their mother for two or three years. Bristol Zoo helps to fund the 8,000 square mile Okapi Wildlife Reserve in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The okapi was first discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1901. After increasingly rarer sightings, . it vanished from the wildlife radar for decades from 1959, prompting . fears that it had died out. But eight years ago researchers working for the WWF found okapi tracks in the wild. So little was known about the mysterious Okapi until the . early 20th century that the Western World believed it was a mythical . animal and called it the ‘African unicorn’. The breed was discovered by the British governor of Uganda Sir . Harry Johnston in 1901 in the densest parts of forest in the Congo. Since then, conservation projects have worked to find out . more about the creature, but it is a relatively new species. The mammal, which is a cousin of the giraffe, is timid and . reclusive. They have long and strong tongues like giraffes that can reach high . branches and strip them of their leaves. Their long legs and sturdy body have striped markings that . can either serve as camouflage or as a guide to their calves when deep in the forest. Okapis are believed to be threatened with extinction in the . near future. Civil war in the Congo has had a devastating impact on the . species. The main threats to okapi come from hunters and the destruction of . their habitat. Lodja, the mother okapi at Bristol zoo, was born at . Rotterdam zoo in 2001. She was transferred to the UK from a zoo in France.",Bristol zoo was the first in the UK to care for an okapi .
"The wait is almost over. And to celebrate Sam Fisher's imminent arrival, Ubisoft have released a brand new Blacklist gameplay trailer. The video shows off the different approaches Fisher can use during missions. Ghost focuses on stealth, with the aim of completing objectives without being seen. Panther style allows Sam to stalk his enemies and unleash fatal finishing moves. While Assault ditches the silenced weapons and focuses on an all-out attack. In this latter approach, expect the modified mark and execute mechanic - Killing In Motion - to play a central role. He's nearly here! It's felt like years but Sam Fisher is closing in on what could be his last outing on current gen . Blacklist follows on from the events of Conviction. The President shuts down the corrupt Third Echelon, replacing it with Fourth Echelon - led by Fisher. The team is then tasked with stopping a group of terrorist called  'The Engineers' attacking the United States. It's powered by a heavily modified version of the Unreal 2.5 engine - the same one used in Conviction. However, although its visuals didn't stand out at this year's E3, they are noticeably smoother than in its predecessor, with animation - in particular - much improved. Not surprisingly, the PC version was the strongest - with Nvidia's latest 700 series cards making short work of the dated engine. Xbox 360 owners can opt for Kinect functionality - with players able to make a noise to distract guards or control Sam with body movements rather than a controller. The Wii U version uses the touchscreen as an inventory and OPSAT (Fisher's arm-mounted computer) as well as presenting thermal vision and motion tracking intel. NOW WATCH THE LATEST TRAILER: .

"Exposure to THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can increase the addictive properties of nicotine . Young people who smoke cannabis are also more likely to become addicted to cigarettes - increasing their risk of heart disease and lung cancer. Exposure to THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can increase the addictive properties of nicotine, a study shows. The research, published online in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, suggests previous cannabis use may make people more vulnerable to nicotine dependence and tobacco related diseases. Cigarettes are often considered a 'gateway' to other drugs, but there is now evidence to show the reverse can be true - the use of other drugs can lead to nicotine addiction. So Dr Steven Goldberg, of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, Baltimore, Maryland, and colleagues tested whether exposing rats to THC would make them more likely to self administer nicotine. For three days, one group was given twice daily injections of the chemical while another received an equivalent dose of an inactive placebo. Beginning a week after their final jab, the rats were trained to work for intravenous injections of nicotine. Those previously given THC were far more likely to self-administer nicotine than the others, the researchers found. In addition, the THC-exposed rats were prepared to work much harder to obtain nicotine than the control group, suggesting the value of nicotine was far greater after THC exposure. Dr Goldberg said: 'This finding indicates THC-exposed rats placed a higher value on nicotine and devoted more time and energy to acquiring the drug.' Cigarettes are often considered a 'gateway' to other drugs such as marijuana (pictured), but there is now evidence to show the reverse can be true . Although there are many factors that may contribute to a progression from marijuana use to tobacco dependence, the research suggests lasting effects of THC may make marijuana users more susceptible to the addictive effects of tobacco. Dr Goldberg said: 'Tobacco is considered a gateway drug because its use tends to precede the use of other drugs. 'However, there is epidemiological evidence that cannabis use develops prior to tobacco use in a substantial number of cases, and cannabis use by teenagers increases the likelihood of developing tobacco dependence when they reach young adulthood. 'While there is also evidence genetic, social and environmental factors encourage the co-use of cannabis and tobacco, findings that cannabis use sometimes precedes regular tobacco use raise the possibility THC exposure might increase susceptibility to nicotine addiction.' He added: 'It is estimated cigarette smoking will kill half of all lifetime users. In this context, an increased risk of tobacco dependence might be the most important health consequence of cannabis use.' Previous research involving 2,500 young people in Australia found those who smoked cannabis daily for at least a month were four times more likely to become addicted to nicotine by the time they reached their 20s.","Exposure to THC, main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, can increase addictive properties of nicotine .
