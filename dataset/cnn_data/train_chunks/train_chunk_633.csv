Demonstration: The patch works by disrupting the CO2 flow which humans give off and helps mosquitoes target us . Britain may be bathed in sunshine, . but for those who find themselves the unfortunate target of mosquitoes, . the desire to expose skin remains minimal. But . now a technology firm based in California claims to have the answer - a . patch which makes the wearer invisible to the insects. The Kite Patch uses non-toxic compounds that disrupt mosquitoes' ability to find people through CO2 for up to 48 hours. The technology was developed by Olfactor . Laboratories and the University of California at Riverside, with . backing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the National . Institutes of Health. For most people in Britain bites can be painful, itchy or become infected. But for large parts of the developing world, it is much more serious. Mosquitoes spread malaria which killed 660,000 people in 2010, according to the World Health Organisation. But research published last year suggested the total is actually double that number and closer to 1.2million. The UN had set a target of eliminating the disease by 2015 but that now looks unlikely. The countries worst hit are in central and western Africa. Most deaths occur in children but a fifth also kill people aged 15 to 49. Crowdfunding website Indiegogo is running a campaign to raise $75,000 to send 20,000 Kite patches for large-scale testing in Uganda, where . malaria rates are over 60 percent. 'A child dies of the disease every minute of every day. Effective mosquito control can be the difference between life and death', said Kite co-founder Torrey Tayenaka. Scroll down for video . Innovation: The Kite Mosquito Patch is a small patch that allows humans to go virtually undetected by mosquitoes for up to 48 hours . Life saver: The Kite Mosquito Patch could help stop the spread of malaria which kills millions every year . From . $35, backers can send 10 patches to Uganda and receive 10 for . themselves. The patch is designed to be durable and affordable. It can also be stuck on bags, prams or anything else that needs protecting. 'The Kite Mosquito Patch isn’t just . another mosquito product, but a powerful alternative to most products on . the market, enabling people to live normal lives with a new level of . protection against contracting mosquito-borne diseases,' said Michelle .

The parents of a boy killed in the Sandy Hook massacre revealed on Monday that they are selling their home because they cannot bear to see the neighboring house of the man who shot dead their son. Dylan Hockley, six, was one of 20 children and six teaching staff who lost their lives when a gunman opened fire on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut a little over a month ago. His parents Ian and Nicole Hockley, who moved to the U.S. from Hampshire, England two years ago, opened up about the joy that Dylan, who had autism, had brought to their lives. Scroll down for video . Remembered: Six-year-old Dylan Hockley, who was killed in the Sandy Hook shooting last month, was described as fun-loving and incredibly empathetic by his parents . Enduring pain: Ian Hockley and his wife Nicole during a press conference with families of Sandy Hook massacre victims, one month after the shooting took place in Newtown, Connecticut . The couple spoke as they attended a gathering with other families to mark the one-month anniversary of the tragedy on Monday. Mrs Hockley told CNN: 'He was autistic but incredibly empathetic. He just wanted to have fun.' Her husband Ian said that his son was a happy child who would run to greet him every time he came home from work, shouting 'Daddy!' He added that his little boy would love to play on the trampoline in their backyard and would insist that his father join him. As the Hockleys try to come to terms with the devastating loss of their son, they have decided to move house as driving past the home of gunman Adam Lanza is more than they can cope with each day. Mrs Hockley said: 'You can't drive up your driveway every . day and see the house of a person who took your son's life and who . brought so much pain to so many people.' Leaning on each other: Nelba Marquez-Greene (left), who lost her daughter Ana, reaches out to Nicole Hockley whose son Dylan also died in the Sandy Hook massacre . The couple plan to remain in Newtown where they moved with their two sons, Dylan and eight-year-old Jake, from the UK two years ago. Dylan's older brother Jake is also struggling to come to terms with the . loss of his sibling and the many questions he has as to why this . happened. One of the ways that the Hockley family is coping is by fundraising in Dylan's name for programs that support children with autism and special needs. Although the family have shielded themselves from much of what happened on December 14 at Sandy Hook, they have been brought comfort by the bravery of one of Dylan's teachers. Special education teacher Anne Marie Murphy, 52, died trying to shield her students from bullets and was found still cradling Dylan, whom she had tried to protect. The Hockleys previously paid tribute to the loving teacher. Grief: Ian Hockley holds a photo of his six-year-old son Dylan on the one-month anniversary of his death as he attends a press conference with his wife Nicole (right) Protector: Dylan's parents said that they were comforted to know that their son had died in the arms of his beloved teacher Anne Marie Murphy . 'We take great comfort in knowing that Dylan was not alone when he died, but was wrapped in the arms of his amazing aide, Anne Marie Murphy,' they said. 'Dylan loved Mrs. Murphy so much and pointed at her picture on our refrigerator every day.' The Hockleys joined other families and neighbors of children killed at Sandy Hook on Monday to launch an initiative to help curb gun violence in America. One month after the shootings, the group, called Sandy Hook Promise, vowed at a press conference to transform public outrage into action to 'make our communities and our nation a safer, better place'. Several of the parents of children . slain in the attack appeared on stage with the organizers, some making . their first public appearances since the shooting, all holding . photographs of their son or daughter. Mrs . Hockley told the group: 'There is no quick-fix single action but . instead a multitude of interlinked actions that are needed.' The Newtown group offered no specific . solution or policy position, but co-founder Thomas Bittman said its aim . is to drive a national conversation on three issues: gun ownership and . regulation, mental health, and school and public safety. Never forget: Photos of Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre victims sit at a small memorial near the school a month after the atrocity . 'Some of us who came together to start Sandy Hook Promise are gun owners,' Bittman said. 'We hunt. We target shoot. We protect our homes. We're collectors. We teach our sons and daughters how to use guns safely. 'We're not afraid of a national conversation within our community and in Congress about responsibility and accountability.'

A homeowner has had £20,000 wiped off . the value of his house – because a surveyor said it was threatened by . knotweed growing behind his back yard. Father-of-one Ben Metcalfe, 35, had . put his terrace home in Stockport on the market at £100,000 and, after . two years of waiting, thought he had a buyer. But the sale fell through at the last . moment when a surveyor carried out an inspection on behalf of the . prospective purchaser. His report found the house was worth only £80,000 . because of a cluster of aggressive Japanese knotweed growing on council . land next door. Ben Metcalfe stands next to Japanese knotweed in the alleyway at the rear of his property in Edgeley, Stockport in Greater Manchester. A large clump of the weed can be seen directly behind him . The sale of Mr Metcalfe's house fell through at the last minute after a surveyor who carried out a report for a prospective purchaser said it was only worth £80,000 - not £100,000 - because the aggressive weed was growing on council land in an alleyway. The bamboo-like weed looms menacingly over the wall to the right . Mr Metcalfe, an NHS support worker, has been left devastated after the collapse of the sale. Pictured above with his family . The expert said the weed was a threat . to the foundations of neighbouring properties and recommended a . ‘migration plan’ to establish where the roots were, how fast the weed . was growing and what direction it would grow in. The bamboo-like plant can grow up to . 12ft high, push through concrete and damage buildings. Eradicating it . with pesticides costs £100 per square foot. An embankment behind Mr Metcalfe’s home is riddled with the weed, some of it already 10ft high. An embankment behind an alleyway next to the homes of Mr Metcalfe and neighbours is riddled with the weed, some of which has grown to around 10ft already. He is unable to cut back the weed himself for fear he could be prosecuted for damaging property . Mr Metcalfe, an NHS support worker, and other locals have long complained about the danger the weed poses to nearby foundations. He is unable to cut back the weed himself for fear he could be prosecuted for damaging property. He said: ‘We had fallen in love with a house and put an offer in but our sale fell through and we were left stranded. ‘We had been planning to move for two or three years. It is unbelievably frustrating. ‘It is clearly a real problem when someone can’t get a mortgage because of weeds. After contacting the local council property management company, NPS, it has agreed to treat the knotweed - for the first time in two years - and will give Mr Metcalfe a certificate guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years . The notorious Japanese knotweed grows 10ft high in places on council-owned land on the other side of the alleyway to the rear of the Mefcalfe home in Edgley, Stockport . Japanese knotweed, native to eastern Asia, grows rapidly and is strong enough to damage concrete . ‘I was told that if it didn’t get sorted out then I would have to sell at auction, or find a cash buyer. ‘There are a lot of lenders that simply won’t offer a mortgage on a home that has knotweed nearby. ‘When the survey came back, not only . did it show up the knotweed, it said that for the sale to proceed there . would have to be a full “migration plan” put together to chart where the . plant was and how it was travelling. ‘Of course the buyer got cold feet. We . feel like we were left completely stuck in this position while we wait . for the knotweed to be treated. We just have to hope that we can find a . buyer that is open minded.’ After contacting the local council, . property management company NPS has agreed to treat the knotweed – for . the first time in two years – and will give Mr Metcalfe a certificate . guaranteeing it will be kept in check for five years. Local Labour councillor Philip . Harding, who raised the case with Stockport Council, said: ‘It has been a . problem there for ten years so I don’t know why it has taken so long to . deal with properly.’ Liberal Democrat councillor Mark Weldon, executive member for community services, attempted to reassure residents. ‘We are committed to tackling this issue and have a comprehensive policy to address Japanese knotweed,’ he said. ‘We are aware of the residents’ concerns and contact has been made with them. ‘This site was treated for Japanese knotweed a couple of years ago when it was brought to our attention. ‘There has recently been some re-growth which will be revisited.’ The curse of Japanese knotweed . Japanese knotweed – which has the scientific name fallopia japonica – was introduced into Britain by the Victorians in 1840. Incredibly . invasive, it can grow 4in a day from April to October and a tiny root . can establish itself as a plant in  just ten days. Apparently . solid structures such as tarmac and flooring in houses are no barrier . to its growth and the weed also creates a risk of flooding if leaves . clog waterways. About £1.6billion is spent a year in an attempt to remove it. Knotweed is recognised by its shovel-shaped leaves, bamboo-like stem and white flowers produced in autumn.

Investigation: Katie Bowman has alleged that the force harassed her after she split with PC Ash . A graduate who claims to be the victim of a police harassment campaign was allowed to access the Police National Computer during patrol car rides with her former boyfriend. Katie Bowman was just 18 when she was allowed to make checks on number plates and even file reports of cars that had been stopped during the jaunts with a serving officer, PC Alexander Ash. In other incidents, she alleges that she and PC Ash handcuffed each other to a desk at a police station and that she wore his body armour. Forensic science graduate Miss Bowman, now 24, has already alleged that officers at Thames Valley Police have made her life a misery after she split with PC Ash, stopping her more than 70 times for alleged offences. She claims to have been targeted because she had broken up with PC Ash after finding out he had another girlfriend. Until last night, the force had sought to downplay the allegations but it has now launched an inquiry into them. But yesterday it responded to revelations that PC Ash, 31, took Miss Bowman on ‘ride-alongs’ in his patrol car and even let her request searches on the heavily restricted PNC. Counter claim: PC Alexander Ash at his wedding in May . Miss Bowman says for the next two years after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment . His activities had been exposed by an internal probe in 2008 but he escaped with a fine and reprimand for misconduct. Last . night Thames Valley Deputy Chief Constable Francis Habgood apologised, . admitting ‘it would appear that the conduct of a few officers has fallen . short’. He confirmed that PC Ash had been disciplined in 2008, prompted . by Miss Bowman’s complaints, and he suggested the officer could now . lose his job. Mr . Habgood said: ‘These officers behaved in a totally unacceptable way. Were this to happen today I strongly believe the outcome would be very . different.’ Documents from . an internal investigation, obtained by Miss Bowman and seen by the . Mail, describe a recording of Miss Bowman requesting information on the . PNC and filling out forms on behalf of PC Ash. Miss Bowman said: ‘Alex used to be on patrol on his own so I used to meet him and spend the rest of the shift in the car. He would let me wear his body armour, hat and belt. ‘I would do the vehicle checks over the radio and write out the forms for him.’ Miss Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, says for the next two year after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment by his colleagues. Report: How the Mail covered the story on Thursday . Complaint: Katie Bowman claims her life was made a misery . Despite never securing a conviction . against her, Miss Bowman said the officers filed up to 40 damning . intelligence reports which saw her fired from two jobs and rejected from . a third after Criminal Records Bureau checks. PC Ash claimed earlier this week that he was ‘never in a relationship’ with Miss Bowman and only met her twice. Miss Bowman, now pregnant and engaged, claims she was also forced to flee her home in Marlow and move to Bedfordshire. She said: ‘As soon as I moved it all miraculously stopped. And even though it has, I’m having to try to clear my name because I’m terrified for the future, I can’t get a job.’ Miss Bowman has the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has branded the damaging files on her as ‘utterly trivial’. Thames Valley Police removed almost half of the 40 intelligence reports after a review. The remainder will be reviewed once again in the latest probe. Deputy Chief Constable Habgood said last night: ‘It is essential that the people we serve can have absolute trust and confidence in us to conduct ourselves with integrity and professionalism at all times. 'It would appear that in this case the conduct of a few officers has fallen short of this.’ Welcoming the review, Miss Bowman said: ‘I’m happy they’ve agreed to investigate this but it is long overdue.’","Katie Bowman was 18 when she had access to confidential police data .

Price hike: Tesco has raised the price of its own-brand, everyday value two-litre bottle still water from 17p to 24p . Tesco was last night accused of ‘shameless profiteering’ after increasing the price of its bottled water by 40 per cent while Britain is in the grip of its worst heatwave in seven years. Britain’s largest supermarket chain has put up the cost of a two-litre bottle of its own-brand still water from 17p to 24p. Tesco denied it was cashing in on the heatwave and insisted the move reflected the cost of production. NHS nurse Ross Evans, 33, discovered the rise when he went to a store in Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff, on Wednesday to buy water for some of  his patients. The father-of-two said: ‘I didn’t expect Tesco to be so immoral as to put up the price of water in the middle of heatwave and cash in on people’s misery. ‘Given the warnings about the elderly and vulnerable in this weather I think this is shameless profiteering. It’s sneaky. ‘When I realised the price of the bottles had gone up from 17p to 24p I put them down again and walked out.’ The supermarket said the price of Tesco Everyday Value Still Water increased by 7p earlier this month. A spokesman said: ‘Our prices reflect the cost of production and we keep both as low as possible. We think four bottles of filtered water for less than a pound is still very good value.’ Rivals Sainsbury’s and Asda both sell their own-brand water for 17p. Last year it was revealed that Tesco’s own-brand water is merely filtered tap water. At the time a Water UK spokeswoman said: ‘Selling filtered tap water in supermarkets has a whiff of Del Boy about it. I can see it would be a nice money-making wheeze.’ Defence: Tesco denies it is cashing in on the heatwave and insists the move is to reflect the cost of production .","Supermarket chain has raised the cost of its own-brand, two-litre bottle of still water from 17p to 24p .

'He inspired love and utter loyalty and he gave it in return. I will look back on the days working with him as some of the funniest times that I have ever spent.

But he never took himself or the business too . seriously. We are all in a state of shock. We have lost a very, very . dear friend.' Friend and television producer John Lloyd told the BBC he had not seen Smith for some time because of his poor health. 'Mel had kept himself to himself since he became ill.

Smith was described as having 'extraordinary natural talent' by Peter Fincham, director of television at ITV. Mr Fincham, who was the business partner of Smith and his comedy sideback Griff Rhys Jones at Talkback Productions as well as their agent, said: 'Life was always exciting around Mel. 'He was my friend and business partner for many years and had extraordinary natural talent with the rare gift of wearing it lightly. 'Being funny came naturally to him, so much so that he never seemed to give it a second thought. Mel and Griff were one of the great comedy acts and it's hard to imagine that one of them is no longer with us.'

Smith . had been a director since his days at Oxford University, and went on to . have more success behind the camera with films such as Bean, The Tall . Guy and Blackball. Though he and Jones sold Talkback in 1999 to Freemantle, Smith remained one of the key figures in UK comedy. During an appearance on Celebrity Mastermind in 2009, Smith had appeared frail and slurred his words. It later emerged he had been suffering from severe pharyngitis. He leaves his wife Pam, the couple had been married for 24 years. Father Ted writer Graham Linehan said . he and writing partner Arthur Mathews had been helped in their career . by Smith, with their first sketches being broadcast on Alas Smith and . Jones.

Smith and Jones formed production company Talkback together, which was sold in 2000. The duo last worked together in a sketch show in 2012. BBC director general Tony Hall said: 'Mel Smith's contribution to British comedy cannot be overstated.

'And his pioneering TV production work with Griff Rhys Jones through their company Talkback has created many of the defining comedy shows of recent decades.' Rowan Atkinson, who worked with Smith on both Not the Nine O'Clock News and Bean, the first Mr Bean film, said he was 'truly sad' to hear about his death. In a statement, he said: 'Mel Smith - a lovely man of whom I saw too little in his later years. I loved the sketches that we did together on Not the Nine O'Clock News. 'He was the cast member with whom I felt the most natural performing empathy. 'He had a wonderfully generous and sympathetic presence both on and off screen.""He was also an excellent theatre and movie director, doing a wonderful job on the first Mr Bean movie.

Jack was up against tough competition in the Best Moment category, with fellow nominees including Olympic soccer player Alex Morgan, Olympic tennis gold medalist Andy Murray and Indianapolis Colts head coach Chuck Pagano, who has also battled cancer. 'We’re not what you would call red carpet people and so we've had some great fellow Nebraskans lend a helping hand in that regard,' Mr Andy told 1011. Jack proved to have plenty of fans among the high-profile sportsmen at the ceremony. Many of them, including South Carolina's Jadeveon Clowney, ESPN anchor Stuart Scott and Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson posted pictures of them posing with Jack on social media, Omaha.com reported. Fans: South Carolina's Jadeveon Clowney was one of the many sports stars who posed with Jack . Moment of fame: Jack was escorted down the red carpet by Nebraska player Taylor Martinez and his parents . The brave cancer patient's chance to join the Huskers came through his family's friendship with the team's former star running back Rex Burkhead. Burkhead befriended Jack shortly after the brain cancer was diagnosed in April 2011. Their friendship grew into the Team Jack campaign that has raised awareness and funds for research. 'Jack is a fighter, a strong kid,' Burkhead said. 'To see him run around and enjoy the Husker experience, it's a dream come true, especially for kids in the state of Nebraska.' The video of the sports fan, who announced last month that he had completed his last round of chemotherapy, moved so many people that he was invited to meet the President. Jack's father, Andy Hoffman, said President Obama presented his son with a new football and told him he was proud of him. 'We’re honored because Jack represents every kid who has gone through this horrific disease without any changes in the first-line protocol to treat his form of pediatric brain cancer in 25 years,' he added. His son's touchdown also resulted in Upper Deck, a sports and entertainment trading card company, creating a sports trading card for the 7-year-old, KETV7 reported. National attention: News of Jack's touch down reached the White House, and he was invited to meet President Obama who gave him a signed football . Jack won . the hearts of fans and everyone in the football program for his . courageous bout with brain cancer during his appearance in April. Wearing a miniature Burkhead uniform complete with a No. 22 jersey, Jack ran onto the field late in the scrimmage. He then ran 69 yards for a spectacular touchdown that he celebrated in front of the crowd of 60,174. Running back Burkhead is the captain of the support network Team Jack. On . a fourth-and-1 play, he took a handoff from Martinez. Jack started . running left, but Martinez redirected him. The little guy turned on a . dime and followed a wall of blockers down the field. Players . from the Red and White squads left their sidelines and followed him . into the end zone to mob him and lift him on their shoulders after his . 69-yard touchdown. The crowd at Memorial Stadium cheered as Jack celebrated - a moment that left his father misty-eyed on the sideline. Hero: Jack, who was seven when he appeared on the pitch, might go down as the biggest star of the Nebraska spring game . Battle: The boy is fighting brain cancer and he came on to the field to run a 69-yard touchdown. He said it felt 'awesome' Jack ran 69-yards to score this touchdown. Players from the Red and White squads left their sidelines and followed him into the end zone to mob him and lift him on their shoulders . Survivor: Jack was diagnosed with cancer in April 2011 and has had two surgeries . Asked what he was thinking when he ran on to the field, Jack said, 'Scoring a touchdown.' And when he broke free and scored? 'It felt awesome.' And the crowd reaction? 'Really awesome.' Football operations director Jeff Jamrog and fullback C.J. Zimmerer came up with the idea to get Jack involved in the spring game. Mr Jamrog had called the Hoffmans before the game to tell them the Huskers had a special play planned for Jack. Receivers coach Rich Fisher motioned Jack over on the sideline to show him the play he drew up. Mr Hoffman said that's when it hit him that his son really would get his day in the sun at Memorial Stadium. 'It was a lot of emotions right at once,' Andy said. 'Very emotional to see that. Husker fans have been so incredible to Jack and our family and especially to this cause.' Mr Hoffman said Jack was 'doing . great' and that an MRI at Children's Hospital in Boston showed that the . tumor has shrunk substantially in the past year. 'We're very optimistic for Jack,' he added. Burkhead, . who is preparing for the NFL draft, said he got as much joy out of . Jack's touchdown as he did for any of the ones he scored for the . Huskers. 'For Jack to get down here and do it, I know it made his day.' Star running back Rex Burkhead (right) befriended Jack last year and is the captain of the support network known as 'Team Jack' Jack has won the hearts of fans and everyone in the football program for his courageous bout with brain cancer .","Jack Hoffman awarded Best Moment of the Year for Huskers video .

"By . Lauren Hood . PUBLISHED: . 12:08 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:59 EST, 21 July 2013 . Lauren got impatient waiting for baby and visited the beauty salon for numerous treatments . As the world waits for news of the Royal baby, we may all be getting a bit impatient, but if you're feeling frustrated, imagine how Kate is feeling. I don't have to imagine as I know exactly how it feels to be overdue - my baby was 16 days late! When you are told your due date early in pregnancy you become fixated on that date, everything revolves around that day, 20 weeks to go, 2 weeks to go, two days to go and then suddenly that all important date comes and goes and you're left in limbo. Every call you make is answered with 'Are you in labour?' and your Facebook becomes filled with messages asking 'Any sign of this baby yet?'. It started to drive me crazy, to a point I stopped making calls and even put a message on Facebook advising people not to ask if the baby had arrived as if it had I would let them know. Luckily I only had eager friends and family waiting on my baby's arrival, poor Kate has not only a country, but most of the world waiting for her happy news. But no matter how much she may will . this baby to make an appearance, the truth is that the baby will only . arrive when it's ready. I'm . sure Kate has been bombarded with advice from mothers telling her what . methods brought on their labours, well I tried them all, long walks, . bumpy roads, pineapple, curries, raspberry leaf capsules and endlessly . bouncing on my birthing ball, but nothing would budge my little girl. When I reached 41 weeks I had an appointment at the local birth centre where I had reflexology and acupressure, I was also given what is called a 'cervical sweep', I'll not go into details but all I'll say is it was certainly not one of the most pleasant experiences of my life! I left the centre feeling quite positive . and was told this could help bring on labour in the next 24 to 48 . hours. But two days later there was still no sign of the little one. So, . as much as the sweep was not enjoyable, I would do anything to get this . baby out so back I went for another one and then a third, but yet again . no joy. She had 'almost all on offer' and when she went into hospital she was so dolled up she looked like a Barbie . By this stage the impatience was starting to drive me mad, every day seemed to last a lifetime but the only thing that kept me sane was keeping busy. I arranged to do something every single day, I met friends for lunch, went shopping, went to the cinema, walked endlessly round the park and made several visits to the beautician. In fact I called into the beauticians so often I had almost all of the treatments on offer. I had my toenails and fingernails . painted, maternity massages, hair extensions and even false eyelashes, . so by the time I was taken into hospital I looked like a pregnant Barbie . Doll. The day before I went into hospital to be induced was the worst day of all. My bump was so enormous I actually thought my stomach might explode, I couldn't sleep properly and couldn't bend down to even put my socks on. I was tired, hot, huge and extremely frustrated. What made it worse was that one of my friends from my antenatal course, who was due two weeks after me, had gone into labour that morning. I cried most of that day and even called the hospital, begging for them to take me in, but despite my pleas they said I had to wait one more day. It was not just me who was feeling frustrated, my poor other half was just as anxious as me to meet our little one, and he also had to put up with my emotional outbursts. Therefore my sympathies are not just with Kate, but William also, although at least he doesn't have a giant bump to contend with. As baby was approaching 16 days late, Lauren felt her bump so enormous her stomach might explode . So finally, after 14 days, endless beauty treatments, far too many curries and an overdose of raspberry leaf tea, on the 9th April I waddled into Pembury Hospital, with my fake hair and eyelashes, and started to get excited about finally seeing my baby.  But she was stubborn and refused to budge for another two days. Finally on 11th April, 16 days past my due date, my beautiful baby girl Sophia Belle Hampshire arrived into this world. I still had my false eyelashes on but after two days of labour I was far from glamorous and refused to let a camera near me. Unfortunately for Kate, I don't think she will be able to avoid the cameras for long but until the Royal baby arrives my advice to her is to keep busy, go for long walks, get pampered and enjoy getting some sleep as you'll not be getting much of that over the next few months. She felt in limbo as her due date came and went, she couldn't bend down and was totally exhausted .","Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's royal baby is yet to arrive .

His favourite locations to take astronomy pictures are on the south coast as the conditions tend to be better. Mr Sharp has enjoyed taking pictures of the Milky Way above Stonehenge, Wiltshire, because of its ancient astronomy links. The IT project manager, who regards photography as a hobby, spends up to four hours into the early hours of the morning taking pictures of the sky.

The Milky Way is pictured above Netley Abbey in Southampton . Scenic: Mr Sharp's favourite locations to take astronomy pictures are on the south coast. This is the Milky Way above St Michael's Mount in Cornwall . He says there is a very narrow window available to get shots of the Milky Way so he was pleased to capture them. Mr Sharp , 50, from Portsmouth, said: 'In the UK the Milky Way can only be seen in summer, between May and August. 'The optimum time frame to shoot it is between 12.30am and 02.30am, before it gets too light. 'And even then you can only really see it in the dark moon phase - a week either side of a full moon. 'What's more, the skies have to be crystal clear to allow for good shots - which all makes for a very narrow window of opportunity. 'It's a very spectacular sight, especially when you see it with the naked eye - and I like the challenge of seeing it in the UK.

He also created a selection of star trails - made by collating hours of photographs to show the apparent motion of stars. Mr Sharp added: 'My star trail photos tend to be the result of about four hours of photography and what you're seeing is the Earth's rotation. 'Normally I will finish up shooting at about 1am. 'Astronomy photography takes dedication and a lot of research beforehand, and luck comes into play too.' Mr Sharp's shot of the Milky Way above Stonehenge is one he believes may not be possible in the future due to the closure of the adjacent A344 road.

"By . Stephen Adams . PUBLISHED: . 16:10 EST, 20 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:10 EST, 20 July 2013 . Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie said the NHS must no longer be taken for granted . Cheats are fleecing the NHS of at least £100 million a year by falsely claiming that they are entitled to free prescriptions. The Mail on Sunday has discovered that patients are simply walking into pharmacies and claiming they are on benefits or a low income – and a 'scandalously careless' checking system means few people are ever caught. Pharmacists told undercover reporters that it was ‘very, very rare’ for someone to be investigated – let alone fined – while one even appeared to condone abuse of the system. According to latest figures, prescription fraud costs the NHS £100 million – enough to pay for 4,000 extra nurses. A new report into the problem will be published later this summer, and experts believe that the figures could climb even higher. In England, everyone aged 19 to 59 must pay the £7.85 prescription charge unless they can prove they are receiving benefits, are on a low income, or have certain medical conditions. However, the system is open to abuse because patients simply have to tick a box on the back of the form to state they are exempt from the fee. Pharmacists should ask to see evidence such as a benefits letter, but undercover Mail on Sunday reporters found they sometimes do not. All the pharmacy staff we spoke to said they would dispense medication free of charge even without seeing proof of entitlement. This is in line with official guidance, which states there is ‘no question of refusing to dispense the prescribed item’ to those who don’t have the evidence on them. Staff should instead tick a box on the form stating ‘evidence not seen’, which can then trigger a fraud investigation. Patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £7.85 prescription fee plus a £100 penalty charge (posed by models) But our reporters were told  that rarely happened. An assistant at Morrisons Pharmacy in Rubery, Birmingham, said that when this box was ticked, forms could get ‘pulled out’ for questioning, before adding: ‘It’s very, very rare, though.’ And in a clear breach of the guidelines, another pharmacy worker said she would not tick the ‘evidence not seen’ box, thus ensuring no investigation would be launched. The member of staff at Boots in North End Road, Fulham, West London, said: ‘I won’t tick this box to say I haven’t seen it. I’m not like that.’ Our reporters did not collect any prescriptions during their investigations. Patients caught falsely claiming free medication must pay back the £7.85 prescription fee plus a £100 penalty charge. But the investigation process is lengthy, involving local health authorities, the Health Service’s anti-fraud arm – NHS Protect – and other bodies such as the Department for Work and Pensions. NHS Protect could not say how many prescriptions it investigated last year, nor how many penalty charges were issued. Its last report, published five years ago, found one in 50 claims for free prescriptions was fraudulent, resulting in drugs worth £100 million being handed out that patients should have paid for. Since then the cost of drugs dispensed for free has risen about £1 billion to £8.28 billion in 2011. Cuts have also forced NHS Protect to scale down its anti-fraud work in this area, according to Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University. He said: ‘Their resources have declined significantly over the past five or six years. I would guess that there is not as much enforcement work going on as there used to be.’ The NHS Business Services Authority, which runs NHS Protect, has cut its running costs by 41 per cent since 2006, according to the latest annual report. No new anti-fraud policies have been introduced since 2007, said a spokesman, but he stressed that the number of investigations was determined by local health authorities, not NHS Protect. Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie, a member of the Commons’ Health Select Committee, said last night: ‘Clearly, the system for checking if people are actually exempt from prescription charges is scandalously careless. It seems pharmacists just tick a box and they’ve got a happy customer.’ She added: ‘Sadly, this is an example of a wider attitude across the NHS system that the Health Service is literally free. But it is not. Everything in the NHS costs. We can no longer take it for granted and must urgently plug this expensive, leaky institution.’ Stephen Barclay, a Conservative member of the Public Accounts Committee, said controls on prescription fraud were ‘clearly non-existent’. He added: ‘It is deeply frustrating given that I have repeatedly raised concerns over NHS fraud in Parliament.’ Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, called for a ‘fundamental review of prescriptions’. But a spokesman for the Royal College of Pharmacists said it was ‘not their job to police the Government’s prescription exemption system’, adding: ‘Guidance is very clear that pharmacists must put the clinical needs of a patient first, and not deny someone access to lifesaving medicines because they haven’t got proof of exemption.’ The Health Department said it took NHS fraud ‘extremely seriously’, adding that NHS Protect would ‘continue to seek the strongest possible sanctions for people who perpetrate it’. A Boots spokesman said: ‘If it was proved that a pharmacist actively sought to wrongly fill out an exemption, Boots UK would take the matter very seriously and it would be grounds for a serious investigation.’","Prescription fraud costs NHS £100 million - enough to pay 4,000 nurses .

"By . Martin Beckford . PUBLISHED: . 16:10 EST, 20 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:14 EST, 21 July 2013 . Victim: Hollie Watson from South London, pictured with her son Tyler . Thousands of fraud victims have had their cases ignored due to the failure of a new crime hotline. Action Fraud is writing to apologise to nearly 2,500 people whose crime reports went missing over the past eight months because of an ‘IT fault’. The blunder will put further pressure on Ministers to improve the nationwide system introduced this year, which means people can no longer report fraud by calling 999 or visiting a police station. Instead, they must give details online or ring a call centre run by a company handed £2 million of public cash in the past year. Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) have urged the Home Secretary to carry out a review amid concerns that Action Fraud is not giving victims support, refusing to update them on progress and failing to pass on more than half of cases to police. The computer problems will also heighten concerns that statistics showing a fall in crime do not fully take into account soaring levels of online scams, most of which are never reported, investigated or solved. Dorset PCC Martyn Underhill demanded action from Ministers after constituent Jenny Parkinson, 64, lost her £68,000 life savings in a bank scam, saying: ‘The system is flawed because it’s not focused on victims.’ But Action Fraud failed to pass the grandmother’s case on to police, despite the large sum involved, and did not inform her of the decision. It was only after she went to her local radio station and her PCC got involved that an investigation was launched. Failure: Action Fraud is supposed to provide a central point of contact for fraud victims but has been heavily criticised . She said: ‘I feel police action is vital or the criminals will come to understand that Action Fraud is toothless and they can continue to rob at will.’ Victims told The Mail on Sunday they felt let down after making reports to Action Fraud. In most cases their banks had already said they would not get their money back because they had voluntarily – if unwittingly – transferred it to fraudsters. Hollie Watson, a 24-year-old hairdresser from Catford, South London, rang the hotline after giving a £2,000 deposit on a flat to a ‘landlord’ who turned out to be a fraudster. Concern: Dorset PCC Martyn Underhill has demanded action after constituent Jenny Parkinson, 64, lost £68,000 in a bank scam . ‘Action Fraud weren’t as helpful as I thought they would be,’ she said. ‘I was constantly ringing them to find out what was happening and they wouldn’t tell me anything.’ She also asked to be put in touch with the charity Victim Support, but they only contacted her six weeks later. Ludivina Saloma, a 43-year-old nurse from Bedfordshire, paid more than £3,000 for flights to the Philippines to visit her dying father, only to discover the ‘travel agent’ was bogus. She says Action Fraud told her to go to the small claims court and when she tried to explain her situation, a call centre operator hung up on her. ‘It was really rude,’ she said. ‘We just kept going round and round, she was saying it wasn’t a fraud.’ Online fraud is one of the fastest-growing categories of crime, with official figures last week showing that thousands of people are falling victim to dating scams, in which conmen befriend them over the internet then convince them to hand over cash. Millions of Britons are also being tricked into giving away bank details and passwords by fake emails, or paying for goods online that never arrive. Action Fraud was set up in 2009 to gather information on new scams and take reports instead of police, who often lack resources or expertise to solve online scams. The quango’s budget now stands at £5 million a year, much of which is paid to the firm BSS to run a call centre in Manchester. BSS started off managing telethons such as Children In Need for the BBC, and also operates a ticket line for the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. Complaints: Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'Action Fraud has taken immediate action to process the affected reports' Action Fraud received 302,526 reports in 2012-13 but only 40 per cent were passed on to police to investigate. Most reports are included in crime statistics, says the Home Office. On Friday, Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne admitted that since November last year, 2,490 online reports ‘were not processed correctly due to a fault in the IT system’. He said: ‘Action Fraud has taken immediate action to process the affected reports and will be writing to apologise to everyone and to make it clear that their report is now being dealt with.’ The Home Office said Action Fraud received 30 complaints between January and March this year, adding that BSS would have to pay to repair the IT system and contact victims following the technical fault. A Home Office spokesman added: ‘We are constantly looking at ways of improving our effectiveness and we welcome feedback from PCCs and the public.’","New hotline Action Fraud has lost nearly 2,500 crime reports .

"By . Russell Myers . PUBLISHED: . 16:27 EST, 20 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:35 EST, 21 July 2013 . After days of fielding leading questions from French journalists about drug use in the sport, British cyclist Chris Froome hit back yesterday – literally. Needing only a solid finish in the penultimate stage of the Tour de France to cruise to victory in Paris today, Froome was forced to punch one over-eager fan who ran in front of his bike. Kenyan-born Froome’s third-place finish yesterday gives him a 5min 3secs advantage in the 100th edition of the sport’s most famous race, and he simply needs to avoid an accident during today’s procession from Versailles to the Champs-Elysees to claim the trophy. In action: British cyclist Chris Froome, pictured left during the Tour de France, is on course to win the sport's most famous race . The Olympic time-trial bronze medallist said: ‘I can’t quite believe I’m sitting here in this position. It really is amazing. ‘I’m a bit lost for words. I’ve still got to roll into Paris but this is the general classification sorted out. To finish it off like this is special.’ Froome’s stunning achievement follows Sir Bradley Wiggins’s victory 12 months ago. It means that after a wait of 99 years for its first winner of the famous tour, Britain will soon have two in as many races. Unseemly: Chris Froome's partner Michelle Cound became embroiled in a Twitter row with Bradley Wiggins's wife Cath during the Tour last year . But Froome’s efforts have been soured by comparisons with Lance Armstrong and the other cyclists who used drugs to dominate the tour in the past 20 years. Since he powered into the lead with an emphatic victory in the first mountain stage, Froome, 28, has been forced to respond to questions about doping. He said: ‘I can understand why people are asking, given the  history of the sport – they have been let down so many times before. ‘But I’m also one of those people who’s been let down. I’ve also believed in people who have turned out to be cheats and liars. But I can assure you, I’m not.’ The media even asked Team Sky to release all the data it has on Froome, to combat accusations of doping. The team initially refused because it said it might help its rivals, but in an unusual step, it gave French newspaper L’Equipe data collected over the past two years. The information was analysed by physiologist Dr Fred Grappe, who did not find any abnormalities. He concluded Froome’s performance wasn’t as a result of doping but simply ‘at the upper bounds of what is physiologically possible’. Froome has been subjected to 19 drug tests during this tour and 29 in total this season.Froome’s path to professional cycling, from mountain biking on dusty roads in the nature reserves of Kenya’s Great Rift Valley to the giddy heights of the Tour de France and the Olympics, has been unlike any other in the sport. Born in Nairobi to British parents, he was educated in South Africa and studied economics at university. In the lead: Chris Froome pictured after finishing third in stage twenty, a 125KM road stage from Annecy to Annecy-Semnoz, of the 2013 Tour de France . Almost there: Chris Froome pictured as he realises he is close to winning the Tour de France after finishing third in Saturday's stage . But he abandoned his degree to take up the offer of a professional cycling contract in Europe. At first he struggled, not being used to the harsh winters, or the tactics, discipline and etiquette needed in the professional sport. But within two years he had signed for the biggest professional team in the world – Team Sky – and last year finished runner-up to team-mate Wiggins. Tension still surrounds the two men after Froome sacrificed his own chances to support Wiggins’ bid for victory last year. Even their partners became embroiled in an unseemly Twitter row, with Froome’s girlfriend, South African photographer Michelle Cound, tweeting: ‘Teamwork is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.’ Congratulations: Chris Froome and team mate Richie Porte cross the finish line together at the end of stage eighteen on Thursday . Proud: Michelle Cound Tweeted this image of her with cyclist boyfriend Chris Froome during the Tour . Cath Wiggins replied to praise  Team members Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for ‘genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism’ – but did not mention Froome. Today’s procession into Paris will take place later than usual, with organisers delaying the start in the hope of a sunset finish. Isle of Man rider Mark Cavendish – dubbed the Manx Missile – has won the past four sprints on the Champs-Elysees and is aiming to become the first rider to win the final stage five times. Nearing the end: Chris Froome after retaining his yellow jersey after stage seventeen of the Tour de France .","Froome was forced to punch one fan who ran in front of his bike yesterday .

Crown Prosecution Service chiefs are at the centre of a row over a £623,555 secret payout to a senior civil servant who they have refused to name. The massive redundancy package was among nearly 1,300 handed out to lawyers and civil servants working for the CPS over the past three years. But none have been publicly named. Last night a former senior CPS lawyer said the agency had a duty to name the highest paid individual because the compensation was public money. Cuts: There have been nearly 1,300 redundancy packages which averaged at £48, 434 handed out by the Crown Prosecution Service in the last three years . He said: ‘If the BBC are able to name top executives who receive golden payouts, I can see no reason why this shouldn’t apply to people working at the CPS.’ But a CPS spokesman said it had to honour the confidentiality of the severance deal, which prevents the individual being named. Details of the payment were obtained under a Freedom Of Information request which also showed that the average payout at the CPS between 2009 and 2012 was £48,434 – some £6,000 more than the average across Whitehall, according to HMRC. The majority of redundancies are in response to Coalition budget cuts across Whitehall (stock image pictured) Explaining the size of the payoff, a CPS spokesman said: ‘As a government department, the CPS is bound by Civil Service-wide pension rules. 'This severance payment to a senior employee was made under the old Civil Service pension rules, which contractually entitled long-standing employees to up to six years’ pay if they were made redundant.’ He added: ‘The CPS had no discretion in the size of this payment. Following the reform to the pension rules, an employee of similar seniority and length of service who was made redundant today would receive a much smaller compensation payment. 'This payment included a confidentiality clause and we are legally bound not to name the former employee.’ The majority of the 1,282 CPS payoffs are in response to Coalition budget cuts across Whitehall. A CPS spokesman added: ‘Following the Government’s comprehensive spending review in 2010, the CPS, like most government departments, has been required to make significant savings in its overall budget.’ He added: ‘The savings will inevitably involve a reduction in staff through voluntary routes and we have offered a series of exit schemes since 2010. 'These have enabled us to reduce senior staff and managers and headquarters employees, while protecting frontline services. The scheme is in full accordance with Cabinet Office guidance.’","Average redundancy payout at the CPS between 2009 and 2012 was £48,434 .

Medical attention: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London . Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo had two of his teeth knocked out as he was pushed heavily against a window by prison officers, his brother has claimed . Five members of Belmarsh prison staff have been suspended after the 28-year-old suspect was injured on Wednesday at the prison in south-east London. The Prison Officers' Association (POA) said he was being restrained using approved techniques, and that its members strenuously denied any wrongdoing. His brother Jeremiah Adebolajo told the BBC that he . speaks to his brother almost daily, and had also spoken to his lawyer . and to the governor of the prison. Michael Adebolajo is accused of murdering soldier Lee Rigby in May. He claims five officers at a time are present when dealing with him and he is never in contact with any other prisoner. He said the altercation began when his brother was given an instruction by one of the guards. He said: 'They decided to twist his arm back... the arm that had been shot... He manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window.' Mr Adebolajo added: 'I wonder why it took five prison officers to restrain one man and how in the course of that restraint his teeth were able to be knocked out if they were following procedures. 'The suggestion is that procedures means that prisoners' teeth are going to be knocked out.' POA chairman Peter McParlin has accused the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) of 'over-reacting'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We have spoken to our members and on the basis of what our members have told us they have done absolutely nothing wrong. 'We are concerned that the Ministry of Justice have over-reacted due to the notoriety of this prisoner.' Accusations: Adebolajo is accused of hacking Fusilier Rigby (left) to death together with Michael Adebowale, 22 (right, in a court drawing). The two suspects are due to stand trial on November 18 . Jail: It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently on Wednesday, and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison's high-security wing . Mr McParlin criticised the MoJ for failing to 'correct false reporting' of the incident at Belmarsh. He said that while restraint techniques were designed to minimise injuries to staff and prisoners, 'sometimes there are unforeseen consequences in any violent incident'. A POA official said earlier this week that it will fully co-operate with any police investigation, and expects the officers to be 'fully exonerated'. Crowds of wellwishers line the street as the funeral cortege of Fusilier Lee Rigby drives away from Bury Parish church on July 12 following a funeral service attended by 800 .

"By . Alasdair Glennie . PUBLISHED: . 16:55 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:16 EST, 19 July 2013 . The head of the BBC handed a £600,000 contract to a friend, it emerged last night. Tony Hall has appointed Suzanne Heywood to lead a two-month review into making the corporation a ‘simpler place to work’. He worked with Lady Heywood, who is married to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, at the Royal Opera House before he joined the BBC as director-general. In the money: Suzanne Heywood, pictured with husband Sir Jeremy Heywood, has landed a plum job with the BBC . Her study with global management consultants McKinsey is not expected to cut the BBC’s headcount or save money. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Commons public accounts committee, said the links between the pair raised very serious questions as to how McKinsey beat its rivals to the contract. Threatening to call Lord Hall before the committee’s next BBC hearing in September, the senior Labour MP said: ‘If these questions are not adequately answered we will have to investigate them ourselves. ‘It’s a lot of money. If you are going to pay consultants you have to go through the appropriate mechanisms and not use your friends. ‘With all eyes on the BBC at the moment I can’t understand why they don’t appreciate that everything has to be visibly above board.’ Conor Burns, a Tory MP on the culture, media and sport committee, has written to Lord Hall asking him to publish all the documents relating to the McKinsey contract. ‘Tony Hall was brought in as director-general with a clear mandate to put the days of murky relationships and mutual back scratching at the BBC behind them,’ he said. ‘It is vital if his credibility is to be upheld that the BBC now urgently publish the tender documents relating to the awarding of this contract, so the licence fee payer can see beyond doubt that this contract was awarded on merit and not on the basis of personal favours.’ Question time: BBC Director General Lord Tony Hall may be called in front of MPs to explain his decision to employ Lady Heywood . He added: ‘It seems extraordinary when you have so many highly paid executives that you need to bring in highly paid consultants to do a job they should be able to do themselves. ‘It is a very poor use of licence fee payers’ money. The only way it will be good value for money is if the consultants recommend firing one of the BBC’s senior managers. One of their salaries could pay for the whole exercise.’ A partner in New York-based McKinsey & Company, Lady Heywood is also a director of the Royal Opera House in London, where Lord Hall was chief executive from 2001 until his switch to the BBC in April. The BBC insists McKinsey was hired ‘after a competitive process’. Announcing the plan, Lord Hall said: ‘I want, as far as I can, to turn more of the organisation toward the programmes and our services, and less on the other things a big organisation like this does. ‘We all know that working in matrices is a very complex way of operating. We can make it simpler for people to take responsibility for what they do. ‘I hope that by this time next year, I will be standing before staff and licence fee payers with a simpler organisation, where responsibilities are much clearer.’ McKinsey was on a shortlist of four management consultancy firms before Lord Hall made the final decision to award it the contract. Earlier this year, he was criticised for appointing another former colleague to a top post at the BBC on a £395,000 salary.  Anne Bulford, who was Channel 4’s chief operating officer, was handed the role of managing director of finance and operations without the job being advertised. Miss Bulford spent three years with the Royal Opera House as director of finance and business affairs before joining Channel 4 in 2005. Lord Hall knows her from their time together at the Royal Opera and also from his time as deputy chairman at Channel 4. When he appointed her, he sent an email to staff saying she was a ‘direct appointment rather than an advertised one’ because he believed her talent and experience ‘make her the best person for this role’. Her appointment came shortly after Lord Hall announced he had hired former Labour culture secretary James Purnell as strategy and digital chief on £295,000 a year. Like Miss Bulford he was appointed without the role being advertised. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘There’s no doubt that the BBC needs to simplify its labyrinthine structures, but licence fee payers will be dismayed that yet again McKinsey is raking in a massive sum in consultancy fees. ‘Given the vast sums that the BBC top brass are paid, you could be forgiven for thinking that they ought to be best placed to take a lead in sorting out their own organisation.’ At a public accounts committee hearing into the BBC severance payments scandal this month, MPs said the corporation’s financial management was akin to ‘corporate fraud and cronyism’. In 2011, the BBC was criticised for spending more than £8million on management consultants in just one year. Last year, former director-general George Entwistle hired accountancy firm Deloitte to help slash the number of managers at the corporation. A BBC spokesman said: ‘McKinsey & Company were appointed because they were the best organisation to do the job. ‘A number of companies took part in a competitive tender process and were assessed and shortlisted before the director-general was involved. ‘The final decision was then unanimously taken by a committee comprising representatives from the BBC’s strategy and finance divisions and the director-general.’","Lady Heywood and director-general of the BBC Lord Hall have worked together before .

As MPs began . their six-week summer recess, the PM rushed to Lord’s in north London to . catch England batting their way to 361 all out. Speaking . on BBC’s Test Match Special during the lunch break, Mr Cameron revealed . how his interest in yesterday's match had triggered panic around the Cabinet . table. He said: ‘We had a . Cabinet meeting and I asked someone to bring in the cricket score half . way through just to see how it was going. ‘And a bit of paper arrived in the Cabinet room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby. ‘There . was a great intake of breath and actually it was because Ken Clarke . wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at Lord’s.’ Where's Dave? The Prime Minister was surrounded by ordinary fans as he watched England all out for 361 . Unusually . Cabinet ministers held their weekly meeting at Chequers, the Prime . Minister’s country retreat, yesterday instead of in Downing Street. The stately pile boasts tennis courts and a swimming pool but Mr Cameron’s official spokesman denied it was a ‘jolly’. Today . the Prime Minister seemed delighted to have started parliament's long . summer break with a few hours in the sunshine watching the cricket. He said: 'It's such a glorious sight coming here, the sun shining, England playing well. 'It always such a wonderful thing to see. I was a bit late and thought this morning that I wouldn't see England batting.' Asked . by former cricketer and broadcaster Geoffrey Boycott to join him at to . watch a match at Headingley, Mr Cameron replied: 'We could have a day . when we cancel Question Time and all come to the cricket.' Spotted: Cricket fans turn around to see the famous face in the row behind them . Hook: Mr Cameron watches intently from the stands at Lord's cricket ground in north London . Thirsty work: Mr Cameron sips from a water bottle as play continues . Ahead of the Ashes Mr Cameron hailed . the competition as the ‘big one’ and warned Britain had ‘high hopes’ for . Alistair Cook’s side as it took on the Australian’s. He . added: ‘Now whether you remember Botham and Willis at Headingley, like I . do, or Kevin Pietersen’s defiant stance at the Oval in 2005 - I . remember where I was when that happened - nothing captures the public’s . imagination quite like a Test match against Australia. ‘The nation’s got high hopes. We’re right behind the team, and I’m sure they’re going to rise to the occasion.’ The visit to the cricket is just the . start of a long summer for Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused . of spending too long chillaxing. He . is expected to take two holidays this summer - one in Cornwall and one . in Scotland – in the middle of his campaign against independence. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will be away at the same time, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge of the country. The . PM and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time . this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in . charge of the country. Mr . Clegg revealed earlier this month that he had been unable to co-ordinate . his family holiday so it did not clash with the Camerons’, and other . ministers will be left to ‘hold the fort’. After leaving Lord's the Prime Minister travelled to the Olympic Park to hand out goody bags to Olympic Games Makers who were there to celebrate one year on from the Olympic and Paralympic Games . Every . year Mr Clegg and his family go to the same village in Spain where his . wife Miriam’s family is from. They will be accompanied by their three . children Antonio, Alberto and Miguel. But like millions of schoolchildren, MPs couldn’t wait to start their six week summer holiday last night. But . without the chance to watch a DVD or play Buckaroo on the green benches . of the House of Commons hardly any politicians bothered turning up for . the last day of the parliamentary term. Maybe MPs can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the Commons had a recess. At 5.20pm yesterday Commons John Bercow moved to adjourn the House of Commons until September 2. It means there will be no new legislation, no debates and no Prime Minister’s Questions for six long weeks. MPs argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies. With . the general election now less than two years away, those with the . smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more . voters. However the chance to get away for a holiday – or two – will prove too great for most. As the Commons wound down yesterday it seemed most MPs have started their break early. Fewer than 50 of the 650 MPs turned out to see Business Secretary Vince Cable answer questions on the economy at 9.30am. Clash: Mr Cameron will be on holiday at the same time as his deputy Nick Clegg this summer, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge . By 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an EU-US Trade and Investment Agreement. As the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of MPs left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures. And just three were left when Tory MP Bill Cash had a debate on HM Revenue and Customs. 10.02am: On the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen MPs turned up in the Commons to grill Business Secretary Vince Cable . 1.37pm: By lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches . 5pm: With most people still hard at work in the country, just three MPs could be seen in the Commons chamber before it packed up for the summer . In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year. Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any MP worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess. ‘However, the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account. ‘Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which means Bills are getting passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny. ‘This is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the Commons to properly debate new laws and hold the Government to account.’","Prime Minister spotted in the crowds at Lords for the second Ashes test .

Formula One magnate Bernie Ecclestone is facing the prospect of extradition after being indicted by a German court on bribery charges. The 82-year-old billionaire could be jailed for five years if convicted. Prosecutors allege that a £26million payment by the motorsport boss to German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky was made to ensure that a large stake of Formula One was sold below its true value in 2006 to Mr Ecclestone’s preferred bidder. Mr Ecclestone, left, had been under investigation since former German banker Gerhard Gribkowsky, right, was convicted of corruption for receiving payments from the motor racing chief executive in connection with the sale of shares in the sport in 2006 . But he denies the sum was  a bribe, . instead claiming he  was being blackmailed by the banker over untrue tax . allegations that could have cost him ‘billions’. Gribkowsky was jailed for accepting the payment and is serving an eight-and-a-half year sentence. Mr Ecclestone gave evidence during the . banker’s trial, admitting that he gave him large sums of money, but . denied doing anything illegal. Now he has been served with an . indictment by a German judge, and will either have to answer voluntarily . to the charges or be threatened with extradition. Mr Ecclestone’s team is planning to . send a response to the judge within the next few weeks. After the . defence has been weighed against the prosecution case, the judge will . decide whether to summon him for a court hearing. Court action: The tycoon's legal team will submit a response within the next few weeks and prosecutors will then decide whether Mr Ecclestone could face trial . He strenuously denies the allegation – . but questions are being raised over whether he can continue his . dominance of motor racing as Formula One’s chief executive with the . charges hanging over him. Mr Ecclestone told the Financial Times . yesterday: ‘I have just spoken to my lawyers and they have received an . indictment. It’s being translated into English. We are defending it . properly. It will be an interesting case. It’s a pity it’s happened.’ Mr Ecclestone said it was ‘inevitable’ that the indictment had been issued against him, saying: ‘If someone . wants to sue you, they can do it and you have to defend it.’ Gribkowsky is alleged to have received . the £26million during a huge sale of Formula One shares in 2006. He . worked for state-owned Bayerisches Landesbank, which was selling its 48 . per cent share in the motor racing company, and he was a major figure in . arranging the sale. At his trial in Munich in 2011, the . disgraced banker admitted corruptly receiving bank commissions and large . payments from an Ecclestone family trust. Big business: Mr Ecclestone had claimed that the £29million payment was to avoid a UK tax inquiry into the sale of Formula One in 2006 and vehemently denied that they were bribes . He claimed the cash was in return for . ensuring the shares were sold to CVC, a private equity firm, because it . would keep Mr Ecclestone as the controller of Formula One. But the motorsport boss insisted he . had been ‘pressured’ into paying because Gribkowsky had threatened to . make false allegations to the UK taxman that an Ecclestone family trust . in the tax haven of Lichtenstien was fully in Bernie’s control.

Five weeks after finishing runner-up at the US Open for the sixth time, Mickelson came from behind Sunday to win the Open, his fifth career major. The path to one of his greatest victories was longer than most, but Mickelson feels it's the greatest win of his career. Embraced by his family near the 18th hole, Mickelson celebrated the win after coming from two shots behind leader Justin Rose by shooting a week-best round of 66 at Muirfield. Fitting: Phil Mickelson is the winner of the 142nd Open Championship . Overcome: Phil Mickelson of the U.S. holds the Claret Jug as he celebrates with his wife Amy, and children Amanda, Sophia and Evan, after winning the British Open . Mickelson, 43, fended off late challenges from several golfers to clinch the title in front of his wife Amy and children, Amanda, Evan and Sophia. The world's number two golfer, Mickelson has famously battled through much adversity during his career. The British Open champ announced in 2010 that he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Though treatable, the condition can create severe pain in the feet and tendinitis in the Achilles tendon, among other issues. He has said that his case is manageable. Healthy again: Amy Mickelson famously battled breast cancer in 2009, only a month before husband Phil's mother was also diagnosed . 'What a fun day. This is some of the best golf I have ever played,' said Mickelson. Mickelson's last major came at the 2010 Masters, which he also won in 2006 and 2004. His other major was the 2005 PGA Championship. Champ at last: Phil Mickelson holds the Claret Jug and hugs his wife Amy (L) in a family shot after winning the British Open Golf Championship . In May 2009, Mickelson announced that he would take a leave of absence from professional golf after his wife Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer. His leave of absence was to be indefinite, pending the outcome of Amy's treatment. Mickelson missed two tournaments while his wife underwent surgery and treatments. Pro golfers banded together wearing pink as a show of support for Mickelson's family. When told less than two weeks later that the surgery and ensuing treatment had been successful after doctors caught the cancer at an early stage, Mickelson announced he would return to pro golf. Moment with the family: Mickelson won the 142nd Open Championship at Muirfield . Less than a month later, Mickelson's mother Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer, causing him to take another leave of absence. He returned after she began to show improvement, but not without a nod to the man who saved the lives of the two most important women in his life. Mickelson invited Tom Buchholz, the radiation oncologist who treated both women,to be his caddy during the 2010 Houston Open after learning the man was a tour caddy in 1984, and then again during an exclusive Par 3 tournament at Augusta National the day before the 2012 Masters Championship, according to CultureMap Houston. Relief: Mickelson is hugged by wife Amy and children Amanda, Evan and Sophia . 'Playing this championship was the . biggest challenge of my career and I didn't know if I had the skills to . win on links golf but I played some of the best links golf I have ever . played,' Mickelson said after the tournament. 'It is amazing to be part of any Open Championship and to win at Muirfield feels amazing... this is probably the greatest and most difficult win of my career.' Mickelson's British Open victory came only weeks after he finished second at the U.S. Open for the sixth time, a defeat he called as difficult as any he's dealt with in his career. 'I have such an incredible difference of emotions from where I was a month ago with such a heart-breaking loss at the US Open,' Mickelson said. Frustration? Woods rarely appeared inspired . Tiger Woods made a late charge towards the front of the pack Sunday, but the world's number one golfer came up short, finishing tied for sixth overall.","Has battled through his own physical ailments and breast cancer diagnoses to both his wife Amy and his mother .

A nine-month-old pit bull found in Lomita, California, has had his tender belly inked with a notorious LA gang sign. The abandoned pup was left tied to a pole outside a donut shop where Elizabeth Vivlamore took pity on the whimpering dog. She called the police who told her they would call animal control, but neither turned up. The grandmother, who is on a fixed income, took the young dog in and fed him and gave him water before a trip to the vet revealed he had fleas, worms, an ear infection and his tail had been broken in three places. She paid for him to be micro-chipped, de-wormed and vaccinated. Scarred: Petey has been marked for life with a tattoo on his stomach, but hopefully he will recover from the emotional scars inflicted by his abusive former owners . Cruel and unusual: Animal welfare workers discovered the inking after initially mistaking it for ringworm . Unable to keep the dog, dubbed Petey for his resemblance to the dog in the 'Our Gang' series from the 1920s, the pensioner contacted ROMP Rescue, and when rescue officer Randy arrived to pick up the dog, he noticed some markings on Petey's stomach that he thought was ringworm. 'I went and got an electric razor and I shaved off his belly and that's when I discovered the tattoo,' Randy told DailyBreeze.com. Big, bold letters were emblazoned across Petey's pink belly in black. 'I said, ""Oh my gosh, that looks like a gang name or something."" I looked it up online and sure enough, it was,' said Randy. The San Fernando-based ROMP Rescue saves dogs and trains them for permanent homes.

Forever home: Petey's not quite ready for a new family yet, though carers say he's great with people but terrified of other dogs . 'I can't understand why they would do that. The pain involved is obviously more than any puppy should have to endure.' Randy doubts Petey was given any anaesthetic before the large tattoo was needled into his skin. Abused: Animal care workers believe Petey was used as bait for fighting dogs . He wants to find Petey a home, but says the dog is not ready for a new family yet. The animal care worker says Petey is great with people but terrified of other dogs. He believes Petey was used as a 'bait dog' to train fighting dogs and that he would have eventually been trained to fight himself. 'A bait dog is a dog that's used to train fighting dogs, and what they do is make the dog defenseless and they'll tape its mouth shut with electrical tape and throw it into a fighting ring and let the other dogs just destroy it,' he told CBS. As a result, Petey shakes when other dogs are nearby, and he becomes frustrated, angry and nervous. 'His legs just shake,' Randy said. 'He's afraid of the world.' Petey will need about $2,100 in rehabilitation before he's ready to find a new home. A 21-day rehabilitation program in Nipomo, California will help undo the damage done in Petey's early life and fix any behavioral problems. A fund has been set up to help pay for Petey's rehab, and at the time of writing, organizers had raised $1,800 of the $2,100 goal.","A young abandoned pit bull terrier dubbed Petey has been tattooed with a notorious LA gang symbol .

Yankees star third baseman Alex Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from a Miami clinic in order to keep them from officials in Major League Baseball, it was revealed today. Rodriguez, who is likely out until the midpoint of the 2013 season, had an intermediary purchase the papers from the Biogenesis clinic in Miami. After officials in the MLB front office learned of this deal, they rushed to buy copies of the documents as well, which purport to show ties to performance-enhancing drugs. Coverup?: New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez reportedly tried to purchase documents from an anti-aging clinic that has alleged ties to performance-enhancing substances . Rodriguez's purchase was first reported by the New York Times. The New Times said it obtained records detailing purchases by Rodriguez, 2012 All-Star game MVP Melky Cabrera, 2005 AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon and 2011 AL championship series MVP Nelson Cruz. Its exposé claimed the baseball star received cocktails including Human Growth Hormones (HGH) and testosterone creams on a fairly regular basis, according to handwritten notes viewed by someone familiar with the clinic. Rodriguez's name appears in handwritten notes, reportedly kept by Bosch's clinic, that indicate he received various substances from 2009 up until 2012. 'There was his name, over and over again, logged as either 'Alex Rodriguez', 'Alex Rod', or his nickname at the clinic, 'Cacique,' a pre-Columbian Caribbean chief. Rodriguez’s name appears 16 times throughout,' according to the article. Rodriguez has denied the claims. 'I have nothing to hide': Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers is also being investigated for his links to the Florida clinic which is now closed. He has said his name appears in records because of a payment dispute . Other baseball players the newspaper said appeared in the records include Gio Gonzalez and Yasmani Grandal. Later, Yahoo Sports reported that 2011 NL MVP Ryan Braun's name also appeared in the records. Braun subsequently issued a statement . saying: 'I have nothing to hide.' He has said his name appeared because . of an issue over payment for consultancy work relating to his . successful fight to overturn a 2011 doping ban. Washington Nationals star pitcher Gio Gonzalez's name reportedly appeared in records at an anti-aging clinic with alleged ties to performance-enhancing drugs . Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig has declined to comment on Biogenesis, other than to say it is the subject of a 'very thorough investigation' by MLB. Lawsuit: Anthony Bosch faces a claim for unspecified damages after he was accused of doling out banned substances at his Miami clinic . The Times said the payments by the commissioner's office did not exceed more than 'several thousand dollars.' MLB officials decided to take the unusual step of paying for the documents because, with no subpoena power, its investigators would likely have no access to the material if it wound up in the players' hands, the paper reported. Last month, Major League Baseball sued Biogenesis, and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned performance-enhancing drugs to players in violation of their contracts. The lawsuit in Miami-Dade Circuit Court seeks unspecified damages from Biogenesis and its operator, Anthony Bosch. Several other Bosch associates are named in the lawsuit. Among the banned drugs supplied, the lawsuit said, are testosterone, human growth hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin. Baseball officials also unsuccessfully lobbied New Times editors to share the documents that formed the basis of their story.","New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez among those claimed to be involved with the now-defunct Biogenesis clinic in Miami .

Talks: Apple has reportedly held talks with a firm co-owned by hip hop producer Dr Dre (pictured) about setting up a new music streaming service . Apple has held talks with a firm co-founded by hip-hop producer Dr Dre about the creation of a new music streaming service. The technology giant is reported to have approached Beats . Electronics, best known for its distinctive headphones, over a potential . partnership involving Beats' planned music-streaming service. It would help Apple steal a march on arch-rival Google, which is also believed to be launching a YouTube branded streaming music service this year. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook met with music mogul and Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine during a visit to Los Angeles in late February to find out more about Beats' plan, called 'Project Daisy.' Apple's Internet products chief Eddy Cue, a key player in setting up its iTunes Music Store, also joined the meeting, at which Mr Cook expressed interest in Project Daisy's business model and its rollout plans - although the two did not discuss specifics of a deal, sources said. The meeting between Mr Cook and Mr Iovine, who is also chairman of music company Interscope-Geffen-A&M, is believed to have been 'informational' and covered a broad range of music-related topics. Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr and Beats declined to comment. Apple, which makes the globally successful iPhone, has been widely reported to be considering a music-streaming service to complement iTunes, the largest online repository of music for sale. Beats, which is known for its stylistic, distinctive headphones, has a partnership with Taiwanese handset maker HTC Corp, an Apple rival. In a boost for the company, Beats said on Tuesday it had secured $60 million in funding for Daisy from a group of investors including Warner Music owner Len Blavatnik, Fort Worth billionaire Lee M. Bass, and Australian financier James Packer. The funding will bankroll the music service's launch in late 2013. Beats reportedly named the project 'Daisy' in honor of what it called the first digital, computerized song. At the time, the firm said in a press release that the service would 'bring an emotional connection back to the act of music discovery,' referring to the process through which users find, buy and consume music. Meeting: Apple CEO Tim Cook is understood to have met with Beats CEO Jimmy Iovine last month . Successful: iTunes is the biggest online repository of music to buy with millions of users worldwide . Music mogul Jimmy Iovine, chairman of Beats, and also the man who discovered Eminem, is believed to have met with Apple . The music recording industry has languished through more than a decade of declining revenues. Industry sources say many of the largest companies are beginning to warm to the idea of collecting fees on music streamed over the Internet, as the use of smartphones and tablets increases around the world. The meeting between Apple and Mr Iovine was set up in January, immediately after Beats announced Daisy without explaining the upcoming project's business model or how it plans to differentiate itself from existing services such as Spotify and Pandora. Other players reportedly looking at expanding into music-streaming - whether fee-based or by paid subscription - include Google and Amazon. Negotiations for the Google service have been underway for several months and it will launch later this year, according to reports. It is expected to be branded as a YouTube service. They tech giants . biggest rival would be Spotify, the Swedish service which lists five . million paying subscribers and 20 million users of its ad-supported . service in 17 countries. Deezer, Rdio and Spotify all offer a free, ad-supported service alongside a £9.99-a-month subscription for premium users. The area is seen as the future of the music industry, and is expected to have contributed more than ten per cent of the music industry's digital revenue for the first time in 2012, while the number of paying subscribers surged by 44 per cent last year to 20 million people globally. Mr Iovine, a music producer and 'mentor' to contestants on Fox's 'American Idol' show, has a long association with Apple and was one of the first music industry executives to sign onto what was then Apple's nascent iTunes initiative, announced in 2001.

Medical engineering firm FASOTEC is using 3D printers to convert scans into cream-colored resin replicas of a fetus' dial for about $500. But it doesn't stop there, with the Tokyo-based business also recreating other scanned body parts and organs so doctors can practice before operations. Bizarre: This nine-month fetal face figure, made from resin, costs about $500 . 'As it is only once in a lifetime that you are pregnant with that child, we received requests for these kind of models from pregnant women who... do not want to forget the feelings and experience of that time,' Fasotec spokesman Tomohiro Kinoshita told AFP. The company uses a layering technique to build up the 3D form based on ultrasound scans. The scans are usually taken around eight or nine months into the pregnancy.

FASOTEC used to produce 3.6 inch (9 centimeter) models of an entire fetus encased in a transparent block the shape of the mother's uterus, but stopped doing it due to possible risks of MRI during pregnancy, according to WJBF.com. The 'Shape of an Angel' models, which cost about $1164, also came with a miniature version that could be attached to mobile phone straps. Now the company makes models of anything that has been scanned, including body parts and organs to enable doctors to practice before operations.

It is the latest and highest challenge the German adrenalin junkies have tackled to date. Scroll down for video . High life: Lutz Eichholz and his friend Stephanie Dietze have just completed their biggest challenge yet . Four-time world champion Eichholz has been pedaling across cliffs and deserts all over the world for 16 years, but that made his and Dietze's latest venture down the Cima Ombretta Orientale mountain no less daunting.

Reinforcements: Staff from bungling firm G4S are believed to have been hired to help detectives investigating the Jimmy Savile (pictured) sex scandal . The BBC is setting aside a staggering £10 million to cover the cost of the three inquiries set up following the Jimmy Savile scandal. Lawyers’ fees will account for most of the final bill but details released under the Freedom of Information Act show that a public relations firm, a corporate investigations company and a transcribing service, which charges almost £1,000 a day, are also involved. The Pollard Review, chaired by ex-Sky News chief Nick Pollard, examined why Newsnight’s Savile investigation in 2011 was axed. It reported last December, when acting director-general Tim Davie claimed it would cost £2 million. The two other inquiries are looking at the Corporation’s culture and practices during Savile’s career, and past sexual harassment claims. The BBC said: ‘It has already been stated that the overall cost of the Pollard inquiry is likely to be approximately £2 million. ‘We will be publishing details of the costs once figures are finalised.’ Nineteen witnesses, including ex-BBC director-general George Entwistle, were allowed up to £50,000 of legal advice for the Pollard Review.

Daniel Kaluuya plays Joseph Mobutu, the one-time acolyte of Lumumba who became his colonel – and his nemesis. We see little subtlety here, none of the coldness or charisma the real Mobutu must have had. The political power games throughout this play are feebly under-explored.

And what with all those sea urchins, lion fish and moray eels lurking in the rocks, its probably not a good idea to go poking around too diligently. But Eirian Evans, along with new bride Bethan, begged their instructors to help them search the reef after his ring slipped off his finger during a honeymoon diving expedition. British honeymooner Eirian Evans lost his wedding ring while snorkelling in the Great Barrier Reef with wife Bethan.

Arrested: Dominick Anderson, 26, allegedly flew into a violent rage at Beverly Holmes' New York apartment, after he found a doll and pictures of himself in her closet while doing the Christmas cleaning . A 'deranged' grandson beat his grandmother to death with a fake elephant tusk today because he believed she had entranced him with a voodoo spell, it has been claimed. Dominick Anderson, 26, allegedly flew . into a violent rage at Beverly Holmes' New York . apartment, after he found a doll and pictures of himself in her closet while doing the Christmas cleaning. Anderson's mother, Mary Anderson, told reporters her son had 'psychiatric problems' and the discovery made him think Mrs Holmes was performing black magic on him behind his back. 'That’s where she goes and does her chanting every morning,' she told The New York Post. 'Dominick took that doll and threw it away. He said, ""I can’t believe my own family is trying to do this to me.""' Officers were called to the home, in Hamilton Heights, Harlem, after reports of a domestic disturbance to find Anderson brawling with the 62-year-old pensioner and his sister, according to reports. But when they tried to break the pair up, Anderson turned on the officers wielding an ornamental plastic tusk, it is claimed. He . reportedly brought the trinket down on the head of officer Michiell Matos . before swinging it at five others as they tried to intervene. It took all five officers and a blast of pepper spray to subdue Anderson, before he was taken away in restraints. The . injured officer was rushed to Harlem Hospital with a serious head wound . while his five colleagues were treated for minor cuts and bruises. Mrs Holmes was rushed to hospital with stab wound to the head, the New York Fire Department said, but medics were unable to save her. Mrs Anderson told the New York Daily News that, . in his fury, her son had ripped the tusk from a statue that sat on the . mantlepiece in the living room between the radiator and a picture of . Elijah Muhammad, the late leader of the Nation of Islam. She said it was . a replica Mrs Holmes had bought at Bloomingdale's. Scene: The incident occurred inside a building on St. Nicholas Avenue and West 145th Street at 8.10am on Wednesday, police said . The newspaper reported that a . television was also smashed, curtains ripped down and a table was broken . in the brawl. The blood-stained tusk was also found lying on the living . room floor. The incident occurred inside a building on St. Nicholas Avenue and West 145th Street at 8.10am today, police said. Anderson's distraught mother told The Post that her son suffered from psychiatric problems, adding: 'He thinks my mother is doing the voodoo on him,' she told reporters. 'It's a family tragedy. He's a good boy.' Weapon: Dominick Anderson, 26, allegedly hit the officer on the head with a plastic ornamental elephant's tusk, similar to these (stock image) Describing him as a 'father figure' in the family, Mrs Anderson said her son had a five-year-old daughter and made a living doing odd jobs around the local community. She said while her family was Muslim, Mrs Holmes had dabbled with Buddhism. Officers said the suspect was in a 'stable condition' at Harlem Hospital where he will undergo a psychiatric evaluation. His sister, Simone, 17, was also injured in the attack, suffering a gash to the head. She is understood to be recovering in hospital. He has been charged with attempted murder and resisting arrest, although police sources told the Post charges could be upgraded following autopsy results.

A retired vet woke to find a police torch being shone into his face when officers raided his home after the RSPCA received a tip-off that his two pet dogs were being maltreated. A total of 13 officials – police, firemen and RSPCA officers – turned up unannounced in six vehicles at 70-year-old John Spicer’s home and broke down the door to get in while he was asleep. His sheepdogs Puppy and Little Boy were taken away and Puppy was destroyed immediately. Mr Spicer was arrested on suspicion of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. He had his fingerprints, DNA and mugshot taken and was held in a police cell for 24 hours before being released. Yesterday he criticised the RSPCA for being heavy-handed and said he has still not been told what has happened to Little Boy. ‘The whole episode was a total over-reaction,’ Mr Spicer said. ‘I was asleep inside and the first thing I knew was a torch being shone six inches from my face by a police officer. ‘I was put barefoot in the back of a police van and told I was being arrested. I was in a cell at a police station for 24 hours. ‘This was the first time ever I’ve been taken to a police station in my life, I have been left shaken by it. It was completely over the top.’ Mr Spicer, who lives in the village of Gobowen near Oswestry, Shropshire, was released after being questioned by officers from the animal welfare charity. Yesterday an RSPCA spokesman refused to say whether Mr Spicer would face prosecution as the investigation is ongoing. His ordeal began at around 5pm on July 8 when two RSPCA officers in separate vans, two constables, a sergeant and two PCSOs from West Mercia Police in two cars and a van, plus a fire engine with six firemen on board, turned up at his whitewashed terraced home. After using a fire engine ladder to peer inside an upstairs window, they broke down the door and let themselves in. Taken away: The RSPCA and police take Puppy the sheepdog from Mr Spicer's home before putting the dog down . Led away: Mr Spicer has yet to find out the fate of Puppy's brother Little Boy . They took away 12-year-old Puppy, which had been suffering ill health due to a spinal injury and had partly lost the use of its legs, as well as ten-year-old Little Boy, Puppy’s brother, claiming they were not being looked after properly. But Mr Spicer, who was a vet for 30 years, said he had been treating Puppy’s illness, which he described as ‘complicated,’ himself and the dog had been improving. He said: ‘The police decided there was no case to prosecute. I’ve heard nothing since from the RSPCA.’ Mr Spicer, a bachelor, added that he doesn’t know how he will live without his dogs. ‘I’ve not lived in my house without a dog for 30 years,’ he said. ‘At some stage it is going to hit me that the house is empty.’ Neighbour Mark Breeze, 47, said: ‘I’ve never seen John mistreat an animal in my life, he always looks after his dogs very well. He’s very cut up about it.’ A spokesman for the RSPCA said they had attempted to contact Mr Spicer on numerous occasions after receiving several calls about the welfare of his dogs. It is understood he was reported to the charity several times by a concerned local. Heavy handed: A total of 13 officials turned up at 70-year-old John Spicer¿s home in Gobowen near Oswestry, Shropshire, and broke down the door to get in while he was asleep . ‘We will always attempt to work with owners to safeguard the welfare of their animals,’ the spokesman said. ‘The dog was put to sleep by an independent vet – on their advice as nothing more could be done to help it. ‘A second dog still belongs to the man, it has not been taken permanently, but it will remain in RSPCA care while the investigation continues. ‘The conditions the dog had been living in were not suitable and it is now being treated for a skin condition.’ Anne Kasica, who runs the Self-Help Group, an organisation for animal owners ‘experiencing difficulties with the RSPCA’, said: ‘It’s appalling that an elderly man can be treated this way, but unfortunately we’ve seen it all before. ‘All the RSPCA seem to care about is prosecutions because they bring in donations through publicity.’ Tory councillor David Lloyd, who represents Gobowen, said: ‘Many villagers were angry at the heavy-handed way in which the reclusive Mr Spicer appears to have been treated.’ Tory MP Simon Hart, a former head of the Countryside Alliance, claims the RSPCA is pursuing an ‘aggressive political agenda’ against pet owners which is ‘at odds with animal welfare’.","A dozen officers broke down the door to John Spicer's home .

A Nasa spacecraft has caught a glimpse of something we've long suspected was there, but could never see - the tail of our solar system. Scientists have long predicted that our solar system has a tail much like a comet, as it moves through space causing a stream of particles to trail behind it. But now their theory has been proved correct after Nasa's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) spacecraft has mapped the first view of the tail, which follows the heliosphere, or our solar 'bubble'. Scroll down for video... This diagram shows the sun - the white dot in the center of the circle which represents the inner heliosphere encompassing the entire solar system. A tail of particles flows to the right of the heliosphere. The elongated shape in light blue is the outer heliosphere, the region where the sun still has a small amount of influence . Our solar system can be likened to a meteor traveling through Earth’s atmosphere, which causes the particles to form a stream trailing off behind it. IBEX has mapped the boundaries of the tail of the heliosphere, something that has never before been possible. Scientists described this tail, called the heliotail, in The Astrophysical Journal. By combining observations from the first three years of IBEX imagery, the team mapped out a tail that shows a combination of fast and slow moving particles. Nasa said that there are two 'lobes' of slower particles on the sides, faster particles above and below, with the entire structure twisted, as it experiences the pushing and pulling of magnetic fields outside the solar system. 'By examining the neutral atoms, IBEX made the first observations of the heliotail,' said David McComas, lead author on the paper and principal investigator for IBEX at Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas. 'Many models have suggested the heliotail might be like this or like that, but we’ve had no observations. 'We always drew pictures where the tail of the heliosphere just disappears off the page, since we couldn’t even speculate about what it really looked like.' Telescopes have previously spotted similar tails around other stars but it has been difficult to see whether our star also has one. Scientists came close to viewing it before when Pioneer 10 crossed the orbit of Neptune in 1983, but annoyingly it lost power 20 years later before it moved into the tail. IBEX however, maps regions by measuring neutral particles created by collisions at the heliosphere’s boundaries. Eric Christian, IBEX mission scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said: 'Using neutral atoms, IBEX can observe far away structures, even from Earth orbit.' Other stars show tails that trail behind them like a comet¿s tail. Scientists used NASA¿s Interstellar Boundary Explorer to confirm that our solar system has one too. From top left and going counter clockwise, the stars shown are: LLOrionis, BZ Cam and Mira . 'IBEX scans the entire sky, so it has given us our first data about what the tail of the heliosphere looks like, an important part of understanding our place in and movement through the galaxy.' Scientists are using the map to try and understand more about the charged particles that form the heliotail and the solar wind that blows out from the sun. 'The tail is our footprint on the galaxy, and it’s exciting that we’re starting to understand the structure of it, said Professor Christian. 'The next step is to incorporate these observations into our models and start the process of really understanding our heliopshere.' Scientists can test their computer simulations of the heliosphere against the new observations and improve their models. Together, data from instruments in space and analysis at labs on the ground will continue to improve our understanding of the comet-like tail streaming out behind us. This data from NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer shows what it observed looking down the solar system's tail. The yellow and red colours represent areas of slow-moving particles, and the blue represents the fast-moving particles .","Nasa's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) has caught a glimpse of the tail of our solar system as it travels through space .

The world’s most ambitious initiative to return captive-born animals to the wild began last week when six Javan langurs and a gibbon were transported to Indonesia from Kent. It is the first time these primates have been reintroduced into their natural forest habitat in Java to boost the ‘vulnerable’ indigenous population. The ‘repatriation’ is part of Damian Aspinall’s campaign, Back To The Wild 2013. As head of the charitable Aspinall Foundation, the conservationist wants to end the suffering of wild animals kept in zoos and bolster the population of endangered species. Scroll down for video . Six captive-born Javan langurs and a gibbon have been transported from Kent to Indonesia . This year he will reintroduce record . numbers of animals – including 11 Western Lowland gorillas into Congo . and Gabon, two bull elephants and more primates to the wild. The langurs, right, were born at his . Kent wildlife parks Howletts and Port Lympne, while the gibbon was born . in Australia before becoming part of the Aspinall breeding programme. ‘We launched the initiative because I believe we have an obligation to our animals,’ said Aspinall, 52. ‘I don’t believe exhibiting wild . animals for entertainment is right. I think the world has moved on. My . aim is to change the consciousness of the public.’ His foundation has an impressive . record. There have been births of 139 gorillas, 33 black rhinos, 20 . African elephants and 28 Javan gibbons at the parks. Aspinall says his wish is that one day his two animal parks no longer exist ‘because there was no need for them any more.’ The son of the legendary gambler, John Aspinall, Damian, 52, grew up at Howletts, a Palladian mansion in Kent which was filled with his father’s pets which included a leopard and a Himalayan bear. Howletts eventually became a wildlife park which Damian took control of after his father’s death, in 2000, and turned into a leading conservation charity. Like his father before him, he has a genuine love of wild animals. As we talk, a five month old tiger cub, Kasimir, pads around the study.  Unlike his father, however, Damian will do everything in his power to make sure his charge eventually lives life in the wild not a cage. He said: ‘We have written to the Russian ambassador as we’re hoping we might be able to introduce our tigers there. We have one person whose job it is solely to look for ways and places to reintroduce animals into the wild. ‘We launched the initiative because I believe we have an obligation to our animals. I don’t believe that exhibiting wild animals for human entertainment is right. I think the world has moved on. My aim is to change the consciousness of the public. We’ve grown up in a culture where it’s normal to take our children to the zoo. We’ve been brought up to believe that it’s perfectly OK to go and see these animals in captivity for the pleasure of man.' Conservationist: Damian Aspinall has previously released gorillas back into the wild and more will travel back to Congo and Gabon this year . ‘Why do we feel we can sentence these animals to life imprisonment? And with no pardon.  For that’s what we’re doing and what right do we have to do that?  For me, I can’t accept that. Not if we want to be proud of ourselves as a species. Under UK law it’s legal to capture a wild elephant and bring into England. How is that acceptable? People need to demand change, write to their local institutions, their local MPs.  I’m not naive, it will take time - maybe 20 years - but I hope in time there will be real change.’ His foundation has an impressive conservation record - there have been 139 gorilla births, 33 black rhinos (currently an endangered species) 20 African elephants, 28 Javan Gibbons and 24 Javan langurs.  Their work could save these species from extinction. Reintroducing the animals to the wild is a long and involved process.  Last week’s ‘repatriation’ has been eight years in the planning - from the initial finding of the land for their reserves in East and West Java to working with the local government to preparing the animals for their journey and, ultimately, the wild. Journey: Rhinos are lifted off a specially enlisted DHL Boeing 757 at Kilimanjaro International Airport during their 'repatriation' trip last year . The primates’ journey began last Thursday when they were flown from Heathrow to Singapore and then onto Jakarta. They then travelled for five hours on a truck and were then carried for half an hour on bamboo poles, down the mountain to the Aspinall Foundation centre in Bandung.  They will then have to be acclimatised before being released later in the year. Damian said: ‘We have to spend some months conditioning the animals although life is so different there’s only so much you can do. They’ll be introudced to local fruits and local leaves and we’ll also mix them with wild caught primates who will hopefully teach them the ways of the forest.  In Indonesia gibbons and langurs are status symbols and are often kept in small cages in people’s gardens.  We’ve been working with the Government to rescue them and then, like our primates, we hope to release them back to the wild.’ Two further langurs, which have been held back as they had worms - all animals must be given a clean bill of health before they are reintroduced to the will.  They will follow shortly, then it will be the turn of the gorillas, the elephants... and so many more. It is a challenge but one which Damian will never give up on while so many species are perilously close to extinction and there are still wild animals in captivity.  His greatest wish is that his two greatest achievements - Howletts and Port Lymne - no longer exist. He said: ‘Yes, because if there was no need for them anymore I would die a happy man.’","Six Javan langurs and a gibbon transported to their natural habitat .

The public largely backs the Coalition's strategy to reduce the deficit and cut spending – until the policy is attributed to the Chancellor himself, the survey suggests. When researchers from Ipsos MORI asked voters if they agreed that deficit reduction should be the priority – the  Coalition's strategy – 52 per cent agreed. Days before next week's Budget, a new poll reveals voters are more supportive of the government's economic plan until they find out George Osborne is the architect . Just 41 per cent backed kickstarting 'growth' through increased spending and temporary tax cuts, a plan favoured by Labour. However when voters were told Mr . Osborne was the author of the policy to tackle the deficit, support for . the strategy plunged to 37 per cent. Even among Conservative supporters, . backing for the flagship deficit reduction policy dropped by five points . when told it was Mr Osborne's idea. And when informed that Labour's Ed . Balls, shadow chancellor, was behind a separate argument for more . spending, 53 per cent swung in behind the strategy, a lead of 16 points. Pollsters questioned 1,009  voters between March 9 and 11. Mr Osborne has emerged as the least popular Chancellor since the 1990s. The Ipsos/Mori survey showed how voters had different reactions to the two economic policies when they were told that Mr Osborne and Labour's Ed Balls were responsible . Overall, Labour's poll lead has grown . to 13 points since last year's 'omnishambles' Budget where Mr Osborne . had to ditch ill-conceived policies such as taxes on caravans and . pasties. Labour has the support of 40 per cent and the Tories 27 per . cent, their lowest since January 2003. Conservatives are privately warning . that next Wednesday's Budget could be Mr Osborne's last as Chancellor if . he delivers a repeat of last year's disaster. Yesterday Grant Shapps, the Tory party . chairman, tried to reprise the spirit of the Thatcher government, . saying he wanted the Tories to be the party of enterprise and . aspiration: 'I believe that at our best we are always on the side of . people that work hard and get on in life.' Only one in four (26 per cent) think Ed Balls and Ed Miliband would do a better job at managing the economy . Mr Osborne is also coming under . pressure from Tory MPs to cut taxes – and a further extension of the . fuel duty freeze is expected – while the Liberal Democrats are calling . for more spending to stimulate growth. Mr Balls' apparent popularity has . surprised Conservatives, who just this week were told by their campaigns . guru Lynton Crosby to try to exploit the tensions between him and . leader Ed Miliband. The poll yesterday found that most voters still blame Labour for the state of the economy. David Cameron has repeatedly targeted Labour's Ed Balls in the belief that he is unpopular with voters because of his role under Gordon Brown . Britain's political elite is a bunch of 'interested amateurs' with little or no business experience who have 'generally never run anything', the British Chambers of Commerce boss said yesterday. In a stinging attack, John Longworth, director general of the respected business lobby group, slammed the lack of corporate experience within the Cabinet. Mr Longworth, a former Asda executive and entrepreneur, said: 'We have a political class in the tradition of the interested amateur. In many cases having little or no experience of business, and who have generally never run anything. 'That ensures they are at the mercy of the mandarins of the civil service – just like the Chinese emperors whose actions were constrained as they tried to rule.' Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, has two decades of business experience and Vince Cable used to be the chief economist at Shell. But the Prime Minister worked in public relations and Chancellor George Osborne is a career politician. A Department for Business spokesman said: 'Ministers across Government speak to businesses every day of the week to understand how we can help them grow and succeed. 'There is extensive business experience in the Cabinet, specifically amongst ministers in the Treasury and Business Department.' And just one in four believe Labour . would do a better job. Pollsters said Mr Osborne's lack of popularity . may not be personal, but down to the public blaming whoever is in power. Bob Duffy, of Ipsos MORI, said: 'It is . also true that George Osborne has the lowest rating of any Chancellor . since Ken Clarke back in the mid-1990s. But then he probably doesn't . expect to be popular right now with the economy in the state it is, and . the cuts continuing.' The economy is the number one issue for voters, ahead of immigration and Europe. Most are pessimistic, with only 18 per . cent believing the economy will improve in the next year, while 48 per . cent think it will get worse.","More than half of people support coalition's priority to cut the deficit, falling to 37% when told it is the Chancellor's policy .

High pay: Site manager Mr Wootton was paid in excess of £50,000 by Ravenscroft School in Essex . A primary school is paying its caretaker £50,000 a year – double the wage of a newly qualified teacher. The caretaker, named only as Mr Wootton, receives a basic salary of £38,000. But the school has topped that up with an extra £14,500 for overtime and groundsmen duties which he carries out. By contrast qualified primary school teachers in the same area can expect to start on just £25,117. Despite education budget cuts, Mr Wootton has been enjoying the same generous basic salary for the past five years in his role as 'site manager', it was revealed yesterday. His pay is £13,000 more than the amount set aside for special educational needs at the school, Ravenscroft in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, according to its budget for 2010-11. Clacton MP Douglas Carswell yesterday strongly criticised the huge pay package and called on the school's management to 'get a grip'. Tory Mr Carswell, who has been governor at a neighbouring school, said it was unheard of for a caretaker to be paid so much and said it showed a 'weakness' of leadership. 'I think the senior management team need to get a grip,' he said. 'This money should be spent on special needs and maths teachers. 'Most mums and dads will ask how can it possibly be right that a large sum of money is going on a caretaker rather than on raising standards or literacy. 'There has been a weakness in senior management at the school for several years. This school is screaming out to be made into an academy.' Mr Wootton joined the school  31 years ago after leaving the Royal Navy. High pay: Local MP Douglas Carswell says senior management at the school must 'get a grip' It is the responsibility of the . school governors to hire caretakers and decide their pay. A spokesman . for the school defended the payments, claiming it was cheaper to top up . the caretaker's salary for his extra duties and information and . communications technology work than it would be to bring in an outside . contractor. He said: 'The site manager has been in post at the school since 1982. Since 2007 he has not received any pay increases. 'In addition to his basic pay, the . site manager also receives overtime pay which incorporates delivery of . the grounds contract and ICT support. 'It is better value for money for the . site manager to provide this service rather than using an external . provider or employing more staff.' Essex County Council said the salary . had been set by the governors but an outside body had now been appointed . to run the school's finances. 'The governing body of Ravenscroft . School has recently been replaced by an interim executive board as part . of a programme of improvement developed by the county council,' he said. 'Part of the remit of the IEB is to . review current staffing costs established by the previous governors and a . meeting has been planned this month to discuss this.'A primary school caretaker is being paid £50,000 a year - which is nearly double many teachers' salaries.","Mr Wooton receives £38,000 basic salary topped up with £14,500 extra pay .

Grief-stricken friends have paid tribute to the 'beautiful and bubbly' British air stewardess who fell to her death from a Dubai skyscraper.

Friends paying tribute to Miss Clarke on a memorial page set up on Facebook described a 'beautiful person' whose 'big hair, big personality and big smile' made her the life of the party. Police are interviewing the last people to see her alive. Kay Anderson posted on Facebook: ‘Oh Evelyn, I can’t believe you’re gone. ‘Loved the way you laughed in the face of anything bad that was thrown at you. You had life’s priorities in the right order, family and friends but most of all love.’ Another, Katrina Raine, said: ‘Life can be so cruel sometimes, such a loss of a beautiful person.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Reuters Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:48 EST, 16 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:15 EST, 16 April 2013 . The highest U.S. officials during the Bush presidency bore ultimate responsibility for the 'indisputable' use of torture, according to the report from an independent task force, and it urged President Barack Obama to close the Guantanamo detention camp by the end of 2014. In one of the most comprehensive studies of U.S. treatment of terrorism suspects, the panel concluded that never before had there been 'the kind of considered and detailed discussions that occurred after 9/11 directly involving a president and his top advisers on the wisdom, propriety and legality of inflicting pain and torment on some detainees in our custody.' 'It is indisputable that the United States engaged in the practice of torture,' the 11-member task force said in their 577-page report. Shut it down: A new report claims that Guantanamo Bay prison, seen here in 2002 not long after it opened, may be closed after NATO pulls out from Afghanistan in 2014 . The scathing critique of methods used under the Republican administration of former President George W. Bush also sharpened the focus on the plight of inmates at Guantanamo, which Bush opened and his Democratic successor has failed to close. Obama banned abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding when he took office in early 2009, but the widely condemned military prison at the U.S. Naval Base in Cuba has remained an object of condemnation by human rights advocates. The panel was assembled by the nonpartisan Constitution Project think tank and their findings come as 45 inmates are carrying out a hunger strike in protest of their treatment. A clash between guards and prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay camp last weekend and the release of harrowing accounts by inmates about force-feeding of hunger strikers threw a harsh spotlight on the predicament of the inmates, many held without charge or trial for more than decade. The task force called the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo 'abhorrent and intolerable' and called for it to be closed by the end of 2014 when NATO's combat mission in Afghanistan is due to end and most U.S. troops will leave. By then, the 166 Guantanamo prisoners should be tried in civilian or military courts, repatriated or transferred to countries that would not torture them, or moved to U.S. jails, the task force's majority recommended. Past and present: The report focused on the rules put into place during President Bush's terms, but also called on President Obama for failing to changed much of the egregious protocols . But the 2014 goal will be hard to achieve because of legal, legislative and political obstacles Obama faces. While the White House says he remains committed to shutting Guantanamo, he has offered no new path to doing so in his second term. The panel, which included leading politicians from both parties, two U.S. retired generals and legal and ethics scholars, spent two years examining the U.S. treatment of suspected militants detained after the September 11, 2001, attacks. Members of the task force described themselves as the closest thing to a 'truth commission' since Obama decided early in his presidency against convening a national commission to investigate post-9/11 practices. Panel members interviewed former Clinton, Bush and Obama administration officials, military officers and former prisoners, and the investigation looked at U.S. practices at Guantanamo, in Afghanistan and Iraq and at the CIA's former secret prisons overseas. Tense: The guards, seen here in 2007, recently fired on some of the prisoners during an altercation . The task force was chaired by Asa Hutchinson, a Republican former congressman and undersecretary of the Department of Homeland Security during the George W. Bush administration, and James Jones, a Democratic former congressman who served as U.S. ambassador to Mexico. In a finding the panel said was its most notable and was reached 'without reservation,' the report said, 'Torture occurred in many instances and across a wide range of theaters.' Renewed calls: Protests were held in Times Square last week calling for a closure of the prison . But the panel concluded there was 'no firm or persuasive evidence' that the use of such techniques yielded 'significant information of value.' 'The nation's highest officials bear some responsibility for allowing and contributing to the spread of torture,' the report said, though it did not name names. The task force, while concluding that U.S. and international laws were violated, did not recommend legal action against any of those involved but it did press for tighter rules to prevent a recurrence of torture. 'We as a nation have to get this right,' Hutchinson told a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. The panel urged the U.S. government to release as much classified information as possible to help understand what went wrong and cope better with the next crisis. 'Publicly acknowledging this grave error, however belatedly, may mitigate some of those consequences and help undo some of the damage to our reputation at home and abroad,' the report said. The sweeping report cataloged abusive interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, sleep deprivation and chaining prisoners in painful positions. The task force also concluded that force-feeding hunger striking detainees is a form of abuse and should end. 'But at the same time the United States has a legitimate interest in preventing detainees from starving to death,' the panel said.","Bi-partisan report investigated American politicians involvement in the use of torture after the September 11th terrorist attacks .

A man who confessed to . bludgeoning a nine-year-old girl to death then dismembering her body three . days before Christmas pleaded guilty today after prosecutors said they . would ask for the death penalty. Michael Plumadore, 39, from Indiana, also pleaded guilty to . abuse of a corpse and removing a dead body from the scene in Aliahna . Maroney-Lemmon's December 22 death at a Fort Wayne trailer park. He'll be . sentenced June 18 to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Death: Michael Plumadore, left, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, told police he 'killed Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon', right, who weighed just 41lbs, in the early hours of December 22 before dismembering her . Plumadore's attorneys and prosecutors . had told the judge last week they were ready for his trial to start that . day. But defense attorney Anthony Churchward said today that they . agreed to the guilty pleas after prosecutors indicated they would pursue . the death penalty if Plumadore was convicted by trial. Plumadore was looking after Aliahna and . her six-year-old sister because their mother was sick. He was a trusted . family friend who had looked after Aliahna's dying grandfather at the . trailer park where the family lived. The grandfather - who died three weeks before the girl's death - was a convicted sex offender. The family moved to the trailer park - where 15 sex offenders lived - to take care of him in his final days. Plumadore told police he repeatedly hit Aliahna in the head with a brick, chopped up her . body with a hack saw, stashed her head, hands and feet in the trailer . where he lived and dumped the rest of her remains nearby. She weighed only 41 pounds when she died. The other . girls weren't harmed. Horrifying: Michael Plumadore poses next to the chair he where says little Aliahna Lemmon was last sleeping. Authorities say he had already killed her and her body parts were in his freezer at the time of this photo . Plumadore has previously been convicted of trespassing, assault and forgery in three different states and there had been a warrant out for his arrest 11 years before the murder. He was charged with battery of a first-responder in 2000 and was given felony probation. But he failed to report to his probation officer, fulfill his community service hours or complete an anger management course. Plumadore was reported an absconder in June 2000. Greg Shumaker, one of 15 convicted sex offenders who lives at the park, recalled Aliahna's family moving to the trailer park to help take care of 66-year-old James E 'Shorty' Lemmon. Frightening: According to a state website, 15 registered sex offenders live at the mobile home park that numbers about two dozen homes . Sadness: Tarah Souders, mother of Aliahna, is pushed in a wheelchair by step-grandfather David Story and reacts in front of a memorial outside of a mobile home after her daughter's death . Convicted: James Lemmon, Aliahna's grandfather, was convicted of child molesting . Mr Shumaker said he introduced Plumadore . to Mr Lemmon shortly after Plumadore moved into the trailer park, and . Plumadore moved in with Mr Lemmon a few days later. Mr Shumaker said he knew Mr Lemmon because they were both sex offenders and were in jail together. Plumadore is not a registered sex offender in Indiana. But Mr Lemmon had assured Ms Souders that there was nothing to worry about, Mr Shumaker said. Paulette Hair, 45, a former manager at the trailer park who lives at a nearby trailer park, said she also knew Mr Lemmon was a sex offender. 'He stayed out of everybody's way,' she said. Mr Shumaker said Plumadore briefly moved away, but returned when Ms Souders, 28, asked him to care for her father. Aliahna's . father, Dawayne Maroney of Centerville, Iowa, said he knew Plumadore . through Ms Souders and had no reason to distrust him. 'I . can't talk about it because I'm still coping with it. It's too hard to . talk about,' he said. 'I had no reason to suspect anything.'","Michael Plumadore, of Fort Wayne, Indiana, bludgeoned Aliahna Maroney-Lemmon to death .

Jason, who graduated from Columbia and the University of Florida law school, stands accused of murdering Thomas, an analyst for Weight Watchers, on June 24. Neighbours called police to check on her after hearing a fight, and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice. 'Shakespeare couldn't have written a sadder, romantic, . tragedy...I suspected she was a cheater.

'Thank you for being my friends! Very heartfelt sorry to all . of the people I hurt over the years, especially her and her family/friends. God . Bless! Please pray for me.' Police records show that Bohn has a . history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her . death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'. When . officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the . couple’s Astoria, Queens apartment, believed to have been written by . Bohn.

When I woke up again she was unconscious…I am sorry.' The second note, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown, read: ‘Dani, I will love you forever.’ In the Facebook post, he maintains he loves and misses her, and described his bleak existence. 'I . alternate between crying uncontrollably in my cell while I stare at her office . building from my window to fighting with other inmates over food,' he wrote. In a further show of self pity, Bohn added he had struggled with abuse and abandonment. He and his brother lived in a Florida trailer park with . their father, who put beer in their bottles when they were babies, and . turned Jason to cocaine, Chris Bohn, 30, told the Post. The . victim's grandmother, Juanita Hardgrove, said added she is not . surprised by Bohn's attempts to blame her only granddaughter for the . murder. 'It’s to be expected,' she said. 'Jason murdered my granddaughter. What else is there to say?' Ms Thomas was a senior analyst at Weight Watchers and had recently moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend. Neighbours recalled hearing her screams for help the evening she was killed. 'She’s screaming; she’s calling for help: ""He’s kill me. Somebody help me,""' recalled the building's superintendent to CBS. Loss: In the post, Bohn blamed Thomas' lying, stress, alcohol and his own abusive past on the murder . Other tenants said they heard the . tumultuous and violent couple's brawls since they moved in. Thomas had even filed for an order of protection against Bohn, . alleging that he assaulted her in May. In a criminal complaint obtained by . the MailOnline, a police officer described numerous bruises on her face . and back and threatening emails she suffered. She reported the . assault on June 7 and Bohn called her while she . was speaking with officers. 'It's war, I'll dedicate my life to . hunting you down like a dog in the streets, I am going to make your life . impossible,' he said, according to the report. She went into hiding after getting . her order of protection, staying at a battered women's shelter named . Safe Horizon for two weeks. It is unclear why she returned to the . apartment, but she was found bludgeoned after a friend called . investigators asking for them to check on her. Missed: Thomas' family, left, said they were not surprised by his self-pitying tone. Bohn, right, had been violent in the past and she had a protection order against him - before she moved back in with him . An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma, NY1 reported.

Thrill-seekers looking for a new way to get their adrenaline pumping may want to head to the Colorado, U.S., where a new ride has trumped all other river swings. Dangling over a crevice that disappears 1,300 feet below, this new ride then swings at 50-miles-an-hour over the Colorado River, in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. But whether or not customers will get a chance to enjoy the view is unlikely. Scroll down for video . Only for the brave: This terrifying ride perched atop a 1,300ft cliff perhaps trumps all other river swings in the world . Flying: The pneumatically-pumped swing flings thrill-seekers at 50mph dangling high over the Colorado River . The Giant Canyon swing, positioned high over the Colorado River, at Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park, Colorado, was the brainchild of park owner Steve Beckley. Mr Beckley, 41, admits that despite designing the new ride, he has only ever tried it out for himself on one occasion. 'Funnily enough, even though I came up with the whole idea for the ride, I have only ever ridden it once,' he said. 'We had a different swing on the site for several years, but we wanted something more extreme. 'When it came time to replace it, the Giant Canyon Swing seemed like the perfect fit. A tiny scaffold blip atop the 1,300ft cliff, puts the scale of the drop beneath the ride into perspective . Head for heights: Propelled at 50mph while dangling high above the Colorado River, this ride is sure to get the adrenaline going, for those brave enough to try it . 'It's pneumatically powered and much faster, so it's definitely a bigger adrenaline rush. 'And the spot on the edge of Glenwood Canyon makes it even more exciting.' Steve explained why despite the apparent danger, thrill-seekers still flock to this one-of-a-kind contraption. 'The reaction from the public is definitely mixed,' he said. 'People usually scream when they're riding it, so first-timers hear that as they're walking up to the ride. 'Then when they see the drop off down into the canyon, they're either thrilled or terrified, and sometimes both.

"Jimmy Carter and Sting amongst those who signed the petition . By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 11:23 EST, 19 November 2011 . David Cameron is being advised to legalise drug use in Britain by an elite group former U.S. presidents, Nobel Prize winners and six British MP's. In a letter that have been sent to the Prime Minister, Cameron has been encouraged to reverse current UK law that treats drug use as criminal one rather than a medical issue. The document that was directed at Cameron and the entire Parliament house, was signed by former US commander and chief Jimmy Carter, musician Sting and Yoko Ono amongst others. Under pressure: Cameron is being told to consider changing UK drug laws to prevent 'thousands of deaths' as a result of illicit drug use . The Countess of Wemyss, who is leading the calls for change admitted that whilst Cameron had more pressing concerns, that the debate on drugs was not to be ignored. She told The Daily Telegraph: 'I think the Prime Minister has probably got the economy on his mind and not reforming drugs policy. 'But one must have a wake-up call that we must begin a global debate on how we minimise the harm from drugs.' In the letter, the group call for Cameron to begin Parliamentary discussions over the use of drugs which is estimated to be worth £285billion each year. Other signatories of the letter include Sir Richard Branson, Professor Nial Ferguson, philosopher AC Grayling which was organised by the Beckley Foundation, which has been promoting its drug reform policy. Advocates: Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Sting are amongst those supporting the proposed changes . Former drugs adviser to the government, Professor David Nutt, who was forced to resign in 2009 has also lent his name to the proposal. Nutt was forced to leave his post after claiming the severity of drinking alcohol was worse than taking Ecstasy. Moves to downgrade drugs such as Ecstasy or cannabis have yet to be determined although the letter argues that as a result of the 'tens of thousands of people that die in the drug war each year,' legalising the sale and use could prevent such killings from taking place.",Jimmy Carter and Sting amongst those who signed the petition .

Hundreds of youths clashed with Egyptian police in Tahrir Square this morning in a violent start to the second anniversary of the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak and led to the election of an Islamist president who is now the focus of rage. Opponents of President Mohamed Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood allies are expected to mass in Tahrir Square later on Friday to revive the demands of a revolution that they say has been betrayed by the Islamists. The square was calm by daybreak, following early morning battles between police and protesters who threw petrol bombs and firecrackers as they tried to approach a wall blocking access to government buildings near the square. Plumes of teargas fired by the police filled the air. Clashes: A protester gestures defiantly as riot police fire tear gas . into crowds gathering around Cairo's Tahrir square yesterday .

Anger: The protesters tear down a cement wall built to prevent them from reaching the Egyptian parliament and Cabinet building near Cairo's Tahrir Square . The Health Ministry said 16 people had been wounded. At one point, riot police used one of the incendiaries thrown at them to set ablaze at least two tents erected by the youths, a Reuters witness said. Inspired by Tunisia's uprising against President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, Egypt's revolution helped set off more revolts in Libya and Syria. But the sense of common purpose that united Egyptians at the time has given way to conflict that has grown only worse and last month triggered lethal street battles. The anniversary will once again showcase the divide between the Islamists and their secular opponents. The Brotherhood has decided against mobilising in the street for the occasion, a decision that could reduce the likelihood of confrontation.

'The people want to bring down the regime,' declared banners in the square. 'Save Egypt from the rule of the Supreme Guide,' said another, a reference to leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie. Mursi, in a speech on Thursday marking the Prophet Mohammad's birthday, called on Egyptians to mark the anniversary 'in a civilised, peaceful way that safeguards our nation, our institutions, our lives'. Many Egyptians feel let down by President Mohamed Mursi and his Muslim Brotherhood and say he has betrayed the revolution . 'The Brotherhood is very concerned about escalation, that's why they have tried to dial down their role on Jan. 25,' said Shadi Hamid director of research at the Brookings Doha Center. 'There may very well be the kinds of clashes that we've seen before, but I don't see anything major happening that is going to fundamentally change the political situation,' he said. Mursi faces discontent on multiple fronts. His opponents say he and his group are seeking to dominate the post-Mubarak order. They accuse him of showing some of the autocratic impulses of the deposed leader by, for example, driving through a controversial new constitution last month. The Brotherhood dismisses such criticism as unfair. It accuses its opponents of failing to respect the rules of the new democracy that put the Islamists in the driving seat by winning elections. Six months into office, Mursi is also being held responsible for an economic crisis caused by two years of turmoil. The Egyptian pound has sunk to record lows against the dollar. Other sources of friction abound. Activists are impatient for justice for the victims of political violence perpetrated over the last two years.

A spate of transport disasters on roads and railways neglected for years is feeding discontent. The parties that have called for Friday's protest list demands including a complete overhaul of the Islamist-tinged constitution that was fast-tracked into law by Mursi in December, a move that fuelled street violence. Its critics say the constitution, which was approved in a popular referendum, offers inadequate protection for human rights, gives the president too many privileges and fails to curb the power of the military establishment. A protester brandishes a home-made pistol whole another prepares to throw a Molotov cocktail over a wall . Mursi's supporters say the criticism is unfair, that enacting the constitution quickly was crucial to restoring stability, and that the opposition is making the situation worse by perpetuating unrest. With its eye firmly on forthcoming parliamentary elections, the Brotherhood is marking the anniversary with a big charity campaign. It aims to deliver medical aid to 1 million people, offer affordable basic foods, and renovate some 2,000 schools. A strong turnout on Friday could also help the Brotherhood's opponents ahead of the elections. 'There is a lot of power in this day and a real chance to use that to mobilise their supporters in the lead-up to the elections,' Hamid said.","Thousands of anti- government protesters gathering in Tahrir Square .

A toddler with cerebral palsy will get the operation he needs to help him walk thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers. Two-year-old Oliver Dockerty was turned down for funding by the NHS while just a few miles away an aspiring topless model was given a free breast enlargement. The decision caused fury when reported last week. But a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for Oliver. Thanks: Oliver Dockerty, pictured with his mother Claire, can now undergo the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to help walk after Daily Mail readers donated thousands of pounds . The complex operation – selective dorsal rhizotomy – costs £25,000. Oliver’s mother Claire Dockerty, 30, praised the Daily Mail and said: ‘Wow – what a massive response. Thank you all so much. The generosity of the public doesn’t make the NHS decision the right one but it means Oliver can now have the operation that he needs.’ Miss Dockerty, of Manchester, said Oliver has splints on his legs and, because his balance is poor, he uses a walking frame to get around. Oliver was referred for surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. But when a surgeon applied to NHS England for funding, he was turned down as the procedure is not yet routinely covered by the NHS. A spokesman said funding was granted only in ‘exceptional cases’, adding that proposals are being considered to offer the operation more widely later in the year. Priorities: Little Oliver Dockerty, left, was . refused funding for an operation which could help him walk while . aspiring model Josie Cunning, right, had her breasts enlarged to 36DD at . a cost of £4,800 to taxpayers . The case contrasted sharply with that of Josie Cunningham, who had a breast enlargement on the NHS at nearby St James’s University Hospital, which is also part of the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. Under NHS guidelines, cosmetic surgery should be funded only when a local trust deems it is needed to protect a patient’s health. Miss Cunningham, who works in telesales, convinced doctors that having a flat chest was causing her severe emotional distress. After funding was approved by her local primary care trust, she had a £4,800 operation which increased her breasts from 32A to 36DD. Outrage: Claire Dockerty, whose son Oliver, two, needs a specialist operation in order to walk without a frame, slammed the NHS for refusing to pay for the operation .","Oliver Dockerty has cerebral palsy and needs selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to help him walk .

Two men have been arrested for separate sex attacks on British women in a Turkish seaside resort. One of the women was held at knife-point and a second was raped by a taxi driver in Marmaris, it has today been reported. One victim, a 28 year old woman, claims to have woken in the early hours to a man standing at the end of her bed and holding a blade. They are the latest in a string of attacks on British tourists in the popular resort. Two men have been arrested for separate sex attacks on British women in Turkish seaside resort of Marmaris. Blood stained Harun K, 30, is arrested by Turkish police following an alleged attempted rape of a British woman in Marmaris last week . One of the women was held at knife-point and a second was raped by a taxi driver in Marmaris, it has today been reported . Local police say he was planning to burgle the woman's apartment but after seeing her half naked in bed he instead tried to rape her, the Sunday Mirror reports. The woman, who lives and works in Turkey, fought him off, biting his fingers and drawing blood. She managed to flee to the bathroom and locked herself inside. Hearing her screams, her neighbours came to her aid and caught her attacked as he fled. A man named Harun K has been arrested in connection with the attack. He has appeared in a special court and has been remanded in custody. The resort hit headlines once again thanks to the high-profile case of Faye Jones, a 16-year-old schoolgirl from Cramlington, Northumberland, who ran away with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani . In the second attack a 21-year-old woman claims she raped by a taxi driver because she did not have the money to pay the fare after she took a cab back to her hotel after a night out. She said when the driver realised she could not pay, he drove off with her still in the car. He took her to one location where she allowed him to kiss and fondle her because she 'feared for her safety.' But then he drove her to a separate location where he raped her. She later went to local police  and filed a rape charge.The taxi driver was arrested and insisted the sex was consensual. He has now been released on bail while police investigate. The incidents are the latest in a string of attacks on British tourists in Marmaris - which is fast earning a reputation as a mecca for drunken holiday makers. Earlier this month a holiday maker was hit over the head with a bottle in an attack in the street. The 27-year-old Londoner, who had been on a night out with his girlfriend, had been hit over the head with a bottle during a drunken brawl. It’s believed to have begun when he knocked over a local man’s drink. It came just a week after Dwayne Ward, 17, was attacked with a pen-knife and slashed with a razor after a night out in the popular tourist resort. He was then stripped naked and left for dead. The teenager was allegedly ambushed. His attackers are said to have robbed, stripped, stabbed and slashed him and dumped his body in a local garden. Those accused are now on remand facing charges including robbery, wounding with intent and attempted murder. And last week the resort hit headlines once again thanks to the high-profile case of Faye Jones, a 16-year-old schoolgirl from Cramlington, Northumberland, who ran away with 22-year-old Turkish waiter Murat Can Ertani. No charges were made against the waiter, after Faye confessed she had gone of her own free will having convinced him she was 19 . It comes weeks after Dwayne Ward, 17, was attacked with a pen-knife and slashed with a razor after a night out in the popular tourist resort . Jones had been on the final day of a holiday with her mother, Rhonda, who reported her missing. After a massive manhunt, she was eventually found four days later, roughly 40 miles away. No charges were made against the waiter, after Faye confessed she had gone of her own free will having convinced him she was 19. Local mayor Ali Acar told the Sunday Mirror that the recent headlines were damaging for the town. He said: 'What Marmaris has experienced in the past few weeks is so sad and we can’t accept it. 'We are identifying the problems and who created them. People must feel safe when they come on holiday and we do everything we can to protect them.","One woman held at knife-point - second was raped by taxi driver in Marmaris .

A post-mortem examination carried out on the victim revealed Miss Arnold died as a result of head injuries. But he later handed himself in following an appeal by Hertfordshire Police, and was charged with her murder. Abandoned: The body of Amelia Arnold was dumped in a woodland by Wall in Hatfield . He denied the charge, instead admitting the lesser crime of manslaugher, and during his trial attempted to argue he had not intended to kill his former lover. But a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court, London, convicted him on Friday and he now faces life behind bars. Clues: Police set up a cordon at Miss Arnold's house to find evidence, but did not discover her body until four days after she disappeared . Following the verdict, detective . inspector John Arthur, from Hertfordshire Police, said: 'Amelia had been . the victim of physical and mental abuse. She was controlled by Jack Wall, who was a bully. 'He cruelly and brutally took Amelia's life leaving their daughter without a mum.' Mr Arthur paid tribute to Miss . Arnold's family, adding: 'Not only have they tragically lost Amelia, . Jack Wall has put them through the harrowing ordeal of having to listen . to evidence in court, which they did with great dignity. 'We understand it can be extremely . difficult for victims to seek help, but I would like to reassure anyone . suffering this form of abuse that cases are dealt with sensitively and . robustly by police and would urge victims to come forward to report any . incidents.' Disappearance: The teenager from Stevenage was missing for four days before police discovered her body in a wood . Miss Arnold's family paid tribute to . her at the time, describing her as a 'fantastic mummy' who 'touched a . lot of hearts in her lifetime.' Another man, Joseph Potter, 41, from . Sycamore Avenue in Bletchley, earlier pleaded guilty to assisting an . offender and obstructing a coroner. Both men are due to be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court tomorrow.","Killer of teenager faces life behind bars having been found guilty of murder .

Cashing in: Bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby's birthday to its name and hair colour . First everyone was convinced it was July 13, then July 19, but whatever the Duchess of Cambridge's actual due date, one thing is certain: there is still no royal baby. And that means bookies are cashing in as thousands of pounds are lost by those who were certain Kate's revelation she was due 'mid July' meant the baby would arrive last week. Bookmakers said the most popular day for due-date bets was Thursday, July 18, when 1,142 people lost money with Ladbrokes alone. One punter in Wiltshire is £1,000 down after putting their money on July 17. The company said it will make £23,000 if the baby isn't born by midnight tonight, while Coral told the Sunday Telegraph it had made £25,000 from lost bets. William Hill said it had already taken £100,000 in due date bets but could not say how many people had lost out as all bets remain open until the baby is born. The bookmaker has now stopped taking bets on when the baby will arrive, and said the majority of people had bet on it being tomorrow. Spokesman Joe Crilly said: 'The money would suggest that it will be Monday . or Tuesday at the very latest.' Jessica Bridge, from Ladbrokes, said: 'In an ideal world we'd love it if Kate and Wills have completely pulled the wool over our eyes and are actually expecting a late July or early August baby, because all the mathematicians and media thought it would be an early birthday and so that's where all the money went.' Yesterday William Hill revealed it had seen a surge in bets for a due date in August, as punters appeared to decide the baby would have to be induced. Doctors do not normally induce births until two weeks after the due date, which would be August 2 if the Duchess was due on July 19. Bookies are also taking bets on everything from the baby's name to its hair colour, and whether William or Kate will be holding it when they first emerge from hospital. Scroll down for video .

Facebook has turned off its controversial tag suggestions feature for users in Europe, in a move that campaigners will hail as a victory for privacy. The social network tool took biometric information provided when users tag friends' faces in photos to make suggestions on the correct tags for future images. But the company was heavily criticised when it introduced the feature and automatically opted-in all users in Europe last June without formally announcing its arrival on the site. Scroll down for video . Backtrack: Facebook has been forced to turn off its automatic tag suggestions feature that used facial recognition technology to recognise the faces of people pictured in photos uploaded to the site . Privacy campaigners were particularly disturbed since Facebook allows photographs to be published on its site without the express permission - or even knowledge - of those pictured. With the facial-recognition feature activated on the site, this meant in essence that those uploading photos were handing the personal biometric information of those photographed over to the company. The removal of the feature and the forced deletion of all the biometric data will be a blow to the company which is under intense pressure to find new ways to convert its vast hoard users' personal information into cash since it was floated on the stock market earlier this year. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO: The decision will be a blow to the company which is under pressure to find new ways to rake in more money . Responding to the removal of the . feature, Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother . Watch, said: 'Users need to be in control of what happens to their data . and it’s absolutely right this applies to people’s pictures on Facebook . in the same way as their written personal information. 'The wider issue is not just about people opting-in to use the technology, but how you regulate something when often the person in the photo might not be aware their photo has even been uploaded. 'Facial recognition has the potential to undermine people’s privacy far more dramatically than most existing technology, with ever more creative uses finding ways to track us and target us.' Facebook was forced to carry out a review of the controversial feature's introduction after a wave of anger about potential data protection issues. It announced last month that it would suspend the feature across Europe and erase all the biometric facial-recognition data it has collected thus far from users on the continent by October 15. European regulators have ordered Google to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out of it. France’s National Commission on Computing and Freedom led a European investigation into Google’s new unified policy, which replaced 60 individual policies for its search, email and other services and regulates how it uses the personal data it collects. CNIL's president Isabelle Falque-Pierrotin said the company had 'three or four months' to make the revisions, otherwise 'authorities in several countries can take action against Google'. Google responded that it is reviewing the commission’s report but that it believes its policy respects European law. The current row revolves around Google's decision to pool of anonymous user data across Google services. For Google, this is a big advantage when selling online ads. Google and other large internet groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than traditional TV or radio campaigns. The move followed a review by Facebook . Ireland of the degree to which the social networking site had . implemented recommendations made in an audit of the social networking . site by the Irish Data Protection Commission last December. That report assessed Facebook Ireland’s . compliance with Irish Data Protection law and by extension EU law. The . aim is to re-introduce the tag feature in the future, but with new . guidelines and different forms of notice and consent. Billy Hawkes, the Data Protection Commissioner for Ireland, said last month the tool would only return to the site if Facebook agreed with the department on the 'most appropriate means of collecting user consent'. He praised the multi-billion pound company for 'sending a clear signal of its wish to demonstrate its commitment to best practice in data protection compliance.' Mr Hawkes says Facebook should make users more aware of what happens to their personal data to increase control over privacy settings. Mr Pickles added: 'It may be possible in future to find a way to use facial recognition on Facebook in very limited circumstances. 'However, given the challenge of securing consent from both the person uploading the photo and the people in the photo being scanned, it may be practically impossible to secure an adequate level of consent. 'What must not happen is the consent requirement be watered down because it proves difficult.'","Decision taken following probe by the Irish Data Protection Commission .

Competitive sports put some children off exercise for life and primary schools should be told to offer less taxing alternatives, MPs have warned. Safeguarding Britain’s Olympic legacy is about allowing as many children as possible to enjoy the health benefits of sport through non-competitive activities, they say in a report out today. The Commons Education Committee warned that competitive team sports have a ‘limited appeal’ to some children and politicians’ focus on them can be ‘counter-productive’. 'Limited appeal': While children may look up to sporting heroes such as Tour de France winner Chris Froome (pictured) MPs warn that a focus on winning is sure to put some children off exercise . Number one: As England celebrate the euphoria of trouncing Australia in the Ashes, MPs publish a report saying shifting the focus from competitive to non-competitive sports will help tackle obesity . During the Games last summer David Cameron announced that competitive team sports would be made compulsory for all primary school children in England. He pledged funding for new sports teachers to inspire the next generation of top athletes, and expressed concerns that Indian dance was being counted as physical education. But the committee of MPs urged the Department for Education to make clear to schools that there should also be non-competitive activities to increase the wellbeing of all children, and help control obesity. The committee chairman, Tory MP Graham Stuart, said the 2012 Games was a ‘magical time’ which generated ‘massive enthusiasm’ for sport among young people. Olympic legacy: David Cameron (pictured with Olympic sailor Ben Ainslie and Paralympic swimmer Ellie Simmonds) had promised that competitive sports would become compulsory in primary schools . ‘High-quality school sport is vitally important,’ he said. ‘It provides young people with opportunities to improve their education, health and well-being. 'We need to be encouraging all young people to take part in sport; whether they enjoy the competition of football, rugby or netball or prefer non-competitive activities. Schools must provide a range of activities that appeal to all.’ Competitive sports ‘can bring many benefits to young people in terms of resilience, organisation and team work’, the report said, but a focus on winning ‘can be a disincentive as a much as incentive’ for some children. While the Government has injected £300million into primary school sports provision for the next two years, the MPs warned there is no long-term plan when that ends in 2015. They said ministers needed to act to make sure the momentum was not lost ‘amid short-term plans and funding’ or their promises risked becoming a ‘gimmick’. Inclusive: MPs say that safeguarding Britain's Olympic legacy means getting as many children as possible to engage with exercise rather than focusing on coming first . The committee took evidence from education think tanks, as well as the Youth Sport Trust and the Rugby Football Union, which recommended more provision for non-competitive sport – although 59 per cent of primary schools said they offer this in the form of activities such as dance. Meanwhile 67 per cent of primaries said their pupils entered inter-school competitions. All 17,000 primary schools in England and Wales have been given funding to improve their sports provision until 2015, and around 120 dedicated sports teachers are being trained. Mr Stuart said: ‘We are concerned that the Government’s primary sport premium – while correctly focused – is only being given to schools for two years. ‘This is simply not long enough for schools to build sustained provision ... if the funding is not extended, there is a risk the primary sport premium will become little more than a gimmick.’","MPs say safeguarding Britain's Olympic legacy involves getting as many children as possible to enjoy non-competitive activities .

Labour was accused of another ‘conflict of interest’ with union baron Len McCluskey yesterday after it emerged his former mistress has been given a top job at his union. The Unite general secretary’s ex-lover Jennie Formby, who gave birth to his child while he was still married, was last month given a £75,000-a-year post as the powerful union’s political director. She is also a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee, which is made up of senior Labour Party MPs – including leader Ed  Miliband – and sets the direction of party policies. The appointment raises more questions about the unions’ influence over Mr Miliband, after Unite was accused of rigging a parliamentary selection contest in Falkirk to try to get Karie Murphy, a close friend of Mr McCluskey, chosen as the candidate by signing up new union members without their knowledge. Mrs Formby’s new role will fan the flames as she will be helping as many union supporters as possible get picked as Labour candidates for the 2015 general election. It is understood she has already challenged Mr Miliband over his response to Falkirk, telling him he should not have brought in the police. Mr Miliband handed over the file to officers earlier this month in a major escalation of the row with the union, which has donated £11.9million to the party since 2010 and whose votes helped him win the leadership over his brother David. It was revealed that Mrs Formby –under her maiden name Sandle – gave birth to a child in 1991, whose father is named on the birth certificate as Mr McCluskey. They were then both working at the Transport and General Workers Union, which later merged into Unite, and Mr McCluskey was living in union-subsidised housing in London while his wife Ann stayed in his native Liverpool. When Mr McCluskey divorced Ann three years later, he set up home with another woman, and his former mistress married Frederick Formby in 2004. Tory MP Stewart Jackson said yesterday . that ‘serious questions must now be asked about whether Mr McCluskey had . a conflict of interest’ in appointing Mrs Formby. Controversial appointment: Jennie Formby, was last month promoted to serve as Unite's political director, and is also a member of Labour¿s National Executive Committee . Mistress: Jennie Formby, pictured on bottom right, gave birth to Len McCluskey's love-child in 1991, while he was still married to his ex-wife Ann . In a letter to Mr Miliband, he wrote: ‘You have spoken out strongly against Unite’s actions in Falkirk. 'I am sure you will agree with me that this appointment now begs new questions as to whether Unite’s leadership is not only rigging Labour selections, but also appointments to its senior team. ‘I call on you on to join me  in condemning this appointment, and that you investigate the process under which it  was made.’ A senior Unite official said most members were not aware of the connection between Mr McCluskey and Mrs Formby and that her appointment would also fuel criticism that the union is ‘run by a clique’. Another official said while she is considered to be able, she has benefited from her connection to Mr McCluskey, adding: ‘She has always enjoyed strong support from Len, and he is so dominant in Unite you can’t get far without it.’ Last night a Unite spokesman said: ‘All appointments are authorised and ratified by the union’s executive council.’ He declined to comment further.","Married Unite leader Len McCluskey fathered child with Jennie Formby .

Spending cuts and the high cost of living could force elderly people who live in the countryside to face their final years in poverty and isolation, a report has warned. Gradual changes to the rural way of life are leaving those over 65 without infrastructure or support, the study found. Poor access to social care, slow internet connections, cuts to local bus services and the closure of local shops and post offices are among the factors affecting their quality of life, it is claimed. Bearing the brunt: An Age UK report claims over-65s living in rural areas are more adversely affected by spending cuts and the high cost of living compared to those living in urban areas . The report, published by charity Age UK, follows the Government’s admission that countryside communities have been failed by some decision-making, with ministers claiming that future policies will be ‘rural-proof’. Over-65s living in rural areas are adversely affected by spending cuts and the high cost of living compared to those living in urban areas, the report claims. The document, entitled Later Life In Rural England, says prices are up to 20 per cent higher in the countryside. It found that 1.2 million people older than 50 in Britain are socially isolated, which it claims is as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Describing rural life for the elderly as ‘tough’, the charity has called on the Government to consider the social impact of cutting services used by the elderly. It found that one in four over-65s living in the countryside identified the lack of public transport as the biggest challenge they face. Almost 600,000 leave their homes only once, or not at all, every week, the charity also found. Connections: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said elderly people in isolated communities could benefit from schemes such as the rollout of broadband to rural areas . The Department for the Environment is expected to publish a guide this month ordering ministers and officials to take account of rural communities when developing policies. Environment Secretary Owen Patterson said: ‘If you’re an elderly person in a constituency like mine in rural Shropshire and you haven’t got a car, or you lose the ability to drive, you are at a disproportionate disadvantage.’ He pinpointed the rollout of broadband to rural areas as something that would be a ‘huge social gain for elderly people’. Mr Patterson added: ‘The biggest thing we can do to people is to get broadband into our most remote communities. ‘The great thing about broadband is you can Skype your daughter in Sydney, and you can keep up with all the latest news, culture and sport online and do your shopping and play a valuable role in society.’ Michelle Mitchell, charity director of Age UK, said: ‘Life in rural England is very tough for many people. ‘Too many are stranded at home, lonely and isolated, struggling to the shops, post office and even hospital, because of a lack of local bus services. ‘With rural communities ageing rapidly, it’s more critical than ever that the Government and local authorities make sure that the older people who live there, many of them frail and vulnerable, have access to the services and facilities they need to live as independent and fulfilling lives as possible.’ Victoria Harris from The Prince’s Countryside Fund said that the closure of rural shops and post offices is a ‘major issue’.","1.2 million people over 50 are 'socially isolated' which is said to be as dangerous as smoking 15 cigarettes a day .

A grandfather who saw Jill Dando moments before she was shot dead claims police ignored his evidence about the murder. Barry Lindsey said Miss Dando, 37, was confronted by her 'Mediterranean' killer on her doorstep in 1999 seconds before she was killed. Mr Lindsey, now 61, told detectives to search for an olive-skinned man - but he claims they were only interested in evidence linking Barry George to the murder. Released: Barry George wrongly served eight years in prison for the murder of Jill Dando before he was acquitted at a retrial. An eyewitness told police that Miss Dando's killer was in fact a man of Mediterranean appearance . Mr George served eight years behind bars for the killing before being acquitted after a retrial in 2008. The 53-year-old was recently denied up to £500,000 compensation for being wrongly jailed after the Court of Appeal agreed with a minister that Mr George was 'not innocent enough' to be eligible for a pay-off. Eyewitness Mr Lindsey told police in the days after the murder on April 26, 1999, that Mr George was not the man responsible for the murder outside the Crimewatch presenter's home in Fulham, west London. 'I told officers they needed to find a man with olive skin, dark hair and who looked like he was of Mediterranean origin,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'But straight off, they said ""We are looking at a local guy over this murder. He is called Barry George."" They asked if I knew him and described what he looked like.' He added that when he told police that Mr George was definitely not the man responsible they 'didn't want to listen any more'. Victim: Miss Dando's real killer has never been identified after Mr George was acquitted of murder in 2008 . Mr Lindsey was driving past Jill Dando's home in a green Range Rover which he was taking to a friend's house in Wimbledon when he saw her. The father-of-five, who is a former print worker, claimed that he saw the television presenter arguing with a man. He added: 'I hit the brakes, stopped in the middle of the road and looked through the back window. I will never forget the look on her face. It was one of absolute terror - her face had gone as white as the coat she was wearing.' Although he considered intervening, Mr Lindsey decided to drove-off and heard a gunshot as he reached the end of the road. He didn't know who Miss Dando was until he saw the story about the murder on the news that evening and realised what he had witnessed. The eyewitness said the man had dark skin, looked Mediterranean, and was two stone lighter than Barry George. Murder scene: The road in Fulham, west London, where Jill Dando was shot dead on her doorstep in April 1999 . Killing: Police search the road in Fulham, west London, for clues after Miss Dando, 37, was shot dead on her doorstep . Although he was interviewed at length by police and taken back to the scene, Mr Lindsey never heard from officers again. Mr George said he fervently hopes he will live long enough to see Jill Dando’s killer brought to justice - but he very much doubts it will happen. 'The real murderer is out there somewhere but the police aren't looking for him,' he says. 'They needed someone to plug a hole and I was it – my life was disposable.' Barry and his sister Michelle Diskin strongly believe that police used his disabilities to reinforce the notion he was  a weird, dangerously obsessive fantasist. He was born with brain damage which affects his short-term memory. Defeat: Barry George, left, was denied compensation for being wrongly jailed over the killing of Jill Dando, right . He also suffers from epilepsy and was . diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, which makes it difficult for him to . read people’s motives. 'The . police knew this but used it against him,' said Michelle. 'They would . never have been able to do this if he had Down’s Syndrome, say, or was . blind. I have to wonder whether they really believed he did it. 'You . see, at the time of the murder I was living in Ireland, my mother was . elderly and unwell and our father wasn't around. The police must have . thought that there was no one to fight for Barry, that a conviction . would be easy. ‘They . were so very desperate in all they did.

Rachael Neustadt, 35, allowed Daniel, seven, and Jonathan, five, to go to Moscow with their father for Christmas but they have not been allowed home. Now Ms Neustadt has turned to a Russian court and asked them to intervene in the international tug of love. Tug of love: Rachael Neustadt, left is fighting for her sons Daniel Jakob, seven, (centre) and Jonathan, five, (right) to be returned to England. She also has a third son, one-year-old Meir, who is still with her . The English High Court have said Ilya Neustadt, 36, a former London Metropolitan University lecturer, must bring his two sons back to Britain. But he has refused to comply with the court order, and solicitors for Ms Neustadt, an American who lives in London, have applied direct to the Russian courts for help. They are using a piece of international law governing cross-border disputes between parents which was ratified by the Russians less than two months ago. Ms Neustadt hopes that the orders made in the High Court will be 'enforced' in Russia under the international convention. Her solicitors Dawson Cornwell revealed details of the abduction after Deputy High Court Judge Alison Russell gave the mother permission to publicise the case. Ms Neustadt also has a third son with her ex-husband, one-year-old Meir, who remains in London with her. Family split up: Daniel, seven, (left) and Jonathan, five, (centre) went to Russia for Christmas with their father but have not been allowed to return. They are currently separated from their one-year-old brother Meir (right) She said in a statement released through her solicitors that she is desperate to get her children back. 'I just want the boys back home here safe . and sound - and soon. I'm deeply concerned that the current situation is . damaging and harmful to the children and to the family bond, especially . because of the absence of a relationship between the boys and me, their . mummy. Order: Ilya Neustadt, 36, who has defied demands to return his two sons to England . 'I love and miss them so much and I know they are missing me and . their baby brother too.' A spokesman for the law firm said: 'Rachael had only agreed to the children going on a holiday with their father to Russia to visit his family over the school Christmas break. 'Ilya was to bring the children back to England in time for the new school term. As a result of the abduction, the children are now completely separated from their mother, who has always been their primary carer, and from their younger brother. 'The children are now Wards of the English High Court and the Court has ordered that Ilya must return the children to England. Ilya has ignored all of the High Court orders and refuses to engage in the proceedings. 'When Rachael confronted her former husband about his actions in splitting up their three children, keeping the siblings apart, and keeping the children away from their mother, Ilya replied with what he referred to as the ""two-thirds speech"" in that, when the Berlin Wall was built, it may have been ""unfortunate"" to give up one third of the city, but ""at least two-thirds was saved"".' Ms Neustadt has travelled to Russia three times in an attempt to get her ex-husband to hand over Daniel and Jonathan, but he has refused. The spokesman added: 'Rachael has had very little contact with the children despite her visits to Russia. On Rachael's most recent trip to Russia, Ilya denied her contact with the children and refused to inform the children that their mother was in Moscow. Split family: Brothers (from left to right) Daniel, Meir and Jonathan. Daniel and Jonathan have been in Russia since before Christmas . In Russia: Daniel Neustadt (both pictures) who has been in Eastern Europe with his father since before Christmas . 'On the one occasion when Ilya permitted the children to briefly speak to their mother on the telephone, Daniel asked his father if he could see his mother, but then returned to the phone to tell his mother that he could not because his father says,  ""it is forbidden"". 'Ilya has prevented regular telephone and Skype contact from taking place between the children and their mother and has also recently told Rachael that: ""I am their mother now!

Killers: Mick and Mairead Philpott are currently serving prison sentences for the manslaughter of six of their children in a house fire . Philpott started the blaze with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs in May last year. They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner Lisa Willis. Philpott was locked in a legal battle with her for custody of the four children they had together. The trio were all found guilty of killing the children in the fire at their home in Victory Road, Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11 last year. They made a despicable gamble to start the fire and blame Miss Willis in a bid to win back custody of five children she took from the family home. But the idiotic plan went disastrously wrong. Too much petrol was used and the fire burned out of control – leaving Philpott unable to reach the children in temperatures approaching 1,000F. The judge described the plot as 'a wicked and dangerous plan' that was 'outside the comprehension of any right-thinking person'. Young lives destroyed: The six coffins carrying the Philpotts's children are carried into St Mary's Roman Catholic Church for their funeral last year . Killed by their own parents: Six wooden crosses mark the graves of the Philpott children . In the days that followed the fire, Philpott began his elaborate ruse to appear blameless and even appeared at a press conference appealing for information. He ‘loved’ being a local celebrity and was seen 'laughing and joking' and ‘touching up’ his wife in the hospital where her son Duwayne was dying after the fire. Then, while in custody awaiting trial, he wrote a sick prison letter boasting that if he won freedom he and his wife would celebrate by ‘raping each other’.

Marine conservation campaigners have offered a £2,000 reward to anyone who turns in the hit-and-run killer of a young dolphin. The calf was fatally injured by the propeller of a boat after up to 20 vessels were accused of ‘harassing’ an inshore pod of dolphins off the Cornish coast. Police are now investigating the death. The cash reward for information leading to an arrest has been put up by the charity Sea Shepherd UK. Killed: Police are investigating how a young dolphin was mown down and killed by boat users in a Cornish estuary (file photo) Witnesses said powerboats raced into . the Camel estuary near Padstow and surrounded a pod of protected . bottlenose dolphins swimming close to the shore. It is thought one of . the boats collided with the calf by accident. Yesterday, Abby Crosby, of the Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘A bottlenose dolphin was killed. It’s a massive tragedy. ‘Inshore pods are so rare and special. There are only three recognised inshore pods resident around the coast . in the UK and one of them is in Cornwall. 'There are only between eight . and a dozen dolphins in this pod and to lose one is drastic. We need to . educate powerboat owners about how special this species is. ‘I believe everyone was alerted that . the pod was out in the estuary and they went out. I think some speedboat . owners were very excited to see them. Attraction: Powerboat and speedboat users raced into the Camel estuary on Saturday afternoon to see a rare pod of inshore bottlenose dolphins in the water. But a calf was fatally injured by one of the motorboats (file photo) ‘These dolphins are protected by the . Wildlife Act of 1981 and you cannot plead ignorance of the law. You . cannot follow a pod because that is harassment. They can follow boats, . but boat owners should turn their engines off. ‘These creatures are insanely intelligent. They will mourn a calf – they are not like wild animals with little intelligence.’ 'I understand it was not a deliberate . act but an accident but we need to educate power boat owners about how . special this species is' Abby Crosby, Marine Conservation Officer with the Cornwall Wildlife Trust . Faye Archell, of British Divers Marine . Life Rescue, said: ‘There were a number of private, commercial and . sightseeing vessels in the area at that time. 'Padstow sightseeing . vessels are all trained how to behave responsibly around wildlife. However, passengers may have witnessed the harassment by other vessels.’ A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman . said: ‘Specialist wildlife crime-trained police officers are . investigating reports of a dead bottlenose dolphin which was seen in the . Camel estuary, Padstow, on Saturday. ‘It is believed a pod of dolphins . entered the estuary at about 1.30pm. They were followed by up to 20 . boats until about 4.45pm when they left the estuary. ‘A pleasure boat running cruises area then saw the body of a dead dolphin.’ The pod belongs to a sub-species of . bottlenose dolphins that spend their lives inshore. Bottlenose dolphins – . which have regional accents, with the whistles made by those off Wales . different to those living off the Irish coast – are altruistic and will . go to the aid of humans in distress.

Overjoyed: The newlyweds were joined by their respective families to celebrate their special day. Mrs Bluett said: 'Love has taken its sweet time' Mrs Bluett said: ‘The important thing is that we met all those years ago and it must have really left some sort of impression. ‘And when circumstances brought us . closer together we finally got married after all these years.

A Boston-based designer has created Squito, pictured. It's a throwable camera that can take multiple photos as it is thrown from one person to another. It then uses image stitching to create a single panoramic aerial shot . Squito is the size of a tennis ball and is fitted with three cameras, an orientation sensor, a microcontroller, image processor and image stabiliser. It can take multiple photos of a subject, left, before stitching these images into a single aerial shot, right . Soldiers on the battlefield could soon benefit from new state-of-the-art surveillance equipment that can remotely pinpoint snipers, ambushes and explosive devices. A throwable wheeled robot and a remote-controlled helicopter were both unveiled at a demonstration at the Defence and Equipment Support at Abbey Wood, near Bristol. The 500g robot, which is equipped with cameras and other sensors, is made from titanium and can be thrown by soldiers into buildings to see enemy activity. The throwable camera was designed by inventor Steve Hollinger from Massachusetts and a patent for the device was granted this week. Squito is the size of a tennis ball and is fitted with three cameras, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) - or orientation sensor - a . microcontroller and image processor. Hollinger’s patent describes the ball-shaped camera as having position sensors that can detemine whether the camera is spiraling or spinning as well as the location of the subject. Stabilisers also mean that the images taken don't appear blurred or out of focus. Squito is also capable of registering the individual frames captured in a sequence. The camera can then use all of these features to create a seamless panoramic aerial photo. These images are sent wirelessly to the user’s phone, tablet or desktop. Designer Steve Hollinger and his company Serveball claim Squito can be used by search-and-rescue teams to take panoramic photos of the inside of dangerous buildings. It could also be used with thermal imaging cameras to find bodies, for example . Squito's built-in cameras, sensors and stabilisers can track individual frames to create seamless panoramic aerial photos . Squito can also take video clips. 'Throwable camera innovations are accelerating with advancements in sensor and imaging microelectronics,' said Hollinger. 'And with the advent of low-cost, high-speed cameras for outdoor recreation, an affordable throwable camera is finally within reach.' Hollinger has created a protoype of Squito and, now that the patent has been granted, he plans to manufacture the device for commercial and industrial use. He claims Squito can be used for sport, architecture, search-and-rescue operations, landscape photography and more. The ball can be thrown into dangerous or unstable buildings, for example, to take 360-degree photos of the inside. Squito can also be used with thermal imaging cameras to help emergency services find bodies in buildings. Hollinger is developing a second Squito model that can capture slow-motion, full-spherical video of subjects visible from a bird’s-eye view along the trajectory.","Squito is the size of a tennis ball fitted with three panoramic cameras .

Foreign criminals are taking advantage of weaknesses in police roadside checks to operate in Britain, a senior officer admitted last night. Organised gangs, particularly from Eastern Europe, are trying to exploit difficulties officers face in trying to prove their identity. In some cases, police suspect criminals are able to use false documentation to evade capture when they are wanted in their homelands. Avoiding capture: Foreign criminals are taking advantage of weaknesses in police roadside checks to operate in Britain, a senior officer admitted last night . They revelations were made as 37 forces joined a nationwide crackdown in a bid to flush out wanted criminals from overseas. Police chiefs have taken the unusual step of taking senior officers from Romania, Lithuania and Poland on the week-long operation. They have already snared at least two men wanted on European Arrest Warrants, made 54 arrests, seized 62 vehicles and uncovered a major crime gang. In one case a man claimed to be Lithuanian when he was in fact Polish and wanted for a violent attack in 2005. Officers also discovered a ‘significant number’ of foreign vehicles with invalid insurance, as well as motorists who have been disqualified from driving overseas. Chief Superintendent Martin Evans, who is responsible for the move, said the language barrier and foreign paperwork are ‘challenges’ faced by police patrols every day. Pulled over: There are estimated to be between 15,000 and 30,000 registered foreign vehicles on UK roads . But the Staffordshire officer said that confronting foreign nationals with officers from their home nation is an ‘extremely powerful tool’. He added: ‘It sends a strong message to our foreign visitors. You can see the change in their demeanour when they realise they are dealing with officers from their country. ‘In the main, these people are not part of any established community, they are simply here to commit crime. ‘We are certainly not tarring everybody with the same brush. We are targeting the criminal and not the nationality.’ At any one time there are estimated to be between 15,000 and 30,000 foreign registered vehicles present on Britain’s roads. Travelling gangs are suspected of involvement in offences from shoplifting to fraud, metal theft and vehicle crimes. Some gangs target specific crimes, for example the theft of valuable catalytic converters or cashpoint thefts using skimming devices. The latest operation involves eight officers from Romania, Lithuania and Poland and specialist equipment which cross-references number plates with central databases. Police were joined by immigration officials as well as Home Office officials and enforcement officers from the DVLA. Eight of the 12 most wanted foreign criminals who are believed to be at large in the UK are from Poland, Lithuania and Romania. They include Robert Grygoruk, 36, from Poland, who is wanted for possession of a handgun, supplying drugs and running a prostitution ring. There is huge public pressure to close the net on those who exploit European Union rules on freedom of movement to enter and remain in Britain. In many cases criminals cannot be stopped from entering the country and when deported they are able to return within days. Success: Police have already snared two men on European Arrest Warrants . Chief Supt Evans, who is head of the central motorway police group, said: We want to reassure the public that we are working with our European colleagues to tackle these gangs. ‘We will use the best intelligence and skills we have to detect, prevent and convict those responsible for crime around the country. ‘While shoplifting may not appear as one of the more serious offences, it has a very damaging effect on businesses. ‘Some individuals we have previously stopped had significant criminal convictions.’ Chief Constable Suzette Davenport, who has national responsibility for roads policing, said many foreign crooks move around to avoid detection. She said: ‘Their activity has a damaging impact on communities and businesses that are targeted. ‘We want to prevent the public from the misery they cause and build on the intelligence we already have. ‘These criminal gangs must use our roads to carry out their illegal activity, so by targeting them in this way we are aiming to develop a robust system to tackle the issue in the future.’","Police suspect foreign criminals are using false documents to avoid capture .

The main task of soldiers situated . there was to observe the Japanese attempt to construct mine fields to . block Russian maritime routes. It was also used to keep the largest gulf in the Sea of Japan - known as Peter the Great Gulf - safe from interference from other nations. A permanent observation post was constructed on the island in 1892. It formed part of Russia's Vladivostok Fortress - a complex system of unique fortifications built across coast of the country in the late 19th and early 20th Century.

A Christian worker who claims she was sacked from her job at Heathrow following a 'race hate' campaign by 'Muslim extremists' today vowed to take her unfair dismissal case 'all the way to Luxembourg' to the European Court of Justice. Nohad Halawi allegedly weathered cruel rumours that she was 'anti-Islamist,' on top of a systematic catalogue of intimidation that included telling the 48-year-old that she would go to Hell if she did not convert to Islam. Halawi, previously a beauty consultant for luxury cosmetics brand Shiseido, was then booted out of her 13-year-long job in Heathrow Airport's World Duty Free shop, after going to her seniors with concerns about the verbal tirades she was subjected to. She also claims 'extremist' colleagues brought the Koran to work to try and convert people to Islam and even handed out leaflets promoting terrorism, as well as declaring that it was 'a shame' the failed July 21 London bombings did not go off. Having taken her tribunal case to the courts in 2011, Halawi lost after it was ruled that as a part time and commissioned-based freelance she was not a staff employee. Today, however, she won the right to appeal. Speaking outside court, the mum-of-two from Weybridge, Surrey, told how the abuse started after she stuck up for a Christian colleague who was left in tears after Muslim staff made fun of her for wearing a cross necklace. She said: 'At first, because I am from Lebanon, they assumed I was Muslim but when they found out I wasn't they started bullying me.' Halawi, who came to Britain from Lebanon in 1977, continued: 'They used to say about 9/11 that it serves the American's right and that it was a shame the failed London bombings did not go off. When I asked them why they did not go back and live in their own country if they didn't like the UK, they said 'we came to the West to try and convert as many people to Islam as we can.' She also revealed insider knowledge on life within Heathrow: 'They keep coming to the airport and many of them work in security. It is terrible there. If they see that you are a Muslim they wave you through. One time they thought my husband was Muslim and said 'don't worry he is one of us' and let him through without checking him. And you're telling me this is safe security.' Employment: One of the World Duty Free stores at Heathrow Airport, where Halawi worked for 13 years . Mrs Halawi said she once found extremist leaflets in one of her Muslim colleague's drawers but the airport turned a blind eye. She said: ""Management told him to throw them away. I later found out he had been sacked from other terminals for handing them out and inciting religious hatred, but duty free covered it up as they are scared of labelled Islamophobic."" She was fired in July 2011 after five Muslim colleagues complained she was anti-Islamic followed a heated conversation in the store. After her sacking 28 colleagues, some of them Muslims, signed a petition calling for her reinstatement claiming she was dismissed on the basis of ""malicious lies"", but it was unsuccessful. Having lost her first unfair dismissal campaign, Halawi received help from the Christian Legal Centre to further her case and has subsequently won a right to appeal. She added: 'I am not and have never been racist or anti religion. I have many Muslim friends. I am doing this because I want to show that people It's not fair to use the religion card. They've ruined my life. They've ruined my family's lives. I can't get work and am relying on friends and family to get by' A spokesperson for World Duty Free refused to comment because of the 'ongoing legal proceedings.'","Nohad Halawi, 48, was fired in July 2011 after five Muslim colleagues complained she was anti-Islamic .

After what Stacey Pulsifer estimates having been 22 hours of straight driving, it wasn't until she pulled through a McDonald's drive-thru near Plattsburgh, New York for coffee that she first heard what sounded like meowing. Rescued: Stacey Pulsifer holds up Pumpkin a 6-week-old kitten she discovered trapped in her car's bumper after a 100 mile drive across upstate New York . 'I couldn't figure out where the cries were coming from,' she told the Press Republican. Purely baffled, she returned to her apartment nearby, and hearing the meowing continue, called up two friends to help investigate. 'We literally ripped my car apart,' she said of their efforts. After climbing in and out of her car searching from top to bottom, the scared black kitten was discovered wedged behind her Jeep’s bumper. Route: Ms Pulsifer estimated having driven 22 hours across upstate New York - from Plattsburgh to Elizabethtown and back - before discovering the kitten . 'We called the police, we called the emergency vet. Who do you call when something like this happens?' she asked. After being cut out from her dangerous nook, and making several midnight phone calls to her vet, Ms Pulsifer reports the cat newly named Pumpkin as being fine - up until her front paw, at least, which was found broken in several places. 'She will need to have her front leg amputated when she gets a little older,' Ms Pulsifer told the paper. 'But it really doesn't slow her down any.' Watching the tiny black cat scamper around her apartment, playing with toys people have since dropped off for her, Ms Pulsifer said that the injury that keeps her in a pink sling, hasn't dampened her spirits. 'You can tell she's definitely grateful to be alive,' Ms Pulisfer said.","Stacey Pulsifer estimates having driven 22 hours before discovering the kitten trapped outside the back of her car .

"By . Sara Malm . PUBLISHED: . 10:05 EST, 3 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:26 EST, 4 July 2013 . The King of Belgium last night said he will abdicate in favour of his son. King Albert, 79, said that because of his ‘age and health’ he will pass the throne to Crown Prince Philippe, 53, this month. However, his decision follows the opening of court proceedings over his illegitimate daughter. Announcement: King Albert II of Belgium is expected to announce his abdication after 20 years on the throne, this afternoon . Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said he, too, would make an official announcement immediately after the king's speech, further heightening expectations the 20-year reign of Albert is drawing to a close. In August, Albert would mark his second decade on the throne of the kingdom of 10.5 million people. The nation celebrates Independence Day on July 21 and many have said that could be an ideal day to hand over the largely ceremonial post. Albert’s reign has been largely peaceful although the nation has struggled with an increasing divide between the northern, Dutch-speaking Flanders and the southern, French-speaking Wallonia. King Albert II, centre, is believed to be abdicating in favour of his son Crown Prince Philippe, far left, pictured wit Queen Paola, Dowager Queen Fabiola, Princess Astrid and Prince Lorenz . After he succeeded his brother Baudouin in 1993, Albert became embroiled in a major royal scandal when he was force to acknowledge the existence of an out-of-wedlock daughter, Delphine Boel. His marriage with Queen Paola, the daughter of a member of the Argentinian Junta, suffered a major crisis, and the issue was brought into the spotlight yet again this spring when Boel opened court proceedings to prove she is the king's daughter. She has called upon her alleged half-siblings, Crown Prince Philip and Princess Astrid to provide DNA to prove her case. During his 20 years on the throne, Albert I has gone from turned from a king with a love of sleek motorcycles into an elderly monarch sometimes relying on a walking stick. Following the neighbour? In April this year, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, center, pictured with King Albert II and Queen Paola, gave up the throne in favour of her eldest son . Adding to his troubles was the eternal political strife within the nation itself. When Belgium found itself without a government for a record 541 days before the team of Di Rupo could take the oath late in 2011, Albert had to be involved in the protracted talks because one of the few real powers a Belgian monarch has is to appoint government brokers. If he abdicates in favour of his son, he will be the second European monarch to do so this year. Belgium's neighbor, the Netherlands, has already seen an abdication this year. Queen Beatrix - now known as Princess Beatrix - stepped down after a 33-year reign of neighbouring Netherlands . Her eldest son was appointed King Willem-Alexander at a lavish ceremony in Amsterdam on April 30.","Expected to abdicate in favour of his son Crown Prince Phillip .

Wrong: Diabetic Revina Garcia was pulled out of her car, handcuffed and put into a police car after she crashed into another vehicle . Police have admitted they need more training after a Santa Fe woman suffering a diabetic seizure was handcuffed and 'roughly' thrown into the back of a police car because officers thought she was drunk. Revina Garcia said she was lucky she didn't fall into a diabetic coma when she was pulled out of her car, pushed to the ground and handcuffed by police after she rear-ended a pick-up truck on Paseo Real near the N.M. 599 intersection in New Mexico on Friday. While Garcia, 56, was wearing an insulin pump on her waistband, police only called emergency services after the 'disoriented' woman managed to mumble that she was diabetic. According to a police report obtained by Santa Fe New Mexican, Santa Fe County sheriff's deputy Joseph McLaughlin asked Garcia to put her vehicle in park, turn off the ignition and unlock the door or window. But when she didn't comply after 'multiple requests' and tried to drive off twice, a second deputy broke one of the car's windows. McLaughlin then reached in and switched off the car's ignition, undid Garcia's seat belt and removed her from the 2013 Hyundai. The officers then threw Garcia to the ground and handcuffed her. 'I did not detect the odor of an alcoholic beverage, but Garcia did seem to be very disoriented,' the report said. 'When asked [why] she did not comply with my requests she replied ‘I’m sorry.’' Education: Revina Garcia said police should have known she was diabetic from the insulin pump she was wearing . According to Santa Fe New Mexican, police believed Garcia then 'mumbled something about being . diabetic' before the officers realized they should call paramedics who said she was 'suffering from a diabetic emergency'. Garcia told Koat Action 7 News she believed officers thought she was a drunk driver, but should have known she was diabetic from the insulin pump clipped to her waistband. She said law enforcers must receive more training to recognize when someone needs medical care. 'I'm surprised I didn't go into a coma in the back of that police car,' she said. 'Most people if their blood sugars are in the 20s are comatose. 'If there's education this wouldn't happen. This wouldn't have happened.' This is where Revina Garcia collided with another vehicle after suffering a diabetic attack . Santa Fe County sheriff Robert Garcia told Santa Fe New Mexican . his office is 'sensitive to the issue' and officers receive training in . how to recognize diabetic attacks, but 'in a situation like this, . things happen fast'. He said . his office is reviewing incident footage and conducting an internal . review in addition to meeting with Revina Garcia and her husband. 'We are looking into it. It’s not something we are just going to blow off and not deal with,' he said.

But it isn't just women using the opportunity to expose some flesh. The latest research reveals that men are daring to bare more leg than ever before as temperatures across the UK continue to soar. High street sales data has revealed that demand for men’s shorts that sit at the top of thighs, rather than knees has shot up by a staggering 156 per cent in the last week alone. The thighs the limit! Sales of very short shorts have surged in recent weeks, could it be thanks to Joey Essex who has been donning the designs in Essex and at Wireless festival in recent weeks? It seems that the trend has been spurred on by celebrities with well-known faces such as TOWIE’s Joey Essex and Mark Wright, Cristiano Ronaldo, Danny Dyer, Olly Murs and One Direction’s Louis Tomlinson, who all prefer the thigh-skimming option. Spotted on the recent SS14 catwalks of Versace, Emporio Armani, Dolce & Gabbana and Gieves & Hawkes, this is one trend that has definitely made the leap to the great British high street, and looks set to continue. Debenhams spokesperson Ed Watson, who carried out the research, said: 'We have all heard about the emergence of ""mankles"" – male ankles peeking out from rolled up trousers. Well, this takes it to the next level. 'All over the world, British men are renowned for exposing their white knobbly knees during the summer holidays. Higher and higher: As temperatures rose at Glastonbury, so did the men's short length with Nick Grimshaw (L) and Oliver Cheshire (R) donning the tiny designs . The only way is shorts: James Argent, Joey and their TOWIE friends have also been sporting the thigh-skimming designs . Get shorty! The 'Cristiano effect' caused by football star Ronaldo's barely-there holiday wear has seen sales of men's micro shorts surge. Rio Ferdinand and Olly Murs also dabble with the trend on holiday . 'For the daring few, wearing short shorts can be a liberating experience, particularly when faced with the recent tropic temperatures. 'We haven’t seen a demand for short shorts as high as this since Wham sparked the trend in the 1980s – we are currently considering whether or not to go even shorter for next summer!' The retailer has seen a particularly high demand for short shorts in Newcastle, Glasgow and Cardiff. Flashback: Debenhams say they haven't seen a demand for short shorts as high as this since Wham sparked the trend in the 1980s . During the 19th and early 20th centuries . shorts were worn as outerwear only by young boys and because of this, . men would not wear shorts to avoid looking immature. In the 1930s, shorts started to be worn . for casual comfort (e.g. outdoor and athletic activities) by both men . and women.However, it was still taboo to wear shorts outside certain . activities. Since arpond World War II, when soldiers . often served in tropical locations, adult men have worn shorts more . often, especially in summer weather, but the perception of shorts as . being only for young boys took several decades to change. By the late . 20th century it became common for men to wear shorts as casual . wear in summer. The 1980s saw the emergence of short shorts and there has been a steady rise in popularity.

We may be baking in a heatwave but scientists have detected snow around a young solar system 175 light years from Earth. American Astronomers have snapped the first ever direct image of a snow line - the point where liquids turn to ice - around an infant solar system. The images show the region around the star where water, carbon dioxide, methane, carbon monoxide and other gases freeze onto dust particles orbiting around the young star at its centre. American Astronomers have snapped the first image of a snow line (pictured). They saw the carbon monoxide snow line (where the green meets the black inner ring) that had formed around star TW Hydrae. They believe it is similar to how our own Solar System would have appeared when it was just a few million years old . A snow line is the point where liquids turn to ice, in an infant solar system.

An artist's concept of a snow line around star TW Hydrae is pictured and shows ice-covered dust grains in the inner disc (blue) and carbon monoxide ice covered grains in the outer disc (green). The transition from blue to green marks the snow line . Dr Chunhua Qi, an American researcher . with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, co-led the . international team whose results are published in Science Express. He said: 'ALMA has given us the first real picture of a snow line around a young star, which is extremely exciting because of what it tells us about the very early period in the history of our own Solar System.' 'We can now see previously hidden details about the frozen outer reaches of another solar system, one that has much in common with our own when it was less than 10 million years old.' On Earth, snow lines form at high elevations where falling temperatures turn atmospheric moisture to snow. In much the same way, snow lines form around young stars in the distant, colder reaches of the disks from which solar systems form. The transition from blue to green marks the carbon monoxide snow line on this artist's concept. The snow helps grains of dust to adhere to each other by providing a sticky coating, which is essential to the formation of planets and comets . Depending on the distance from the star, other more exotic molecules can freeze and turn to snow. The snow line spotted around TW Hydrae formed on the boundary between warm and cool regions of space where the young star's heat energy is weakest. The presence of dust insulates an area of the gas which allows it to form ice crystals. However, further out from the disk of dust that will eventually go on to form planets, the gas heats up. This 'cocoon' of hot gas had previously thwarted the scientist's efforts to observe the snow lines, which were only discernible from their 'spectral signatures', or the radiation reflected off the particles and into space.","American Astronomers have snapped the .

While all eyes were on the iPad mini launch launch night, Microsoft tried to steal Apple's thunder by allowing the first reviews of its supposed iPad killer, called Surface, to be published. However, the tactic may have backfired. The Surface tablet, which will cost between £399 and £559 ($499 to $699 in the US) when it goes on sale on Thursday, was met with a lukewarm response, with reviewers criticising its lack of apps and branding it 'a compromise'. Scroll down for video . US journalists have published the first reviews of Microsoft's Surface tablet - and slammed it as 'disappointing', blaming a lack of apps. The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into computer hardware. Based on a Nvidia Corp chip designed by ARM . Holdings, the Surface will run a simplified version of Windows 8 that is . not compatible with old Microsoft applications. However, . the tablet will feature new app-style versions of Office mainstays such . as Word, PowerPoint and Excel, and will include Xbox games, video and . music apps. The Surface, with two cameras and a USB port, will be Wi-Fi only. Even the most positive review, from technology magazine Wired, would only go so far as describing the tablet as 'quite good'. The price is the same as the cheapest iPad, and will put the two firms into a head to head battle. Amazon's Kindle Fire and Google's Nexus tablet are also set to be launched or receive updates this week as manufacturers prepare for what many predict will be a 'tablet Christmas'. The Surface will go on sale the same day Microsoft releases Windows 8, . the new version of its desktop computer software. Experts have described the software as make or break for the company, but say the Surface will struggle against the iPad. 'It is priced the same as the iPad , even though the Surface has a higher spec with 32gb rather than the iPad's 16gb,' said Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint. 'However, the consumer is unlikely to understand that - they will simple see that it's a straight choice between an iPad and Surface, and I think the majority of people will choose an iPad - they just won't be aware of a spec fight. Microsoft's contribution: The new Surface tablet computer has a case that doubles as a keyboard . Mr Miles said the tablet could appeal to owners of Microsoft powered mobile phones. 'If you've used Windows Phone the Surface is easier to use, but not many people have - and people love or hate it.' Gizmodo: 'Microsoft Surface RT Review: This Is Technological Heartbreak' 'We hadn't looked forward to something this much in a long, long time. 'Now it's here: And it's been just as long a time since a gadget has been so disappointing. Should you buy it? No.' The Verge: 'Not Quite There - And The Clock Is Ticking' (7/10)'The . promise of the Surface was that it could deliver a best-in-class tablet . experience, but then transform into the PC you needed when heavier . lifting was required. 'Instead of putting down my tablet and picking up . my laptop, I would just snap on my keyboard and get my work done. 'But . that's not what the Surface offers, at least not in my experience. 'It . does the job of a tablet and the job of a laptop half as well as other . devices on the market, and it often makes that job harder, not easier. 'Instead of being a no-compromise device, it often feels like a . more-compromise one.' Engadget: 'Where are the apps?' (No score)'It needs a bigger pile of apps and games to make up for that and, while we're sure they're coming, we don't know when. 'If . gaming and music and movies and reading are what you're looking to . enjoy, then we might advise sitting this one out for a few months just . to make sure that all your bases will indeed be covered. 'If, . however, you're looking for an impeccably engineered tablet upon which . you can do some serious work, a device that doesn't look, feel or act . like a toy, then you should get yourself a Surface with Windows RT.' Wired: 'Microsoft Has Surfaced A Hit' (8/10)'This is a great device. 'It . is a new thing, in a new space, and likely to confuse many of . Microsoft’s longtime customers. People will have problems with . applications — especially when they encounter them online and are given . an option by Internet Explorer to run them, only to discover this won’t . work. 'But overall it’s quite good; certainly better than any full-size Android tablet on the market.' New York TImes: 'Sleek Tablet, Clumsy Software' (No Score)'What lets the Surface down is supposedly Microsoft’s specialty: . software."" Wall Street Journal: 'Hardworking Tablet With PC Chops''Microsoft's . Surface is a tablet with some pluses: the major Office apps and nice, . optional keyboards.

Sources told the New York Daily News that the money was paid to T&M while Mr Weiner was trying to protect his reputation over the scandal. Federal Election Commission financial statements showed that campaign money funded 'legal services', reported the New York Daily News. 'We’ve asked a firm to look into whether some of my photos could have been taken (and) manipulated,' Mr Weiner said at the time of the scandal. This comes as it was revealed Democrats will hold a congressional seat left vacant when David Wu, another politician in a sex scandal, resigned. Democrats poured $1million into the district, determined not to drop another safe seat after losing the district left vacant by Mr Weiner. Political scandal: After days of denials, Weiner confessed in June that he tweeted a photo of his bulging underpants to a young woman . In December he was revealed to have been open to a threesome with e-mistress Traci Nobles and another man, reported Radar Online. Online messages showed Mr Weiner asking: 'How about with another guy?' Ms Nobles replied: 'Hmmmm, haven't done it before'. Mr Weiner went on to say that ‘it can be hot’, and when asked if he’s turned on by other guys, said: 'It depends on the guy, but generally yes'. Ms Nobles, 35, a former cheerleading coach from Georgia, was one of at least six women who came forward with explicit online chats with him.

A slaughterman balances a rifle against the pony’s head and pulls the trigger. The animal flails on the ground and is then winched on to the production line where her throat is cut with a razor sharp knife, severing the carotid artery. The company LJ Potter of Taunton kills 63 horses a week using this method, with the carcasses shipped to France for food. Scroll down for video . Last seconds: This is the grisly scene played out every day inside the Somerset slaughterhouse which sent six horses containing danger drug bute into the human food chain . The business is run by Stephen Potter, who said he sells his horsemeat through 50 butchers in the Calais area. Meat from three of the six horses found to contain the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone, known as bute, has been sold and eaten, while meat from the second three has been recalled. Mr Potter said he bought ponies, thoroughbreds and riding stable horses that are old or injured. ‘People come to us to dispose of their horses because they feel we do it very well,’ he said. ‘We wish to produce meat that is wholesome, nutritious, good value and, most importantly, safe. ‘We firmly believe that the humane destruction of horses for the human food chain has an important role to play in ensuring horse welfare, as otherwise unwanted horses would be left to enter a downward spiral to neglect.’ The details have triggered a fierce political row, with Labour accusing the government of ‘catastrophic complacency’ in its handling of the horsemeat scandal. Grisly: LJ Potter of Taunton kills 63 horses a week using this method, with the carcasses shipped to France for food. The business is run by Stephen Potter, pictured. This is a file picture . Labour’s Shadow Environment Secretary, Mary Creagh, warned ministers of the danger of bute contamination on January  24, however horses containing the drug continued to be slaughtered and exported for food. It was not until this week that a new regime, which stops horsemeat being sold until tests show it is negative for bute, was introduced. She challenged food minister David Heath in the Commons yesterday, saying: ‘We must make sure horsemeat intended for humans is not contaminated with bute, it really is as simple as that. ‘So why did you not act immediately when I raised this issue three weeks ago in this House?’ She added: ‘It’s astonishing. We were in the middle of a horsemeat adulteration scandal, this is just catastrophic complacency from you.’ Mr Heath said the government is working with the French authorities to track the British horse carcasses killed at Mr Potter’s abattoir. He also insisted that Britain is leading the way in getting European co-operation to track down the criminals responsible for the scandal. Slaughterer: Mr Potter, pictured, said he sells his horsemeat through 50 butchers in the Calais area. This is a file picture . ‘We have probably the biggest investigation that has ever been conducted across Europe into criminal behaviour, going on at the instigation of this Government,’ said Mr Heath. He described Britain’s role as a ‘quite remarkable achievement in a very short time’. Throughout the crisis, ministers have argued the horsemeat contamination is a matter of food fraud rather than a health risk. News that British horses containing bute have entered the food chain suggests these were premature. In theory, high doses, far more than would be present in a horsemeat burger, can induce blood disorders, including aplastic anaemia. This means the bone marrow stops making enough red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets for the body, putting people at risk of life-threatening infections. However, the Government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, yesterday insisted any risk to consumers is small. ‘Horsemeat containing phenylbutazone – bute- presents a very low risk to human health,’ she said.

She challenged food minister David Heath, left, in the Commons yesterday . ‘At the levels of bute that have been found, a person would have to eat 500 - 600 one hundred per cent horsemeat burgers a day to get close to consuming a human’s daily dose. And it passes through the system fairly quickly, so it is unlikely to build up in our bodies. ‘In patients who have been taking phenylbutazone as a medicine there can be serious side effects but these are rare. It is extremely unlikely that anyone who has eaten horse meat containing bute will experience one of these side effects.’ Mr Potter did not respond to calls asking about his methods and where the six horses were sent in France. Speaking in 2007, he defended what he does, saying: ‘We will all be old at some point and may spend our later years in great discomfort, horses are the same. ‘The horses are handled in a stress-free manner, by professional people and despatched with the minimum of fuss. None of us could ask for anything better than that.’ A Yorkshire abattoir owner, Peter Boddy, has been accused of providing horses to a factory in Wales where they were passed off a beef and turned into burgers and kebabs. Mr Boddy is contracted to remove fatally injured horses from racecourses, including Aintree and the Grand National. Yesterday, the racing authorities said measures are in place to ensure horses killed on the track cannot be sold for food.","LJ Potter of Taunton kills 63 horses a week .

Popular: Rosie Whitaker, who once performed at London's Royal Opera House, was a 'popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents' A distraught family are calling for a ban on anorexia and suicide websites following the death of their daughter. Her family believe Monday night’s tragedy came from reading and writing on websites where girls idealise slim celebrities such as Kate Moss, while describing how they cut themselves and contemplate taking their own lives. In a blog, Rosie, a talented ballet dancer, spoke of her struggles with bulimia, her compulsion to slash herself with a razor blade and plans to kill herself. Callous strangers responded by telling the clearly underweight girl she was fat and urging her to commit suicide. In April, Rosie wrote: ‘This girl just told me to go kill myself. I don’t even know what to do. I’m sitting here crying my eyes out, praying that the people around me will be okay. ‘Praying that I won’t pick up a blade. I just don’t understand how someone could say that, say that to someone who has been planning their suicide for almost 3 weeks.’ On Monday night – a couple of hours after writing on her blog ‘I’m so f****** sorry’ – the teenager appears to have carried out her plan to end her life. She was pronounced dead on the rail line close to her home in Beckenham, south-east London, after being hit by the Victoria to Ramsgate train. The tragedy, and Rosie’s family’s planned campaign against the offending websites, will add to concern about online communities that encourage vulnerable youngsters to starve themselves and take their own lives. Dr Alice Cole-King, a psychiatrist, said: ‘There is a growing body of evidence that vulnerable and distressed people can be unduly influenced by suicide and self-harm promoting websites.’ Rosie’s family issued a statement yesterday saying: ‘She was a popular, beautiful girl who brought joy to everyone through her various talents, including dancing and performing at the Royal Opera House, diving, writing poetry and piano playing. ‘For most of her life, she was very happy and planned to follow a career in which she would help others. ‘She was a well-balanced and well-loved young lady who had everything to live for. Tributes: Friends of Rosie left flowers and notes at Beckenham Station in tribute to the schoolgirl . You'll never be forgotten: One of Rosie's friends left a note expressing her sadness at the schoolgirl's death . ‘However, during a period of stress . brought on by the pressures of conforming to her peer group and studying . hard for GCSE exams, it appears she was, unfortunately, heavily . influenced by websites and online communities promoting self-harm and . suicide. ‘We hope her tragic death serves as a . warning to other impressionable youngsters and their parents that such . sites pose grave risks.’ A British Transport Police spokesman . said Rosie’s parents were planning to launch a campaign against suicide . and self-harming websites. ‘The websites she was looking at are things we will be examining as we compile a report for the coroner,’ he added. According to her blog, Rosie, who was . an army cadet, had been plagued by thoughts of death, and false beliefs . that she was fat and unattractive. It appears she had given up her habit . of obsessively cutting herself with a razor blade, but an apparent . relationship break-up seems to have tipped her over the edge. She also repeatedly referred to her weight and starvation attempts. Rosie posted numerous photographs of . excessively thin models – some distorted to make the women even more . skeletal than in reality – and others of arms slashed by a razor blade. She spoke of having obvious wounds she had to hide from her mother. In the heading of her blog are the . words ‘And then she broke’, beneath which she declared: ‘Rosie, 15, . London. Recovering. I have a s*** blog and everything . is just s***.’ Rosie's dancing achievements had included performing at London's prestigious Royal Opera House . Following her death, a friend wrote on the front page of her blog: ‘Unfortunately Rosie passed away on June 11 2012.’ ‘Rosie was a very talented student who excelled at music, diving, dance and creative writing. ‘She was an inspiration to those who . taught her as well as those who learned with her. More importantly, she . was much loved by students as well as staff. ‘Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this very difficult time.’ Friends of Rosie and others left . tributes to her on memorial pages online, with close friend Bryony Wilde . writing: ‘You are at peace now, and I will remember every single moment . I spent with you when you filled my life with happiness. ‘You are a kind, clever, amazing, talented, sweet girl and I will never forget you. Rest in peace, baby, remember, I love you.’ This article has been amended to make clear that the statement came from Rosie's family, not just her parents, and to remove photographs of Rosie and comments from her blog following representation from her family.","Rosie Whitaker described as a 'popular, beautiful girl'

Nicolas Sarkozy is facing ridicule after falsely claiming he visited Japan’s devastated Fukushima nuclear plant. He told a presidential election rally that he went to the plant crippled by last year’s earthquake and tsunami. But although he was the first Western leader to visit Japan after the tragedy, Mr Sarkozy never left Tokyo. He told 5,000 supporters in Normandy: ‘I went to Fukushima…and unlike Francois Hollande, I can tell you the disaster was caused by the 42metre wave from a tsunami.

Old Etonian Lewis stars in the Homeland series made by Mr Murdoch's production company fox21. A spokesman for the mayor's office said he could not comment on a 'private engagement'. The office's stance has angered politicians who say the mayor should be transparent about who he sees. Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group . at the London Assembly, told The Guardian it was 'ludicrous' that Mr Johnson believes he can meet Mr Murdoch in a private capacity. Dinner date: Actor Damian Lewis, pictured at the 24th Annual Producers Guild Awards held at The Beverly Hilton Hotel with Helen McCrory, was also reported to have attended the dinner . He told the newspaper: 'He is the Mayor of London and has a duty to uphold the highest . standards. 'Does he really think meeting for a private dinner with Rupert Murdoch is a normal meeting? What planet does he live on?' The mayor is seen as a future . challenger to David Cameron's leadership of the Conservatives party and . the recent meeting will fuel speculation of a closer relationship . between him and the media mogul. Johnson was swamped by media at the Conservative Party Conference last year . Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group of the London Assembly, said Johnson should be transparent about his meetings . The pressure group Hacked Off, which is campaigning for new press laws, also criticised the mayor. A spokesman told the MailOnline: 'After the revelations unearthed during Leveson, you might think that senior politicians had learned their lesson about holding secret assignations with newspaper bosses. Yet it appears that Boris Johnson just doesn't get it. 'It beggars belief that anyone could describe a dinner between the most powerful politician in London and the head of News Corporation, the company at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal, as a ""private arrangement"". 'The mayor is also the chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority and it is totally inappropriate for him to be meeting Mr Murdoch in private while the Met are carrying out an investigation into Murdoch companies. 'We urge all politicians to comply with the Leveson recommendations and publish full and up-to-date accounts of their meetings with media proprietors and editors. Given their past record of excessive closeness, and all the harm it has done, that is the very least the public can expect from those who represent them.' The alleged dinner is the second time the pair have met in recent months. Mr Johnson invited Mr Murdoch and his wife . Wendi Deng to watch Rebecca Adlington in the 800m final during London . 2012 as his personal guests. Labour MP Chris . Bryant told The Guardian that the relationship between Mr Johnson and Mr Murdoch has something 'decidedly unseemly' about it.

Barry Coleman suffered a broken back and ribs in the horrifying accident which happened as he took a nocturnal walkabout at his home in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. The shop worker, who suffered severe memory loss after blood clots formed on his brain, decided to take action to prevent a repeat of the fall that nearly killed him. Precautions: Serial sleepwalker Barry Coleman from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, has fitted a baby gate to the top of his stairs after nearly dying when he fell down them . Injuries: The fall, which happened as he slept walked, left Mr Coleman with a broken back, ribs, arms and thumbs. He also suffered from blood clots in his brain which left him with memory loss . Injuries: He was fitted with a head and neck brace following the fall due to the severity of his injuries . Mr Coleman has been helped to make a full recovery by his wife Valerie, and the couple now plan to renew their wedding vows for their 25th wedding anniversary. He has slept walked all his life but this accident is the worst he has suffered. Mrs Coleman said: 'I was really tired and I'd turned off all the lights in the house, whereas normally I leave a couple on. Barry fell asleep in his chair and then must have come up to bed later. Close: Mr Coleman's recovery has been aided by his wife Valerie . 'When he started sleepwalking he must have been really disorientated and fell down the stairs. 'I knew immediately what had happened and when I first saw him at the bottom of the stairs I thought I'd lost him.' Mr Coleman was treated at the scene before being taken to hospital, where he was fitted with a head brace and a neck collar - which he hopes will be removed in a couple of months.

The man who woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 with no memory of his past life, is facing suspicion from doctors and those who knew him before his amnesia. Michael Boatwright was discovered unconscious in a Motel 6 room in February, but when he awoke he could not remember anything about himself, recognize even his own reflection, nor how to speak English. When he woke up he believed he was Johan Ek and only spoke in Swedish, a persona that clashes with his Social Security card, passport and the veteran's medical card he was carrying. Faking it? More friends have come forward saying they knew Boatwright before his amnesia, and they're not buying the story . Who is Michael Boatwright? The man above woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 with no memory of his past life -  only speaking Swedish and responding to 'Johan Ek' Doctors at Desert Regional Medical Center diagnosed Boatwright on March 13 as having transient global amnesia, but experts say there is no way to prove if he actually suffers from the disorder. Skeptical: Gifford Searls knew Boatwright back in China, and helped the man get back to the U.S. before his visa expired. He's not sure if the amnesia is real . But more is coming to light about Boatwright's life just prior to losing his memory. Gifford Searls met Boatwright in the first half of 2012 when they were both working as teachers in Zhuhai, China. Searls works at United International College, and Boatwright was then an English teacher at the TPR English school. They both loved tennis,  and often met up to play on weekends. Searls says Boatwright was a very good tennis player, spoke flawless English and seemed to be healthy. He says everyone found Boatwright to be an 'affable, energetic guy' and didn't seem to show any signs of past trauma - something doctors say sets off the amnesia. 'There was no inkling of any deep personal issues. He never talked about money. He didn't talk much about his past life,' Searls told The Desert Sun. 'And then there was this one Friday night where I get a phone call.' Boatwright was in trouble. All Searls could make out over the phone was his friend whispering for help. So he showed up at Boatwright's home with his wife and two other friends and found that the man they knew was living in a 'hovel' - a single-room basement apartment that had no bathroom. Boatwright was inside and unconscious with a glass of vodka and half a vial of animal tranquilizers next to him. He was rushed to the hospital and treated, eventually being released into his friend's care. During his time at Searls' house, Boatwright talked about his ex-wife in Japan, and how he had been 'cut off' from their son. Baffling: Michael Boatwright is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son . Boatwright admitted that he couldn't go back to his job at the school and didn't know where to go next - his visa was set to expire. The TPN English school confirmed that Boatwright  quit in January and that he had an ex-wife in Japan. So Searls came up with an idea to send Boatwright to Palm Springs, California to look for a job as a tennis instructor. He had contacts at a local Marriott where Boatwright could try and get a job. Searls paid for Boatwright's one-way flight and gave his friend $400 to start a new life. Lost: A picture of Boatwright in China failed to jog his memory . Boatwright left China on February 24, the last day of his visa, and that was the last time that Searls heard from his friend. Searls' experiences with Boatwright just before he lost his memory shed light on what might have caused the man to subconsciously - or consciously - erase his old life. Doctors say there's no way to prove whether Boatwright actually suffers from amnesia, or if it's something he's making up. According to James Brandt, the director of the Division of Medical Psychology at Johns Hopkins University, only a few of these cases happen a year and they are almost always met with doubt. Relief: Michael Boatwright uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss . He believes Boatwright suffers from a psychological disorder called 'dissociative amnesia' which causes memory loss when a patient tries to block off a portion of their brain to protect themselves from painful memories. Skills can be lost as well as languages and Brandt says the memory loss can last months to years. As doctors 'aren't mind readers' there's no way to no for sure what's going on with Boatwright. 'We just don't know how conscious this is,' Brandt said. 'And unless the person suddenly comes to you and confesses - and says, ""I've just been playing you like a song. I've been faking it all along"" - unless they say that, you never really know how conscious it is.' Speaking Swedish: Members of the Swedish community in Palm Springs believe that Boatwright lived in Sweden in the mid-80s . Searls for one, doesn't believe that Boatwright lost his memory. 'I just think here is a guy that has no place to go, is desperate and is broke. If he does this, at least he has a bed and three meals a day,' Searls said. 'He's reached the end of his line. But that's just a personal perception.' The Swedish-American community in Palm Springs also finds aspects of 'Johan Ek' questionable. They've been helping him adjust to his new reality at the Vasa Order of America's Desert Viking Lodge. After five months of trying to dupe him into speaking English, he hasn't slipped once said his social worker Lisa Hunt-Vasquez. One . of Boatwright's friends at the Vasa Order, Viola Wyler, does believe . that Boatwright lived in Sweden during the mid-1980s, but he doesn't . speak with a regional accent which is strange. Wyler says this could be because he learned the language later in life, or hasn't used it much during his adult life. Speaking through a translator with The Desert Sun, Boatwright assures that his amnesia is real, and a living hell. 'Walk in my shoes for one day,' he said. 'You'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime.'","Michael Boatwright woke up in a Palm Springs Motel 6 in February with no memory of his past life .

"By . Eddie Wrenn . UPDATED: . 13:02 EST, 30 May 2012 . Bolivia's glaciers are melting - much faster than first predicted, and the blame is falling on airborne aerosol particles. The Chacaltaya glacier made its slow trek down the Cordillera Real Mountains for 18,000 years. By 2009 the glacier in southern America had gone, and even that was sooner than expected for researchers, who estimated in the 1990s that it would survive into 2015. Now researcher Franceso Zaratti, from the Higher University of San Andres, suggests that aerosol particles are landing on the glaciers and speeding up their demise. The Andes in Bolivia are losing their glaciers, which date back tens of thousands of years, at a rate which is astonishing scientists . He said: 'The phenomenon that we believe contributes more and that we are going to measure, is airborne aerosol particles that deposit on the glaciers and in turn increase their capacity to absorb energy and solar radiation.' Most atmospheric aerosol particles are produced by natural processes such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires. But man-made chemicals through industry, mass transportation and agriculture, as well as smog from nearby cities such as La Paz and El Alto are thought to be contributing. The researchers are now investigating the area to test their theories. Zaratti said: 'The most attractive thing of Chacaltaya is the altitude; I mean we're at 5,200 meters. 'At this altitude we are at what is believed to be a free and clean atmosphere.' The glaciers are important to the area, providing water for the millions of people who live in La Paz and El Alto. But the glaciers are expected to disappear between 2035 and 2045. The scientists expect to show that aerosol particles are settling in the glaciers, increasing their capacity to absorb energy and solar radiation which in turn, causes the glaciers to melt faster. They said by sharing this information they hope to provide answers to similar questions being posed by scientists around the world. However, while the Bolivian mountains are losing their glaciers faster than expected, the Himalayan glaciers are melting far more slowly than predicted, according to a satellite study in February from the University of Colorado Boulder. Previous estimates of ice loss in the high Asia mountains ranged up to 50 billion tons a year, said the university's Professor John Wahr. The actual figure is a mere four billion tonnes, according to a survey using data from Nasa satellites. Previously, it had been claimed that Himalayan glaciers would have melted to a fifth of current levels by 2035, leading to sea level rises and drought. Those predictions used ground-based measurements, whereas the new study measured the effect of gravity on twin Nasa satellites to give an accurate measure of the mass of ice being lost. ‘The results in this region really were a surprise,’ said Wahr. ‘One possible explanation is that previous estimates were based on measurements taken primarily from some of the lower, more accessible glaciers in Asia and were extrapolated to infer the behavior of higher glaciers. 'But unlike the lower glaciers, many of the high glaciers would still be too cold to lose mass, even in the presence of atmospheric warming. ‘What is still not clear is how these rates of melt may increase and how rapidly glaciers may shrink in the coming decades,’ said Professor Pfeffer. ‘That makes it hard to project into the future.’","Particles settle in glaciers, increasing capacity to absorb solar radiation .

You may want to make sure you  have an umbrella, some warm clothing – and an indoor option. The cold and wet weather is set to last into June, forecasters have warned, and it’s threatening to rain on the royal parade up and down the country. Yesterday, as snow fell as far south as the Midlands and the bitterly cold May weather continued to disappoint, fears were raised of a washout for the Jubilee next month, when 1.5million wellwishers will turn out to see the Queen and millions more will take part in street parties. Mayday: Walkers faced snow on the moors above Teesdale in County Durham yesterday . What a catch: Hailstones fell in London yesterday afternoon due to the unseasonably cold weather . As Her Majesty continues her 4,000  mile tour across the UK on the first weekend of June, it is likely to be cloudy, with heavy rain and below average temperatures in the south. Street parties could be ruined by the weather and motorists have been warned to expect traffic chaos over the four-day weekend, with more than eight million expected to hit the roads on June 1. And it means there is little prospect of respite from the current grey skies and chilly weather, which led to snow showers in Teesdale in County Durham and parts of Wolverhampton yesterday. An intense burst of chilly air from the Arctic was blamed for the unseasonable weather, as temperatures plummeted to just 1c (34f) overnight. Elsewhere yesterday, heavy rain flooded roads in Cambridgeshire, stormy seas soaked walkers on the promenade in Scarborough, North Yorkshire and hail pelted large areas of London. Chilly: Cold northerly winds brought in wintry showers to higher ground, including the Pennines, Shropshire, parts of Wales and Scotland . Wintery: Pedestrians in Birmingham were left hoping their umbrellas could cope as the season's poor weather continued with a hail storm hitting the city . A woman in her 50s was left fighting  for her life with serious head injuries after she was crushed by a metal fence which blew down in strong winds in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, at around lunchtime.  Witnesses saw a huge gust of wind rip the fence from its hinges and on to shoppers. Temperatures reached highs  of just 12c (54f) during the  day, though they are predicted  to pick up towards the end of the week. While snow does regularly fall in May in Scotland and high ground areas such as the Pennines, it is fairly unusual to see it dusting areas of lower ground. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘We saw sleet and snow showers around eight or nine o’clock in the morning in north-east England and the north-west Midlands, coming in from the  Arctic and Scandinavia. ‘They were very intense showers and cold air, so the snow hit low ground areas, but it quickly melted and we are expecting dry weather on Wednesday, though still chilly. ‘Temperatures should pick up  to around average by Friday or Saturday at around 16c (61f) in the south.’ Cold northerly winds also brought wintry showers to higher ground, including the Pennines, Shropshire, parts of Wales and Scotland. University lecturer Neil Farrington, 41, was walking his dogs in Castleside, near Consett, County Durham, when the snow fell yesterday. The father of three said: ‘It lasted for 20 minutes and it came down quite heavily with big flakes. ‘It was quite a sight to behold, then it turned to rain and the snow on the ground disappeared. My oldest son was supposed to be playing cricket tonight so he was not best pleased.’ Lovely weather: The tennis courts at Alderley Edge Cricket Club in Cheshire were well and truly out of use as wintery weather saw hail and sleet settling on the playing surface . Cold: Hail and sleet cover the ground near Alderley Edge Cricket Club in Cheshire on Tuesday afternoon as cold weather gripped the country and summer remained on hold . Unseasonal: The cricket season will have to be delayed looking at the amount of sleet and hail that has settled on the pitch at Alderley Edge Cricket Club in Cheshire . Chris Burton, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said:  'It is late to snow and it has happened because northerly winds brought colder air down from the Arctic and Scandinavia. 'We have showers that can turn wintry on higher ground.' Meanwhile in the south, floods swamped roads in Essex and Cambridgeshire. Drivers have been taking a risk by driving through flooded country roads to avoid a 27-mile detour to reach the village of Welney in the Cambridgeshire Fens. The road across Welney Washes was closed for the first time in two years and the only other way into the village means a long drive through narrow country lanes.

Spectrum in the sky: A rainbow forms over Swansea Bay in south Wales yesterday morning . Dennis Birch, who runs The Lamb and Flag pub in Welney, said: 'It's a 27-mile detour to reach us without going through the floods which adds an extra hour to people's journeys and they have to use more petrol. 'The floods make it difficult for us as we rely on passing trade.' Forecasters warn Britain will be hit by the latest cold snap this week for up to a month. Many parts of the country are facing several weeks worth of night-time frost, freezing winds, hail and heavy rain. A jet stream over Europe is stopping warm air arriving from the Continent and causing arctic conditions to blow across the country. The north of the country will be the worst hit as temperatures plummet to -6C with snow expected across the Pennines and Cumbria while the south faces days of rain and blustery winds. Jonathan Powell, forecaster with Vantage Weather Services, said: 'It looks like this is going to continue well into June. Summer is really on hold, with no sign of it in the near future. 'Temperatures are well below where they should be for the time of year and snow, ice and conditions more akin to the middle of November are going to stick around into the first two weeks in June. Unexpected: A man in Birmingham with his collar turned up against the chilly weather leaves tracks in the freshly fallen hail which hit the city's streets on Tuesday . 'We are in for a very wet, cool and miserable time, with no sign of summer on the way.” The Met office said the brief warm spell over the weekend was down to an area of high pressure which drifted over the UK but has now been replaced by northerly air from Scandinavia and northern Europe. Showers are expected to have hit all parts of the country by Thursday and to continue well into June. It comes in stark contrast to scenes around the UK at the weekend as Britons made the most of the nice weather, heading to local beaches and parks.

And with around 252 million domain names registered across the internet, they're set to get more outlandish. Wacky spellings, portmanteau words and inexplicable suffixes like 'ify' or 'sy' (think Spotify and Huntsy) abound in the quest to find an unclaimed URL. In this era, when every business must have an online presence, the quest to obtain a short, memorable dot-com web address is chief. What's next: Yext is short, catchy and not a real word - therefore a perfect start-up name, while the founder of Shodogg, a screen sharing platform, felt that Showdog lacked personality . Name game: Flickr was so named because its founders couldn't afford to buy Flicker.com from its owner . But that's no mean feat when there are so many million domain names currently registered across the . Internet. The solution? Inventing words to register your domain name and avoid paying millions for a properly-spelled, concise URL. As an example, the rights to the URL investing.com sold for about $2.5 million last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. Start-ups, by their nature, are usually big on ideas but low on funds. One now-established business that faced a financial challenge when finding a name is Tumblr. The original: Yahoo is now buying blogging platform and fellow oddly-named business Tumblr for $1.1 billion cash, announced CEO Marissa Mayer in May . Growing: Since its launch in New York City, Thrillist has grown into 20 other markets around the U.S. When Caterina Fake and Stewart . Butterfield had the idea for a photo-sharing site in 2004, they decided . to call it Flicker, but the domain name was taken and the owner refused . to sell it to them. They settled for Flickr and the rest is history. The . Wall Street Journal reports that Twitter was originally Twttr in 2006 - . the domain name for Twitter.com was taken and the company's co-founder . Biz Stone didn't think they could afford to buy it. 'We . assumed it would be too expensive,' he told the Wall St Journal. Soon . enough, though, Twttr took off, and the company was able to 'buy the . vowels'. One . mathematically-minded Australian entrepreneur was trying to come up with . a name for his data-science consulting business and finding the options . slim. So Anthony Goldbloom, . 30, wrote an algorithm to generate all the pronounceable combinations . of letters, three syllables or fewer, whose dot-com addresses weren't . already claimed. 'I was too frugal to want to pay for an [existing] domain name,' he told the Wall Street Journal. He got 700 options out of his algorithm and was tossing up between . Sumble and Kaggle when a poll of friends and family overwhelmingly voted . for Kaggle. Goldbloom could . now afford a much more conventional name - Kaggle has been backed by a . number of Silicon Valley investors, and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin is . its chairman - but with that kind of success, why would he want to? Portmanteau: Mibblio, a sing-along story book company, is a mixture of 'music' and the Latin word for book 'biblio' Game changr: Tumblr's misspelling has become part of its cache . The naming of start-ups and products is such big business that companies exist solely for the purpose of finding the perfect name. Steve Manning, founder and presumably name-designator of Igor, a name-consulting business, says today's start-ups are going the wrong way about choosing their business names. 'The primary driver for start-up naming right now is the misguided mission to find the shortest possible, pronounceable [unclaimed] dot-com address,' Manning told the Wall Street Journal. He says short URLs aren't the be-all and end-all and that start-ups are underestimating their potential customers if they assume people won't respond to a longer business name and website. Nancy Friedman, a name and tagline developer, agrees. 'A short name isn’t always the best name,' she writes at her blog Fritinancy. 'Your URL doesn’t have to be your name: The web address of Open, a design agency in Manhattan, is notclosed.com. And alternatives to .com abound - .us, .ca, and the many country-code domains that can be employed in creative ways.' Bought vowels: The San Francisco offices of Twitter are well-appointed now, but when it first launched as Twttr, the social media company couldn't afford to buy its vowels . Friedman also points out that 'quirky' names aren't a recent phenomenon. You only have to walk down the processed snack-food aisle at the supermarket to see that start-ups don't have a monopoly on crazy names (think Cheez-Its, Poptarts, Lunchables, or Krispy Kreme). Nevertheless, in the challenge to come up with a short name that conveys meaning, and is easy to pronounce and logical to spell, start-ups are certainly the leading the kooky-name pack. Mashable's tips for founders naming their start-ups advises the use of prefixes and suffixes, as in bitly, Spotify and Rootsy, creating compound words or portmanteaus, like Facebook, Foursquare and Thrillist. Or, simply misspell a word, as Tumblr, Digg and Reddit all have. If that all fails? Make something up - think Yipit and Yobongo. Mashable recommends using lots of vowels to add rhythm to the name. Or, just ask Kaggle if you can borrow his algorithm.","Start-ups are becoming known for their quirky names .

Fossilised turtle shells plucked from a Polish rubbish dump have been judged to be the oldest and most complete palaeontologists have yet discovered. Dating back 215million years, experts say the shells could provide invaluable clues in solving the riddle of the origin of this ancient reptile which is venerated by cultures across the globe. 'I'd say my guardian angel led me here,' said Tomasz Sulej, the palaeobiologist who made the discovery. Ancient: A fossil of one of the world's oldest-known turtle shells with a limb bone dating from 215million years ago, discovered in clay deposit in a rubbish dump north-west of Krakow, Poland . His investigation was led by a hunch that inspired him to poke around a landfill near the town of Poreba - in a region known as the Polish Jurassic Highland - in September 2008. Euphoria came after just 15 minutes as he unearthed a prized turtle fossil, which recent tests have now confirmed to be the oldest found so far anywhere in the world. The prestigious Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology and National Geographic Polska recently published details of the discovery. 'Late-Triassic turtle fossils are extremely rare. There are around eight spots on Earth where you might find them, and here in Poland we’ve unearthed the oldest and most extensive collection,' Dr Sulej told AFP. 'Finding something that has been in the mud for 215million years, it’s like bringing it back to life,' he added. 'I'd say my guardian angel led me here': Palaeobiologist Tomasz Sulej says he was led to the site by a hunch and unearthed the fossil after just 15 minutes hunting . The bright yellow spokes on the shell of a Radiated Tortoise native to Madagascar catch the eye of school children visiting the Warsaw Zoo. 'They’re like army tanks with their heavy armour!' exclaims 12-year-old Wojtek. But the shells that have afforded turtles protection from predators for aeons are no match for humans. Hunted for meat, traditional medicine or caught in the illegal pet trade, this species could become extinct during Wojtek’s lifetime. About half of the globe’s 328 recognised species of fresh water and marine turtles and land-faring tortoises could vanish in the coming decades, according to the Turtle Conservation Coalition. 'After being here for a couple hundred million years, dozens of species of turtles are now on the verge of extinction, quite simply due to being captured or eaten on an unprecedented scale, particularly in Asia,' says Mariusz Lech, reptile keeper at the zoo. Known to live up to 130 years, these ancient creatures carry deep meaning as primordial symbols of longevity, stability, security and wisdom and feature in creation myths from India to native North America. Yet their future seems bleak. 'Being realistic about the modern-day threats they face, especially in south-east Asia, China, the Philippines, Indonesia or Madagascar, turtles are disappearing fast,' Lech warned. 'Some species could vanish within 20 years if radical steps aren’t taken to protect them now.' While turtle fossils of a similar age . were also discovered in Germany, the Polish find includes shells, along . with neck and tail vertebrae, as well as limb bones that are unique. 'We’ve discovered two species, including one which is unknown,' Dr Sulej said. His . team have identified a Proterochersis-type turtle similar to a single . Proterochersis robusta fossil found in Germany, while another appears to . be of a smaller, as yet unknown species. This . region’s picturesque, craggy countryside, shaped during the Jurassic . era and known for vast nearby coal reserves, has proven to be a . prehistoric treasure trove. Dr Sulej’s discovery came on the heels of a new 200million-year-old dinosaur species unearthed in nearby Lisowice in 2006-7. It was christened the Smok Wawelski - Wawel Dragon - after a fabled fire-breathing dragon, whose rumoured lair was in a cave at the foot of Krakow’s 14th century Wawel Castle. Other digs in the area have turned up several hundred fossils from six species including turtles, sharks, scaled fish and dinosaurs. Now, Dr Sulej says his mission is to find a turtle skull. Though fossils carry no organic material for DNA testing, their structures hold precious clues to the origins of species. 'Each new turtle fossil is invaluable as it could provide clues to their origin, which up to now has been a bit of a mystery,' he said. These most ancient of creatures are thought to have evolved from Procolophons, a type of parareptile living in the Permian period up to 300million years ago. The Odontochelys semitestace, a 2008 find in China dating back 220million years has also been classed by experts as a turtle ancestor, which like them had a belly shell, but unlike them had teeth and no full top shell. DNA tests on modern-day turtles suggest they may be related to crocodiles, according to Dr Sulej. Adding to the intrigue, Procolophons are not thought to be related to crocs, he said.","Tests show the shells date back 215million years to the Triassic era .

Germany has branded France ‘Europe’s biggest problem child’ in the escalating war of words between the two countries. The tit-for-tat name-calling comes as relations between Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Francois Hollande continue to deteriorate. Earlier this week a leaked French policy document described Mrs Merkel as ‘egotistical’ and said France’s socialist government – which opposes austerity – should engage in ‘democratic confrontation’ with her. The language was later toned down, but Mr Hollande was accused of using the sort of rhetoric that led the two countries to war. German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and France's President Francois Hollande are tangled up in a war of words, after leaked reports criticised their countries . The blistering report also estimated that France had a bleak financial outlook, as it had failed to fully invest in research and development. The continent's two biggest powers initially fell out when France's Socialist party called for 'democratic confrontation' with Germany, the Daily Telegraph reported. It also attacked German Chancellor Angela Merkel, accusing her of 'egotistical intransigence'. Those criticisms were leaked to the French media last week, accusing Mrs Merkel of thinking about 'nothing except the savings of account holders on the other side of the Rhine, Berlin's trade balance and her electoral future'. Gemran politicians rallied around the chancellor, highlighting just how tense relations are between the two powers. Europe's two biggest powers: The governments behind Angela Merkel and France's President Francois Hollande have written scathing reports . The row comes after Mrs Merkel, the . continent’s most powerful leader, insisted countries would be forced to . cede more sovereignty to rescue the troubled euro. Last week she warned that eurozone members had to be prepared to surrender authority to European institutions. Berlin is pushing for centralised controls of national budgets, and suggests that the EU's economics commissioner should be given more powers to police countries' economic policy decisions. Germany and other rich countries want more oversight and control of the budgetary decisions of poorer nations which they are having to bail out to keep the single currency together. Mrs Merkel also insists austerity and proper budgetary controls are critical to Europe’s economic future – a position which exacerbates her increasing conflict with Mr Hollande. The socialist leader is facing rows not only with his foreign counterparts, but his own people too,. He has become the most unpopular president in five decades, a new poll has revealed. Hiss personal approval rating has plunged to just 25 per cent of the population amid soaring unemployment and ballooning public debt. He is even more unpopular that President Charles de Gaulle was in 1968 - when millions of French rioted to demand a complete overhaul of French society.","Two powers in war of words as leaked reports attack the other .

Locked up: Kenneth Bae, who has been sentenced to 15 years of 'compulsory labour' by North Korea for unspecified crimes against the state . A Korean-American sentenced to 15 years hard labour in North Korea was a missionary who smuggled in inflammatory literature and trying to establish . a base for anti-Pyongyang activities at a border city hotel, the state's Supreme Court said. Kenneth Bae, 44, was sentenced earlier this month after being detained late last year leading a tour group in the North Korean city of Rason, on the border with China. North Korea delivered its most in-depth account yet of the case against Mr Bae today, but the long list of allegations included no statement from him, other than claims that he confessed and didn't want an attorney present during his sentencing last week for what Pyongyang called hostile acts against the state. Since the sentencing came during a period of tentative diplomatic moves following weeks of high tension and North Korean threats of nuclear and missile strikes on Washington and Seoul, outside analysts have said Pyongyang may be using Bae as bait to win diplomatic concessions in the standoff over its nuclear weapons program. North Korea repeated its denial of such speculation in the new statement, but the pattern has occurred repeatedly. The North's state media described the statement from an unidentified Supreme Court spokesman as a response to U.S. government and media assertions that the legal case against Bae was unreasonable and other claims 'that he was not tried in a transparent manner and (the North) was trying to use this issue as a political bargaining chip.' The spokesman said Bae could've faced death but the court reduced the penalty because he confessed. Bae, a Washington state resident described by friends as a devout Christian and a tour operator, is at least the sixth American detained in North Korea since 2009. The others eventually were deported or released without serving out their terms, some after trips to Pyongyang by prominent Americans, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. There has been no sign yet of a high-profile American envoy set to make a clemency mission to North Korea, which has only recently eased a near-daily, weekslong torrent of threats that followed greater U.N. sanctions over Pyongyang's February nuclear test. Tensions: The sentencing of Kenneth Bae will further complicate already strained relations between Pyongyang and Washington. North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un (3rd left) is pictured at a soccer match . The North's statement said Bae gave anti-Pyongyang lectures in China and 'infiltrated' about 250 students into the city of Rason, a special economic zone in North Korea's far northeastern region bordering China and Russia. It didn't elaborate on the students' activities, however. Young leader Kim Jong Un has the power to grant special pardons under the North's constitution. Earlier this week, former NBA star Dennis Rodman attempted to use his friendship with Kim on Bae's behalf, asking the leader to 'do me a solid' and release the American. Rodman visited North Korea in February and apparently hit it off with Kim, a die-hard basketball fan. Pyongyang hasn't responded to Rodman's appeal on Twitter. Rodman said after his trip to North Korea that he planned to return in August to vacation with Kim. Buds: Dennis Rodman, left, has called on North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, right, to release American prisoner Kenneth Bae (Mr Rodman with Kim Jong Un in February during his visit to North Korea) Social Media: The former NBA star took to Twitter to send an informal plea to the North Korean leader . The U.S. has called for the North to immediately release Bae. It relies on Swedish diplomats in Pyongyang to deal with Bae's case because the North and the U.S. have had no formal diplomatic relations since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce instead of a peace treaty. North Korea said in the statement that Bae 'set up plot-breeding bases in different places of China for the purpose of toppling (North Korea's) government from 2006 to October 2012 out of distrust and enmity toward the' country. 'He committed such hostile acts as egging citizens of (North Korea) overseas and foreigners on to perpetrate hostile acts to bring down its government while conducting a malignant smear campaign against it. He was caught red handed.' Award: Ri Kyong Sim, a traffic policewoman of a district branch of the Traffic Command Corps of the Pyongyang City People's Security Bureau receiving the coveted 'Hero of the Republic' award in Pyongyang . Speculation: The unusual award of a top medal for bravery to a North Korean traffic policewoman has fuelled speculation that she might have intervened in an incident that had threatened the life of leader Kim Jong-Un . North Korea refers to Bae as Pae Jun Ho, the North Korean spelling for his Korean name. North Korea has faced increasing international criticism over its weapons development. Six-nation disarmament talks involving the Koreas, the United States, Japan, China and Russia fell apart in 2009. Several rounds of U.N. sanctions have not encouraged the North to give up its small cache of nuclear devices, which Pyongyang says it must not only keep but expand to protect itself from a hostile Washington. Tensions have escalated since it conducted its third nuclear test since 2006 in February. The human rights group Amnesty International has criticized Bae's lack of access to a lawyer and called for his release. Friends and colleagues say Bae was based in the Chinese border city of Dalian and traveled frequently to North Korea to feed orphans.","Kenneth Bae, 44, was sentenced to 15 years hard labour earlier .

The vintage motor is said to have served the former British Prime Minister when he used it to give driving lessons to the first female MP, Lady Astor, on a Kent estate. Just like new: Classic car restorer Charlie Tope with the 1923 Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, once used by Sir Winston Churchill, which had been deteriorating in a garage for decades . Fit for the road again: The engine of the restored Rolls Royce, which was also used in TV show The Avengers and as a recovery truck during the Second World War . During the war years, its back end was cut off to convert it into a recovery truck with a mini crane bolted on to the chassis for the auxiliary fire and ambulance service in Manchester. And in the 1960s, the Rolls appeared in 18 episodes of the Avengers as the car of choice for English gentleman character John Steed. During the series, the classic car had a steak cooked on her engine and a ladder smashed through the windscreen. But after the show the Rolls was forgotten about - and sat deteriorating in a Sussex garage until earlier this year. Proud: Mr Tope has spent the last six months painstakingly restoring the classic car . Rich heritage: The car was apparently used by Sir Winston Churchill to give Britain's first female MP driving lessons in Kent .

Slain: Former SEAL Chris Kyle, seen here with wife Taya, was killed by a fellow soldier in February . Ventura claims .

In the book, Kyle claims he overheard 'scruff face' badmouthing the United States, then-President George W. Bush, and criticizing the Iraq War. Ventura, a former professional wrestler known as 'The Body' - who is well known for his criticism of the Bush Administration and for questioning details of the September 11, terror attacks - was never specifically named in the book, but Kyle later identified 'Scruff Face' as the former Minnesota governor in subsequent television interviews.

Wanted: Police are looking for Julio Acevedo, 44, in connection with the deaths of an expectant couple . Police today identified a man suspected of driving the car that smashed into a taxi carrying a pregnant woman and her husband, killing them, before fleeing the scene. Authorities are seeking Julio Acevedo, 44, who had a DWI arrest just two weeks ago and who has previously served eight years in prison for manslaughter, for the early-morning crash in Brooklyn on Sunday, police said. The crash claimed the lives of Nachman and Raizi Glauber, both 21, and although their baby was delivered by emergency caesarean section following the crash, he also died on Monday. The Glaubers were heading to hospital after Raizi, who was seven months pregnant, felt an unusual pain. But . the newborn boy died early on Monday, a day after the crash claimed . both of his parents, according to Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the . family's Orthodox Jewish community. Acevedo was going at least 60 mph when the BMW he was allegedly driving slammed into the cab carrying the couple to a hospital, police said. He has previously served eight years in prison on a manslaughter charge in a . shooting death, and violated parole once after, according to a state . department of correction spokeswoman. As well as the 1987 shooting in Brooklyn, his record includes a 1997 robbery in the Bronx, according to DNAinfo. When he was stopped by police last month for driving erratically, his blood alcohol level was far above the legal level at .13. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day without bail. Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died . 'We in the community are demanding that . the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this . couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a . statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even . bothering to check on the people of the other car.' A woman who identified herself at Acevedo's mother told the New York Daily News he would turn himself in on Monday. Nachman and Raizi were traveling in the . black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in . Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the . would-be parents. The Glaubers both were pronounced dead . at hospitals, and the medical examiner said they died of blunt-force . trauma. It's not clear if they were wearing seatbelts. The cause of the crash remained under . investigation on Monday. The driver of the BMW was expected at least to . face charges of leaving the scene of an accident. Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers . Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph . A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child . Police . initially believed the BMW driver had a passenger but now say he was . alone in the vehicle. A witness said the BMW passed by at a high rate of . speed before the accident. The . livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their . own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, . police said. The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash. This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong. In New York City, yellow taxis are . hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are . picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles. Missed: A person walks towards the graves of Nathan and Raizy Glauber at the Satmar Cemetery. In keeping with the Jewish tradition of holding a burial as soon as possible, they were buried on Sunday . Meanwhile, police said the registered . owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged . with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car. A person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, the person said. The tragedy comes after Raizi Glauber's father spoke of his agony at her emotional funeral, which was attended by more than 1,000 orthodox Jewish mourners, on Sunday afternoon in New York. 'God is punishing me for my sins by taking away my daughter,' Yitzchak Silberstein said in Yiddish. The impact from the t-bone smash sent . Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, . while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue . Nachman and the taxi driver. Both the Glaubers were pronounced dead at hospital. The . couple's child was born by C-Section at Bellevue Hospital in . Manhattan, and had been in critical condition before his tragic passing. Heartbroken: The Glaubers were mourned at an emotional funeral hours after their deaths on Sunday . Missed: The young Orthodox Jewish couple, both 21, both died of blunt force trauma from the crash . Mourning: Rabbi Zalman Teitelbau, leader of the Satmar Orthodox Jewish community, speaks during the funerals in Brooklyn on Sunday, surrounded by members of the community . Doctors had delivered the baby by cesarean section. Neighbors and friends said the boy weighed only about 4 pounds. Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the . city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by . extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries. Paramedic Yisroel Altman . said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but . their head injuries were just too much. 'I’ve . seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that . killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizi was . responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at . Bellevue. Jewish law calls for the burial of . the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev . Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn on Sunday to pay their respects to the . Glaubers. Tears: After the funeral began, a speaker sobbed uncontrollably, his voice choked with grief . Gathering: The services were in Brooklyn - home to the largest community of orthodox Jews outside Israel . A crowd of hasidic Jews gathered in front of the Brooklyn, New York, synagogue where funeral services were held Sunday . There will not be a similar funeral . for the baby boy; Hasidim do not perform funerals for newborns who do . not survive 30 days, according to Mendel Rosenberg, of Chesed Shel Emes. At the funeral Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, speaking in Yiddish, addressed the mourners. 'It's . a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum. 'We have to hold . on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a . very, very big tragedy.' Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News. 'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.' The young Jewish Orthodox couple were on the way to the labor ward when the tragic incident occurred . An Orthodox Jewish man walks past debris from the fatal accident . He . was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from . him how to treat a wife,' he said.

The . community has strict rules governing clothing, social customs and . interaction with the outside world. Men wear dark clothing that includes . a long coat and a fedora-type hat and often have long beards and ear . locks. Hundreds of members of the Satmar community gathered shoulder to . shoulder on the street outside, men in hats and women in shawls or head . coverings, nearly everyone in black.

The reality behind El Dorado, South America's mythical city of gold, will be revealed at a new exhibition of ancient art. Exhibits including ceremonial gold helmets and objects used during ritual drug taking will go on show at the British Museum. El Dorado, often misinterpreted as a mythical city of gold, actually referred to a ritual that took place at a lake near the modern day city of Bogota in Colombia where the new ruler of one of the native tribes was covered in powdered gold before diving into the water. All that glitters: This ancient Colombian mask was worn during funeral processions . Hardware: This helmet made from gold alloy comes from the Quimbayan tribe, who are noted for their spectacular gold work . Ornate: This poporo (left) is topped with human faces and was used for storage. The delicate plate represents a bird (right) The exhibition includes objects salvaged from the lake dating back to before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century. Among the objects on show are a gold and platinum container used to store lime powder which was mixed with coca leaves and chewed. Exhibition curator Elisenda Vila Llonch said the drug was valued because it 'gives you extra strength to work in high altitudes, in very cold climates and it suppresses hunger'. Style: The exhibition is a mixture of functional and decorative artefacts . Delicate: This pained cotton tapestry was made by the Muisca people . On the nose: This unusual plate is an articulated nose ornament made from gold alloy . Other objects include jewellery and gold masks worn during burial rituals. Museum director Neil MacGregor said: ""Ancient Colombia has long represented a great fascination to the outside world and yet there is very little understood about these unique and varied cultures. 'As part of the Museum's series of exhibitions that shine a light on little known and complex ancient societies this exhibition will give our visitors a glimpse into these fascinating cultures of pre-hispanic South America and a chance to explore the legend of El Dorado through these stunning objects.'

Designer Sassi Holford makes wedding dresses that are the stuff of fairy tales – she created Autumn Kelly’s gown for her marriage to Princess Anne’s son Peter Phillips. And her beautiful daughter Missie has the enviable job of modelling some of her fabulous work. Yet while Missie may look perfect dressed in princess-pink tulle and satin, life is far from easy for the 12-year-old. She suffers from a rare, incurable lung condition that has seen her hospitalised 32 times – 12 of which required intensive care. Incurable: Sassi Holford's daughter Missie, 12, has been hospitalised 32 times as a result of her lung condition which makes her vulnerable to infection . Missie has bronchiectasis, which causes the airways to become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus. This can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection and even a common cold could become life-threatening. Her first emergency is etched in her mother’s mind. ‘It was a warm day in July 2002, just after Missie’s second birthday, and we’d been picnicking in the countryside,’ says Sassi, who lives in Somerset with husband Martin, her business manager, and children Charles, 16, Missie and her twin brother Hugo, 12. ‘She was a normal, bouncy toddler, but within an hour of getting home she went limp, her lips turned blue and she was gasping to breathe. Martin and I drove her to Musgrove Hospital in Taunton.’ Missie was treated with intravenous antibiotics, oxygen and inhalers for what was believed to be a one-off virus. Model child: Missie modelled her mother's creations between treatments for her incurable illness to give her something to look forward to . Four days later she was discharged. But the family’s relief was short-lived. Three weeks later the same thing happened, and a further 15 hospital admissions followed in the next two years. Sassi, Martin and anyone who ever looked after Missie at home or school became adept at recognising the signs that she was going to be ill. ‘I was responsible for the livelihoods of 40 staff so I couldn’t just walk away from my business to be at home full-time, and we wanted Missie’s life to feel as normal as possible between episodes,’ says Sassi, whose other children do not suffer from the condition. ‘We made sure anyone who looked after her was fully briefed on her condition. SassI adds: ‘Before an episode, there would be a change in her demeanour. When she was well she had a good appetite and was energetic and always laughing. Before an attack, she’d become withdrawn and we’d spot tugging in her neck where her airways were straining, plus the familiar blue tinge to her lips. It was easier when she was four and she could say ‘‘doctor’’ if she felt poorly and ‘‘hospital’’ if she thought something serious was about to happen.’ Bronchiectasis can affect anyone at any age. An estimated one in 1,000 adults and one in 10,000 children in the UK have the condition. About 9,000 are admitted to hospital every year, and in 2010 there were 1,000 deaths with bronchiectasis an underlying factor. The lungs are full of tiny branching . airways, known as the bronchi, whose role is to move oxygen into even . smaller sacs called alveoli that transfer oxygen into the blood. Hospitalised: Missie aged seven during one of her dozens of hospital visits going through treatment for bronchiectasis . Professor Stephen Spiro, of the British Lung Foundation, says: ‘Bronchiectasis means that the airways dilate in the lung due to an infection which then causes the production of a lot of phlegm. This can trigger a vicious circle of mucus gathering in the bronchi, making them prone to infection and further widening them, leading to a build-up of more mucus. ‘It’s common in those with cystic fibrosis, but can also be caused by a previous childhood lung infection, or if a problem with the immune system has led to the bronchi becoming damaged due to infection.’ Any cold or virus could put Missie into a critical state. ‘Even going shopping, we risked her picking up a cold and very quickly her lungs would get infected and close down,’ says Sassi. The turning-point for Missie’s health was in 2007 when immunology specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital realised the weak link was in her immune system and that she has no resistance to pneumonia. ‘We were then able to prevent future attacks with the swift use of antibiotics when symptoms presented, regular pneumonia vaccinations, a steroid inhaler and daily physiotherapy sessions,’ says Sassi. Prof Spiro says physio is a key treatment for bronchiectasis and that although living with the condition can be distressing, the outlook for most sufferers is good. ‘It doesn’t disappear, but in most cases it’s possible to manage through medication and physiotherapy to strengthen and clear the lungs,’ he says. Missie’s condition began to stabilise in 2008 and she now loves to play netball, horse-ride and dance. ‘She hasn’t been hospitalised for four years,’ says Sassi. ‘She still uses an inhaler daily and holidays are planned with military precision to ensure medical care is nearby. But finally, I feel I can start to relax.’","Designer Sassi Holford's daughter suffers from bronchiectasis .

Fewer than one in four voters think Ed Miliband will be prime minister in 2015, according to a new poll. Just 22 per cent expect him to win the next election – the first in a series of unhappy findings for Mr Miliband after weeks of controversy over Labour’s links to the trades unions. To add to Mr Miliband’s woes, his business spokesman Chuka Umunna, tipped as a future Labour leader, was reported last night to have started seeing Tony Blair regularly. Bad reading: Only one in four people think Ed Miliband will be the next PM - rising star Chuka Umunna appears a more popular choice . ‘Chuka strikes Tony as very smart,’ said one close ally of the former prime minister. Lord Mandelson, another architect of New Labour, added of Mr Umunna: ‘He’s on a trajectory which could take him far.’ According to a ComRes poll for ITV News, the majority of the British public – 57 per cent – do not see Mr Miliband as an election winner. Twice as many – 42 per cent – agree that Labour would have a better chance in 2015 without him as the 20 per cent who disagree. With polls suggesting Britain may be on course for another hung parliament, 43 per cent said they would prefer another Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition to the 33 per cent who favour a Lib-Lab pact. Almost half of voters, some 46 per cent, say that Labour cannot be trusted to run the economy, a figure that is unchanged from last year and suggests the party has made no headway on the key issue. One crumb of comfort for Mr Miliband is that the public are slightly less likely to say that Labour would be more electable with David Miliband as its leader than they were last year. Some 31 per cent agree – down six points from last September. Mr Umunna, hyped as the UK’s answer to Barack Obama, is one of several figures tipped as successors to Mr Miliband, including home affairs spokesman Yvette Cooper. The Financial Times reported that having initially regarded Mr Umunna as too Left-wing, Mr Blair has started to see him regularly and believes he is ‘rising to the challenge’. Lord Mandelson added: ‘I think he defies the Left-Right description. He’s part of a generation that transcends those labels.’","Just 22 per cent of people expect him to win the next election .

Summer has arrived at last and sun-deprived Britons have been flocking to the country's beaches to bask in soaring temperatures after enduring weeks of soggy weather. But not everyone will be welcoming the respite from the rain. The sudden change in weather has come with an unfortunate side effect for hay fever sufferers - soaring pollen counts. The seemingly endless weeks of rain in the UK since spring have seen pollen-bearing grasses and weeds flourish. The tiny particles spread easily on humid days, and the current hot spell has seen an increase in the amount of pollen in the air. Heatwave: Brighton beach was swarmed with sunbathers yesterday, all eager to enjoy every minute of Britain's long awaited hot weather - but the rising temperatures come at a price for allergy sufferers . Lindsey McManus, from Allergy UK, said hay fever sufferers might see their symptoms flare up after the sudden change in weather. Tissues at the ready: The orange symbols on this map indicate high pollen counts over much of the UK . 'Because the weather has been so up and down people might be thinking they had got away with it,' she said, explaining that wet weather keeps levels of pollens that trigger hay fever lower. 'When it's warm weather, and it's a little bit breezy, (symptoms) are going to really kick in,' she said. 'Things like weeds and grasses and trees are all pollinated by the wind, and (the particles) are really small so winds carry them long distances.' Britain's estimated 16 million hay fever sufferers have already been warned that the chaotic weather could see the country's hay fever season last up to a month longer than usual. The season normally ends in July, but experts have said the freak weather could leave sufferers enduring sneezing fits, sore throats and watery eyes well into August. At the beginning of the month NHS Direct reported a 20 per cent increase in calls from hay fever sufferers during the early summer months compared to the same period in 2011. Patrick Sachon, health manager at the Met Office, said the settled, drier weather would be reflected in boosted pollen counts. 'The . unsettled weather this summer has led to a fluctuating pollen count but . as expected we have seen some very high levels when the weather has . been good,' he added. Making a splash: These young girls found respite from the scorching heat in a fountain in central London yesterday . Time for a dip: A young boy cools off in a fountain in London yesterday, as parts of Britain enjoyed hotter weather than Rio de Janeiro .

With people all over the country revelling in the glorious sunshine, it would be easy to forget that less than a fortnight ago large swathes of Britain remained on flood alert after persistent heavy downpours at the start of the month followed the wettest April to June period on record. Around 3,000 homes and businesses were flooded and people were swept to their deaths as Britain was battered by rain for weeks on end. The wet weather also saw roads closed off, cars marooned in flood water, and rivers bursting their banks. Even this month rainfall has hit 71.8mm, above the typical 69.6mm July average. What a difference: Less than two weeks ago Londoners were struggling to hold on to their umbrellas as they battled across Millenium Bridge in the wind and rain .

"By . Andrew Levy and Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 18:56 EST, 16 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:02 EST, 17 July 2013 . Children's academic ability could be tested as soon as they start primary school aged four or five under plans unveiled by Nick Clegg. Pupils are currently tested at seven to set a ‘baseline’ for measuring their progress in school. But details of plans to do this during reception year emerged in a consultation document launched by the Deputy Prime Minister, which also includes plans to rank primary school pupils against their peers across the country. Pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put in achievement 'bands' This would see primaries having to ensure 85 per cent of pupils are ready for senior school or risk triggering an Ofsted inspection. Pupils could also be ranked against their peers across the country, being put in 10 per cent achievement ‘bands’, showing, for example, if they are in the top 10 per cent. The consultation document contains a reference to a ‘new benchmark’ to assess ‘progress that has been made by 11-year-olds’. It says the ‘baseline’ test ‘could be at age seven, as now, where teachers assess pupils; or a simple check of a child’s ability in the early weeks of a child’s career at school’. Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg could be judged to be under-performing . Nick Clegg said today: 'All we’re saying is it can’t surely be right that under the current standards a school is deemed to be doing okay if four out of ten of the children who leave primary school are judged not to be ready to have a good start at secondary school. 'This is not to try and either humiliate or celebrate, it’s to give teachers and parents an idea of how that child measures up to other children in the school system. That’s all it is. 'I saw some comments from teaching unions this morning that somehow this was a lurch back to a name-and-shame approach, it’s not at all. 'So it’s higher standards, more money, and the aspiration, the hope is simply to make sure everybody gets the best possible start in life.' A source close to Mr Clegg added last night: ‘We are going to have new tests at 11 and we need to have a new baseline. ‘We are open-minded about whether you do it at seven or even earlier. It would be a teacher-led assessment.’ Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested last month that children should be tested in basic language and literacy even before they start formal education. He warned testing pupils at the end of their reception year was already too late, adding: ‘Children may have lost a vital year of learning by then.’ Currently just 60 per cent of 11-year-olds in a school are required to reach Level 4 in maths and English Sats – the standard expected of their age group. Schools that fail to increase this to 85 per cent by 2016 under the measures outlined by Mr Clegg yesterday could be judged to be under-performing. They could be taken over and turned into academies. The current marking system will also be axed, although its replacement has not been confirmed. The point at which children are judged to be on track to start secondary school will also be raised. At present, achieving Level 4C – the bottom third of the Level 4 pass range – is considered acceptable. Yet just 47 per cent of these children go on to get five good GCSEs, including maths and English. Mr Clegg confirmed the pupil premium – extra funding for disadvantaged pupils – is to increase from £900 to £1,300 in primary schools from next year to help improve standards. Around one in seven pupils qualify for the financial support. Critics have previously voiced concerns about pupils spending too much time preparing for tests instead of  learning at school. After taking national tests at seven, they sit more Sats in maths, English and science when they are 11. Some take their first GCSEs the following year and complete them when they are 16, making four sets of exams in ten years. AS-levels and A-levels bring the total to six in 12 years. Mr Clegg’s planned test would make it seven in 12 years. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ‘The problems with the tests at the end of primary school are well documented. ‘Most secondary schools re-test pupils at the start of Year 7 because they don’t trust the accuracy of data they have to work with. ‘A fairer, more accurate way of measuring pupils’ ability at the end of primary school is certainly needed. ‘I am not convinced ranking 11-year-olds will help to raise standards. I worry what will happen to those children who have tried hard yet are told they are in one of the bottom bands. ‘Children at that age mature differently and their confidence can be easily damaged. It could make secondary teachers’ job in building self-esteem and confidence even more difficult.’ Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers’ union NASUWT, said: ‘School level assessments are fine in principle but in the context of current high-stakes accountability, with no framework for support or provision of resources, the outcome is likely be a bureaucratic nightmare for teachers.’","Testing at aged seven could be moved to first year of school .

Under fire: President Obama has been rocked by a second national security scandal within a week of his election for a second term . General David Petraeus believed he could keep his affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell secret even after he was interviewed by the FBI, it emerged today. After meeting Petraeus on October 21 and also conducting two interviews with Broadwell, the second on November 2nd, the FBI had concluded that no criminal charges would be brought. But the FBI appears to have decided to inform the White House after a Florida-based agent informed a Republican member of Congress of the investigation. This was the same agent who had triggered the inquiry when his friend the socialite Jill Kelley complained to him about anonymous harassing emails. The fallout now threatens to engulf General John Allen of the US Marines, the Nato commander in Afghanistan. He is said to have exchanged between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of emails with Kelley since 2010. To complicate matters further, the FBI agent had allegedly sent shirtless photos of himself to Kelley before she reported the harassing emails to him and had been told not to interfere in the investigation. The agent, depicted by government officials as a Right-winger, contacted Representative Dave Reichert and asked for a member of the House Republican leadership. On October 31st, Reichert put him in contact with Representative Eric Cantor, House Majority Whip. Cantor informed the FBI of his conversation with the FBI agent, now himself under internal investigation, but did not make the matter public. Cantor apparently knew of the FBI investigation into Petraeus' affair eight days before President Barack Obama. The allegedly harassing emails were discovered to have been sent by Broadwell. It is believed that Allen received at least one email from the same email account used by Broadwell to contact Kelley. Scandals: U.S. General John Allen (left), commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan is under investigation over thousands of emails sent to a Florida housewife following the resignation General David Petraeus (right) Allen is now under investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general and his Senate confirmation hearings for the new post of Nato's Supreme Allied Commander Europe, originally due on Thursday, have been put on hold. A senior defence official told reporters that it was alleged there had been 'inappropriatecommunications' between Leon Panetta, Defence Secretary, said in a statement . If Allen follows Petraeus into retirement it will leave Mr Obama with two gaping holes to fill at the heart of his national security team at a time when he is also expected to be replacing his secretaries of state, defence and treasury. It is unclear exactly when FBI Director Robert Mueller and Attorney-General Eric Holder were informed although it has emerged that the investigation began as early as May. General Allen is under investigation by the FBI after the discoverey of between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communication between him and housewife Jill Kelley, (pictured) Obama was only informed of the scandal just two days after last Tuesday's US election, according to the White House, and accepted Petraeus's resignation the following day. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democratic chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said: 'This is certainly an operationally sensitive matter. 'But we weren't briefed. I don't know who made that decision. 'So it is very puzzling and I think was a mistake, because this thing just came so fast and so hard. And since then, it's been like peeling an onion. Every day, another peel comes off.' Representative Peter King, the Republican chair of the Homeland Security Committee said: 'This is a crisis, I believe, of major proportions. 'It's not the usual political thing. We're not talking about the secretary of commerce or some undersecretary . somewhere. We're talking about the heads of the FBI.' King argued that the case 'had to . be brought to the President, or certainly to the National Security . Council. If not, the FBI was derelict in its duty. 'I don't want to raise any conspiracy theories, but I certainly have questions,' he said. Panetta said . Allen, 58,  would remain as commander of U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan . for now, 'while the matter is under investigation and before the facts . are determined.' Adultery can be considered a crime in . the military and while as CIA director Petraeus was a civilian, the . potential security breach could have left him open to blackmail or . undermined his credibility with his staff. Petraeus, who has been married to . wife Holly for 38 years, admitted to having an affair with his . biographer, the former Army officer Broadwell. He . had been due to testify at closed-door congressional inquiries into the . deadly September 11 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, but . will now be replaced at least temporarily by acting CIA Director Michael Morrell. One name being floated as a possible replacement is John . Brennan, the White House counter-terrorism adviser and a CIA veteran who . has played an instrumental role in Mr Obama's drone war against . al-Qa'ida militants. Kelley was thrust into the public eye when she was the target of supposedly threatening emails from Paula Broadwell, which the FBI used to uncover the affair between Broadwell and Petraeus, leading to the former general's resignation from the CIA. Affair: David Petraeus is pictured with Paula Broadwell, his biographer and alleged mistress . Steven Boylan, a retired army colonel and former Petraeus spokesman, said his former boss told him over the weekend that the affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, began about two months after he became CIA director and ended four months ago. 'He is devastated, you could say, and you could also say that it's going to take a long time for the family or some time for the family to get through this, but they will,' Mr Boylan said. It all unravelled when a Tampa woman . went to the FBI in the early summer after she began receiving . threatening emails accusing her of a flirtation with the general, the . Washington Post said. A . government official told The New York Post that the emails contained . such language as: 'I know what you did', 'back off' and 'stay away from . my guy'. Kelley, is described as a 'social liaison officer' to the Joint Special Operations Command in Tampa. She and her husband Scott had been friends with Petraeus and his wife Holly for about five years. John Brennan, the White House counter-terrorism adviser and a CIA veteran is being floated as a possible replacement CIA chief . The FBI soon traced the emails to Broadwell, who had been given unprecedented access to his command in Afghanistan last year to write her glowing biography. The agents eventually discovered sexually explicit emails between Petraeus and Broadwell indicating the affair. Broadwell was found to be in possession of some classified material, but Petraeus was not thought to have given them to her.","Petraeus thought he could avoid disgrace because FBI concluded there would be no criminal charges brought .

Casper’s diet and fitness programme was specially tailored by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA PetAid hospital. PDSA senior vet Andrew Hogg said: 'Casper has made great progress over the last six months. 'Weight loss in cats has to be achieved very slowly and under close veterinary supervision as too rapid a weight-loss can be dangerous to their health. Christine and Casper have done incredibly well. 'Obesity is a growing problem amongst UK pets and we hope this will inspire others to make a positive change to their pets’ lifestyles.'","Greedy moggy gorged on chicken and roast potatoes .

A convicted burglar will spend Christmas in jail after being caught trying to sell a stolen First World War memorial plaque to a scrap dealer for just £200. Jobless Michael Coyle, 40, was captured on CCTV trying to get rid of the 5ft by 3ft bronze memorial. When the dealer realised the significance of the plaque, which was inscribed with the names of 34 men who died in the Great War, he confronted Coyle, who claimed an ‘old guy’ had given it to him and he didn’t know what it was. Magistrates were told that police were called and arrested Coyle two days later based on the CCTV footage. But he refused to name his accomplice and the plaque, which had been . taken from the grounds of Christ Church, Willaston, Wirral, in July has . never been recovered. Coyle, of Little Neston, Wirral, was jailed for nine weeks by . Chester magistrates after admitting handling stolen goods. Michael Trevor-Barnston, chairman of the bench, told Coyle: ‘This was a . particularly despicable offence and we found it hard to believe that you . did not know what you had in your possession. The plaque, taken from the grounds of Christ Church, Willaston, Wirral, in July has never been recovered. Coyle was jailed for nine weeks after admitting handling stolen goods . 'You have previous . convictions for dishonesty and you failed to help police recover the . plaque, causing shock and abhorrence to the families and loved ones.’ The memorial was built in 1921, with the £1,130 cost being met from . public subscription. It contained the names of many locally raised men . who fell on the battlefields of the Western Front. Others were killed in . more distant campaigns, such as Mesopotamia and Palestine, or died in . captivity in Germany. After the Second World War, the names of nine men . killed during that conflict were inscribed on another plaque. Relatives of those honoured on the memorial last night said Coyle was a ‘disgrace’. Upset: Reverend Raymond Dent of Christ Church, standing next to the memorial which is without its two plaques . Alan Pollard, 89, who served with the Gloucester Regiment during the . Second World War, said: ‘It is a disgusting crime and one that left . people truly appalled and I welcome the magistrates’ decision to jail . this man.’ Mr Pollard, who is related to Private John Pollard, a soldier with the . Cheshire Regiment who died in Mesopotamia aged 23 in 1917, said: ‘I . really don’t understand what goes through the minds of someone to steal . such a thing. He is a disgrace.’ The Rev Ray Dent, the vicar of Christ Church, said the memorial will . cost between £8,000 and £10,000 to restore. ‘It is a terrible crime,’ he . said. ‘Some of the village have called for the stocks, but my concern . is that he (Coyle) won’t help the police find the plaque, so he can’t be . truly repentant. ‘He will be meeting another judge one day and needs to clear his conscience. I will be praying for him.’ Sue Gibson, prosecuting, told the court that both plaques were reported . missing on July 30. Schoolchildren made replacements so the monument . could be used for last month’s Remembrance  parade. Neither bronze has been recovered but within 48 hours of the theft, . Coyle was caught on CCTV driving into a local yard and offering a plaque . as scrap. He would have received just £183.30 for the metal.

Mitt Romney today stands on the brink of becoming the Republican candidate to challenge Barack Obama for the presidency of the U.S. But it could have been so different for the former Mormon missionary when he was almost killed in a car accident in Bernos-Beaulac, France, in 1968. The 21-year-old was driving from Pau to Bordeaux when he was hit by a car driven by a Catholic priest, which killed one of his own passengers. Wreckage: Former Mormon missionary Mitt Romney almost died in a car accident in Bernos-Beaulac, France, in 1968, which killed one of his passengers. The Citroen DS driven by Mr Romney is pictured . ‘We were all talking about how dangerous how the highways were and the French highways,’ Mr Romney said, reported the Boston Globe in 2007. ‘Literally as we were having that conversation, boom, we were hit. It happened so quickly (that) there was no braking and no honking.’ Mr Romney drove Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson and others to Pau, where a small Mormon congregation was in dispute. There were six people in total going back to Bordeaux when the car was hit and Mr Anderson's wife Leola was killed, reported the Boston Globe. Recovering in hospital: The 21-year-old Mitt Romney, pictured, was driving from Pau to Bordeaux when he hit a car driven by Catholic priest Albert Marie . Mr Romney, who has always insisted he was not at fault, was seriously injured and even feared dead for a moment after the crash. 'It happened so quickly (that) there was no braking and no honking' Mitt Romney . A policeman who first responded wrote ‘Il est mort’, or ‘he is dead’, in Mr Romney’s passport. But at hospital he came out of a coma. He was left with a swollen face and fractured arm. Mr Anderson, who died in 1995, suffered injuries to his chest, ribs, lung, liver and spleen. The incident happened on a curving two-lane road on which Mr Romney passed another accident just before his crash, reported the Boston Globe. Injured: Mr Romney had been driving Mormon French mission president Duane Anderson, pictured, to Pau, where a small Mormon congregation was in dispute . Witnesses did claim Catholic priest Albert Marie, 46, of Sireuil, France, was drunk when the crash happened but this was never verified. 'I was frightened of driving a car (and) had a sense of vulnerability that I had not experienced before' Mitt Romney . Mr Marie was driving with his mother Marie-Antoinette Marie and a woman named Marguerite Longué, 48, reported the Boston Globe. Mr Anderson never sued after the accident as he was worried about a religious run-in with the French government or the Catholic Church. Local police don’t have any records of the accident because their documents are destroyed after ten years, reported the Boston Globe. Nowadays: Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, centre, and his wife Ann, right, are seen after winning the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday . The other passengers in Mr Romney’s car were French Mormon couple Suzanne and Bertin Farel and staffer David Wood, 21, of Salt Lake City.

One of the first cat cafés in Europe, Cafe Neko, opened in Vienna, Austria, while there is also one in St Petersburg, Russia. ‘We thought long and hard about who would really benefit from having a cat café in London.

"By . Simon Walters . UPDATED: . 08:46 EST, 31 July 2011 . Tony Blair is to face scathing criticism from the official inquiry into the Iraq War for the role he played in leading Britain into one of its biggest foreign policy fiascos in modern history. The Mail on Sunday has been told that the former Prime Minister will be held to account on four main failings: . The damning verdict of the Chilcot Inquiry comes eight years after Tony Blair went to war against Saddam Hussein with George Bush . Well-placed sources say the reputations of Mr Blair and key allies will suffer major damage when the report by Sir John Chilcot’s Iraq War inquiry is published this autumn. Mr Blair, former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and ex-Downing Street spin doctor Alastair Campbell are all expected to be criticised. All those taken to task by Chilcot’s five-strong panel of experts will receive notice in the next few weeks of the inquiry’s conclusions. They will be given a final chance to respond to their alleged failings before the report is finalised. Although it has not yet been written, clear indications have been given as to which areas it will focus on. The damning verdict of the Chilcot Inquiry comes eight years after Mr Blair went to war against Saddam Hussein with George Bush. A total of 179 British soldiers died in Iraq while estimates for the number of Iraqi dead vary from 100,000 to 650,000. Although Saddam was toppled within weeks, the invasion led to a bloody aftermath and there were claims that it contributed to increased terrorism in the UK and elsewhere. In evidence, a defiant Tony Blair said he had no regrets about the war and maintained Britain would ultimately be able to look back on it with 'immense pride' The Chilcot Inquiry, set up by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown two years ago, is the third inquiry into the conflict. It followed the Butler Inquiry into the intelligence failings and the Hutton Inquiry into the death of Ministry of Defence weapons expert Dr David Kelly. Inquiry chairman, former civil servant Sir John Chilcot, 72, was asked to conduct a more searching investigation spanning the period from 2001, two years before the war, right through to 2009. The Mail on Sunday understands that the inquiry rounds on Mr Blair for telling Parliament that intelligence suggesting Saddam had WMDs was ‘beyond doubt’. In evidence, a defiant Mr Blair said he had no regrets about the war and maintained Britain would ultimately be able to look back on it with ‘immense pride’. But he admitted he had misunderstood the claim in a Downing Street dossier that Saddam could launch WMDs in 45 minutes. Ex-Downing Street spin doctor Alastair Campbell (left with Tony Blair) is also expected to be criticised in the report . He also conceded there was not a ‘growing’ threat from Saddam in the autumn of 2002 – despite stating precisely that in the Commons before the war. The inquiry report is also expected to criticise spin doctor Mr Campbell, whose denial that the dossier on Saddam’s weapons was designed to ‘make the case for war’ was challenged by former spy chief Major-General Michael Laurie, who was head of intelligence collection for the Defence Intelligence Agency. Major-General Laurie told the inquiry two months ago: ‘Alastair Campbell said the purpose of the dossier was not “to make a case for war”. I had no doubt at that time this was exactly its purpose and these very words were used. Although Saddam Hussein was toppled within weeks, the invasion led to a bloody aftermath in Iraq . ‘We knew at the time that its purpose was precisely to make a case for war, rather than setting out the available intelligence. I and those involved in its production saw it exactly as that, and that was the direction we were given.’ And earlier this month an unnamed MI6 officer said Mr Campbell acted like ‘an unguided missile’ in work on the intelligence dossier. The spin doctor had ‘a propensity to have rushes of blood to the head and pass various stories and information to journalists without appropriate prior consultation’. The inquiry is also understood to focus on the way that Mr Blair privately told Mr Bush more than a year before the conflict that he would back the war, while claiming in public he had not made up his mind. Mr Blair denied that a deal to go to war had been ‘signed in blood’ at President Bush’s Texas ranch in 2002. He said they merely agreed to ‘deal’ with Saddam. However, a rift between Mr Blair and Mr Straw over whether the UK supported ‘regime change’ will also feature prominently in Chilcot’s conclusions. Furthermore, Mr Straw is in the line of fire after saying he only ‘very reluctantly’ endorsed the war, but ignored warnings from Foreign Office legal advisers that it was illegal. Sir Michael Wood, former senior legal adviser at the Foreign Office, said he considered resigning in protest at the war and was sidelined after he objected. Mr Blair’s ‘sofa government’ style, whereby key decisions on the war were made in his study by a small circle of confidants – with most Cabinet Ministers and officials excluded – is also expected to be condemned. Sir John Chilcot's Iraq War inquiry is published this autumn . Former Cabinet Secretaries Lord Wilson and Lord Turnbull, who both served under Mr Blair, told of their failed pleas to Mr Blair to rely on traditional Cabinet committees. Lord Turnbull said the Cabinet was not asked to approve the war until the eve of the invasion in March 2003, by which time they were ‘imprisoned’ and had little choice but to agree – or see Mr Blair ousted. The failure to anticipate the post-war turmoil that followed Saddam’s defeat is believed to be another major part of Chilcot’s conclusions. The inquiry heard how Major-General Tim Cross, a senior British officer, asked Mr Blair to delay the invasion of Iraq two days before the conflict, partly because planning for afterwards was ‘woefully thin’. Major-General Cross said: ‘I remember saying, in so many words, I have no doubt at all that we will win this military campaign. I do not believe that we are ready for post-war Iraq.’ When he arrived in Baghdad after the war, things were worse than he expected. ‘Baghdad was held together by chicken wire and chewing gum,’ he said. Last night sources close to Mr Blair said that they were aware of the kind of criticism he was likely to face. A spokesman for the Chilcot Inquiry said: ‘We will not provide a running commentary on the inquiry.’ A source close to the inquiry said reports that Mr Blair would be heavily criticised were ‘speculation’. A spokesman for Tony Blair said: ‘This is a deliberate attempt to pre-judge a report that hasn't even been written yet. 'We're not going comment until it has been published.’ The inquiry pursued a claim that a deal was ‘signed in blood’ by Mr Blair at Mr Bush’s ranch in Crawford, Texas, in 2002, a year before the war – while Mr Straw denied regime change was considered. Panel member Sir Roderic Lyne asked Mr Straw: ‘What Mr Blair said about Crawford was very simple – Saddam either had a change of heart or regime change was on the agenda. He says it is on the agenda, you say it was off. Weren’t you and the Prime Minister aiming for different objectives?’ Inquiry member Sir Lawrence Freedman challenged the way Cabinet Ministers were kept in the dark in the build-up to the war. His colleague Sir Roderic said: ‘Would the board of any company ever be asked to take collective responsibility for a major strategic decision without a single paper or discussion in a board committee?’ Sir John Chilcot said Mr Blair’s claim that the secret services had established ‘beyond doubt’ that Saddam had WMD ‘was not possible to make on the basis of intelligence’. When Mr Blair insisted: ‘I did believe it, frankly, beyond doubt,’ Sir Lawrence said: ‘Beyond your doubt, but beyond anybody’s doubt?’ Sir Roderic suggested Mr Blair had ‘misled Parliament’. Inquiry member Baroness Prashar questioned Mr Blair on ‘obvious failings’ in post-war planning. There was ‘so much concentration on the (military) campaign planning that attention wasn’t paid to the aftermath.’ She told Mr Straw: ‘The U.S. was dysfunctional . . . yet we continued to assume they would sort it out. It wasn’t for want of people drawing it to the attention of the Prime Minister. Why did we not pay enough attention to that?’","Iraq war deal 'signed in blood' by former Prime Minister .

Fears over Frankenstein Foods are ‘humbug’, the new farming minister insisted yesterday, arguing that many Britons happily eat beef from cattle fed on GM crops. Addressing public concern about the genetically modified food industry’s increasing influence, Owen Paterson said: ‘There isn’t a single piece of meat being served [in a typical London restaurant] where a bullock hasn’t eaten some GM feed. So it’s a complete nonsense.’ But the Environment Secretary’s dismissive response angered campaigners, who pointed out that consumers’ apparent willingness to eat GM-raised beef was simply a result of the food not being labelled as such. Controversial: Critics fear genetically modified foods can cause environmental harm and damage human health . The row emerged as Downing Street said David Cameron was backing moves to speed up the approval process for controversial new GM crops and food. Ministers and officials are currently lobbying in Brussels for the European Commission to make it easier for Frankenstein Food giants to cultivate their crops. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Government has a position on GM foods which is, provided that it’s used safely and responsibly, it can deliver benefits and help address the challenge of global food security. ‘We have to ensure public safety and  take decisions based on the scientific  evidence, though in principle we are obviously supportive. If we can speed up a slow system then we should do that.’ Mr Paterson’s support is a victory for the biotech giants, such as Monsanto, which have been lobbying ministers and officials. Unfounded: Owen Paterson said concern about genetically modified food was 'a complete nonsense' His stance is all the more remarkable as he was once a champion of organic farming. In 2000 he challenged Labour ministers to ensure proper separation distances around GM crops to avoid contaminating regular crops. Successive governments, including the Coalition, have gone to great lengths to ensure there is no label to identify food that comes from animals reared on a GM diet. As a result, shoppers cannot know whether their food has a link to imports of GM feed, such as corn or soya. Currently, the only way to avoid GM is to shop at Marks & Spencer, which has a ban, or to choose organic meat, milk and eggs. Mr Paterson argued that the cultivation of GM crops would have ‘real environmental benefits’. He said: ‘Emphatically we should be looking at GM … I’m very clear it would be a good thing. The trouble is all this stuff about “Frankenstein foods” and “putting poisons in foods”. ‘There are real benefits, and what you’ve got to do is sell the real environmental benefits.’ In fact, Britain’s only large-scale GM crop farm trials – carried out ten years ago – found evidence of real harm to wild plants, insects, and, potentially, farmland birds such as the skylark. US research shows the widespread cultivation of GM crops has brought disaster for many farmers following the emergence of superweeds and superbugs. In some cases the only way to remove the rampant weeds is with large quantities of highly toxic chemicals, machetes and flamethrowers to burn out their roots. At the same time, studies continue to raise questions over whether GM crops and food are safe for human health. Peter Melchett, of the Soil Association, which campaigns against GM, said: ‘Owen Paterson says that people are eating meat from animals fed on GM feed without realising it. That is because the British Government has consistently opposed moves to label to give consumers accurate information, and he should put that right by immediately introducing compulsory labelling of meat and milk from animals fed on GM feed.’ He added: ‘Owen Paterson is wrong to claim that GM crops are good for the environment. The UK Government’s own farm-scale experiment showed that overall the GM crops were worse for British wildlife. ‘US Government figures show that overall pesticide use has increased since GM crops have been grown there, because, as scientists opposed to GM predicted, superweeds and resistant insects have multiplied.’ Pete Riley, of campaign group GM Freeze, said: ‘Mr Paterson has got his facts wrong as well as fundamentally misunderstanding why GM is not grown or sold in the UK. ‘The UK does not grow GM crops because the Government’s own farm-scale trials showed a decade ago that GM harms wildlife already threatened by industrial farming. ‘The evolution of superweeds and superbugs was an inevitable consequence of following a model of food production that still fails to deliver food to people who need it while causing considerable harm to the planet.’","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said there are 'real environmental benefits' to GM technology .

Rhian Burke, 35, was still reeling from the death of 12-month-old George from a fit, when her grief-stricken husband Paul plunged to his death from a motorway bridge. At an inquest, a coroner recorded a  verdict of accidental death ‘rather than suicide’ because Mr Burke, 33, had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in the days after his son’s death. Devastated: Rhian Burke lost her 12-month-old son George and husband Paul just five days apart . Loss: Paul Burke, pictured with the couple's son George, left, and on their wedding day, right .

That’s when I knew there was a major gap in the . system, with nobody taking responsibility for bereavement support. ‘The current bereavement system in the NHS fails to offer any  aftercare, particularly for grieving fathers.’ Heartbreak: Baby George was rushed to hospital after suffering a fit but died hours later . Support: More than 450 people attended a joint funeral for Paul and George at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff . In February last year, baby George suffered a fit while he was playing  at the family home in Miskin,  near Cardiff. Campaign: Rhian Burke has now launched a charity to help other family's who experience similar traumas . He was taken to hospital but died hours later. Doctors later discovered the fit was brought on by influenza and bronchial pneumonia, which had not been diagnosed. In the following days, the devastated . couple started to plan George’s funeral and talked of taking their other . two young children on holiday to Lapland. Mrs Burke said: ‘One minute we were a normal family getting on with life – the next it was all over. ‘Paul took the car for a drive. I didn’t think anything of it. ‘We had cried together and were planning funeral arrangements  for George. ‘I hadn’t noticed anything different in his character. ‘When I was given the news about Paul, it nearly killed me. ‘Paul should be here today to support me, but he isn’t. ‘I am in no way cross or angry  with what he did, as he was the kindest, loveliest person you could ever meet. ‘He was a very proud man who loved his family very much.’ More than 450 people attended a joint funeral for the father and son at Llandaff Cathedral in Cardiff. Mrs Burke’s 2 Wish Upon A Star charity . has since raised £50,000 to help improve bereavement support after . charity balls and events were held in Mr Burke and George’s memory. She said: ‘People ask me how I cope, but the charity work has really given me a focus. ‘I’m determined to change  things.

Starting in 2016, women will be regularly assigned to combat roles, but may not be assigned to elite units such as the Navy SEALS and Army Rangers over fears by former commandos they may distract the male members of the team. Explaining that these fears are largely unfounded and being used as an excuse to keep them out of highly sought after assignments, female soldiers point to women on Special Operations teams in Afghanistan and ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell’ as proof they are fit. Boys club: Female soldiers may be kept out of elite Navy SEAL and Army Ranger units over sex fears . A number of former soldiers told NBC News that assigning female soldiers to teams of anywhere from 12 to two would pose problems while far from home or even any other human contact for extended periods of time. These hook-ups could lead to jealousy and infighting on the team, affecting its cohesion and, ultimately, its effectiveness. ‘It can shift the focus of doing the job if everybody’s trying to get laid. I know it sounds incredibly juvenile, but it’s incredibly true,’ former Airborne Ranger and Special Forces sergeant Jack Murphy told NBC News. Murphy, who served in both Afghanistan and Iraq added that adding women would ‘make the entire team useless.’ Custom fit: Army body armor designed to fit women's physiques has already been deployed with women serving in Afghanistan . Having overseen 20 women who have served in Afghanistan, Colleen Farrell disagrees. Calling the female Marines she supervised as a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps reserves from 2010 to 2011 the most professional Marines she ever led, Farrell said ‘they are there for the mission. They’re not in Afghanistan to get married.’ Farrell said the last time military leaders tried to use this argument, with ‘Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,’ it was eventually proven false. In the time since the policy that kept gays from openly serving in the military has since been repealed, there has been no proof any distraction exists, Farrell added. Amid this back and forth, military leadership has yet to determine whether or not women will be eligible for Special Operations roles. ‘We haven't made any decisions, whatsoever,’ Major General Bennet Sacolick told NBC News. Director of force management and Special Ops development, Sacolick added that he is aware of concerns among current units. The RAND Corp. has been enlisted to survey male members about the potential pitfalls of women Special Ops soldiers, according to NBC News. Military leaders choosing to keep women out of specific combat roles will be forced to apply directly to the Defense Secretary for an exception, according to the New York Times. Lock shot: One former Navy SEAL thinks women, such as these training at Fort Campbell, should be assigned to all-female units such as sniper teams . One compromise could be all-female units, such as sniper teams, the Soviets used to employ, according to Brandon Webb, a former Navy SEAL who served in both Afghanistan and Iraq – the most infamous of which killed 309 enemy combatants, mostly Germans, during the second World War. Women make up about 15 percent of the military, and about 280,000 were deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, according to the Times. Over the were killed in action, the paper noted.","Former soldiers fear that soldiers hooking up will lead to ineffectiveness .

The socialist MPs were captured playing the game on iPads during a night session in the National Assembly to debate the bill. It is unclear whether the pictures were taken during a break in the proceedings or while the debate itself was under way.

The two MPs can be seen playing Scrabble on their iPads during a debate about the gay marriage bill . High scorers: Among the words used during the game was 'gache', which is French for 'wasted', and 'mufle' which can be translated as 'cad or 'oaf' Elsewhere the ten-point 'z' letter was used in 'saluez', the French word for 'greet', and 'nez', which means 'nose' in English. The National Assembly has approved a key article of the bill that would legalise gay marriage. The measure, approved by a 249-to-97 vote, would drop the legal requirement that a marriage in France must be between two people of the opposite sex. To become law, that measure must now be approved by France's Senate. That is expected to happen since President Francois Hollande favours the change. However, the legislation also contains a measure that has been more controversial in the parliamentary debate, which started last Tuesday. It would legalise gay adoption, and hundreds of thousands of supporters and opponents of the measure have held protests in Paris. The parliamentary debate on the gay rights legislation is scheduled to be completed by February 12.

A benefit fraudster has been spared jail despite claiming more than £50,000 in false benefits when he had £112,000 in the bank. Brian Carter admitted conning more than £54,000 in false benefits over a six-year period despite his healthy bank account which he had failed to disclose to Basildon Council. But the 58-year-old, from Vange, Essex, avoided a prison sentence and was handed just 200 hours unpaid work. The sentence has been slammed by councillors who say they are sick of benefit fraudsters dodging jail despite years of false claims. Phil Turner, deputy leader at Basildon Council, said: 'You have to question these liberal-minded magistrates who clearly felt it was in this man's best interest not to lock him up, but what sort of deterrent is that for others fraudulently claiming benefit? 'I don't have £112,000 in my bank, and your average hard-working, law-abiding citizen would be praising God for having that amount of money in the bank. 'His sentence is just a slap on the wrist. Magistrates need to get a backbone.' He continued: 'There has got to be a change in legislation where the punishment fits the crime. If you walked into a bank and pilfered that amount, you would get banged up and so should this guy. 'This is unforgiveable.'

A British call centre has hit upon a novel solution to the problem of providing around-the-clock service - it has sent its staff to New Zealand. Workers there man the phones in the daytime, which is night in the UK, meaning they are fresh and alert at all times. Telephone-answering company Moneypenny cooked up the plan after managers realised that their employees would rather leave the country than work night shifts. Headquarters: Telephone-answering firm Moneypenny, pictured, is based in Wrexham, North Wales . Contrast: The company has opened a new office in Takapuna, a suburb of Auckland, to cover the night shift . Lucky: Jess Edwards, 24, has been moved to New Zealand by the company . When workers at its base in Wrexham . leave the office at 8pm, they hand over to their colleagues in Takapuna, . a suburb of Auckland, where it is then 8am. And . when the British staff get back in the next morning, they take over . from the 'night shift' workers, who are free to enjoy their evening. Jess Edwards, 24, one of four workers who have relocated from Wales, said: 'It is a fantastic opportunity - I'm loving it. 'It was a bit strange to start with but it works very well - we go to work in the morning just as the staff in Wrexham are going home for the day. 'I am getting to see places I probably never would have the chance to see otherwise. 'I have visited Australia and both the North and South Islands of New Zealand and generally thrown myself into the experience.' The staff are living together in a rented house, and work on a cycle of four days on, four days off to enable them to travel around their temporary home. They are scheduled to return home soon, when they will be replaced by another set of four employees. WREXHAM         AUCKLANDPopulation      43,000                 1.4million .

A temperature rise of just 1.5C is likely to release vast amounts of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere from melting permafrost, new evidence suggests. In Siberia alone, the mighty thaw would liberate more than 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and methane, experts warn. The extra levels of greenhouse gas are potentially enough to accelerate global warming. Natural ecosystems and human infrastructure would also be seriously disrupted. Frost crystals at the entrance of Ledyanaya Lenskaya Cave: In Siberia alone, a thaw spurred by global warming of just 1.5C would liberate more than 1,000 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and methane, experts warn . Governments around the world have set themselves the goal of pegging global warming at less than 2C higher than pre-industrial levels. Above this point, it is feared climate change could become impossible to control. But the new research suggests the tipping point at which large frozen regions of the Earth start to thaw may be a warming of just 1.5C. A global rise of 1.5C above late 19th century temperatures could bring a substantial thaw as far north as 60 degrees latitude, it warns. Sixty degrees girdles the world through Siberia, the Nordic nations, the southern tip of Greenland, Canada and south Alaska. U.N. studies show that temperatures have already risen by about 0.7C since the 19th century and are still rising. The permafrost frontier: Here the ground is permanently frozen in a layer tens to hundreds of metres thick . The evidence comes from a study of stalactites and stalagmites in caves along the 'permafrost frontier' of Siberia. Here, the ground starts to become permanently frozen in a layer tens to hundreds of metres thick. The mineral formations that hang from the roofs of caves or rise from their floors only grow in the presence of liquid water. They form as liquid rainwater or melting snow and ice drips into the caves. In Siberia, the formations record 500,000 years of changing permafrost conditions. The evidence showed that 400,000 years ago, a temperature 1.5C warmer than it is today was enough to cause substantial thawing of the permafrost. Dr Anton Vaks, from Oxford University, led the international team, whose work is reported in the latest online version of the journal Science. He said: 'The stalactites and stalagmites from these caves are a way of looking back in time to see how warm periods similar to our modern climate affect how far permafrost extends across Siberia. 'As permafrost covers 24 per cent of the land surface of the northern hemisphere significant thawing could affect vast areas and release gigatonnes of carbon. 'This has huge implications for ecosystems in the region, and for aspects of the human environment. 'For instance, natural gas facilities in the region, as well as power lines, roads, railways and buildings are all built on permafrost and are vulnerable to thawing. 'Such a thaw could damage this infrastructure with obvious economic implications.' An ice hall in the Ledyanaya Lenskaya Cave: Stalactites and stalagmites only grow in the presence of liquid water. By dating them researchers worked out when they last grew and what the global temperatures were . The team measured the radioactive decay of minerals to date the growth of stalactites and stalagmites in the caves. Results . from Ledyanaya Lenskaya Cave in the northernmost and coldest region, . near the town of Lensk, showed that stalactite growth only took place . there 400,000 years ago when the temperature was higher by 1.5C. Periods . when the world was 0.5 - 1C warmer than it is today did not see any . stalactite growth in the cave. This suggested that 1.5C was the 'tipping . point' at which the coldest permafrost regions began to thaw. The . United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimates that permafrost . contains about 1,700billion tonnes of heat-trapping carbon - twice the . amount currently in the atmosphere. A . UNEP report said in December that permafrost had already begun to thaw . in some areas and could release between 43 and 135billion tonnes of . carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, by 2100. An environment under threat: A view of the frozen Lena River from the entrance of Ledyanaya Lenskaya Cave . Almost 200 nations agreed to the 2C limit on global temperatures above pre-industrial times - comparable to late 19th century temperatures - to avert more floods, storms and rising sea levels. More than 100 poor nations want a tougher ceiling of 1.5C. But it is slipping out of reach because greenhouse gas emissions are rising, especially in emerging nations led by China and India, while some rich nations are not making promised cuts. Dr Vaks added: 'Although it wasn't the main focus of our research, our work also suggests that in a world 1.5C warmer than today, warm enough to melt the coldest permafrost, adjoining regions would see significant changes, with Mongolia's Gobi desert becoming much wetter than it is today and, potentially, this extremely arid area coming to resemble the present-day Asian steppes.'","U.N. studies show global temperatures have already risen by 0.7C .

Pay deal: Caroline Thomson left the BBC with £670,000 soon after she lost out on the director general's job to George Entwistle . Losing a well-paid job at the BBC is like ‘winning the lottery’ because of the huge pay-off that inevitably follows, MPs said yesterday. They accused the corporation of ‘hosing down’ departing executives with licence payers’ money as details of the extraordinary exit packages for former top executive Caroline Thomson and director general George Entwistle were made public. They were left ‘incredulous’ when learning that former chief operating officer Miss Thomson left with a £670,000 pay-off – more than twice her £330,000 salary – even though she had wanted to quit. Senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge suggested that the entire leaving package in September was essentially manufactured to ‘compensate’ Miss Thomson after losing out to Mr Entwistle in the race for the director generalship. Miss Hodge, chairman of the influential Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘She didn’t get the top job and she wanted to leave, so someone created a redundancy where there wasn’t one. 'A lot of people don’t get the jobs they want to.’ In addition, Mr Entwistle’s lavish deal – which approaches £500,000 and was agreed ‘for the good of the licence-fee payer’ – has brought to £4million the sums paid out to ten departing BBC executives in the past two years. Tory MP Guto Bebb said: ‘It does look as though losing a job at the BBC is the same as winning the lottery.’ The row took the gloss off the unveiling of Royal Opera House boss Tony Hall as the corporation’s new director general yesterday. Demands: George Entwistle gave the BBC a list of demands worth at least £500,000 if they wanted him to quit, MPs were told . Pugh's take on today's events . Some observers even wondered whether . the timing of the announcement about Lord Hall was an attempt to divert . attention from the embarrassing Commons scenes. Mr . Entwistle quit earlier this month after only 54 days in charge. But on . top of his well-publicised £450,000 pay-off – double that to which he . was entitled – his lavish exit package included another £45,000 for . bills for lawyers and communications advisers. The deal included up to £10,000 for the legal advice to help him secure his pay-off. He also received a year’s Bupa private medical cover, legal expenses of . up to £25,000 to help him give evidence to two inquiries into the Jimmy . Savile affair, and £10,000 for public relations assistance to cope with . the ‘considerable amount of door-stepping’ from reporters. Yesterday BBC trustee Anthony Fry was repeatedly criticised when he appeared in front of the Public Accounts Committee. One MP said the Entwistle saga revealed the BBC’s ‘complete lack of . understanding’ for the ‘punter’ who pays for the licence fee. Mr Fry expressed his own ‘irritation and aggravation’ at the terms of . the pay-out, admitting that members of the public would regard the . amount as ‘in the stratosphere’. Anger: BBC trustee Anthony Fry (left) said he was irritated by Entwistle's demands but it was the right decision  while select committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge (right) said it showed how far the BBC is out of touch . But he revealed that Mr Entwistle had . made it clear through his lawyers that the £450,000 deal for his . resignation was the ‘only thing that was on the table’. Mr Fry said that . had the director general been fired it would have been likely to cost . the corporation a further £80,000 if it had gone to an employment . tribunal. One year's salary - £450,000 . Bupa policy - £1,200 per year . Legal fees for setting up deal - up to £10,000 . Legal fees for 2 Newsnight inquiries - £25,000 . 'Communications budget' - £10,000 . Pension pot - £883,000 or £40,000 per year . The pay-off, along with the details of Miss Thomson’s exit deal, left MPs on the committee angry. Miss Thomson, who left after 37 years, is understood to have received a . year’s pay for being made redundant and a further year’s pay for payment . of her notice period. Committee chairman Miss Hodge suggested the redundancy had been a ‘device to pay off her disappointment’. She added: ‘She didn’t get the job and then she goes. Fine. 'She might be . really, really fed up and felt she did not want to work for the . organisation any more... You can’t then give them £670,000 of licence . fee payers’ money. It’s just awful.’ Her colleague on the committee, Tory MP Richard Bacon, said: ‘You don’t . hose them down with money as compensation. That is what this looks like. It really does.’ Announcement: George Entwistle with BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten, as he announces his resignation - 15 minutes after the BBC Trust agreed the deal . Caroline Thomson was the BBC’s top . woman executive and favourite to be the first female director general . but was pipped by rival George Entwistle. She . earned £330,000 as chief operating officer but left in September after . her post was axed. On top of her £670,000 pay-off she left with a £1.71million pension pot. The 58-year-old first joined the BBC after starting as a trainee journalist in 1975. Since . the BBC began publishing the expenses of its top executives, her taxi . claims received attention with her regular use of cabs costing thousands . of pounds of licence fee money each year. Ms Thomson is married to the former Blairite advisor Lord Liddle – her second husband – and has one son . Of Mr Entwistle’s deal, Miss Hodge said: ‘We express . incredulity. It demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of how . this is viewed in the public domain, given that it is licence . fee-payers’ money. That is the real shocker about this. ‘He took a public job, he was hugely well remunerated, he failed in 54 . days, he gets incredibly rewarded for failure... There is no . understanding of what the ordinary punter turning on the telly feels . about it.’ There were gasps from committee members . when it emerged that 574 BBC bosses received private healthcare as part . of their deals, worth in the region of £2million in total. Miss Hodge later told Radio 4’s World At One she was concerned by a . series of severance packages for top BBC managers, including deputy . director general Mark Byford, who received almost £1million, and former . marketing director Sharon Baylay, who got nearly £400,000. She said: ‘This is taxpayers’ money. You really have to think very, very . carefully when you are spending that money that it is in the public . interest.’ Mr Fry offered a faint hope that some of Mr Entwistle’s pay-out could be . recouped, depending what came out of the inquiry into the decision to . drop the original Newsnight inquiry into Jimmy Savile last year. The BBC is being urged to allow spending watchdog the National Audit . Office to look at the terms of Mr Entwistle’s departure, but the . corporation is resisting the move. In the last two years alone, leaving BBC executives have taken more than £8.5m of license-fee payer money in payouts and pensions . A BBC spokesman said: ‘Between August 2009 and August 2012 the BBC has . reduced its senior management numbers by 29 per cent and its senior . management pay bill by 30 per cent. ‘Part of this restructuring requires us to pay redundancy packages for . senior management who in some cases have worked at the BBC for many . years.

Many in Japan have lauded the woman for her remarkable bravery in taking on a man who once spent 13 years in prison for the murder of a rival Yakuza boss with a samurai sword. Fearsome: Kenichi Shinoda was convicted of murdering a rival yakuza boss in the early 1970s with a samurai sword. He was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in prison . The woman, from Nagoya, also claims that when she refused to pay the bung in 2008, Yamaguchi-gumi henchmen threatened to burn down her restaurant. This is believed to be the first lawsuit of its kind in Japan, Kyodo news agency reported. The former restaurant owner is reported to have paid a total of . 10.85 million yen ($109,000; £72,000) in in total. The rest, lawyers say, will cover damages. Police figures suggest that the Yamaguchi-gumi make up . over 40 per cent of Japan's organised criminal underworld, AFP news agency . reported. No nonsense: Japan's National Police Agency found in November that one in five Japanese companies shaken down by the yakuza gangsters ended up paying them off . Kenichi Shinoda, also known as . Shinobu Tsukasa, began his yakuza career in 1962 when he joined the . Hirota-gumi, a Nagoya-based Yamaguchi-gumi affiliate. The Yakuza is a collective term given to Japan's organised crime syndicates. It is estimated that the Yakuza has over 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs, but together they make the largest organised crime group in the world. Numerous films have been made about yakuza crime, culture and practice, including the 1993 movie American Yakuza (pictured) They are known for their controlled organisation and strict codes of conduct, which involves punishments such as 'yubitsume' for members who break the rules. The tradition of 'yubitsume', beginning with the first joints of the left hand little finger comes from the Japanese way of holding a sword with 'yubitsume' intended to weaken the Yakuza member’s sword grip. The number of members has been on the decline since the Japanese Government introduced the Anti-Organized Crime Law in 1992 and as recent as last year, the US Treasury Department froze assets for the largest Yakuza ‘family’, the Yamaguchi-gumi. But his reputation for violence, loyalty and shrewd business acumen saw him rise fast up the ranks. Perhaps most famously, Shinoda was convicted of murdering a rival yakuza boss in the early 1970s, with a samurai sword. He was convicted of murder and spent 13 years in prison. But he is seen as an unusual Japanese crime boss, who likes to keep a lower profile than some of his rivals. He insisted on taking the train to . his induction ceremony instead of a chauffeured limousine and reportedly . stopped in a street noodle restaurant on the way to the lavish yakuza . banquet arranged in his honour. In November, police revealed one in five Japanese companies shaken down by the yakuza gangsters ended up paying them off. A . study released by Japan's National Police Agency found that of the . companies that answered the survey, at least five had paid more than . 5million yen ($61,000) to meet the demands of yakuza extortionists. The survey gives a good indication that Japan's 'nine-fingered economy' is still very much in business. Police sources acknowledge on . background that there may be more companies who actually paid off the . yakuza than were willing to admit it in a police survey. In October of 2011, it became a crime . in Japan to make payments to the yakuza or utilize their services under . the organized crime exclusionary ordinances. The NPA has repeatedly warned people not to give in to yakuza extortion demands.

(File picture) Crime scene: Emergency services at the scene of a reported gang-related incident in Tokyo's Akihabara district . Despite that, of the 2,885 companies that participated, 337 or 11.7 per cent reported run-ins with yakuza shakedowns. Of those companies approached by the yakuza, 62 companies or 18 per cent gave into the demands, The Atlantic Wire reported. Police said this figure is probably only the tip of the iceberg. For the companies approached by the yakuza, more than half (185) were pressed for payments or services in the last year.","Kenichi Shinoda is leader of the feared Yamaguchi-gumi gang of Nagoya .

Muslim protestors have clashed with riot police in a Paris suburb after attempts were made to fine a woman for wearing a full Islamic veil. Community leaders in Trappes, a commuter town to the west of the French capital, joined politicians in calling for calm following two nights of disturbances. They have seen hundreds of people surrounding the police headquarters in the area and bombarding officers with stones while also starting fires and vandalising property. Manuel Valls, France’s Interior Minister, today ordered hundreds more police into the area, saying: ‘Given the incidents which marred the night, and during which four people were arrested and twenty vehicles burnt out or damaged in the Elancourt district, a security plan will be maintained until calm returns permanently.’ French policemen from the anti-crime unit (BAC) patrol the streets in Trappes, a suburb of Paris, after two nights of violent clashes . Violent clashes erupted between citizens and French police late on July 18 and have continued for two nights . He added: ‘The mobilisation of the forces of order whose presence in large numbers and their vigilance prevented further serious trouble last night in Trappes.’ A 14-year-old boy suffered a serious eye injury in the violence, while four police were hurt on Saturday, said local prosecutor Vincent Lesclous. A police source in Trappes said: ‘The disturbances are related to the arrest of a man who objected to his wife being controlled for wearing a veil . ‘He attacked officers and was then arrested. It is this which led to the protests outside the police headquarters in Trappes.’ On both Friday and Saturday night, heavily armed CRS riot police could be seen taking part in running skirmishes with youths, while there were reports of flash ball guns being used to disperse the crowd. The violence is the latest in a string of incidents related to the controversial burka ban which was introduced across France in 2011. It means that women found guilty of wearing veils in public can be fined the equivalent of £130 and be forced to attend citizenship classes. Last month police were attacked on an estate in the Paris suburb of Argenteuil after arresting two men who also objected to a woman being stopped for wearing a veil. Some 40 riot police had to be called to the area to restore order, with tear gas and flash ball guns being used. The rioting started after after police officers carried out an identity check on a full-veiled woman and her husband . Riot police have used tear gas and flash ball guns to quell the violence . A 21-year-old pregnant woman was also attacked by suspected vigilantes for covering her face with a veil on the same council estate. In March, a Frenchman who ripped a Muslim woman's veil off her eyes was given a five-month suspended prison sentence. The 30-year-old said he was merely trying to 'enforce' his country's laws when he carried out the attack in the city of Nantes. The man later told a court he was a firm believer in the law brought in by government of former right-wing president Nicolas Sarkozy. But the judge said that he had acted like a 'vigilante' and carried out the attack solely because he was prejudiced against the women's faith. Mr Sarkozy had described Muslim face coverings as an affront to the principles of the French Republic, saying that they could be used by both shoplifters and terrorists to hide their identities. Amnesty International is among human rights groups who have condemned the law, saying it breaches the right of freedom of expression. Today police helicopters could be seen circling over Trappes, the home town of former Chelsea and France footballer Nicolas Anelka, as armoured vans surrounded the police HQ. Officers fear that high summer temperature may encourage crowds to gather over the weekend so as to once more target the police.","Two days of rioting in Trappes, near Paris, after police stopped woman .

Theft: After wedging open the shop's security shutters, the criminals took handfuls of jewellery from the window . Two of the raiders acted as lookouts, while another man repeatedly smashed into the strengthened glass with a hammer. It triggered a security system which automatically closed the shutters and filled the shop with clouds of smoke.

David Cameron's election adviser Lynton Crosby (above) faces claims he advised private healthcare firms how to exploit NHS 'failings' The Prime Minister faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was claimed that his controversial elections supremo advised private healthcare firms how to exploit NHS ‘failings’. Lynton Crosby’s lobbying company told clients that the Health Service is ‘seen as too bureaucratic with long waiting lists’, according to a document. His firm, Crosby Textor Fullbrook, said polling of the British public had shown that 59 per cent agreed that ‘as long as they receive the best available healthcare, the system doesn’t matter’. The poll also found that people believed that although the NHS provides good care, it has ‘failings’. While the document – which consists of slides from a powerpoint presentation to the H5 Private Healthcare Care Alliance – dates back to 2010, before Mr Crosby began working for the Tories last year, it will fuel fears of a conflict of interest. The revelations could damage the Tories’ attempts to present themselves as defenders of the NHS after recent hospital scandals. They come after David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny again that he was persuaded to drop plans for plain cigarette packaging by his adviser, who lobbies for big tobacco firms. But he refused to say whether they had spoken about the issue – simply that Mr Crosby ‘has not intervened… that’s the answer you’re getting’. Health campaigners have attacked Mr Cameron for postponing the decision to ban all advertising from cigarette packets. The revelations could damage Cameron's attempts to present the Tories as defenders of the NHS after recent hospital scandals . In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr yesterday, he was asked three times if he had spoken to Mr Crosby about the issue but dodged the question. He said: ‘He [Mr Crosby] has not intervened in any way on this or indeed on other issues.’ Mr Crosby’s role was ‘advising the Conservative Party on how to take on Labour, how to make a political argument, how to prepare for the next campaign.’ Commenting on the leaked presentation, a Conservative spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear that Lynton Crosby has never lobbied him on anything. He does not advise on government policy.’","His lobbying company told clients the NHS is seen as 'too bureaucratic'

Joe Helliwell, 20, who did not have a licence and was uninsured to ride the moped, crashed into Lucas Thorpe as he crossed the street, leaving him critically injured. The youngster suffered a fractured skull, eye socket and leg in the collision and had to be placed in an induced coma at Sheffield Children’s Hospital following the crash in April. Seriously injured: A moped rider who left an eight-year-old boy critically injured in a hit and run crash has been spared prison. Lucas Thorpe suffered a fractured skull, eye socket and leg in the collision . The schoolboy had to be placed in an induced coma at Sheffield Children’s Hospital following the crash in April . He was struck moments after leaving his grandparents’ house - on the very first day he had ever been allowed to walk to his friend’s house to play - and was dragged along the road by the bike, leaving his family fearing his face would be scarred for life. Helliwell, from Rotherham, South Yorks., fled the scene before police arrived and only handed himself in four days later, when he walked into a police station with a solicitor. He admitted both motoring offences and failing to report an accident when he appeared at Rotherham Magistrates’ Court. He was handed a six-week curfew order, which will see him wearing an electronic tag which alerts the authorities if he leaves his house between 7pm and 6am. Surgery: The youngster with his mother Samantha Scott. He underwent emergency surgery at Sheffield Children's Hospital to release pressure on his brain and to stop a bleed after the crash . He has also been banned from driving for a year and was ordered to pay £85 costs. However, his victim’s mum, Samantha Scott, 32, said she was ‘disgusted’ at the leniency of the sentence and said she wanted Helliwell to apologise for his actions. 'We are disgusted by the leniency of his sentence but what we are most upset about is that Helliwell has never once said sorry,' she said. 'I didn’t think we would be bringing Lucas home. Angry: Lucas Scott with his mum Samantha. He was left fighting for his life following the collision . 'All I am really bothered about is that we still have Lucas. 'When I got to him after it happened the bike was in bits, there were pieces of it everywhere, and Lucas was surrounded by paramedics and people helping at the scene. 'He was unconscious at first and had blood coming from his mouth and ears, but then he came round and was screaming ‘mum’. 'He was covered in blood and when we got to the hospital they told us he was critical.' The youngster, whose leg is still in a plastercast, underwent emergency surgery at Sheffield Children’s Hospital to release pressure on his brain and to stop a bleed after the crash. Ms Scott, a mother-of-four from Rotherham said: 'All we want is an apology - an acknowledgment of what he did and some sign that he is sorry for it, because at the moment all we know is that he is walking around our village as though he has done nothing wrong. 'Lucas could easily walk past him in the street.' However, she said she was delighted with the progress Lucas has made. The youngster, who was a goalkeeper with the Young Owls under-eights football team at the time of the collision, is back at school and able to hobble around, despite his leg remaining in the cast. She said: 'We didn’t think we would be bringing Lucas home at one point, so to look at him now is amazing. 'He is still scared when he hears the sound of bikes, so the scars will take a long time to heal - both physically and psychologically - but we are very proud of him for the way he has fought back.' Ms Scott said she hopes Lucas will be playing football with his team over the summer. 'He is a goalkeeper so is used to getting kicked, but after surviving this he will be able to put up with anything that happens when he is in the net now!' she said. Sheffield Wednesday winger Jermaine Johnson said: 'On behalf of all the lads here at SWFC I would like to wish little Lucas a very speedy recovery. 'In recognition of the bravery he has shown we would like to invite Lucas, and his family, to attend a game as VIP guests when he is feeling better.'","Joe Helliwell, 20, did not have a licence and was uninsured to ride .

The families of some of the 22 primary school pupils who died after eating a school lunch contaminated with pesticides have buried the children in the school playground in protest at 'government negligence'. Police have arrested the school cook following the poisoning which may have been part of a political feud between two branches of the same family, a local police chief said. Nearly 50 people, the majority of whom were young children, became sick at the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar after eating the food. Almost half died. The incident followed recent provincial elections in which Arsal Khan Khichi lost to his cousin Jehanzaeb Khan Khichi, police chief Sadiq Dogar said late Thursday.

Police said the school's head had ignored warnings from the cook about the food . Investigators believe that mustard oil used in the cooking had been contaminated with organophosphate pesticides. Several of the parents buried their children in front of the school yesterday. Madav Ram, whose 12-year-old son Rahul was one of the children who died, told the Daily Telegraph: ""We decided to bury our children in front of the school building to remind the government that they died because of their negligence. 'We also plan to raise a memorial in the memory of the dead children inside the school.' Arsal Khan Khichi is accused of paying . a cook, Mohammad Rafiq, 50,000 rupees ($500) to poison food at his . rival's home on June 9, Dogar said. Nearly 50 people became sick and . were taken to the hospital, and 22 died. Jehanzeb Khan Khichi was not at . home when the incident occurred, Dogar said. Rafiq has confessed to poisoning the . food, Dogar said. Police waited to arrest him until they received . medical reports that confirmed the dead had been poisoned. Arsal Khan . Khichi is still on the run, and a murder case has been registered . against him as well, Dogar said. It comes as it was claimed the . headmistress of the school is on the run, as police . claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food. Authorities say the cook had warned . Meena Devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar, that . the cooking oil may have been contaminated. She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed. Grief: Women mourn the death of their children who died after consuming the contaminated meals . Family members of a school girl (not pictured) mourn her death: Twenty-three youngsters died after eating the food, and dozens more remain in hospital after suffering sever poisoning . 'The headmistress said ""continue cooking and serve the food to the children"",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar. It is thought that many of the children who ate the meal may have been saved had the headmistress tasted the food before it was served, as required under the rules of the Midday Meal Scheme. Children are said to be far more vulnerable to this type of poisoning than adults as they have low body weight. Soon . after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural . Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started . complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse. Ninety . minutes later, the first victim, named as four-and-a-half year old Anshu Kumar, died on the way to hospital.

The clothes and shoes of a victim, placed by her family members on her grave: Post-mortem reports on the children who died have confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil . Abandoned: A villager looks back towards the locked house of the headmistress of a school, who fled with her family after children started dying. The cooks said that the teacher controlled the food for the free daily lunch . 'It's . not a case of food poisoning.

More answers are expected . when a forensic laboratory issues the results of its tests on the . dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the . headmistress in her house, he said. Police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, Sinha said. Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill. 'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said. Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said. Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor. When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them. Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves. The . cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the . principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the . government at the school. She . gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare . the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the . children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said. The two cooks were not spared either. Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. All were in stable condition Thursday. While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital. 'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.' Mr Sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway. Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide. Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this. 'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna.

The families of some of the 22 Indian primary school pupils who died after eating a school lunch contaminated with pesticides have buried the children in the school playground in protest at 'government negligence'. Police have arrested the school cook following the poisoning which may have been part of a political feud between two branches of the same family, a local police chief said. Nearly 50 people, the majority of whom were young children, became sick at the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar after eating the food. Almost half died. The incident in the town of Mailsi in Punjab province followed recent provincial elections in which Arsal Khan Khichi lost to his cousin Jehanzaeb Khan Khichi, police chief Sadiq Dogar said late Thursday. Buried in the playground: Villagers look on as three of the children who died after eating food contaminated with pesticide are buried in the grounds of the school . Protest: Villagers chose to bury the youngsters in the school playground in protest against what they describe as government negligence . Tragic: Villagers gather round as the bodies are buried following the poisoning . Mass tragedy: Villagers stand around the burial . mound of a child in front of the school where she was fed contaminated . food. Police said the school's head had ignored warnings from the cook about the food . Investigators believe that mustard oil used in the cooking had been contaminated with organophosphate pesticides. Several of the parents buried their children in front of the school yesterday. Madav Ram, whose 12-year-old son Rahul was one of the children who died, told the Daily Telegraph: We decided to bury our children in front of the school building to remind the government that they died because of their negligence. 'We also plan to raise a memorial in the memory of the dead children inside the school.' Arsal Khan Khichi is accused of paying . a cook, Mohammad Rafiq, 50,000 rupees ($500) to poison food at his . rival's home on June 9, Dogar said. Nearly 50 people became sick and . were taken to the hospital, and 22 died. Jehanzeb Khan Khichi was not at . home when the incident occurred, Dogar said. Rafiq has confessed to poisoning the . food, Dogar said. Police waited to arrest him until they received . medical reports that confirmed the dead had been poisoned. Arsal Khan . Khichi is still on the run, and a murder case has been registered . against him as well, Dogar said. Politics are often a family affair in . Pakistan, where it is not uncommon to have members of the same clan . running against each other as members of rival political parties. It comes as it was claimed the . headmistress of the school is on the run, as police . claim she forced a reluctant cook to serve up the food. Authorities say the cook had warned . Meena Devi, head of the rural school in the eastern state of Bihar, that . the cooking oil may have been contaminated. She had complained that the oil looked strange and gave off a foil smell when heated, but her concerns were dismissed. Grief: Women mourn the death of their children who died after consuming the contaminated meals . Family members of a school girl (not pictured) mourn her death: Twenty-three youngsters died after eating the food, and dozens more remain in hospital after suffering sever poisoning . 'The headmistress said ""continue cooking and serve the food to the children"",' said Police Superintendent Sujeet Kumar. It is thought that many of the children who ate the meal may have been saved had the headmistress tasted the food before it was served, as required under the rules of the Midday Meal Scheme. Children are said to be far more vulnerable to this type of poisoning than adults as they have low body weight. Soon . after the potato curry and rice was served at the school in rural . Chappra, Bihar, one of India's poorest states, pupils started . complaining of stomach cramps, then began to vomit and collapse. Ninety . minutes later, the first victim, named as four-and-a-half year old Anshu Kumar, died on the way to hospital. Death came . so quickly for some that they died in their parents' arms while being . taken to hospital. Dozens of other children are being treated for food poisoning. Authorities . discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next . to the vegetable oil and mustard oil, but it wasn't yet known if that . container was the source, said Amarjeet Sinha, a top official in Bihar. Villagers stand next to mass graves of the schoolchildren who died: Authorities discovered a container of pesticide in the school's cooking area next to the vegetable oil and mustard oil .

The clothes and shoes of a victim, placed by her family members on her grave: Post-mortem reports on the children who died have confirmed that insecticide was either in the food or cooking oil . Abandoned: A villager looks back towards the locked house of the headmistress of a school, who fled with her family after children started dying. The cooks said that the teacher controlled the food for the free daily lunch . 'It's . not a case of food poisoning. It's a case of poison in food in a large . quantity, going by the instant deaths,' Mr Sinha said. More answers are expected on Friday, . when a forensic laboratory is to issue the results of its tests on the . dead children, the food and the uncooked grain stored by the . headmistress in her house, he said. Police were searching for the principal, who fled after the students started falling sick, Sinha said. Local farmer Ajay Kumar's 5-year-old daughter was among the victims. He was in his house, which is about 100 metres from the school, when he heard screams from neighbours saying the children had fallen ill. 'I rushed there and all the kids were on their backs or clutching their stomachs or vomiting. I picked up my girl and took her to the local hospital right away,' Ajay said. Parents hitched rides or took public transport to get to the hospital, which is about nine miles from the village, he said. Medical staff told them they had no medicines to give them. His daughter died shortly afterwards, writhing in pain on the floor. When Reuters visited the village, there were at least 18 burial mounds, many in a large field opposite the school. Some contained multiple bodies and villagers could not agree on how many children were buried in them. Many parents said they buried their children's toys and clothes in the graves. The . cooks, Manju Devi and Pano Devi, told The Associated Press that the . principal controlled the food for the free daily lunch provided by the . government at the school. She . gave them rice, potatoes, soy and other ingredients needed to prepare . the meal for Tuesday lunchtime and then went about her business. As the . children ate, they started fainting, the cooks said. The two cooks were not spared either. Manju Devi, 30, ate some of the food and fainted. Her three children, ages five, eight and 13, fell ill as well. All were in stable condition Thursday. While Pano Devi, 35, didn't eat the tainted food, her three children did. Two of them died and the third, a four-year-old daughter, was in the hospital. 'I will stop cooking at the school,' she said. 'I am so horrified that I wouldn't grieve more if my only surviving child died.' Mr Sinha said one of the cooks told authorities that the cooking oil appeared different than usual, but the principal told her to use it anyway. Doctors treating the children said they suspected the food had been contaminated with insecticide. Media reports said the cooking oil may have been stored in an old pesticide container, but there was no independent confirmation of this. 'The minute the children were brought in, we smelled this foul odour of organophosphorus,' said Dr. Vinod Mishra, a doctor in the medical team treating many of the children at Patna Medical College Hospital in Bihar's capital, Patna. Organophosphorus compounds are used as pesticides, which are widely available and are sold under a variety of different brands.

A young mother pretended she was mugged to steal £10,000 from her grandfather. Amy Luck, 23, from Cadishead, Greater Manchester, couldn't 'resist the temptation' to take the money after being asked to cash in £10,000 Premium Bonds for her grandfather Barry Smith. She secretly handed the money over to her boyfriend Jonathan Stevens, 21, who buried it in his step-father's garden. The pair planned to spend it on themselves, Manchester Crown Court heard. Pregnant mother-of-one Luck and Stevens stood sobbing in the dock together at a sentencing hearing where their behaviour was slammed. But the thieving pair avoided jail by what the judge described as the 'skin of their teeth'. Mr Smith kept £10,000 in premium bonds in his granddaughter's name, the court heard. In May this year, he decided he wanted the money - and so asked Luck to cash them in. The night before she was due to go to the bank, Luck hatched a plan to keep the money to herself and pretend that she had been mugged. Stephens originally laughed off the idea before agreeing to take part. At 10.30am on the morning of May 15 police received a report of a robbery at Union Road, Eccles, from Mr Smith, who had been told by his granddaughter that she had been pounced on returning from Halifax bank. Luck went on to make a seven-page statement which made police suspicious with its vagueness. Verdict: Amy Luck and Jonathan Stephens leave Manchester Crown Court. The thieving pair avoided jail by what the judge described as the 'skin of their teeth' Luck also claimed to have been robbed of an iPhone 5, but was reluctant for officers to use the 'Find My iPhone' app to trace it. 'It's so hard having that much money put in my bank account when I don't have a pot to p*** in' Amy Luck, 23 . After wasting three hours of police time, Luck finally admitted she had taken the money. In a handwritten statement she said: 'It's so hard having that much money put in my bank account when I don't have a pot to **** in. I can get the money back, I'm sorry I wasn't robbed, it was all lies.' After collecting it from the bank, Luck had thrown it in her boyfriend's car, before he hid it under a flower-bed at an address in Sale. Richard Littler, defending, said of Luck: 'She'd never seen that amount of money before. She comes from a respectable family and is ordinarily hard-working. Her and her partner are trying to build a car sales business and get away from the benefit system.' Sentencing, Mr Recorder Driver described the crime as a 'severe breach of trust'. He ordered Luck, who admitted theft and perverting the course of justice, to serve a year-long sentence, suspended for two years, with a three-month curfew. Stevens, who admitted theft, was given an eight-month sentence suspended for two years, and 70 hours unpaid work. The court heard that Luck's grandfather did not support the prosecution. The judge told them: 'Consider yourselves very lucky - you have stayed out of jail by the skin of your teeth.'","Amy Luck, 23, couldn't 'resist the temptation' to take the money .

The burden of EU regulation  on the NHS and businesses will be laid bare today in the first official audit of the costs of Britain’s membership. Officials have spent months collecting evidence on a comprehensive assessment of the extent of meddling from Brussels. The first of their reports will be published tomorrow by William Hague, the Foreign Secretary, and senior Conservatives hope it will help their plans to try to renegotiate looser ties with the EU. Foreign Secretary William Hague, left, set to publish official audit of the costs of Britain's membership while David Cameron, right, is being urged by to take action to pull Britain out of the working-time directive . It comes amid alarming evidence that patient care is being put at risk by strict EU rules on working hours. Doctors’ leaders have warned ministers that the working-time directive, an EU edict which limits the working week to 48 hours, is having a serious impact in the NHS. Hospitals have had to alter traditional shift patterns and hire huge numbers of agency workers to ensure staff do not break the rules. The heads of the medical royal colleges suggest that thanks to the rules patients in hospital increasingly see a ‘conveyor belt’ of doctors at their bedside, while trainee doctors are unable to gain the hands-on experience they need. Tory MPs are urging David Cameron to take action to pull Britain out of the working-time directive in a renegotiation ahead of a referendum on EU membership, which the Prime Minister has promised to hold by the end of 2017 if he remains at No 10. The rules are also seen by many business leaders as uncompetitive when EU countries are up against booming economies such as India and China. The analysis, ordered by Mr Cameron, is supposed to be a neutral, fact-finding exercise about Britain’s future in the EU. The first report will look at how the EU and the single market affects UK taxation, health, business, overseas aid, foreign policy, animal welfare and food safety. A further 26 reports will be  published in coming months. Open Europe, the Eurosceptic think-tank, described the reports as a ‘useful exercise that will inform the EU debate for years to come’. But Stephen Booth, one of its researchers, added: ‘Unless this review is complemented by a political strategy to set out the parameters of a future EU renegotiation, it will not be sufficient.’ The Prime Minister insisted other EU members know the UK is ready to leave unless it negotiates a better relationship, and that Britain now rejected the founding principle of the EU. ‘Ever closer union, something that’s in the Treaty of Rome, shouldn’t apply to the UK,’ he added. ‘We’ve never signed up to that, we’ve never liked that. Let’s get Britain out of that.’ The Prime Minister said that in recent months, other EU member states had agreed that reforms were necessary to allow some countries to have looser ties, including Germany, Sweden, Holland and Italy.","Officials' comprehensive assessment of extent of meddling from Brussels .

Violent incident: Michael Adebolajo, one of the suspects in the brutal broad daylight killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, London . Prison officers have reacted with fury to claims from Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo that he was ‘assaulted’ while in prison. The man accused of hacking to death Fusilier Lee Rigby in the street was involved in a violent incident in Belmarsh high security jail last week in which he lost two teeth. In an interview with BBC News over the weekend, Adebolajo’s brother Jeremiah claimed warders in the prison ‘took offence’ when the remand prisoner refused to obey an instruction and then ‘smashed his head against a window’. The BBC also reported the claim – denied by Prison Service officials – that the murder suspect had been denied medical treatment. Officials insisted he had refused to be seen by a doctor. The report also claimed the suspension of five officers involved in the incident was ‘exceptional’, and hinted the assault might have been the result of Adebolajo’s ‘notoriety’. But yesterday the prison officers’ union condemned reporting of the incident as a ‘circus’. And sources suggested the officers had felt threatened after Adebolajo refused to comply with orders and turned towards them aggressively. Steve Gillan, general secretary of the Prison Officers’ Association, said: ‘All hell breaks loose because a prisoner says he has been assaulted.’ He insisted the suspension of the officers was ‘entirely routine’ in such circumstances. He said: ‘He is a dangerous person and our members are doing their best in the circumstances to do a professional job. We all know how dangerous this man is and that danger is still faced in prison. ‘The suspension is an administrative thing which happens if there is a police investigation. People shouldn’t be reading anything in to this.’ Mr Gillan said the officers insisted they had used only ‘approved restraint techniques’ when Adebolajo refused to comply with routine instructions. ‘They tell me they have done absolutely nothing wrong,’ he said. ‘They believe they were in danger from him and he turned aggressive.’ He added: ‘If the individual had complied with…instructions he would not have had to be restrained. He hasn’t been assaulted at all.’ HMP Belmarsh: Adebolajo¿s brother Jeremiah claimed warders in the prison ;took offence' when the remand prisoner refused to obey an instruction and then 'smashed his head against a window' In the BBC interview, Jeremiah Adebolajo’s identity was hidden because he said he fears being attacked. His account, from a phone conversation with his brother, suggested the murder suspect was the victim. Drummer Lee Rigby: Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, 22, are due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 18 over the soldier's death . Mr Adebolajo said: ‘They decided to take offence to something, and decided the best course of action was to twist his arm back. It was the arm that had been shot. ‘He manoeuvred out of that so they smashed his head against a window.’ And he said it was ‘strange’ his brother had not been given immediate medical treatment. But this claim was knocked down by the Prison Service, who insisted Adebolajo had refused to be seen by a doctor. The union expects the warders to be cleared by the police, but Mr Gillan warned officers could refuse to use restraint techniques if they think it will lead to them being targeted. ‘Prison officers will say “we won’t put our hands on anyone”, he said. Michael Adebolajo, 28, from Romford, east London, is one of two men accused of murdering Fusilier Rigby outside Woolwich barracks in May. When he appeared in court last month via video-link from the prison he was flanked by warders in full riot gear. Prison staff asked the court to keep him handcuffed as he was ‘unpredictable’ and had refused to comply with orders. He and Michael Adebowale, 22, are due to stand trial at the Old Bailey on November 18. Prison officers face strict rules on the amount and type of force they can use when dealing with difficult inmates. Ministry of Justice rules dictate that so-called ‘control and restraint techniques’ must only be used as a last resort. Officials are taught to use approved holds and locks aimed at subduing the prisoner  – which can cause severe pain. Before using them, officers must try to negotiate with the inmate repeatedly to convince them to comply. And at any time when the prisoner relaxes, officers must relax their holds. Guidelines state: ‘Staff must continue to attempt to de-escalate the situation throughout the incident with the aim of releasing holds and locks.’ ‘The application of C&R holds may cause pain to a prisoner and if the prisoner is compliant, the holds must be relaxed.’ What force is used is only justified – and therefore lawful – if it is ‘reasonable in the circumstances, necessary and proportionate’. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Suspect's brother accused prison officers in interview with the broadcaster .

Lisa Overington, 45, is now living out of boxes in her mother’s conservatory, while other workmen battle to correct his errors. The mother-of-three has been been forced to double her mortgage on her property to pay for the repairs. In total she is more than £50,000 out of pocket. Investigation: Inspectors described his work as 'unprofessional' and 'unconventional', and found he had breached a staggering 26 building regulations . Disruptive: Lisa Overington, 45, is now living out of boxes in her mother’s conservatory, while other workmen battle to correct his errors . Mrs Overington recruited Truckle’s firm - Taylor Carpentry Ltd - last summer to carry out £38,000 of improvements on her home. She paid the sum, with further instalments to follow, Fareham Magistrates Court heard. But Truckle, from Sarisbury Green, . Hants, abandoned the work in September after only comp;eting half the . job - and short of the 86 per cent that Mrs Overington had already paid. When building control . officers were called in, they found 'unprofessional and non-compliant' work and 'unconventional' building practices. They identified structural errors, . said incorrect building materials had been used, and found some of them . abandoned on the site. The damage was so bad that workmen have since had to tear out parts where errors were made and start again. Mrs Overington said: 'There is no electricity, no plumbing, no kitchen, no bathroom, no walls - it is an empty shell of a house. Abandoned: The state of the house after builder Shane Truckle had started work, leaving rubbish in the side garden . Disappointing: The condition of tiling on the rear roof at Mrs Overington's home . 'There is not even a sound roof yet and there is so much to do. 'He wiped out a year of my life and stolen my future, because I have had to double my mortgage. 'To say he has ruined my life is not an overstatement. 'I have spent every weekend at that house clearing the rubbish and doing as much as I can to make it right. 'It has consumed my life and will do for some time to come.' Magistrates convicted Truckle of 26 counts of failing to comply with building regulations. He failed to attend court and did not enter a plea. Truckle must now pay £18,423 compensation, £5,200 fine, and £4,540 legal costs. He was also ordered to pay £15 into a fund for victims of crime. Mrs Overington hopes to be back in the home before Christmas, but it will not be decorated and will contain only basic facilities. A planning inspector today described Truckle's work as among the worst he had seen in his 17 years as an officer. Paul Gosling, who led the investigation for Fareham Borough Council, warned the work was so poor the building was at risk of collapsing. He said: 'During my 17 years' experience in Building Control this is potentially one of the worst examples of building practices I have witnessed from a builder. 'The defects and contraventions identified suggest that the builder did not have a suitable level of competence to be carrying out building works in a manner which would satisfy the minimum requirements of the Building Regulations. 'Tailored Carpentry Ltd created a notable number of significant defects, many structural defects, which if not corrected could have resulted in structural collapse of areas of the building.' Councillor Trevor Cartwright, who is responsible for building control at the council, welcomed the prosecution. He said: 'The offences represented a serious and dangerous breach of the Building Regulations which had potentially put the homeowner at significant risk. 'I am pleased that the builder was found guilty of the contraventions and I am also pleased that the courts have ordered the builder to pay a considerable amount of compensation to the owner to assist with the rebuilding of her home.'","Shane Truckle, 32, wreaked havoc on the bungalow in Fareham, Hants .

Police are investigating the death of a pregnant woman who travelled from Dublin to London for an abortion but died just hours after the procedure. The 32-year-old, who was a foreign national living in Ireland, underwent an abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in west London in January 2012. She died in a taxi hours after the procedure. Marie Stopes International declined to comment because of client confidentiality. An inquest is yet to be held but the Metropolitan Police said a file on the woman's death had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service in April this year. Investigation: A 32-year-old pregnant woman who flew from Ireland to Britain to undergo an abortion at a Marie Stopes clinic in west London, stock image pictured, died just hours after the procedure . The Met continue to investigate the sudden death, a spokesman said. The woman's husband told The Irish Times that his wife had sought an abortion at a maternity hospital in Dublin but had been told that it was not legally possible to provide one. New legislation allowing for a termination in Irish hospitals when a woman's life is in danger are expected to be formally signed into laws in coming days. It is understood the woman's life was not considered to be at risk when she sought the procedure although she had a condition which raised the risk of miscarriage. The woman's husband, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he is frustrated at the lack of progress in the investigation. 'I think if this was an Irish or a British woman, we would know what happened to her. But I am still waiting for answers,' he said. Death: Savita Halappanavar died in hospital in Ireland last year from suspected septicaemia after doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy . The woman had a child in Ireland in 2010. Her pregnancy was painful and complicated by extensive fibroids and treatment could have left her her infertile. 'We were worried about what would happen when she became pregnant again,' he said. 'She was sick, but we were told that nothing could be done in Ireland.' It is understood the woman was about 20 weeks pregnant when she travelled to Britain for an abortion. Her husband told the newspaper that she may have acted sooner but was examining options and raising money for the procedure. It is understood the woman was suddenly taken ill in the Slough area of Berkshire at about midnight on the day of the procedure while in a taxi. She was pronounced dead at Wexham Park Hospital after suffering a heart attack caused by extensive internal blood loss. The couple were in Ireland on student visas at the time of her death. Ireland has since amended the law to allow abortions in the country in certain circumstances after a backlash following the death of Indian dentist Savita Halappanavar, who died in an Irish hospital last year after being denied an abortion. She was miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy in October but doctors would not terminate the pregnancy. Her widower Praveen claimed the couple had been told a termination was not allowed because 'Ireland is a Catholic country', prompting a worldwide outcry. The bill was passed earlier this month after it was revealed that 11 women travelled from Ireland to Britain every day for an abortion last year. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar (seen together on their wedding day) said they were told she could not have an abortion because 'Ireland is a Catholic country'","The 32-year-old woman had abortion at a Marie Stopes .

Fading light prompted authorities to call off attempts to find the missing pilot and a decision will be taken tomorrow morning about the next course of action. The American-registered plane carrying one person, its British pilot, crashed about 15 miles off Dungeness in Kent at around 2.30pm.

An RAF rescue helicopter has now joined the search for the British pilot lost in the Channel after his light aircraft crashed some 15 miles off Dungeness, Kent, on his was to Le Touquet airport in northern France . The single-engine light aircraft had been heading from Blackbushe Airport, on the Hampshire and Surrey border, to Le Touquet, in northern France's Pas-de-Calais department. The alarm was raised after the aircraft was overdue, a spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency MCA said. The incident happened four miles inside UK waters and the search was being co-ordinated by the British with help from the French authorities. The French search and rescue helicopter found wreckage around 15 miles off Dungeness, the MCA said. Following the suspension of the search, an MCA spokesman said tonight: 'Further discussions will be held in the morning as to the next course of action.' A search and rescue helicopter from RAF Wattisham had earlier joined in with the search, along with the Dungeness RNLI lifeboat, and three French vessels.

Holly Willoughby and her husband Daniel Baldwin reacted angrily to claims they kept neighbours up with a house party . Her good girl image was somewhat diminished after she wore a very revealing black dress on the final of The Voice last month, prompting 139 complaints to the BBC. So an ugly neighbourly dispute is the last thing that TV presenter Holly Willoughby will have wanted – not least because she has been accused of ‘keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour’. The accusation was made in an anonymous letter delivered to the £3million home she shares with her TV executive husband Daniel Baldwin and their two young children. Mr Baldwin, 37, reacted angrily to the letter by emailing 50 neighbours, many of whom the couple have never met, seeking help in tracking down the letter-writer. He denies creating any such noise, saying he and Miss Willoughby were watching Nashville – a US drama set in the world of country music – and that they want ‘an explanation’ from their critic. And to assist their hunt, Mr Baldwin attached two images of the woman who delivered the letter, obtained from the CCTV cameras bristling from his luxury home. Now one furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy, saying that the couple have unleashed ‘utter building chaos’ on the area over the last year. David Moss, 55, said: ‘We have been shocked by this vicious intrusive email, in which they make themselves out to be good neighbours, when we have had enormous trucks blocking the pavement six days a week.’ The row has disrupted the usual calm in the well-heeled area of south-west London, where Miss Willoughby and her husband bought their house 18 months ago. Since then they have lavished hundreds of thousands more on the house, which already boasts an impressive garden and balconies overlooking the Thames. They have made a series of planning applications, including bids to build a large extension, a garage complete with ‘staff accommodation’, and a large swimming pool. It seems the neighbours have tolerated the work – but somebody must have snapped on Saturday morning,  when the letter was delivered. The streets around Ms Willoughby's home: One . furious neighbour has accused the pair of hypocrisy, saying that the . couple have unleashed 'utter building chaos' on the area over the past . year . In the afternoon, Mr Baldwin sent out his email, headed, ‘Your help – our neighbourhood’. It read: ‘Dear Neighbours, this morning this lady left a letter on my doorstep. The letter was extremely rude and overly aggressive (I’ll save you from the gory details). Mystery critic: CCTV footage of the mystery woman who delivered the letter to Ms Willoughby's £3million home sent out by her husband . ‘It wrongly accused us of “keeping the whole neighbourhood up last night with drunken behaviour”. ‘In fact the whole house was in bed by 10.30pm – after two episodes of Nashville (please don’t judge me on this!). ‘The letter had no name or house number so I’d very much like to explain this to the lady on the picture and I’d like an explanation from her on the letter’s contents. ‘Her photo, from our CCTV footage is attached. Any help clearing this up would be hugely appreciated. ‘I’d like to think that we live in a neighbourhood where we can freely knock on our neighbours doors and have a civilised chat about any concerns/worries/issues.’ Mr Moss, who works in the NHS, added: ‘They think that they are decent neighbours, but at no point have they apologised for the disruption. 'The trucks and other stuff associated with their building works regularly block the pavement, and those who are elderly, disabled or pushing a pram have to take their life into their hands and walk in the road. ‘Just when we thought it was nearly finished, they have got planning permission to build a big pool in their garden.’ Mr Baldwin and Miss Willoughby, who also presents ITV1’s This Morning, refused to discuss either their email, or the complaints about the work on their home.

Adviser: David Cameron's head strategist, Lynton Crosby is also a lobbyist contracted by tobacco firms . The Prime Minister was yesterday forced to again deny that he was persuaded to drop plans for plain cigarette packaging by his adviser Lynton Crosby. But he refused to say whether he had spoken to his election strategist about the issue – simply that Mr Crosby ‘has not intervened... that’s the answer you’re getting’. Mr Crosby, an Australian who masterminded London Mayor Boris Johnson’s election campaign, is a well-known lobbyist whose firm has contracts with big tobacco firms including Philip Morris International, owner of the Marlboro brand. A number of major cigarette companies had campaigned against the introduction of plain packaging for their products. David Cameron has come under fire from health campaigners for postponing the decision to ban all branding from cigarette packets, as they claim children would be put off buying them which would save thousands of lives. In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr yesterday, Mr Cameron was asked three times if he had spoken to Mr Crosby about the issue, but dodged the question. He said: ‘He [Crosby] has not intervened in any way on this or indeed on other issues.’ Mr Crosby’s role, he said, was ‘advising the Conservative Party on how to take on Labour, how to make a political argument, how to prepare for the next campaign’. Yesterday, Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron said while there was no evidence Mr Crosby had influenced policy, ‘it all looks dreadful’. ‘Even if there’s no fire, there’s plenty of smoke’, he told Sky News. Since he was appointed as the Tories’ election campaign manager, Mr Crosby has encouraged the party to focus . on mainstream issues of the economy, welfare and immigration. No smoke and no fire: The Prime Minister was forced to deny that he had been pressured by Mr Crosby, right, over the cigarette packaging plans . Plans previously backed by Mr Cameron for a  minimum unit price for alcohol, and a charge for plastic bags handed out by supermarkets, have been shelved. Mr Cameron insisted his party had ‘not changed our policy’ on plain packaging and he believes ‘there are merits’ to the idea. But it is understood the idea has been kicked into the long grass until after the election in 2015. Officially the Conservatives are waiting for more evidence from Australia, which introduced plain packaging last year.","David Cameron under pressure over role of Tory strategist Lynton Crosby .

Two British anglers on an ‘ultimate’ fishing trip in the remote Russian Arctic were killed in a helicopter crash yesterday. The men and their Russian guide died when they were hit by the rotor blades of their chartered aircraft. Both Britons were said to be in their late sixties and were on a custom salmon fishing trip to the Kola Peninsula, 90 miles from the port city of Murmansk. They were named by Russian officials but the Foreign Office would not confirm their identities until their families were informed. Tragedy: The helicopter which is thought to have killed the three men was a Eurocopter 120B (stock image, this helicopter was not involved in the crash) Reports from Russia said the men had been dropped at a wilderness angling lodge by a private Eurocopter EC-120. As . the craft attempted to take off, it banked suddenly to one side and its . rotor blades hit the men where they stood with their guide, Alexander . Tushnikov. The pilot, said to have 25 years’ flying experience, survived the crash with injuries. Lines . of inquiry are likely to include whether the helicopter was caught by a . sudden gust of wind, causing it to tilt, or if it suffered a mechanical . failure. Russia’s . Investigative Committee said in a statement: ‘After landing, the . helicopter turned on its side and its rotors hit the passengers.’ The end of the Cold War opened new fishing grounds to wealthy angling enthusiasts. The . Kola Peninsula was previously a top secret area, home to the Red . October submarine base and the Soviet navy’s northern fleet. Now . it is known as the ultimate destination for high-end fishing tours for . Atlantic salmon, attracting anglers from around the world. More . than 100 British anglers head to its lodges every week during the peak . summer season, paying around £4,000 a week for custom fishing trips. They . are flown by helicopter to unspoilt rivers surrounded by Arctic . wilderness because many fishing spots are inaccessible by road. Operators . say the region has not been overfished like many popular salmon rivers . and that competent anglers can catch more than 100 salmon in a week, . with some fish weighing up to 40lb. The peak season runs from June to August, when the area north of the Arctic Circle enjoys 24-hour daylight. Outside the season, the rivers are frozen for three or four months a year. The . two British men were said to be fishing on the Rynda, one of four . rivers in the area where salmon forge upstream to breed from their ocean . feeding grounds. A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the deaths of two British nationals in Russia. ‘We are in touch with the local authorities and we stand ready to provide consular assistance.’ Ultimate destination: Salmon anglers on the 'untouched' Kola peninsula . Justin . Maxwell Stuart runs a UK-based travel firm called Where Wise Men Fish . and has organised tours to the Kola Peninsula in the past. He . said: ‘It is some of the finest – if not the finest – salmon fishing on . the planet. Any dedicated salmon fly fisher would aspire to do this . sort of trip.’ The Eurocopters are considered safer than the MI-2 ex-Russian military helicopters used elsewhere, Mr Maxwell Stuart said. He . added: ‘They have better helicopters than in some places. The pilots . are all very good. They are trained to drop people off under the arc of . the blades to avoid things like this happening. It’s a real shock.’ Fly . fishing instructor Michael Evans has run trips to the region and said: . ‘It remains untouched because it is frozen for three to four months of . the year. It’s a completely natural environment. ‘The fishing is phenomenal. It has the most prolific Atlantic salmon fishing in the world.’ Mr .

It took 40 volunteers several days to plant 2,000 trees intended to form a Diamond Jubilee wood. It took a blundering council worker only a few minutes to chop the lot down. The young saplings were hidden by long grass in a hay meadow at Nidd Gorge, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. Mowed down: Saplings were accidentally chopped down at Nidd Gorge in Yorkshire . ‘The council had told the grass cutter where to go, but he went off piste and wiped out the young trees,’ said Keith Wilkinson, chairman of the Bilton Grange Conservation Group which carried out the planting in December. ‘It is a real shame. The mower has just ripped most of them from the ground. Only a couple of shredded oaks have survived. It is disheartening for the volunteers.

The parents of two girls killed on a . level crossing accused Network Rail of a cover-up yesterday after . winning a six-year battle for justice. Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte . Thompson, 13, were hit by a high-speed train as they went Christmas . shopping together in 2005. The friends stepped on to the tracks . while trying to catch their train at Elsenham in Essex but failed to . spot another service travelling in the opposite direction. At the time, Network Rail insisted the . route was safe. But it failed to disclose the existence of a 2002 risk . assessment recommending the gates should lock automatically when trains . approached. The documents came to light only last year – three years after an inquest jury returned a verdict of accidental death. Plans to prosecute the company, which . is responsible for the rail network, were announced subsequently and it . admitted three health and safety charges yesterday. It is facing an unlimited fine after . magistrates said the £30,000 penalty they could impose was insufficient . and passed sentencing to a crown court. Olivia’s father Chris, 63, said . afterwards: ‘Network Rail withheld documents from us and obviously that . makes us angry. They withheld documents from official inquiries, they . withheld documents from the coroner. ‘This is not going to end with the . sentence. We still have a lot of questions we want answered. Who knew . about this? How high up did the cover-up go?’ Charlotte’s father Reg, 54, added: ‘In . the aftermath of the accident, Network Rail claimed the girls had acted . recklessly and that somehow their youthful exuberance led directly to . their deaths. ‘I never believed that they were the . architects of their own terrible end. It has taken six years to reveal . the truth of what happened. Charlie and Liv would be alive today had . Elsenham station had proper safety measures in place.’ Reg Thompson (left), father of Charlotte, alongside Chris Bazlinton, Olivia's father, speaks outside Basildon Magistrates' Court after winning their six-year legal battle . Tributes are still being placed at the crossing where the girls died . Elsenham Station: The girls were killed in December 2005 as pedestrian gates at a railway level crossing were unlocked. This was the scene a year later . Olivia and Charlotte were killed on December 3, 2005, as they crossed a footpath leading to Elsenham station platform. The crossing was fitted with warning lights and ‘yodel’ sounding alarms. A London to Cambridge train passed over the crossing with the red lights and yodel sounding - a warning for foot passengers not to cross. After the train passed, the lights remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, travelling from Birmingham to Stansted Airport in Essex, was going to pass through the station. The girls opened the unlocked wicket gates and walked on to the crossing. They were both struck by the Stansted train and killed. In November last year, the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) announced that it would prosecute Network Rail over those deaths after reopening its investigation into the accident. The move came after the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) joined the girls' families in demanding a public inquiry amid claims that two safety documents were not disclosed to the Essex Coroner at the 2007 inquest into the deaths. Outside court, Reg Thompson, . Charlotte's father, said: 'The horror of that day is always with us and . the huge hole in our lives left by Charlie will never be filled.

'In . the aftermath of the accident, Network Rail claimed the girls had acted . recklessly and that somehow their youthful exuberance led directly to . their deaths. 'I never . believed that they were the architects of their own terrible end. It has . taken six years to reveal the truth of what happened.' The court hearing comes just days after after 15-year-old Katie Littlewood  was hit by a train at Johnson's Footpath Crossing in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on Saturday. Her death, which is being treated as a ‘tragic accident’ by both Network Rail and British Transport Police (BTP), occurred just a few miles down the same stretch of track where Olivia and Charlotte were killed six years ago. Network Rail said investigations were . carried out on the crossing immediately after the 11.45am incident and . showed no faults with the safety measures in place. Network . Rail said it would plead guilty to failing to carry out a sufficient . risk assessment, failing to properly control protective measures at the . level crossing and failing to prevent the girls from being exposed to . the risks which led to their deaths. Charlotte's father Reg (left), who collated letters to his daughter in a book, and Olivia's father Chris (right) have pledged to continue their fight for improved safety on railways . A man has been fined £800 for allowing a little boy to open gates at a railway crossing. A train driver saw the boy on the railway line and a 4x4 car driven by Lee Mason, 39, reversing from the track as the train travelled at 47mph towards the private crossing, magistrates at Dolgellau, Gwynedd, heard. A telephone to check whether it was safe to cross the Llechryd private crossing near Talybont, Barmouth, had not been used when the child went to open the gates last August, as it should have been. Richard Edwards, prosecuting for the British Transport Police. The court heard that train driver Gareth Owen sounded the horn and applied the emergency brakes, but knew that the train would not be able to stop before reaching the crossing. 'The train driver estimated that the boy, with his hands over his ears, was within three feet of the train as it passed him. The vehicle being driven by Mason had managed to reverse back,' Mr Edwards told the court. The court heard that when the train driver spoke to Mason of Mansfield Woodhouse, Mansfield, the defendant said he had not used the telephone and the boy had opened the first gate and was walking over the railway to open the gate on the other side of the line. He pleaded guilty to unlawfully allowing the boy to open level crossing gates without permission and therefore endangering the safety of railway passengers or persons using the railway crossing. Iestyn Davies, defending, said his 'accepts full responsibility for not using the telephone to check to see if the railway line was clear'. Court chairman Caerwyn Roberts said: 'This is far more serious and is the most serious case involving railway crossing that had been before this court in recent years,' he said. 'Our fine of £800 reflects your early guilty plea and remorse,' said the chairman. Costs of £100 were also imposed. An order was made preventing the publication of the boy’s details. Prosecutor Sarah LeFerve said the . magistrates' court's power to impose a maximum fine of £30,000 for the . offences was insufficient, given their gravity. The Crown court can impose an unlimited fine for each count. In May last year Network Rail was fined £3million  for safety failing at a set of points which caused the fatal Potters bar crash in May 2002. Defence counsel Prashant Popat said the company had already apologised to the families and taken steps to improve safety. In a statement released after the . hearing, David Higgins, chief executive of Network Rail, said: 'Last . year I apologised in person to the families of Olivia and Charlotte. 'Today, . Network Rail repeats that apology. In this tragic case, Network Rail . accepts that it was responsible for failings, and therefore we have . pleaded guilty.' It added: 'Nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by Olivia and Charlotte's families but I have promised them that we are committed to making our railway as safe as possible. 'In recent years we have reassessed all of our 6,500 level crossings and closed over 500. I accept that there is still a long way to go but we are making progress.' Network Rail will be sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on March 15. A spokesman for the ORR said: 'Network Rail pleaded guilty to two charges under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999, and guilty to one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 'Our thoughts are with the families of Olivia and Charlotte. ORR will do everything it can to ensure that the prosecution proceeds as quickly as possible.' Mr Bazlinton's statement added: 'Above all, we shall be watching closely to make sure that the changes Network Rail has promised to improve level crossing safety are carried out. 'Visions and plans are all very well, but it is putting them in place that matters. 'I have confidence that David Higgins is the person to achieve change - his record of delivery at English Partnerships and the Olympic Delivery Authority bodes well for the future. 'Tina Ineson, Olivia's mother, accepted an invitation from David Higgins last June to become Level Crossing User Champion: she won't take ""no"" for an answer.'","13-year-old Charlotte Thompson and Olivia Bazlinton, 14, were hit by a train at Elsenham station in 2005 .

An Arizona mother is furious after her two-year-old son's former daycare center posted a public warning with his picture online accusing him of 'biting'. After kicking little Ryan Jones out of Tiny Tots in Chandler for allegedly biting a child, co-owner Carmella Sul uploaded an image of the toddler to Craigslist with a severe warning: 'Beware of this kid, he bites'. 'I was sick as any parent would be if they saw their child on the internet,' Ryan's distressed mother Maggie Jones told Dateline’s Wild Wild Web program, which investigated complaints against the family-run center. Devastated: Arizona's Maggie Jones, left, was horrified after seeing a Craigslist post warning people her two-year-old son Ryan was a 'biter' The online feud began when Jones' five-year-old son, who also attended the center, started complaining he wasn't getting enough food. Jones said she contacted Sul, telling her the daily fee should cover all meals. Soon after, both boys were kicked out. 'She [Sul] stated that my two-year-old had bit another child,' Jones told Dateline. Jones, disappointed after initially believing the center was 'perfect' for her boys, posted an online listing warning parents to stay away from Sul. That's when Sul retaliated, posting Ryan’s photo online and warning other daycare operators that he was a 'biter'. But Sul took the matter even further by sending Jones an aggressive text message: 'Your kid is a dog and he keeps biting'. Family-owned: Mother and daughter Tiny Tots owners Maria Sul, left, and Carmella Sul, right, have been accused of bullying parents . This was the Chandler, Arizona, home Maria and Carmella Sul used to operate Tiny Tots daycare center . While the state of Arizona has reportedly not received any formal complaints against the business owners, Dateline found several parents have had run-ins with them. Michelle Thomas claimed her two sons were also kicked out of Tiny Tots without warning because the Suls claimed her 19-month-old son put another child in a . chokehold. When Sul thought that Thomas had posted a complaint online, the daycare owner emailed her saying: 'I hope you die and your kid.' 'To watch people’s children and you tell somebody’s mother . you hope them and their child die,' Thomas told Dateline. 'That’s . . . I don’t . know about that.' Dateline also alleged the Suls should have applied for a childcare license because they had been caring for at least 10 children at any one time. The center doesn't need a license if they look after a maximum of four children at a time. Dateline spoke to Kelly Brown, a mother who removed her children from Tiny Tots after seeing more than a dozen kids at the center. 'I visited about two weeks ago and when I went in I counted 22 children,' Brown said. 'Every seat in the dining room was covered. Every spot on the couch, on the floor. And there were five kids by the gate.' The Suls admitted there were sometimes more kids at their center than there should be. 'Usually there are five kids,' Maria Sul told Dateline. 'We did have some extra ones today.' Maria Sul also said she remembered Ryan Jones: 'The little biter. He likes biting kids.'

Laura Gallagher was listed as a parent on Alanna’s obituary following the discovery of her tarp-covered dead body in a Saginaw, Texas intersection July 1, as were two other men. She spoke publicly Friday for the first time since Alanna’s death. Now, just three weeks into her grief, Gallagher and her unique family—none of whom, police say, are prime suspects in the chilling case—must deal with the fear they are being targeted. Shocked: Laura Gallagher spoke to the press for the first time Monday after arsonists torched her car and a memorial to her murdered 6-year-old daughter . Missed: Neighbors said the often saw 6-year-old Alanna riding her scooter down her street in the quiet neighborhood before her July 1 murder . Around 2:15am Friday morning, the family was startled to hear a pounding on the door. ‘Fortunately, a neighbor had come over to wake us,’ Gallagher told KXAS. ‘We'd been asleep upstairs.’ As they slept, a family car was torched along with a small memorial that had been set up in honor of Alanna. As news cameras rolled Friday, charred remnants of the car could still be seen in the driveway. Unthinkable: Gallagher, who is in a polyamorous relationship with two other men who identify as the late Alanna's parents, stands over charred remnants of her car . Sad: A small memorial placed nearby in Alanna's honor was also torched early Friday . Down the street, a memorial of stuffed animals and other children’s toys was also set on fire. ‘It's very frightening,’ said Gallagher. Police are struggling with the issue, as well. ‘It's kind of hard to say what people's intent was in this situation,’ Saginaw police spokesman Officer Damon Ing said. ‘[It's] just very disheartening that someone would do this to the family.’ Coping: Neighbors quickly set up a makeshift memorial on the curb for the little girl. It was torched along with the family's car Friday . Positive outcome? Police released footage from the day of Alanna's murder soon after the arson Friday, hoping someone will recognize these two black cars . As for Gallagher, she said she just wants the person caught. ‘I don't want this to happen to any other family,’ she said. As unthinkable as this arson appears, Gallagher hopes some clue was left behind that could ultimately lead to the capture of Alanna’s killer. Police hauled the burnt car away Friday to investigate the arson further. Investigators probing her death seized more than 100 items from the family's home, but said none of the three parents are prime suspects. However, Saginaw Police Chief Roger Macon added that no one has been eliminated as a suspect, The Star-Telegram reported. Officers took items from the home as well as from three vehicles parked outside.

'As with . any criminal investigation, each of the people closest to the victim is . being considered, and their actions investigated.'

According to technology site The Verge, sources familiar with Microsoft's Surface plans revealed the company had taken the steps to try and get its wearable tech to market. These claims follow rumours that emerged in April which stated Microsoft was working on a touch-enabled watch as the company aims to cash in on the anticipated boom in wearable electronics. It's time: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates shows off the firm's smartwatch technology in 2004. Now it has been claimed the company has asked Asian firms to ship 1.5-inch displays for a potential watch-style device . Nothing has been officially confirmed by Microsoft yet, but rumours claim: . The watch will have a removable band that will come in a red, black, yellow and blue. It will be made of oxynitride aluminium, a translucent form of the metal. Microsoft's smartwatch is also said to run a version of Windows 8. Prototypes of the device are being tested by the Surface team and the watch could have the connector featured on the tablet. At the time, the computing giant reportedly asked .

According to the Financial Times (FT), the tech firm wants to bring in fresh pairs of eyes to look at the device because its in-house developers may be struggling to solve the problems. A source told the paper that Apple started 'hiring aggressively' in recent weeks, which suggests that the smartwatch is nowhere near being ready for release and could be pushed back to next year. Some gadgets such as Nike’s FuelBand are intended to measure physical exercise, while others can perform similar functions to a smartphone such as receiving text messages or taking photos.

It's a noise heard in playgrounds across the country by children pretending to fire lasers at each other, but the phrase 'pew pew pew' almost became the activation command for Google Glass. Google's wearable computer is controlled by voice commands and in order to get Google Glass to listen and accept an instruction, an activation phrase is needed. The current phrase is 'okay glass' followed by the command, but managers from Google mulled over more humorous alternatives, such as 'pew pew pew', 'hear me now' and 'glassicus'. Wearers of Google Glass can say a phrase to activate the voice command feature and get the wearable tech to listen and accept instructions. The current phrase is 'okay glass' yet reports claims firm considered alternative 'hotwords' including 'Pew Pew Pew' and Go Go Glass' Google Glass' voice command system was first revealed in February when the search giant released a video that showed a user taking a photo by saying 'okay glass, take a picture'. Similarly, videos can be recorded when a user says 'okay glass, record a video.' The 'okay glass' phrase is known as a Google 'hotword.' According to Emil Protalinski at The Next Web, the hotword idea emerged out of a conversation between Google Glass' marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg, and its product manager, Mat Balezin, in April 2012. Apparently 'okay glass' was the hotword suggested by Rosenberg and this was the phrase used in the final product. She also reportedly revealed that there were more humorous suggestions for the hotword, including: 'pew pew pew,' 'glassicus' and one that Inspector Gadget might enjoy, 'go go Glass'. 'Hear me now,' 'listen up Glass' and 'Glass alive' were also considered. Google Glass (pictured) is a high-tech pair of spectacles with in-built hands-free video camera and internet access. Google's marketing manager came up with its 'okay glass' hotword to access the camera and video functions of the computer during a discussion with the product manager . Source: Google . It could become the norm to hear Google Glass-wearing people saying 'okay glass' followed by a command. One of the alternative phrases might have sounded stranger in public. In less humorous news, Lookout, a security research firm uncovered a vulnerability of Google Glass that let hackers use QR codes to gain control of the wearable computer. However, Google was quick to patch the problem, The Verge reported. The security firm believes that if hackers had exploited the vulnerability, they would have been able to use a malicious QR code to force Google Glass to connect to a Wi-Fi access point and allow them to read all the data flowing to and from the headset. A young Californian hacker called Stephen Balaban is building an alternative operating system for his Google Glass that is not controlled by Google, according to NPR. His aim is to make it possible to use his Google Glass for a whole host of things that Google has not thought of or intended. It is feared by many that the use of Google Glass with its intelligent cameras will erode our privacy. Hackers have managed to use facial recognition on Google Glass and create software that allows a wearer to take a photo by winking . Many people fear that the use of Google Glass with its intelligent cameras will erode people's privacy. A recent study by web hosting firm . Rackspace and Goldsmiths University found that one in five adults in the . UK wants to ban Google Glass completely, because of such privacy concerns. According to Google, the device has been designed so that it is obvious to passers by how the device is being used. For example, people can hear camera voice commands or see someone tap their temple before the screen lights up. But hackers are gradually proving that they are able to modify the device, which has put Google in a tricky situation of trying to welcome creative new ideas that could progress its product while maintaining its stance on being pro-privacy. Mr Balaban said he got a frosty response from Google when he told them that he had built an app that enables Google Glass to use facial recognition to identify people.

When concerned residents in Northumberland felt an ominous rumbling and saw buildings shake near their homes this afternoon, many suspected a minor earthquake had hit the north east. But after contacting the authorities to report the apparent quake, eyewitnesses in Berwick were told the cause of the tremor came from the sky, rather than the ground. The British Geological Survey revealed that the likely cause of the rumbling and shaking buildings was a 'sonic event' from a pair of military jets flying over the area. A picture taken above Alnwick, Northumberland, shows the vapour trails . left in the sky after the sonic boom which rocked the region.

Shortly after the incident, a Northumbria Police spokesperson said reports had flooded in from people who felt the earth move. The force added that there were no injuries or reports of any damage. The British Geological Survey said it had received calls from people in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear, with reports including 'I heard a low frequency rumble', that the 'whole house shook' or the caller 'heard a very loud boom'.

Price: £39.99 / $58 (RRP) For five years, gamers have been itching to get behind the wheel of another GRID game. And although DIRT: Showdown was a dead end, Codemasters are now back on track. Whereas Showdown didn't quite know what it was, Grid 2's confidence is there for all to see. Be that in the glossy TV-style presentation, stirring cinematic audio or its garish LiveRoutes mechanic. In similar vein to the brilliant Forza Horizon, Codemasters have tried to glue the single-player career together with a narrative. You play an up-and-coming racer, who's part of the World Series Racing (WSR) competition. The fast and the furious: Other drivers will try and ram you off the road if you drive aggressively . You'll have to go through different leagues, racing in a variety of locations from the Middle East, US and Asia - taking part in challenges such as timed laps and point-to-point races. It's a simple premise, but the high-quality ESPN endorsed cutscenes throughout help give an air of authenticity about what you're doing. Sadly, the buzz of watching your fan base grow is hampered by the limited number of tracks becoming overly similar a few league wins in. Thankfully, LiveRoutes - where courses are changed randomly as you play through them - helps stave off some of this monotony - even though it's not entirely successful. Grid veterans will struggle with just how ruthlessly a circuit can change - bombarding you with hairpins and tight bends that make it nigh on impossible not to crash. A flashback mechanic does allow you to wind back time if you've crashed or fluffed a corner - but you can only use it a limited number of times. Thankfully, GRID 2's gameplay is fantastic - walking an elegant tightrope between arcade racer and simulator. Mastering the drift, though, takes longer than you would imagine. Car models look very impressive and the sense of speed is well-realised. Add to the mix lush, dynamic environments and a medley of growling exhaust notes, and it's a compelling package in full flight. Away from the track and there's plenty of customisation. You can create your own races and change the appearance of your car but sadly, performance-related mods are saved just for multiplayer. One track mind: To get the best out of GRID 2, you must learn how to master the drift . Minor gripes aside, GRID 2 is still a great racing game - and a worthy lap of honour for our aging current gen consoles. GRID 2 is out now.

Desperate plea: While Clint Heichel, left, was too overcome with emotion to speak to reporters, her mother, right, begged for the 21-year-old's safe return before her remains were found on Friday . Police said they recovered potential . evidence during searches of Dodge Park and Larch Mountain, remote, . forested places east of Gresham where they believe the SUV was on Tuesday . morning. 'There has been . property recovered at different locations, but we can't positively say . that that property is related to this,' Chief Junginger . said. Ritmiller said her . daughter's nickname within the family is 'Mama,' because she's always . been like a second mother to everybody, including her six siblings. Ritmiller . added that her daughter was a hard worker, a devoted Jehovah's Witness . with a 'heart as big as the sun,' and her greatest hope was to have . children of her own. 'She's wanted to be a mama since she was two years old and I brought her sister home,' she said. 'That was just her biggest hope, to have babies.' Grandjean said police received 25 phone tips on Wednesday and another 21 that night. Two dozen detectives were assigned to the case that had been classified as a suspicious disappearance. Though he acknowledged that the first 48 hours are very important in a missing-person case, he stressed that the case is far from cold. Tragic: Six hours after she left home, her car was found with a smashed window in a parking lot . Extensive search: Clint alerted authorities after Heichel failed to turn up for work on Tuesday in Gresham, Oregon . 'The leads and the evidence we've . gathered have not gone cold, and so we continue to push forward until we . find Whitney,' he on Thursday. Friends . said that a gas station attendant claimed that Heichel's vehicle, which was found with the window smashed in, had been driven . by a man, who was acting 'suspicious and hurried', as Heichel sat in the . passenger seat. Her husband, Clint Heichel, told Fox 12 that he learned of his wife's disappearance when her manager at Starbucks called to say she had not arrived for her shift. 'She got dressed this morning, normal everything. Kissed me goodbye, said goodbye,' he said on Tuesday. '(At) about 8:15 her boss called me and said, ""Hey, I was just curious, did . Whitney decide to be sick or not feeling well? Have you seen her or . talked to her?""' he told KATU. Mr Heichel tried calling and texting her, but she did not respond. Abandoned: Her black 1999 Ford Explorer was found in a WalMart parking lot four miles from her home with a window smashed. It looked as if it had been rummaged through, friends said . Targeted: Police confirmed that her SUV was seen at a gas station before the vehicle was found in a car park . Worried, he drove to her parents' home . and then to a hospital in the area, as well as calling family and . friends to see if anyone knew of her whereabouts. When they could provide no further . information, he called police to report her missing at 9.56am, and . friends and family began distributing flyers and searching for her. Detectives learned that her vehicle, a black 1999 Ford Explorer, was seen and her ATM card was used at a gas station around four miles from her home at 9.14am. Her . missing poster claimed an attendant said the man driving the car bought a small amount of gas, but police could not confirm this. At 1pm, family and friends looking for . Heichel found her vehicle, with the passenger window smashed, at a Walmart in Wood Village. Details: Family and friends had been handing out flyers in the area in the hopes of gathering information before her body was found . It appeared as if someone had rummaged through the car, according to her missing poster. 'The passenger side window was busted . out, the backseats were down, there was mud on her tires, which it . wasn't that way the night before,' Clint Heichel said. 'It just is weird that we found her truck, completely off the path that she would take to go to work.' He added: 'Anyone who has a loved one or is . married knows if your spouse goes missing and there's no word... I don't . know what to say, I don't know what to think, I don't know what to do.' In their investigation, Gresham police looked at surveillance . video showing the SUV at the gas station, but said the video was poor quality and detectives were unable to see who was driving the car. Family and friends conducted an extensive search for the young woman, including setting up Facebook groups.","Police arrest 24-year-old male neighbour over aggravated murder .

For the royals there is no better way to celebrate a high profile state visit than with British pomp and ceremony. But while most seemed happy to stick to tradition at Windsor Castle today it appeared not everyone was singing from the same hymn sheet. That's because a glittering military display went slightly awry as one horse decided to throw its rider to the floor as it made an embarrassing run for it. Scroll down for video . Attention seeking: The skittish horse seems desperate to unseat its . rider causing a few heads to turn as they try and get back in position . Bolt out of the blue: The horse, having unseated its rider, makes a run for it during a military display for the Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of Kuwait . There was nothing senior royals could . do as the horse bolted in front of their guests from Kuwait during the . display from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. It . had been organised to kick-off the Queen's welcoming of the Amir of the . middle eastern country as part of the leader's three-day official trip. Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was formally welcomed during the somewhat hampered ceremony staged in Windsor, as Britain bids to strengthen its already strong relations with the Middle East nation. Rebel: The horse could be seen moving out of position during the precession before it unseated its rider . Awkward: The rider looks suitably embarrassed after he was thrown off his horse, while others seemed to want to capture it on film . Professional: He decides there is nothing left to do than make the best of a bad situation and stands at attention . The Queen, Duke of Edinburgh and Prince of Wales were present to greet the 83-year-old Arab leader, who is likely to see the visit as both a personal and political highlight of his career. Handshakes between the British and Kuwaiti heads of state were made in the centre of Windsor near one of the town’s two stations as well-wishers looked on. But the full ceremonial greeting came within historic Windsor Castle’s quadrangle where the 1st Battalion Irish Guards were formed as the guard of honour. The royal party arrived at the castle - said to be the Queen’s favourite home - in a carriage procession accompanied by the dazzling sight of a sovereign’s escort provided by the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment in their breastplates and plumed helmets. Already waiting was the Amir’s . delegation, which included his government’s finance, foreign and . commerce ministers in their flowing robes. Following tradition Philip, dressed in a . morning suit, top hat and carrying an umbrella, escorted the Arab . leader to inspect the guard of honour lined up in two rows in front of . the royal party. The Amir walked past the massed ranks in . their bear skins and winter coats and at the end of the line . Philip gestured towards him to review the soldiers standing in the rear.

One of the most acclaimed ballet dancers of our time has hinted that the classical art is in crisis. 'We need more girls... girls are non-existent,' said Carlos Acosta, 40, of the lack of top-level female ballet dancers, those of an equal stature to himself. The Royal Ballet school of London agrees with him, revealing that while over the last few years overwhelmingly more girls apply in younger years, by age 16 there are more boys than girls actually studying at the School. 'Our directors have found it more of a . challenge to find really talented girls in the past few years. The wave . of talented boys has continued as the myth that ballet is for girls is . even more widely dispelled,' said a spokesperson for the school. 'We need more girls... girls are non-existent,' said Carlos Acosta of female ballet dancers sticking with the art . As young girls dream to star in Swan Lake they find the reality is not so glamorous. Women in the profession are notoriously pushed to their limits as they are encouraged to keep their weight down yet perform extreme physical challenges. Acosta, speaking with the Independent, posed solutions to the problem of falling numbers. 'If you find talented young dancers, then give them a scholarship,' he says. 'Not just one or two people but all the talented dancers. That way we have more chance to deliver to the world the next Darcey Bussell or Tamara Rojo.' And if Britain can't deliver top-level professionals, he calls on us to look abroad. 'If you don’t have talent in your own backyard, you must go and find it. Whether it comes from Italy, Nigeria or South America it doesn’t matter. We should do more to look elsewhere and give people a chance to flourish.' Acosta danced his Romeo to Tamara Rojo's Juliet in the 2011 and 2013 production of the Shakespearean tragic love story. He has a daughter of his own, little Aila Acosta-Holland, with Charlotte Holland. Acosta calls for scholarships to be given out to all talented dancers, not just one or two, in the hope of finding the next Tamara Rojo (pictured at an event, left, and performing with Acosta, right) or Darcey Bussell .

"By . Natasha Courtenay-Smith . PUBLISHED: . 16:06 EST, 15 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:50 EST, 15 July 2013 . Worries: 5ft 3in Kate Miller in 2010 when she dropped from 8st to 6 st . When Kate Miller started at university and rapidly lost weight, she thought the change in her lifestyle was most likely to blame. 'I'd gone from enjoying healthy home-cooked food living at home with my parents to living a typical student's life in Leeds - going out five nights a week and surviving on takeaways and pot noodles,' she recalls. But that Christmas, with Kate having dropped from 8 st to 6 st (she is 5ft 3in), her friends and family began to fear she was in the grip of an eating disorder. 'My mum started weighing me each time I came home, and with my weight dropping off, she said if I kept losing weight she'd pull me out of uni,' says Kate. 'I always said to her I didn't understand it because I was eating more than ever. But because I was thirsty all the time, I also kept slipping away after meals to go to the loo. It looked suspicious. 'Then I heard her and my dad talking about how worried they were about me, and my friends were asking me all the time why I was losing weight.' The family were very worried Kate might have anorexia. 'I knew everyone thought I had an eating disorder, which was upsetting,' says Kate. 'But far from having an eating disorder, I was hungry all the time so actually eating more than ever. Some days, I'd eat 4,000 calories - but the weight was still falling off me. 'At the same time, I was experiencing double vision and dizzy spells and fainting. One night, shortly after Christmas, I went to the toilet at 2am, fainted and woke up at 7am on the bathroom floor. 'When I tried to Google my symptoms, the only thing I could really think it might be was anaemia.' Kate was also suffering from an ankle injury which wouldn't heal. 'I'd sprained it on a night out in November. I thought it would take a few days to heal, but it just didn't improve, and I ended up having to wear a tubigrip all the time.' Kate was one of the estimated 850,000 people in the UK with undiagnosed diabetes, where blood glucose (also known as blood sugar) levels become too high. Glucose comes from the carbohydrates we eat and the body uses it as fuel. The hormone insulin breaks it down and transports it into the cells. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin to help glucose enter your body's cells - or the body becomes resistant to the insulin it does produce, says Pav Kalsi, clinical advisor to the charity Diabetes UK. As a result, glucose stays in your blood, where it cannot be used as fuel and also harms blood vessels, nerves and organs. Long-term complications from poorly-controlled diabetes include nerve damage, kidney failure and blindness. There are two forms of diabetes. Type 1, which develops rapidly, occurs when the insulin-producing cells in the body have been destroyed. Shock: Kate in February 2011, when she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes . 'We do not know for certain why this happens, but type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition, in which the immune system mistakes the body's insulin producing cells as harmful and attacks them,' says Mr Kalsi. 'The body is unable to produce any insulin at all, and the patient's deterioration is rapid and very visible. Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age but usually appears before the age of 40, and especially in childhood.' Symptoms include frequent urination, feeling thirsty and tired, and weight loss (because when it's starved of fuel, the body breaks down its own fat and muscle). Type 2 diabetes develops at a much slower pace, and occurs when the body can still make some insulin, but not enough, or when the insulin that is produced does not work properly. Mr Kalsi says: 'This form of diabetes usually occurs in people over the age of 40, and is linked to risk factors such as being overweight, which causes the body to become resistant to insulin. 'It takes people longer to realise that they have type 2 diabetes, or go for check-ups, because they mistake the symptoms such as being tired or needing the loo more as a part of getting older. Most of the people with undiagnosed diabetes have type 2 diabetes, but some have type 1.' With her weight loss, dizzy spells and continuing fainting, Kate finally went to see her GP in February. He measured her blood sugar levels and sent her straight to hospital. 'It was really frightening,' recalls Kate. 'I thought I was just going for a check-up, and had even taken a friend with me. Next thing I knew the doctor was talking about calling an ambulance. 'In the end, I went in a taxi and my mum was racing down the motorway to Leeds from her home in Newcastle to meet me there.' Kate underwent tests and within a matter of hours was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. 'It was devastating and very frightening. I'd heard of diabetes, but I didn't fully understand what it was and it sounded as though my entire life was about to change. The specialist was talking about me seeing a nutritionist and having a check-up every two months and I was terrified. 'My mum was in tears. She felt she should have known, and prevented it, but the nurses kept telling her there would have been nothing she could have done. My mum also said she was so sorry she'd thought I had an eating disorder. It was such a shock, especially as there isn't a history of diabetes in my family.' To this day, Kate has no idea why she suddenly developed diabetes, but it is thought the autoimmune condition could be linked to a virus, or she could have had a genetic predisposition to it. Kate was told it was the high sugar levels that had prevented her ankle from healing, as the body's immune cells - responsible for healing - do not work properly when blood sugar is high. Two weeks later she underwent an MRI scan to check if her high blood sugar levels had caused any long-term damage to her organs or nervous system. It had, and she now has to wear glasses because her retinas - the light sensitive area at the back of each eye - have been damaged, a common complication with the condition. Living life to the full: Kate know she has to be more responsible since her diagnosis but she's looking forward to a healthy, normal future . She also had to immediately start insulin injections - which means counting her carbohydrate intake to calculate how much insulin she needs. (Patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with medication in tablet form, alongside diet and lifestyle changes, although some end up needing insulin injections.) The good news is diabetes can be successfully managed over the long term. 'If patients make the right diet changes, take insulin and attend their appointments, it's likely they can avoid all the complications of diabetes,' says Mr Kalsi. Today, two years after diagnosis, Kate - who has recently graduated with a degree in journalism - has to inject herself with insulin up to ten times daily, depending on what she has eaten. Kate says: 'Because I was a student at the time, I wanted to still feel fairly free and not stick to too rigid a diet, so I focused on learning really accurate carbohydrate counting. 'I can eat whatever I want: I just have to inject the right amount of insulin, into either my tummy or my leg, to cover the carbohydrates I've eaten. That means on some days, if I eat salad and lean meat, I only inject once, but on another day, if I had a burger in a bun, I might inject many times. 'The first time I injected I was nervous, but you quickly get used to it.' Kate's weight is now back to 8 st and her ankle is fully healed. 'I've got reading glasses now, which is a bit annoying, but I just tell myself how lucky I am,' she says. 'If I hadn't gone to the GP when I did, my blood sugar levels would have escalated further and I could have slipped into a coma. 'The consequences then would have been far more serious. I still try to live my life to the full. I have to be more responsible than I did before, but I'm coming to terms with living with a chronic condition. I'm looking forward to a bright, normal and perfectly healthy future.' diabetes.org.uk .","An estimated 850,000 people in the UK are undiagnosed diabetics .

A young violinist who could no longer play after her broken arm healed at a bent angle is now back performing on her favourite instrument thanks to a long flexible nail inserted into her forearm. Eliza Andre-Browning, 14, broke her right arm during a PE lesson and could no longer play the violin after her arm healed at a bent angle. Her parents were so concerned they took her for a second opinion to a surgeon at Southampton Children’s Hospital to ask if there was anything he could do to help her continue her musical career. Surgeon Ed Gent then re-broke her arm and fixed it in place using a special titanium nail. After a few weeks of rest, her arm healed in the correct position and now Eliza is back playing her violin. Playing again: Eliza Andre-Browning, 14, can play her violin again thanks to surgeons inserting a flexible nail in her forearm after her broken arm healed in a bent position . Before and after: Eliza Andre-Browning's right forearm was left bent in the middle after it healed from a break, pictured right, but it is now straight again after a flexible nail was inserted by surgeons, pictured left . She has recently received the most promising player award from the orchestra that she plays with. Her mother, Rebecca Andre-Browning, 46, a teaching assistant, said: ‘We are just so thrilled. The operation has given Eliza her confidence back and she can play the violin again, which is wonderful to hear. ‘She was devastated when she broke her arm and couldn’t play the violin afterwards. Her arm was bent at such an angle that it made it impossible for her to play. Now she is back playing and loving every minute of it.’ Eliza suffered the injury whilst having a PE lesson at school in November 2011, when she tripped over a trampoline. She went to Salisbury General Hospital where her arm was put in plaster for eight weeks. But when the plaster was removed, Eliza’s arm had healed in a bent position, an occurrence which is rare but not unheard of and made it impossible for her to straighten it. Jumping for joy: Eliza Andre-Browning had feared that she would never be able to play her instrument again . Mrs Andre-Browning, who lives with . husband Gerard, 50, a primary school support worker, in Salisbury, said: . ‘We were shocked when the plaster cast was removed as she couldn’t . straighten her arm at all. ‘Eliza was very embarrassed about what it looked like, so she wore long sleeved tops all the time. But it also meant that she couldn’t play her violin anymore. She had been a very promising violinist up until the accident. It was a lot for a 12 year old girl to cope with. ‘She’s been playing since the age of nine, and has already passed her grade four examination. She loves playing the violin and it was heartbreaking that she couldn’t play it anymore. She couldn’t rotate or straighten her arm at all.’ So Mrs Andre-Browning took Eliza back to see her GP in August last year, and she was referred to surgeon Ed Gent at Southampton Children’s Hospital. He said he would try and re-break her arm and fix it using the special long flexible nail. Delighted: Eliza Andre-Browning pictured with her mother Rebecca who took her to see specialist surgeon Ed Gent so she could have a chance to play her violin again . Mrs Andre-Browning said: ‘Eliza was so excited before her operation. We were nervous in case it didn’t work, but we wanted her to have the chance to play her violin again and live a normal life.’ The operation was carried out in November and was a success. She remained in a plaster cast for six weeks and when it was removed, her arm was perfectly straight. Eliza is now back playing her violin and is due to sit her grade five examination. She is also studying for her music GCSE exam and has just been awarded the Most Promising Player award from her orchestra. Mrs Andre-Browning said: ‘She is thrilled to be back playing her violin and its all thanks to the surgeon who has helped her achieve that. We are so grateful. ‘It is wonderful to hear her playing again. When her bone was so bent, we never thought it would be possible again. But now she can play beautifully again.’ Surgeon Ed Gent said: ‘We corrected her arm fracture and stabilised it with an intramedullary flexible nail.

Freed: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny embraces his wife Yulia at court in Kirov as he is released less than 24 hours after being jailed for five years for embezzlement . A lawyer who unmasked corruption among leaders of his United Russia party has been freed from jail - less than 24 hours after he was sentenced to five years for embezzlement. Alexei Navalny, 37, was released following a surprise request from prosecution lawyers who argued to free him because he is a candidate in the Moscow mayoral election later this year. They said that keeping him behind bars would deny him his right to seek election. Following a hearing that lasted less than an hour, a smiling Mr Navalny hugged his wife Yulia and thanked those supporters who protested against his imprisonment yesterday. The charismatic anti-corruption blogger was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled 16 million rubles (£330,000) of timber from state-owned company Kirovles in 2009 while he worked as an unpaid adviser to the provincial governor in Kirov, about 470 miles east of Moscow. Scroll down for video . His release, the conditions of which say he cannot leave Moscow, will extend until he has appealed his conviction. Mr Navalny, a popular blogger and corruption-fighting lawyer, rose to prominence among the opposition during a series of massive protests in Moscow against President Vladimir Putin's re-election to a third presidential term in March last year. His conviction prompted criticism from the United States and the European Union. The trial had been denounced by his supporters as a show trial ‘redolent of the Stalin era’. Prosecutors had asked for a six year sentence for the embezzlement which allegedly took place in the same year that Navalny started an anti-corruption blog against Putin. His jailing was widely seen as a tactic . to prevent him running for Moscow mayor this year and challenging Mr . Putin for the Kremlin in 2018. Delighted: The Russian leader, pictured with his wife Yulia, spent less than 24 hours in custody after prosecution lawyers requested his release . Support: As well as greeting his wife, Navalny also thanked those supporters who had protested against his jailing yesterday . Foreign Secretary William Hague blasted ‘the selective application of the rule of law in Russia’. Former Russian leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Michael McFaul, US Ambassador to Russia, also condemned the political use of courts. Navalny made his name by blogging about his investigations into corruption at state-owned companies where he owned shares, reaching hundreds of thousands of people. He and his team of lawyers and activists have plumbed property registers abroad to identify top officials and lawmakers who own undeclared foreign assets and hold foreign citizenship. Relief: Navalny and his wife both looked emotional following the hearing which lasted less than an hour in a Russian court . Thankful: Navalny greets journalists and supporters on the steps of the courtroom following his release . Navalny's blog quickly became an Internet sensation not only because of his exposures but because of its engaging illustrations, funny images and witty catchphrases. It was Navalny who first called the dominant United Russia party 'the party of crooks and thieves', a phrase that still dogs Kremlin loyalists. The opposition leader's investigations targeted a wide circle of Putin loyalists - from members of Parliament to state bankers - threatening to discredit the system of governance he has built. He was a leader of the wave of massive protest rallies that broke out in late 2011 after a national parliamentary election scarred by allegations of widespread fraud. Yesterday: A post on Navalny's Twitter account during the long verdict reading noted the thick packet of papers the judge was reading and said: 'We're going crazy while we listen' Defiant: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, centre, and his former colleague Pyotr Ofitserov, foreground, listen to the judge in a court in Kirov during yesterday's sentencing .

Ofitserov ran a timber trading company in Kirov during Navalny's time in the region.

Well-wishers: Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, right, shakes hands with opposition lawmaker Ilya Ponomarev before his sentencing . Navalny insists Opalev framed him out . of revenge.

When she fell pregnant in 2010 21-year-old Holly Griffiths didn't feel the same sense of joy that envelops most first-time mothers. Instead the long-term anorexic was terrified at the though of gaining weight in order to be able to carry a healthy baby. The pregnancy was a painful one that saw Holly having to cope with cracked ribs as her tiny frame struggled to cope with a growing baby but she desperately tried to gain weight and eventually gave birth to a healthy baby boy, named Dylan. Almost three years later Holly is pregnant again, and still in the grip of anorexia. At eight and a half months and weighing just 8st 1lb she will be induced on Monday. Today she appeared on This Morning to discuss her daily struggle to gain weight as she carries her baby. Anorexic Holly Griffiths (right) who is eight and a half months pregnant and anorexic appeared on This Morning today along with psychologist Emma Kenny (left) Talking about her first pregnancy Holly said: 'I didn't ever expect to get pregnant, I think it is pretty rare. 'I was at my darkest point when I got pregnant with Dylan. I was the thinnest I had ever been, I was the illest (sic) I had ever been. 'I had this massive guilt every time I ate because the anorexia still had a massive grip on me. And then I had massive guilt for not feeding, or not considering feeding my child. Holly Griffiths, 21, has battled anorexia since she was a child. She managed to give birth to a healthy baby boy called Dylan (pictured) when she was 19 and now is pregnant with a little girl she has named Isla . Despite being 32 weeks pregnant in these pictures Miss Griffiths . does not look as if she is pregnant at all. She has been  is trying to put on as . much weight as possible for her baby . Miss Griffiths, is pictured here at 32 weeks. She is trying to put weight on to ensure that baby Ilsa is born at a healthy weight when she is induced on Monday . 5ft 7in Holly was eight when she . started battling with her weight. She blames her condition on the . pressure to look skinny in a leotard while taking ballet classes. By 12 she had been admitted to a children’s psychiatric clinic weighing just 5st 5lb – about 3st underweight. When Holly was pregnant with Dylan, now aged two, she was so thin that one of her ribs cracked as the baby grew. She was induced at 37 weeks and gave birth after a labour of only ten minutes. Dylan weighed 5lb 10oz and, to her . relief, was healthy. ‘I was so lucky he was OK,’ she said. ‘I felt so . guilty I had put his life at risk.' Miss Griffiths admits that when she was told that she was pregnant with her first child Dylan she was terrified. She said she should have been over the moon but was upset she would not longer be able to control her weight . Miss Griffiths (pictured with fiance Harrison Bogbanovs after the birth of Dylan) was so small that when Dylan was in her womb he cracked her rib and started to crush her lungs. Because of this she was induced at 37 weeks . Miss Griffiths is pictured looking a slightly healthier weight while on holiday with her partner Harrison and baby Dylan. Miss Griffiths goes into periods of remission but is prone to relapses. Now, at 34 weeks pregnant, she has been battling to gain weight before she gives birth to her daughter, who she will name Isla, despite the severe morning sickness that saw her lose 18lb in the earlier stages. Normally, pregnant women are expected . to consume about 2,000 calories a day but Holly, who is engaged to the child's father, gym manager Harrison Bogbanovas, 24, makes do with . between 800 and 1,200, eating one slice of toast for breakfast, salad . for lunch, and plain pasta for dinner. Holly, from Greenwich, South London said: ‘I suffered terrible morning sickness which caused my weight to drop, triggering my anorexia. 'I had thoughts of purging but didn’t . need to, my body was reacting in its own way. This made eating a lot . easier, because I would just vomit it up anyway.’ 'I lost a massive amount of weight and then got put on a strict eating plan - nothing rich, spicy or creamy, I needed very simple, basic foods to stop me being sick.' Miss Griffiths (pictured, left, age six) developed anorexia when she was eight after ballet classes put pressure . on her to lose weight. She has fought the condition for years and has . gained a healthy weight for short periods of time. In summer last year . she relapsed (right) and plummeted to seven stone despite being 5'7"" Psychologist Emma Kenny who appeared on the show with Holly and hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford said: 'The natural inclination to wish to starve oneself is always present in the mentality of any anorexic. 'But what Holly's situation shows is that with intensive therapy and treatment and a belief system that becomes a positive one i.e. I have got to feed this child, the pregnancy can continue and you can have a healthy baby. Also the learning experience in that is that if you put your mind to it you can continue that behaviour and then in the long-term overcome this disorder.' Holly is carrying a girl that she has named Isla (pictured here in her 20-week scan). Doctors says the baby is doing well and is healthy despite her mother's low weight . Holly has had to see a high-risk maternity . doctor, throughout her pregnancy and a 4D scan of the child shows she . currently looks healthy. Holly said: 'I'm not better yet but having Dylan kept me eating three meals a day and kept me from really relapsing or regressing. In the future I'm going back to treatment and I hope to kick it for good, it's really important for me to be able to be something that my kids want to emulate. 'I’m desperate to recover so I can teach my kids a healthy way to approach food.

Pope Benedict XVI was surprised by a gust of wind as he crossed Bells Arch in the Vatican City for the general Audience at St. Peter's Square in May 2006 . Among those being confirmed by Pope Francis today included Emily Mulcahy and Edmond Roche, of Cork, in Ireland. The day was described as ‘unbelievable’ by Emily’s father Paul, who saw his daughter blessed by the new Pontiff. He said: ‘It was unbelievable. It’s very difficult to put something like this into words. I was very emotional at times. 'It was just very overwhelming. There were thousands of people at it. It was like when they announced the Pope was elected. It was absolutely incredible. When Pope Francis began to speak, you could hear a pin drop.’ Irish children Edmond Roche, (right), and Emily Mulcahy, (left) were among the 44 children confirmed by Pope Francis during a ceremony in St Peter's Square at the Vatican . Mr Mulcahy said he believes the Confirmation hasn’t sunk in with his daughter. He remarked: ‘It’s been such a roller coaster ride. We’re just walking on a high. She went up and was confirmed. He blessed her and she walked back down. He met her with the other children before it and he shook her hand and said hello.’ Emily chose the Confirmation name Bridget, while Edmond, appropriately enough, went for Francis. The students – who are both altar servers – were chosen during draws in their parishes. The diocese of Cloyne was invited by the Vatican to choose a boy and a girl to take part in the unique ceremony, just six weeks into the new Pope’s pontificate.","A strong gust of wind lifted Pope Francis' cap from his head .

It started with last year’s Olympic heroics and yesterday Britain was coming to accept the fact that we’re actually rather good at sport. For the second year in a row, the Union Jacks were waved in Paris as a British cyclist won the Tour de France. At Lord’s, England went two up in the Ashes series with a comprehensive demolition of Australia. And we even had a good chance of winning the Open, with Lee Westwood starting the day two shots ahead of the field although he had to settle for joint third with his countryman Ian Poulter after American Phil Mickelson played a blistering round to scoop the title. Chris Froome’s Tour de France victory follows that of Bradley Wiggins, who in 2012 became the first Briton to win the legendary trial of endurance. This year Sir Bradley – knighted after his subsequent Olympic glory – was injured and out of action. But his Team Sky colleague Froome, 28, was the favourite to win and did it in style. Britain’s six-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy said: ‘For Britain to have two riders winning the Tour de France back-to-back is fantastic for British cycling. ‘It is a huge achievement and I almost feel sorry for Chris because people are almost getting blasé about it. ‘People think it is another British winner so that is what we should expect – but if you take a step back and get some perspective, you can see what a monumental achievement it is for him to have done this . ‘Just a few years ago we did not have anyone who could podium but now we have two cyclists who can win the Tour in consecutive years, and what Chris has done is phenomenal.’ After 2,000 miles and 80 hours in the saddle, Froome, who started his career riding a BMX on dirt roads in Kenya, was roared towards the finishing line at the Arc de Triomphe by thousands of fans who had travelled from the UK. Winning combination: Chris Froome celebrates crossing the finish line in Paris with his Sky teammates after spending 83 hours in the saddle over the last three weeks . Riding to glory: The 28-year-old admitted he had 'worried every day' of the tour about the grueling course. He dedicated his win to his mother Jance, who died of cancer five years ago . The yellow-jerseyed rider was clutching a glass of champagne and cigar for some of the final ceremonial stage from Versailles as he mouthed the word ‘Magnificent!’ He toasted his Team Sky colleagues in an accompanying car, saying: ‘It’s difficult for me to put it into words. It’s been an amazing journey for me. The race has been a fight every single day.’ Among those watching the last stage of the competition was Froome’s Welsh-born fiancee Michelle Cound, who described his victory as ‘a dream come true for me too’. At Lord’s, England’s cricketers left Australia embarrassed as they won the second Test by 347 runs in what commentators described as a ‘demolition’ with a day to spare.

Brazen: Thieves made off $1.9m worth of Apple iPad minis from the JFK airport cargo hold - the same site as the 1978 Lufthansa heist which inspired mob film Goodfellas . A cargo worker has been arrested over the brazen theft of $1.9 million in iPad minis from JFK Airport, according to authorities. Federal agents arrested Renel Rene Richardson earlier this week because he allegedly made too many inquiries to co-workers about the incoming shipment of sought-after iPads, the NY Post reported. Richardson also asked about where forklifts might be found, according to court papers obtained by the NY Post. The daring crime occurred around midnight November 12, and the fork-lifting fugitives got away with about 3,600 iPad minis that were en route to China. The cargo site where the theft occurred is exactly the same building where $5 million in cash and nearly $900,000 worth of jewellery went missing on December 11, 1978 during a heist later made famous in the mob flick Goodfellas. Richardson worked in the Cargo Air Services building, and he had two co-conspirators in the crime, according to a criminal complaint filed in Brooklyn federal court and cited by the NY Post.Richardson is believed to have acted as a lookout, it was reported, while two unidentified individuals loaded two pallets of iPad mini's onto a truck. Local detectives zeroed in on Richardson after learning of his alleged questions about the iPad shipments and airport forklifts from co-workers, the NY Post said. Richardson was arrested by the FBI, and according to law-enforcement sources cited by the NY Post, he accompanied Port Authority detectives Wednesday night as they searched Long Island for the truck. It's not yet known if the $1.9m in iPad's have been recovered. Police suspected an inside job from the beginning, closely questioning all airport workers and giving three of them lie detector tests. The thieves were believed to have arrived at Building 261 around 11pm, in a white tractor trailer marked with the name CEVA on the side, it has been reported. They pulled up to a side of the airport building which faces onto a street and has less security than the other side. It is also accessible from the airport tarmac. Wise guys: The Lufthansa heist is ranked as America's largest haul of cash ever and inspired the Scorsese film Goodfellas . Goodfellas: The Martin Scorsese film was inspired by the infamous heist in which thieves made off with the equivalent of $21million . Cargo: The $1.9m worth of Apple iPad minis were taken from the JFK airport cargo hold . Airport sources believe someone let them into the area and then let them out after they grabbed the iPads. The iPad thieves might have gotten away with more, but were foiled by three other workers returning from dinner break. The crooks, who used the who . used the airport's own forklift to shift the haul of two pallets of . tablet computers into a nearby truck, had to leave behind three other . pallets full of valuable iPads. In the  Lufthansa heist $5 million in cash and nearly $900,000 was taken, which if adjusted for inflation would be some $21million today. The alleged mastermind of the robbery was Luchese crime-family associate James 'Jimmy the Gent' Burke. He allegedly got away with the crime after 'whacking' nearly all of his co-conspirators in the heist. The gangland bloodbath was recounted in one of the most famous sequences of the Martin Scorsese film GoodFellas, a film which has now reached cult status.","Feds always suspected an inside job; targeted overly-curious worker who allegedly asked too many questions about arrival of shipment .

It is expected to be the ‘must have’ new video game for youngsters, boasting some of the best-loved characters from Disney films. But to the dismay of parents, Disney Infinity comes with a potential price tag of more than £250 – and is said to put pressure on children to add a ‘never-ending’ string of extras. The interactive game works by placing collectible toy figures on a Disney Infinity Base – a portal that operates through an existing games console to ‘warp’ the character on to the screen. To infinity and beyond: The interactive game will be released next month and additional figures are set to be launched before Christmas, when the pressure to fork out for the 'must have' toy of the moment is at its peak . Starter packs, including the video game, base and three toy figures, are expected to cost between £50 and £60 on release next month. But it costs £12 to add each of the 17 other figurines available, and £4 for add-on packs that can improve strength and speed in the game. More figures are expected to be launched before Christmas, adding to the pressure on parents to give in to pester power. Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting advice site Netmums, said: ‘I do worry that at the moment so many parents are strapped for cash. ‘It’s not a cheap present – and to go back to school and find Little Johnny down the road has all the characters will make it hard. It is a never-ending thing.  Parents need to know what they’re signing up to.’ Concerns have also been raised about the £4 add-ons that can provide new powers or change the background of the game. Mrs Freegard said: ‘I’m not sure I like that your character can be better because your parents have more money.’ The Disney Infinity concept borrows heavily from Skylanders, a hugely successful game that has more than 100 collectible character figures in a similar price range. Bank of mum and dad: Concerns have been raised that the game's £4 extras are sold as adding strength and speed to the characters . The Disney Infinity starter packs come with the characters Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, Sulley from  Monsters University and Mr Incredible from The Incredibles. Additional play sets will feature ‘villains’, ‘sidekicks’ and characters from Disney’s latest live action film The Lone Ranger, starring Johnny Depp. Disney argues the game offers value because the figures can be traded between friends and used on different consoles such as the Xbox 360, Sony PS3 and Nintendo Wii. Constantly upgrading and expanding the game with  characters from existing and upcoming films means that it cannot become obsolete either, says the US movie giant. It is also claimed that the game educates youngsters as they learn ‘basic programming’ to create unique challenges, scenarios and mini games in its ‘Toy Box’ mode. Disney Infinity’s lead producer John Day said: ‘I have two boys, ages two and four, and I like  the idea that they can be learning about how to do logical connections using the toys in the Toy Box. ‘We can bring in toys like buttons and doorways, and you can connect the button to the doorway and have the button open the door when you step on it. ‘It seems very basic, but at the same time we’re talking about logical inputs and outputs. It really is a lightweight programming language.’ A Disney spokesman said: ‘Disney Infinity will deliver incredible value to consumers. ‘Each of the play sets features an original, true-to-property experience offering hours of gameplay and in the Toy Box mode, players will have endless possibilities to create unique challenges, scenarios and mini games. ‘In addition, there’s a lot of opportunity for exploration, multiplayer and other options that will extend play time and encourage replayability.’","Disney Infinity made up of interactive board, video game and toy figures .

New Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Sir Mike Richards, has called for hundreds of NHS patients to join inspection teams over next 2 years . Patients are being recruited to inspect hospitals as part of a drastic new measures to root-out poor care. They will form 15-strong squads with doctors and nurses which will carry out thorough investigations of all NHS trusts over the next two years. The Care Quality Commission yesterday unveiled plans of a major overhaul of the way it inspects hospitals following concerns that substandard care was being missed. On Tuesday, the Government announced that of the worst NHS 11 trusts were being put into special measures with teams of outside experts sent-in to make urgent improvements. It followed a major investigation of hospitals with high death rates which uncovered widespread failings including desperate shortages of nurses and doctors, a lack of compassion and poor hygiene standards. But it has since emerged that nine of these 11 failing trusts had previously been passed as safe by the CQC. Only two - Basildon and Thurrock, in Essex and Buckinghamshire Health Trust - had been given warning notices and told to they needed to make improvements. The CQC’s new chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, admitted yesterday (Weds) the previous CQC inspections had been ‘flawed.’ He said: ‘We acknowledge the system was flawed and we wouldn’t be changing it if it wasn’t.’ Sir Mike, who formerly worked as the Government’s cancer tsar improving diagnosis rates and treatment, added: ‘There is too much variation in the quality of care patients receive - poor hospitals need to up their game and learn from the best. ‘I will not tolerate poor or mediocre care.’ The watchdog has been repeatedly criticised for missing poor care and last month it emerged that it had passed the maternity unit at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria as safe even though babies and mothers had died unnecessarily. Under Sir Mike Richards' new leadership, patients will join forces with medical professionals to assess NHS hospitals. The methods used to grade each hospital trust will be similar to the system used by Ofsted when inspecting schools . And last month the chair of the CQC David Prior admitted that until recently policemen and firemen were being sent in to inspect hospitals rather than doctors and nurses. From August, teams of five to six doctors, five to six nurses and five to six patients and relatives will be sent to inspect all 170 NHS trusts in England. They will spend at least two days monitoring care and speaking to staff and relatives and will also carry out an unannounced inspection at nights and weekends. Each trust will be given one of four ratings - outstanding, good, requires improvement, or poor - similar to the system used by Ofsted when grading schools. Hospitals rated as poor will be put into special measures unless the CQC is confident its bosses are capable of making the urgent improvements themselves. The CQC has lined up the first wave of 18 trusts which will be inspected between August and December - and they will enable the watchdog to test its new system. They include six trusts where the watchdog expects to find poor care - based on previous inspections and complaints -which include Barking, Havering and Redbridge in Essex, Barts Health in East London, Croydon in Surrey, Nottingham University Hospitals, South London Healthcare and the Royal Bournemouth and Christchurch hospitals. Another six are deemed to be of medium standard, while six are expected to be providing a high quality care. Patients and relatives wanting to join the inspection teams will undergo a series of interviews and criminal records checks. They will be paid for each inspection - although the amount has not yet been decided - and will be reimbursed for any travel costs. But they will only be allowed to inspect hospitals more than 50 miles from where they live to ensure their opinion of the hospital is impartial and not tainted by their own previous experiences.","New Chief Inspector of Hospitals, Sir Mike Richards, has called for hundreds of NHS patients to join inspection teams over next 2 years .

A girl with a rare genetic condition has finally spoken her first words thanks to a diet that involves eating four tubs of cream cheese a week. Three-year-old Fields Taylor from Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire, suffers from a disorder called Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome, which affects her ability to speak. But miraculously, after starting a high-fat, low-sugar diet - which includes eating almost a kilo of Philadelphia a week - she has finally spoken her first words. Mother Stevis Taylor, 34, is pictured with her daughter Fields, who suffers from extremely rare condition called Glut1 Deficiency. It it means her brain is starved of energy because her body cannot transport enough glucose to it . There is no cure for Glut1, which affects just 25 people in the UK, but children can be helped with a special diet called the Ketogenic Diet. Delighted mother, Stevie, 34, said: 'The first time I heard Fields say ""Mum"" it was just wonderful. 'I didn't really believe that something so simple as changing her diet could make such a big difference. 'The amount of Philadelphia she goes through is a bit mad but the effect it's had is amazing.It's just fabulous to know that she does have a voice inside her and we can finally communicate.' Fields suffers from an extremely rare syndrome called Glut1 Deficiency (GD1). Fewer than 300 cases have been reported since the disease was identified in 1991 and there are only 25 known cases in the UK. GD1 is a genetic condition that primarily affects the brain and . is caused by a defect in the SLC2A1 gene, which is responsible for . making a protein called the glucose transporter protein type 1 (GLUT1). This protein is responsible for transporting glucose (a simple sugar) from the blood into the cells for energy. Symptoms of Glut1 Defiency Syndrome can be alleviated by the Ketogenic Diet which is high in fat and very low in carbohydrates. Field's eats over a kilo of cream cheese a week and must also drink 50ml of a special oil four times a day to boost her fat intake . This causes the brain to be starved of energy which can result in a variety of symptoms. Most, but not all, patients develop seizures within the first few months of life. These seizures are very difficult to treat with the common anti-seizure medications. Other symptoms include learning disabilities, stiffness, difficulty in coordinating movements, speech abnormalities, fatigue, muscle twitches and headaches. Mother Stevie said that at first she was dubious about the diet. But within weeks she said she could see it working - that Fields was more alert and her 'personality seemed to come out a bit more' There is no cure for the condition but many people have reported a great reduction in symptoms from the Ketogenic Diet. The diet is a very . restrictive calorie-limited, high-fat diet. No sugar is allowed and . minimal carbohydrate is included. The diet is so precise that children on it must avoid even topical ingredients – such as medications or toothpastes – that might contain sugar. Strict compliance with this diet . causes the liver to produce ketones which are used by the brain as an . alternative fuel source. Ketones are measured with a blood monitoring machine that requires pricking the child's finger. Ketone levels must be regularly checked because if they are too high a patient may go into a coma. Stevie said: 'At first I was pretty dubious about the diet - I didn't see how food could make such a big difference. Mother Stevie (pictured with husband David and daughter Fields) said that after several weeks on the diet something miracualous happened. She said: 'One morning I was in the kitchen and all of a sudden I heard this little voice shout ""mum"". 'I dropped what I was doing and ran into the direction of Fields and just couldn't believe what I was hearing.' 'But within weeks you could see it working, she was more alert and her personality seemed to come out a bit more. 'Then, one morning I was in the kitchen and all of a sudden I heard this little voice shout ""mum"". 'I dropped what I was doing and ran into the direction of Fields and just couldn't believe what I was hearing. 'There's been times that I never thought I'd hear her speak. I was just over the Moon. G1D prevents glucose, the brain's main energy source, from reaching it.This in effect starves the brain, leading to a number of symptoms include seizures, muscle twitches, learning disabilities and in Field's cases, speech problems.The Ketogenic Diet is a very restrictive, calorie-limited, high-fat diet. No sugar is allowed and minimal carbohydrate is included.Strict compliance with this diet causes the liver to produce ketones. These ketones are then used by the brain as an alternative source of energy. Children must be strictly monitored when on the diet because too many ketones can trigger extreme fatigue and even coma in extreme cases. 'Now she's started shouting for the dog and saying bigger words - she said the word dinosaur the other day - I nearly cried.' Stevie explained that it was difficult to get Fields to comply at the outset but that cream cheese has really helped make it bearable for her. 'Philadelphia really has been our saving grace - she just loves the stuff. She'll pile it up on crackers and it gives her loads of energy,' said Stevie. 'I do get funny looks when I give her a tiny piece of toast with layers and layers of butter on but the diet has really worked wonders for her. 'It doesn't affect her weight either as she uses up every bit of fat she eats, she doesn't store any of it.' Stevie, and husband David, first noticed something may be wrong with their daughter when she was just 15 weeks old. Stevie said: 'I'd had a normal pregnancy and normal birth but Fields got to 15 weeks old and she started with a twitch in her wrist. 'I went to the GP who said she would book us an appointment at the hospital. 'I was just waiting in the waiting room to find out when that appointment would be and all of a sudden she had a seizure. 'I was petrified. Your worst thoughts go through your mind. She just went really vacant, like she was going into another world. Field's parents are now hoping that, thanks to the diet, her condition will improve even further. They went to a Glut1 conference in America last week and there were children there that were walking. Steie said: 'It's a huge goal for Fields to reach, but she's progressed so far in such a short time.' Fields was rushed to hospital, where she had another seizure, and further tests were carried out. After a week in hospital she was diagnosed with epilepsy. 'When they told us she had epilepsy we accepted it and tried to get on with it. But then I started noticing that other children Fields' age were doing more advanced things than she was. 'So we told the hospital and last March she had some genetic tests done. 'I didn't really think anything of it, and when we went back to the hospital in January this year for an appointment I just thought it was a routine check up. 'I was gob smacked when they told us that there was deletion in one of her chromosomes, and that she had Glut1. I'd never heard of it before.' Fields is now thriving thanks to the new regime which has cut out carbohydrates and massively upped her intake of fats . The only way to treat the condition is by starting the Ketogenic Diet which Fields was put on in April. Her parents are now hoping that, thanks to the diet, her condition will improve even further. Stevie said: 'We went to a Glut1 conference in America last week and there were children there that were walking. 'It's a huge goal for Fields to reach, but she's progressed so far in such a short time. 'We know she can do it.' Emma Williams MBE is the CEO and Founder of Matthew's Friends, a Ketogenic Dietary Therapies Charity. Emma said: 'The Ketogenic Diet is really the only treatment there is for Glut 1 DS and sadly there are still patients in the UK that have been diagnosed with Glut 1 DS that are then put on a long waiting list for the treatment - this is not acceptable as there should be no waiting list for these patients. 'The longer they are without treatment the longer their brains are being starved and the more damage can be done. 'Fields' story just highlights the difference the correct treatment can make to a person and the Ketogenic Diet can work wonders in these patients and those with drug resistant epilepsy.'","Fields Taylor has a rare condition called Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome that affects just 25 people in the UK and 300 people worldwide .

A pregnant mother died just three days after being sent home from a hospital where staff twice misdiagnosed the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy for a stomach bug. One doctor did suspect she might be suffering with the condition, that causes an embryo to implant outside the uterus, but was unable to confirm a diagnosis because the hospital's  specialist scanning service was closed for the weekend. The family of Becky Ben-Nejma, 28, were this week given an undisclosed six-figure compensation payout after the hospital trust admitted she was misdiagnosed and that their failings contributed to her death. The family of Becky Ben-Nejma were this week given an undisclosed six-figure compensation payout after a hospital trust admitted she was misdiagnosed and their failings contributed to her death . Mrs Ben-Nejma, who already had two children, visited Maidstone Hospital's A&E department with stomach pains late on a Friday afternoon. Medical staff suspected she had gastroenteritis and sent her home with painkillers. One doctor - it later transpired - suggested she should be scanned for any possible complications with her pregnancy, suspecting she may have an ectopic pregnancy. But the hospital's specialist scanning department was closed for the weekend so he asked Mrs Ben-Nejma to return on the Monday for a scan. The next day Becky complained she was in even more pain so she returned to the Kent hospital. Incredibly, the A&E registrar still diagnosed it as gastroenteritis and simply sent her home with stronger painkillers. Mrs Ben-Nejma had only discovered a few days earlier that she was seven-weeks pregnant. The following morning, at around 7.30am, she collapsed at home into the arms of her then 12-year-old daughter Charlotte, and suffered a heart attack. Ms Ben-Nejma only found out she was seven-weeks pregnant a few days before she died. She collapsed at home into the arms of her then 13-year-old daughter Charlotte, and suffered a heart attack . Paramedics worked frantically to revive her and she was rushed into hospital by air ambulance. She then suffered a second cardiac arrest while undergoing an emergency operation to remove her fallopian tubes. Mrs Ben-Nejma was kept on life support, before the agonising decision was made to switch it off and she died on December 20, 2010, her daughter Charlotte's 13th birthday. Tests revealed Becky had experienced an ectopic pregnancy. Details of Mrs Ben-Nejma's death emerged this week after it was revealed her family had been given a compensation payout by Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. Medical director Dr Paul Sigston said: 'The trust sincerely and unreservedly apologises for the failings that contributed to death of Mrs Ben-Nejma. 'In order to ensure that such failings do not happen again the trust has introduced a range of measures including strengthening the emergency gynaecology service, which is now centralised at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, and as a result of which patients now have better access to senior staff, diagnostic equipment and treatment of emergency situations.' He said scanning equipment and senior medical staff in women and children's services were now available 24 hours a day including at weekends at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, which only opened about 18 months ago. Becky, from Maidstone, was married to Walid and had two children, Charlotte, now 15, and Bailey, four. John Kyriacou, of Penningtons Solicitors, London, who represented Becky's family, said: 'This is a devastating case for everyone involved. The NHS needs to be as effective during the weekend as it is during the week.' Studies have suggested that death rates at hospitals in England can be up to 25 per cent higher at weekends, and NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has said he would like hospitals to function as effectively at weekends as during the week.","Rebecca Ben-Nejma  went to A&E at Maidstone Hospital with stomach pain .

This is the heartbreaking moment new parents John and Tracey Gamble cradle their dying son, just minutes after medics caused a bleed on his brain during a traumatic and bungled delivery. Frank Gamble's tiny skull was fractured by 'poor technique or excessive force' during the ill-fated forceps birth after his head was found to be in the wrong position for the labour, an inquest heard. He died just hours later. Medics had attempted to deliver him with the tool on three separate occasions but were forced to move to an emergency C-section when the infant’s heart stopped beating. This is the heartbreaking moment new parents John and Tracey Gamble cradle their dying son, just moments after medics caused a bleed on his brain during a traumatic and bungled delivery . Chelmsford Coroners' Court into the tragic baby’s death heard lead doctor Consultant Prof Mohammed Khaled, who was holding the forceps, should have overseen a safe birth. But instead he was used 'poor technique or excessive force' which he should have ensured did not happen, independent experts told the hearing. The senior medic, who has been on restricted duties following the death, told the inquest Frank’s head was in a rotated position causing the forceps to unlock. Recording a narrative verdict, Coroner for Essex Caroline Beasley-Murray said Frank could have been saved if 'appropriate' action had been taken earlier in the labour. Mrs Beasley-Murray said: 'There were very serious failings in the care of Tracey Gamble and baby Frank received at Colchester hospital. 'If appropriate care had been provided baby Frank might have survived. 'It is encouraging to read from the trust’s own investigation report how seriously it has taken these events. 'It is to be hoped that there has been learning from this experience. Frank Gamble's tiny skull was fractured by 'poor technique or excessive force' during the ill-fated forceps birth at Colchester General Hospital, after his head was found to be in the wrong position for the labour, an inquest heard . 'No one else should be allowed to endure the anguish that the Gamble family endured in April last year.' The coroner said to tearful Mrs Gamble: 'At the end of the day of evidence I said it had been a real ordeal for you, but you had all showed such dignity and you are continuing to show that. 'Frankie would have been a much loved little boy and I would like to express my condolences to you.' Frank was confirmed dead shortly after he was delivered by C-section at 10.54pm, on April 18, 2012, at Colchester General Hospital, Essex. At the inquest opening on June 27 the coroner was told Prof Khaled should have known how to carry out a safe delivery with forceps. But independent expert Dr Jeremy Brockelsby told the coroner either a poor technique or excessive force was used. Dr Jeremy Brockelsby said skull fractures were rare and Frank’s parents did not receive the standard of care they were entitled to. Midwife Tamera Aberthart-Briggs told the inquest said was worried for the mother during the delivery and the baby’s heartbeat was lost after the third failed attempt to use forceps. Tracey and John Gamble leaving the inquest after hearing the verdict today, after a coroner recorded a narrative verdict . She told the inquest that evening would stay with her 'forever'. Devastated parents Tracey and John Gamble, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, are now considering taking legal action against Colchester Hospital. The family’s solicitor revealed the couple had hoped for a verdict of 'neglect'. In a statement on behalf of the family Fran Pollard, from Gadsby Wicks Solicitors, said: 'The family wish to convey that the night of April 18 last year will haunt Tracey and John and the extended family for the rest of their days. 'They are disappointed with the coroner’s verdict, but hope lessons will be learned from this tragedy so that no other family has to experience the devastated that they have endured.' Following the inquest a spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would like to pass on our sincere condolences to Mr and Mrs Gamble for the sad death of their son, Frank. 'The 15 months since Frank’s death will clearly have been an unbearable time for the whole family and we appreciate that the inquest will also have brought back very difficult and distressing memories. 'Whilst nothing can now change the sad events of 18 April 2012, it is our hope that the action we have taken to understand why this happened and the steps we have taken to achieve as much learning as possible from this tragic event indicate how seriously we have taken Frank’s death. 'We continue to work with staff to ensure they always aim for safe, high quality care, and always learn where improvements are needed.' Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust - which runs the hospital - was one of 14 Trusts under review due to higher than average death rates. A report released this week did not recommend it to be placed in special measures.","Frank Gamble's skull was fractured by 'excessive force' during forceps birth .

The nature of the calls made by those who anonymously seek help has also changed – with more people contemplating suicide. Mind, the mental health charity who compiled the data, have described the figures as ‘alarming’ and have urged people to seek help as soon as they are concerned about their state of mind. Mind, a UK mental health charity, has noticed a sharp increase in those calling their infoline for help. The amount of people ringing with 'complex and acute' problems had increased more specifically . Mind found that the number of calls rose to over 68,000 in 2012/13, from 46,000 in 2011/2012. They said that they had seen a corresponding shift in the nature of calls, with people presenting more acute and complex problems. This was reflected in a ‘concerning’ 30 per cent rise in calls relating to suicide. Many cases, they added, were as result of 'severe financial worries'. Paul Farmer, CEO for Mind, said that many calls were related to financial worries such as rising living costs . In response to the figures, Mind said there was an increased need for its services, and urged people not to wait until they hit crisis point before seeking help. Paul Farmer, CEO for Mind said: ‘Today many people face the stark reality of severe financial pressures - be it through employment worries, benefit cuts, increased cost of living, or a lethal combination of all three. ‘We urge anyone who needs our support to pick up the phone and to do it today. Earlier this year a study conducted by Oxford University political economist Dr . David Stuckler and Dr Sanjay Basu, an assistant professor of medicine . and an epidemiologist at Stanford University, concluded that 'austerity is devastating the health of people in Europe and North America by driving suicide, depression, and the spread of infectious disease'. It said that reduced access to medicines and care was further compounding people's problems. It also suggested that the high employment rates across Europe had increased drug abuse and even contributed to the increased spread of HIV.","Mind, a mental health charity, has noticed a sharp increase in the number of people calling their infoline .

North Korea has urged Panama to release a ship and its crew caught smuggling arms from Cuba to the secretive state. Panama stopped the ship last week and seized missiles and fighter jets found buried under bags of sugar after a stand-off with the North Korean crew. The 35 men, who have been charged with trafficking undeclared arms, tried to resist arrest while the captain had a heart attack and attempted to slit his own throat. Scroll down for video . North Korea has demanded that the Chong Chon Gang and its 35-strong crew be released from Panama, where the ship was stopped and found to be carrying military equipment . Cuba has said that the military equipment found buried under sacks of sugar on the ship consisted of 'obsolete' weapons that were going to be repaired in North Korea and returned to the island . Panama has called in the United Nations for help in examining the cargo . Authorities discovered missile . equipment, MiG fighter jets and other arms aboard the Chong Chon Gang, which was stopped in the Panama Canal. Cuba admitted it owned what it called 'obsolete' Soviet-era weapons and said they would be returned to the Caribbean island once they had been repaired. 'This cargo is nothing but ageing . weapons, which are to send back to Cuba after overhauling them according . to a legitimate contract,' said a North Korean foreign ministry spokesman, according to state news agency KCNA. Panama has called in the United Nations Security Council, Colombia and Britain to help search the ship, with five U.N. investigators expected to arrive in the country next month once the vessel has been unloaded. North Korea is barred by U.N. sanctions from importing sophisticated weapons or missiles . for flouting measures aimed at curbing its nuclear weapons program. Ban Ki-moon, U.N. Secretary-General, yesterday praised Panama for its actions and said the sanctions committee would take up the issue. The 14,000-tonne ship is being searched by 350 police and border patrol officials. The crew set the vessel's electrical system on fire to disable it, which means the unloading process could take up to ten days, a Panamanian foreign ministry spokesman said. Military equipment was found inside containers on the Chong Chon Gang, which is being searched by investigators . The ship's cargo, bound for North Korea, included missiles, two MiG-21 jet fighters and 15 spare engines . The Chong Chon Gang could take up to ten days to unload, officials said, with the task made more difficult because the crew burned the electrical system before their arrests . Two more containers with suspected arms have been found on the ship in addition to the two already discovered. Access points to the ship's storage . areas were all 'completely blocked' in breach of international . regulations when Panamanian officials boarded it, security minister Jose Raul Mulino said. Cuba said the weapons on the . ship included two anti-aircraft missile batteries, nine disassembled . rockets, two MiG-21 fighter jets, and 15 MiG-21 engines, all Soviet-era . military weaponry built in the middle of the last century. North Korea would breach the arms embargo imposed by the U.N. by carrying out repairs. Britain's U.N. Ambassador, Mark Lyall Grant, said the ship appeared to have violated the U.N. arms embargo. One senior U.S. lawmaker called the matter a 'grave violation of international treaties', while officials said Washington would be speaking to Cuba about the ship. North Korea said the 'ageing weapons' were to be repaired and returned to Cuba under a legitimate contract . Panama's president Ricardo Martinelli announced the ship had been detained through Twitter . Long haul: Panama's President Ricardo Martinelli gives a thumbs up to workers inside the Chong Chon Gang. Searching the entire cargo hold will take several more days . Robert . Menendez, a Democratic lawmaker and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said: 'Weapons transfers from . one communist regime to another hidden under sacks of sugar are not . accidental ... and reinforces the necessity that Cuba remain on the . State Department's list of countries that sponsor state terrorism.' Talks between the two countries on migration went ahead as planned yesterday. The U.S. has been asked to provide technical assistance by Panama. Panama's foreign minister Fernando Nunez Fabrega said his country has no problem with Cuba but was obliged to inspect the North Korean ship under U.N. rules. A 2009 resolution says the embargo applies to 'all arms and related material, as well as to financial transactions, technical training, advice, services or assistance related to the provision, manufacture, maintenance or use of such arms, except for small arms and light weapons.' Panamanian President Ricardo . Martinelli tweeted a photo showing a green tube that appears to be a . horizontal antenna for the SNR-75 'Fan Song' radar, which is used to . guide missiles fired by the SA-2 air-defense system found in former . Warsaw Pact and Soviet-allied nations, said Neil Ashdown, an analyst for . IHS Jane's Intelligence. Powerful drug: The ship has been under scrutiny from international authorities since 2009 and Panamanian police originally boarded in the belief it carried drugs . Controversy: Cuba has said missiles found buried under sacks of sugar on a ship bound for North Korea were being sent to the secretive state to be repaired . Speaking out: The Caribbean nation admitted last night that it owned the military equipment and said it was due to be returned to the island once repairs had been completed . 'It . is possible that this could be being sent to North Korea to update its . high-altitude air-defense capabilities,' Mr Ashdown said. Martinelli . said his officials originally thought drugs could be aboard the ship . and tried to contact the Chong Chon Gang's crew, who did not respond. 'Panama . being a neutral country, a country in peace, that doesn't like war, we . feel very worried about this military material,' he said. IHS Fairplay, a maritime news publication which monitors vessels' movement, said it had found that another ship bearing the North Korean flag had made a similar journey last year. The O Un Chong Nyon Ho docked in Havana last May, it said. Hal Klepak, a history professor at the Royal Military College of Canada, said Cuba's weapons and equipment were 'of staggeringly old vintage'.

Going home: Panamanian presidential security detail walks on the deck aboard the Chong Chon Gang, which was on its way home from Havanna carrying outdated weaponry . He said the Pentagon had long since written off the island as a military threat. Since Cuba's military doctrine was designed to deter any attack, it needs to maintain the arms it has, he added. 'Cuba cannot afford to buy anything newer and does not have repair facilities of its own for such needs,' he said. 'Thus if it is not to scrap, for example, the aircraft entirely, it must repair and potentially update them in some areas.' In early July, a top North Korean general, Kim Kyok Sik, visited Cuba and met counterparts on the island. The . Cuban Communist Party newspaper Granma said he was also received by . President Raul Castro, and the two had an 'exchange about the historical . ties that unite the two nations and the common will to continue . strengthening them.' The meetings were held behind closed doors, and there has been no detailed account of their discussions.

'Given . the history of North Korea, Cuban military cooperation and now this . latest seizure, we find this flight more interesting,' he said. The Chong Chon Gang has a history of . being detained on suspicion of trafficking drugs and ammunition, . Griffiths said. Clued in: Photos of the crew of the Chong Chon Gang hang in the ship.

Employees have made their across Venice’s piazzas and narrow walkways wearing backpacks containing the 33lbs cameras, and images should be available sometime later this year. The cameras, named The Trekker, have been used by Google to capture places only available by foot, such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Google street view was launched in May 2007, and was only available in five American cities; San Francisco, Denver, Las Vegas, Miami and New York City.

As it spreads around the world, some locations are proving more difficult than others. Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean had to be captured by snow mobile and although Nepal can be seen on the map, only mountain landmarks via satellite are available. The Google Street View Car uses nine directional cameras for 360° views at a height of about 8.2 feet, or 2.5 meters, and the images are then 'stitched' together, creating the panorama effect. In addition to the Street View cars and The Trekker, Google uses tricycles, trolleys and snowmobiles when faced with difficult terrains where the cars cannot reach. The Google Trikes, photographs pedestrian-only areas of cities and towns across the globe to capture the streets of the nearly 50 countries now available on Street View. The Snowmobile was invented for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and several mountainsides are now available on Google Maps.

Millionaire Tamara Ecclestone’s husband was robbed and beaten on a petrol station forecourt known as an area for drug-dealing, it emerged yesterday. CCTV footage has been released of Jay Rutland being robbed of a £50,000 Rolex and £20,000 bracelet. Mr Rutland was set upon by at least two thugs in a darkened area of the forecourt in Wanstead, East London, in an attack that left him battered and bruised on Wednesday. CCTV footage has been released of Jay Rutland, the new husband of Tamara Ecclestone, being robbed . The attack left the 32-year-old battered and bruised . The owner of the motor repairs business next to the garage said the spot had been used for drug deals in the past. Dave Dodds, 69, whose CCTV captured the fracas, said: ‘It’s a drug drop-off area  at night. ‘I’ve come back here late when I’ve forgotten something and found people here. I’ve even got video of a gun being handed over.’ The footage shows Mr Rutland, 32, drive to the forecourt in what appears to be a black Ferrari at 12.38am in the early hours of Wednesday, not a Range Rover as mentioned in previous reports. The video also shows a figure searching the darkened ground with a torch minutes after the violent assault. The attack took place in a poorly lit area at the entrance to the repairs  shop, behind the petrol station. Yesterday, blood still marked the road outside. Mr Rutland, 32, said he was driving home when his fuel gauge started flashing, so he stopped at the petrol station, just off the A12. He had gone to relieve himself in a corner when he was approached by two men who he claims threatened, assaulted and robbed him. During the scuffle, one attacker dropped his phone. Mr Rutland picked it up and later handed it to police, which helped identify the owner.

Personal tragedy: Congressman Steve Cohen hit out at the media today for trying to make the story with the model he once thought was his daughter into an 'Anthony Weiner thing' Bonding: Since learning of her existence only three years ago, Cohen has gotten to know Ms Brink and took her on a tour of the Capitol and to the White House Christmas party (pictured) Disgraced: Anthony Weiner was forced to resign from Congress after he tweeted a number of sexually suggestive pictures to a number of young pretty women . He also spoke with CNN this morning about the paternity mix up and grew quite emotional as he said of Victoria: 'She was my family. My only family.' With tears in his eyes he added: 'I had visions of her being my heir and going to her wedding and having grandchildren. It's been heartbreaking and devastating, and I've just been crushed. Last week, Victoria gave an interview about the events surrounding the identity of her real father, which Cohen explained this morning: 'On TV she was saying, ""Steve Cohen is not my father, not my biological . father"", and the second part was edited out by CNN. 'She was saying we still have a . relationship and she sent me a beautiful Father's Day card and it said: 'You will always be my father in many . ways.' 'The press has made this into a story. This is a personal tragedy that should be allowed for me and Victoria to deal . with independently. She's hiding out in Houston and she hates it, so does her . mother. 'I'm in the public eye, I'm tired of it, I want to get back to . legislating. This stuff should be left private and if it's not private it . ought to be dealt with honestly.' Explaining the February tweet that exposed his relationship with Victoria, he said: 'I was thrilled she was watching the State of the Union. She was raised in Texas and her main issues are Louis Vuitton, expensive, stylish clothes and fun. Oh and watching her boyfriend play softball. Texting? Congressman Steve Cohen was seen sending a Tweet during the State of the Union in February (left) and the recipient was Ashley Brink (right) who he later revealed was his daughter - or so he thought .

Back . in February, Cohen had initially claimed that the model that he was . tweeting during the televised speech was a family friend. But that didn't silence critics who thought it odd that the ended the message by writing 'ilu.' The congressman later admitted Brink was his daughter from a previous relationship. Cohen said last week he was 'stunned . and dismayed' after CNN had a paternity test done on the 25-year-old . model with Cohen’s participation. It revealed that John Brink - the man who raised her and the ex-husband to her mother - is in fact her father. Brink, the president of Houston-based Environment and Energy Group, told Politico that Cohen's claims of paternity 'rocked' his world. Cynthia Sinatra, the mother of Victoria Brink, is pictured. She had a relationship with Steve Cohen around the time of Victoria's birth . The 63-year-old, three-term Congressman . said that he only discovered he had fathered the young woman . when he did a Google search of her mother Cynthia Sinatra and found out she had a daughter. He contacted her after realizing that the 'math looked pretty accurate'. 'The mom told me we had a lot of catching up to do,' he told NBC. Cohen said that the mother confirmed that he was the father, saying that she sees physical similarities between the two. The mother said: 'Every time I look at her I see the German Jew in her face.' Daughter: Little is known about Victoria Brink except that she is a 24-year-old model . Cohen told NBC: 'I’m Lithuanian- close enough.' Cohen's heritage is a proud point for the politician, as he is the first Jewish congressman from Tennessee. From there, he began to build a relationship with Ms Brink, taking her on a tour of the Capitol and White House. He went on to share a picture from the White House Christmas party with NBC reporter Luke Russert, who said via Twitter that during their interview 'Cohen was emotional while telling the story about his daughter, fought back tears, could feel genuine fatherly emotion.' While the emotional reunion likely silences political watchers, it doesn't necessarily quiet his constituents who take issue with the fact he was tweeting at all. 'That goes to show you he had his mind on other things except the State of the Union,' Jerome Holloway from Memphis told local news station WMCTV.

A professional beggar who makes £50,000 a year is facing jail after allegedly breaching an Asbo which banned him from scrounging on the streets. Simon Wright was allegedly spotted begging in London’s Leicester Square, weeks after magistrates ordered him to stop operating in the capital. The ‘audacious’ freeloader was arrested and bailed – only to start begging again just a few hundred yards away, it is claimed. Simon Wright, who was banned from begging in the capital after reports he earned £50,000 a year, has been arrested again by police . The 37-year-old has an order which remains in place until 2015 . Westminster city council street wardens spotted Wright in Leicester Square on Tuesday and alerted police . Wright was arrested and bailed to appear at Westminster magistrates' court later this month . Last month the Daily Mail reported how the 37-year-old would sit in ragged clothes on the pavement of Putney High Street in South London, with a handwritten sign claiming he was ‘homeless and hungry’. In fact he would return each night to a £300,000 council flat in nearby Fulham. As a result, magistrates issued an Asbo which banned him from begging anywhere in London for two years. But Westminster city council street wardens allegedly spotted him asking for money in Leicester Square on Tuesday, and alerted police.After officers realised who he was, he was arrested and bailed to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later this month. But just half an hour later, Wright was allegedly seen begging in nearby Coventry Street. He moved off before police arrived. Councillor Nickie Aiken, Westminster’s spokesman for community protection, said: ‘It is his sheer audacity that anyone would find so galling. 'This is why we have our team of street wardens. ‘A lot of people handing him money won’t be earning anywhere near the £75,000 you would need to make [£50,000] before tax. ‘Wright is not an isolated case, there are plenty more beggars like him, all looking equally pitiful. So, once again, we urge people not to pay money to people on the streets. ‘Even those who are genuine cases should not be encouraged to do so. Our teams will go out and offer help to anyone in real need.’ Wright has already escaped being jailed for breaching one condition of his Asbo, after he was caught with his dog unmuzzled. At the original hearing in May, Wimbledon Magistrates’ Court heard that Wright regularly went into betting shops and amusement arcades to change his coins for notes. On many occasions they added up to between £200 and £300. Police constable Oliver Strebel, who brought the case to court, said: ‘He worked pretty much every day, and had done so for about three years. He certainly put in the hours.’ Wright is due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on July 25, charged with breaching his Asbo. If found guilty, he could be jailed for up to five years.

Falling televisions sent nearly 200,000 U.S. children to the emergency room over 20 years, and the injury rate has climbed substantially for these sometimes deadly accidents, a study found. Over those two decades, 215 children died . from these injuries, government data show, and news reports indicate . that since January 2012, at least six young children have been killed . nationwide by falling TVs. Doctors and safety experts say better awareness is needed about the dangers - especially the risks of putting heavier, older model TV sets on top of dressers and other furniture young children may try to climb on. Researchers found that in the last 20 years, more than 200,000 children were injured by falling televisions in the U.S. Most injuries are in children under five; head and neck injuries, including concussions, are the most common. 'This is a problem that is increasing at an alarming rate,' said lead author Dr. Gary Smith, a paediatric emergency specialist and president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance. Smith said it is unclear from the data what type of TV sets are involved in the accidents or whether older, heavier models are the most common culprit. The study was published online Monday in the journal Pediatrics. In 2011, 12,300 children nationwide got emergency room treatment for TV-related injuries, compared with 5,455 in 1990. The injury rate nearly doubled, from 0.85 injuries per 10,000 children aged 17 and younger in 1990 to 1.66 per 10,000 in 2011, the study found. Doctors and safety experts say better awareness is needed about the dangers - especially the risks of putting heavier, older model TV sets on top of dressers and other furniture young children may try to climb on . The researchers examined national data on non-fatal television-related injuries to kids from 1990-2011. Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the government's Consumer Product Safety Commission, said as flat-screen TVs have become more popular, many families move heavier old TVs to bedrooms, placing them on dressers or other unsteady furniture not designed to hold them.","Over the last two decades 215 children have died from their injuries .

An investor’s website has released its list of the worst companies to work for in America as identified by the employees who hate them. 24/7 Wall St. has sorted through the 250,000 companies measured by job review site Glassdoor.com. Out of the most poorly rated, 24/7 Wall St. chose the nine publicly traded companies that scored the lowest and they’re mostly industries where customer interaction is key. Mean: DISH was rated the worst in a survey of employee reviews on job advice website Glassdoor.com. The television provider was also rated 'Meanest Company in America' by Business Week . Meanwhile, three of the namesake Dillards under the company’s employ—Mike, William, and Alex—raked in a combined salary of $54 million over the last three years. Discount retailer Dollar General came in just behind Dillard’s at number 4 on the list. Investor website 24/7 Wall St. looked at job advice website Glassdoor.com's 250,000 reviewed employers and found the nine most poorly rated. Retailers make up four of the nine worst. 1. DISH . 2. Express Scripts . 3. Dillard's . 4. Dollar General . 5. RadioShack . 6. ADT . 7. Sears . 8. NCR . 9. Fiserv . The stores number a whopping 10,000 and employ 90,000-plus people, many of whom aren’t happy. Complaints often revolved around hours at America’s self-described ‘largest small-box retailer,’ especially for overworked store managers. Theft, too, was a hot-button issue at Dollar General, though some said it is customer theft and others complained of abundant employee theft. More service-based companies helped round out the list. Employees at security company ADT complained that too much focus was placed on clinching a sale while higher-ups ‘could care less about customers after sale.’ This no doubt makes things difficult for service representatives who deal with customers in the thereafter, though with little help from a management team they often called ‘weak.’ This . was the Dish Network television provider’s second year as the dubious . winner of 24/7 Wall St.’s list. Employees complained of low wages, . strenuous hours, and unpleasant work conditions. The company that received the poorest ratings: DISH. The television provider, once called 'America's Meanest Comany' by Business Week, also proves that unhappy employees mean unhappy customers. The most recent American Customer Satisfaction Index ranked them behind competitors AT&T, Verizon, and DirecTV. Of the eight other dreaded employers, four are in the retail sector. 'Treated like pawns': Retail companies made up much of the list from 24/7 Wall St. Dillard's Department Stores was the the lowest rated of the retail bunch . Dillard’s . Inc., Sears Holdings Corporation, Dollar General Corporation, and . RadioShack Corp. all scored lower than 2.5 on Glassdoor.com’s 1-5 . ranking system. The worst . of the retail bunch, Dillard’s, came in at number 3 on the list. The . company’s reviews bemoan its low wages and long hours. ‘The . benefits are pitiful and the salaries are not current with industry,’ wrote a reviewer. ‘I should know as I work in a [department] that sees . the salaries.’ But for unhappy employees willing to make a change, there could be light at the end of the tunnel. If they’re willing to leave the service and retail sector.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 18 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 19 July 2013 . Trayvon Martins parents have opened up about their fears for their remaining son, saying that while they still have faith in the justice system, they are now more afraid about what they should tell Trayvon's older brother. 'I'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him. I have no clue if I should tell him to run or walk, I have no clue if I should tell him to defend himself or just lay there,' Sybrina Fulton said of her son Jahvaris. The outrage about the not guilty verdict acquitting George Zimmerman of murdering Trayvon has not simmered, and as the grieving parents were interviewed about their reaction to the news, and how they decided to skip that final day of the trial. 'I'm very afraid right now because i have no clue what to tell him. I have no clue if I should tell him to run or walk, I have no clue if I should tell him to defend himself or just lay there,' Sybrina Fulton said of her son Jahvaris. Opening up: Thursday was the first time that Trayvon's parents talked about the trial, making a number of television appearances . Ms Fulton, Trayvon's father Tracy Martin and their attorney Benjamin Crump all appeared on Anderson Cooper's show Thursday night to talk about how they chose not to be in the courtroom when the verdict was read because they assumed they would have an outburst, which is strictly against the court rules. 'Either way, how could you be quiet? How could you not show any emotions?' Ms Fulton said. Instead, they watched the verdict come on television, and she said that not being in the room- knowing that no one was there to see their reaction- 'took the sting out' but it didn't stop the pain. 'It literally broke us down,' she said. 'I just thought the human side of them would say ""Listen, this was a kid, this guy made a mistake."" This wasn't a burglar or just for him to . suggest that he was a burglar or in any means that he was committing a . crime, it’s just not true. It's just absolutely not true,' Ms Fulton . said. United front: Jaharvis Fulton joined his mother and Trayvon's father when they were interviewed by Matt Lauer earlier on Thursday as the first in their string of post-trial appearances . The two parents remained composed in tonight's interview, just as they have in a number of other discussions today. Even during the lengthy trial, they sat in the courtroom without breaking for the vast majority of the hearings. The only exception came when pictures of their slain son, or testimony about the brusining on his body, was shown to the courtroom as it proved too much for Ms Fulton to bare. A mother's heartache: Ms Fulton said that her faith has helped her through the killing . 'Those things were more hurtful to me, and sometimes I could sit through it and sometimes I had to just go and sit by myself and say a prayer and ask God to send strength to me,' she said. One thing that helped was their decision to never interact with Zimmerman or his relatives in the courtroom. 'We refrained from even looking his way. We didn't want our emotions to run high...because we knew that our son’s legacy was running in our hands,' she said. 'We needed to be in the courtroom to let them see that we were Trayvon.' Much has been made about Juror B37 who has elected to come forward and talk about her rationale that led to the not guilty verdict. One complaint that came forth was that the jury- which was made up of five white women and one Hispanic woman- had an easier time empathizing with Zimmerman than with the black teenager. Martin's parents said her interview with Anderson Cooper just days ago made that painfully clear as she repeatedly used the words 'they' and 'them' to describe African Americans. 'From the beginning of the trial, she had her mind made up. No doubt. No doubt,' Mr Martin said. 'When I heard the verdict, I kind of understand the disconnect: they didn't see Trayvon as their son. They didn't see Trayvon as a teenager. They didn't see trayvon as a human being who was just minding their own business,' Ms Fulton said. Pledge: Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton have started a foundation named after their son and say they hope his death and the trial can serve as a catalyst to bring the country together . As a result of the trial, many African American parents- including the Martins- have come forward about their confusion about what they should tell their children in regards to how to interact with strangers and the police. 'By us living in a diverse community, we really don't have to have the conversation where you have to be afraid of every different race because they grew up going to school with other nationalities,' Mr Martin said. 'When you have a situation where an unarmed teenager is shot in the heart, what is it that I can tell my child now?' Adding . to the confusion is the fact that no meaningful change has yet taken . place, and their lawyer pointed out that it sets a 'terrible' precedent . for future cases as anyone who comes out alive from a similar . altercation has the upper hand in terms of crafting the narrative. Picking sides: The juror who spoke out seemed to sympathize with Zimmerman and understand his point of view more than the victim, Trayvon Martin . Celebratory lunch: George Zimmerman defense . lawyers Mark O'Mara, left, and Don West enjoyed lunch at Nello on . Madison Avenue with criminal lawyer and CNN analyst Mark Geragos, right . Inside the courtroom: The unidentified juror said that she felt Zimmerman was justified in killing Trayvon Martin because he felt threatened, even though she admits Zimmerman may have 'enhanced' the story . The most telling sign that nothing has truly changed is the fact that George Zimmerman will now be given his gun back. 'That's troubling,' Mr Martin said. 'That's very troubling and it's troubling because he made a statement on Hannity if he had to do it all over again, he wouldn't change anything.' In spite of what legal analysts have suggested about the prosecution overreaching with the charge, both parents maintained that there was enough proof to convict the man who shot their son. 'We thought there was enough evidence there no matter who was on that jury to convict him of second degree murder and when you think about it, I think they just took into account what George Zimmerman said was the truth,' Mr Martin said.","Trayvon's parents made a string of TV appearances this morning .

A country estate in the Scottish Highlands with nine homes, its own salmon fishing river and 7,000 acres of land could be yours - if you've got £8million going spare. The Gledfield estate in Ardgay, near Inverness, lies on the River Carron in a beautiful undisturbed glen with rugged mountains, wooded hillsides and low ground pastureland. At the heart of the pile is a grand 18th century eight-bedroom manor, which was recently restored after years of neglect, and in currently in the ownership of the Swarovskis, the family behind the crystal company. The eight-bedroom four-storey Gledfield House lies at the heart of the 7,000 acre Gledfield estate in the village of Ardgay, northern Scotland . The estate, called one of the 'most splendid sporting in the Highlands' by a newspaper, is on the market for £8million . The 18th century manor house was recently restored to its former grandeur after years of neglect by previous owners. It is currently owned by the Swarovskis, the family behind the crystal company . Six lochs within its boundaries have rainbow trout in their waters while 5,000 acres is set aside for deer stalking and another 2,000 for commercial forestry. The secluded estate in Ardgay, Sutherland, provides lovers of country sports with the chance to complete a sporting Macnab - where a poacher bags a stag, a salmon and a brace of grouse on the same day. The competition, run by The Field magazine, requires entrants to conduct themselves in a 'sporting and gentlemanly manner' and have signed proof of their successful Macnab challenge from a gillie or gamekeeper. The estate's sporting credentials have been endorsed by the Daily Telegraph, which called it one of the 'most splendid sporting lodges in the Highlands.' The estate, which lies on the shores of the Dornoch Firth, along the River Carron, has its own salmon fishing river as well as six lochs full of rainbow trout . The 7,000-acre Gledfield estate, which sits in a secluded glen, has 5,000 acres set aside for deer stalking and country pursuits, with another 2,000 kept for commercial forestry . Gledfield House itself has a sauna and three grand reception rooms, while five of the bedrooms have en-suite bathrooms. Elsewhere, there are four staff cottages and another four dwellings which can be rented out to holidaymakers eager to enjoy its location on the shores of the Dornoch Firth. But whoever buys Gledfield will need plenty of money in the bank to run the vast estate. Evelyn Channing, from agents Savills Rural Services, said: 'It is relatively easy to reach from Inverness Airport and you are surrounded by peace, tranquility and nature. There are nine properties on the estate, including the grand manor house, staff cottages, and four further cottages that can be rented to holidaymakers . A map shows the boundaries of the vast 7,000-acre estate, shaded in pink, which contains lochs, mountains and plenty of land for deer stalking . 'It is ideal for anyone wanting to get . out of the city. The house is stunning and it is in mint condition with . wonderful gardens. 'There are 4,000 acres for stalking deer, there is fishing on one side of the estate and there is forestry. 'Even . though it is in northern Scotland it is really accessible and there are . no neighbours and no traffic. It is the polar opposite to London.'","The Gledfield estate, in the village of Ardgay, near Inverness, lies on the River Carron in an undisturbed glen .
