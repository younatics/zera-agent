"Poison: Mark Colborne, 36, is accused of planning a cyanide attack on 'non-Aryans' in the UK. He was remanded in custody today (file picture) An alleged neo-Nazi accused of planning to carry out a cyanide attack against British ethnic minorities has appeared in court today. Mark Colborne is alleged to have been preparing to carry out race hate terror attack against 'non-Aryans' in the UK. Police raided the 36-year-old college student’s Southampton home which he shared with his mother last month. He was bailed but subsequently charged with terrorism offences. Today Colborne appeared at Westminster Magistrates today charged with engaging in conduct in the preparation of terrorism acts contrary to section 5(1) of the Terrorism Act 2006. He was remanded in custody and will appear at the Old Bailey on July 18. District Judge John Zani said: 'I am transferring this case to the Central Criminal Court where you will appear on July 18 where I am sure the judge will want to progress your case. 'I have refused your application for bail. These are very serious allegations, though I must stress they are only allegations and you have not been convicted of anything. 'You are of previous good character which I have taken into account. But in my view there are substantial grounds that persuade me not to release you on bail as you may well re-offend and not attend court. 'You face a lengthy prison sentence if you are convicted of this offence, and for these reasons I am not granting you bail.' Wearing a navy blue jumper and black trousers, he wiped a tear away as he sat with his arms crossed in the glass-fronted dock at the London court. Trial: The judge at Westminster Magistrate's Court warned Colborne, who had a West Country accent when he appeared in the dock, that he faces a lengthy prison sentence if  he's convicted . Flanked by two plain-clothed officers and a uniformed dock officer, Colborne spoke with a West Country accent only to confirm his name, age and address. He repeatedly glanced over to his mother, who works in an animal sanctuary and sat tearfully in the public gallery during the hearing. No indication of plea was given. Hampshire police said his arrest is not part of a wider investigation and there is no threat to the local community.

"Shrek star Mike Myers today urged Scots to remain in the United Kingdom. The actor, who voiced the Scottish accent of the ogre in four box office hit films, said he ‘loves’ Scotland and wants voters to reject independence in September’s referendum. He joins a growing list of international stars including Kermit The Frog, David Bowie and JK Rowling voicing fears about breaking up the 300-year-old union. Is the independence dream ogre? Mike Myers, who voiced Shrek's Scottish accent, has come out against independence . It is a fresh blow for Alex Salmond who has seen the tide of public opinion turn against his dream of Scotland going it alone. The latest opinion polls show support for independence is falling, down to just 35 per cent in a YouGov survey this week. Some 54 per cent say they are planning to vote no in September’s historic referendum. More than four in 10 also fear independence would be bad for the Scottish economy and leave them financially worse off. Canadian-born Myers, whose parents were from Liverpool, made his name in Wayne’s World and Austin Powers before reaching a new audience with the Shrek series of films from 2001 to 2010. Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he initially appeared reluctant to express a view on the contentious issue of Scottish independence. Asked how Shrek would vote in the referendum, he laughed: ‘Wow… what a fantastic question… that I couldn't answer.’ Pressed on what Shrek would say, he replied in the voice of the character: ‘Shrek wants what the will of the Scottish people want.’ But Myers then added in his own accent: 'I love Scotland. I hope they remain part of Britain - and if they don't, I still love them.' First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured meeting the Queen at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh yesterday,  has seen support for independence slip away . FOR INDEPENDENCE . Sir Sean Connery . Actor Sir Sean Connery: ‘The people of Scotland are the best guardians of their own future'. Actor Alan Cumming : ‘The world is waiting for us. I know Scotland is ready.'’ The Proclaimers: ‘Scotland has huge national resources, with its people, its wave power – all the possibilities that this country has...we need to take charge of our own affairs' Comedian Kevin Bridges: ‘If the referendum as tomorrow, I'd probably vote yes.’ The Krankies . David Bowie: ‘Scotland, stay with us.’ Singer Rod Stewart : ‘I’d hate to see the Union broken after all these years — and I don’t think it will happen.’ Susan Boyle: ‘I am a proud, patriotic Scot, passionate about my heritage and my country. But I am not a nationalist.’ Billy Connolly: ‘I don’t believe in having more layers of government that ordinary people will have to pay for. I think it’s time for people to get together, not split apart. 'The more people stay together, the happier they’ll be.' Wee Jimmy Krankie aka Janette Tough: ‘Alex Salmond can sod off ’cos I don’t want it. We don’t live in Scotland so we won’t get to vote and I don’t think it’s fair.’ Andy Murray . Singer Annie Lennox: ‘It will be taken by the citizens of Scotland themselves, who need to seriously weigh up the pros and cons, as the responsibility lies wholeheartedly upon their shoulders.' Tennis player Andy Murray: ‘‘It’s very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you’re an absolute idiot’ Actor James McAvoy: ‘'I won’t be getting involved at all. It’s just counter-productive to my job, it’s not what I do, and I don’t think it’s helpful to have me involved in it.’ The comments were seized on by pro-UK campaigners. A Better Together spokesman said: 'It's no surprise Mike Myers doesn't support separation. He knows a fairytale when he sees one.' However, he risks the wrath of the so-called cybernats who have used social media to attack high profile figures who have supported the campaign against independence. Harry Potter author JK Rowling faced a torrent of vile abuse from nationalist cyber bullies after revealing she donated £1million to the fight against breaking up Britain. The best-selling author said she loves Scotland and wants ‘to see it thrive’. Though she had prepared herself for the attacks, the extreme level of online abuse sparked condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from pro- independence politicians. When David Bowie made a statement supporting the Union was read out on his behalf at the Brit Awards in February. In response to his message, ‘Scotland, stay with us’, one cybernat told him on Facebook to ‘f*** off back to Mars.’ Asked whether he agrees with Bowie, Kermit told The Big Issue in March: ‘Absolutely!’ However, he revealed his other half was preparing for Scotland to go it alone. ‘I understand that Miss Piggy is willing to serve as Queen of Scotland if there is a split. So you may want to guard your castles,’ Kermit added, while promoting his latest film in London. Myers once claimed he chose to give the green ogre a Scottish accent because it pitted him against the English aristocracy who ruled the land of the fairytale. He told USA Today: ‘There is a class struggle in Shrek between the fairy-tale kings and queens and the common people . ‘I always thought that Shrek was raised working-class. And since Lord Farquaad (the villain) was played English, I thought of Scottish.’ Alex Salmond’s panicked aides have ordered a massive publicity campaign – paid for using public money – in an attempt to reverse public opinion. Fearing they have been massively ‘out-gunned’ by the Westminster Government, the SNP administration plans to send a pro-independence document to every household in Scotland at a likely cost to taxpayers of more than £700,000. It is the latest sign of how the jittery Yes campaign fears it is losing momentum with less than three months to go until polling day. The latest YouGov poll for The Times says support for a Yes vote in September's referendum has fallen to 35 per cent, while 54 per cent said they would vote No. Just two per cent of people said they did not plan to vote, suggesting a high turnout on September 18. Nine per cent said they did not know how they would vote. About 12 per cent said they were undecided or did not intend to vote. When the non-voters and the undecided are removed, Yes has 39 per cent and No 61 per cent. YouGov interviewed 1,206 Scottish adults between June 25 and 29. The poll will make grim reading for Mr Salmond, who has struggled to counter the idea that independence would be bad for Scotland. Just 27 per cent of those surveyed said Scotland would be better off economically by severing its links with the rest of the UK, compared to 49 per cent who said worse off. Similarly, 43 per cent said they personally would be financially worse off, while just 17 per cent thought independence would make them better off. Lord McConnell said that supporters of devolution must 'keep making the case' for remaining in the UK . Former First Minister Jack McConnell returned to frontline politics yesterday to warn that the fight against Scottish independence could last for generations. The ex-Labour leader, now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, said that supporters of devolution must 'keep making the case' for remaining in the UK even if the Nationalists are defeated in September. In a wide-ranging speech to mark the 15th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish parliament, he said: . Lord McConnell, who was First Minister from 2001 until 2007, said he took the decision in May to join the fight against independence, and wanted to use Holyrood's 15th anniversary to make his first speech of the campaign. Speaking at The Hub in Edinburgh, the 54-year-old said: 'I have watched over the past two years the debate around the referendum on independence become increasingly polarised between Unionism and nationalism. 'I have never described myself as a Unionist, although I respect most who do. I am not a nationalist, although I respect most Scots who are. I am a patriot, a democrat and I believe in a better Scotland in a better world. 'I appeal to those who believe in Scotland, who care about Scotland, who are democrats and patriots - but not nationalists - to think twice. 'Not to save the Union. But to save devolution, to save home rule inside the United Kingdom.' Lord McConnell told journalists: 'If the outcome is that we stick with home rule inside the UK then... we have to continue to make the case for that system of government for Scotland.' He also set out the case for further devolution of powers beyond a No vote, and wider consideration of how the UK is governed. He said: 'I would like to see a conference for the new Union, where there is a genuine debate about how the UK should be governed in the 21st century because the UK has now changed. 'I would like to see a commitment on the part of all three main Westminster parties after the referendum that they would look at having such a conference whatever the outcome of the next year's general election.' Outlining his own vision for a reformed House of Lords, he said it could be similar to Germany's Bundesrat, which represents the sixteen Länder - federal states - at the national level. Former Independent MSP Dennis Canavan, chairman of the Yes campaign, boycotted the historic opening of the Scottish parliament 15 years ago. But yesterday he hailed Holyrood's record and used the anniversary to announce that a small group of ex-MSPs now back independence. The group includes outspoken Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party leader John Swinburne and former Tory MSP Nick Johnston.","Star who voiced Scottish ogre says he wants voters to reject independence .

"Part of a Sydney home had to be torn down on Thursday so paramedics could remove a man weighing more than 300kg in need of urgent medical attention. More than 20 rescue workers were called to the Croydon Park home to remove the 36-year-old man's front window because he was too large to fit through the front door. The operation to remove the man took three hours and involved putting black plastic on a ramp sloping out of the hole in the wall and 'sliding him out on his back', according to neighbours. Part of a Sydney home had to be torn down on Thursday so paramedics could remove a man weighing more than 300kg in need of urgent medical attention . A relative of the home's landlord said he had only seen the man once in the lounge room of the house. 'He was across the whole sofa lounge, a three person lounge,' he told Mailonline. 'His shoulder was at one end and his feet at the other. He took up the whole lounge.' He said the man and his family had been living in the house for between two and three years and were public housing tenants. The man weighs between 300kg and 400kg but a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman refused to confirm his exact weight. The man was suffering chest pains and had preexisting medical conditions so he needed to go to hospital for emergency treatment. The man called paramedics to help him get to hospital and when they arrived extra fire and rescue workers were brought in to help, at around 11am. The operation concluded at about 2pm. More than 20 rescue workers were called to remove the 36-year-old man's front window because he was too large to fit through the front door . A relative of the landlord said the man and his family had been living in the house for between two and three years and were public housing tenants . The man called paramedics to help him get to hospital and when they arrived extra fire and rescue workers were brought in to help, at around 11am . The special ambulance used to remove the man is called a bariatric truck, some of which have a hydraulic lifter to hoist patients into the back. The truck is also called a multi purpose vehicle which paramedics nickname the 'massive person vehicle' , or simply call it 'the fat truck'. NSW has around six fat trucks which operate throughout the state. A neighbour said he had last seen the obese man 18 months ago, but said he 'never left the house'. 'He's always sitting in a chair in the hallway or the doorway. He never came out,' he said. Another neighbour who didn't want to be named said the house was the scene of a domestic incident at Christmas, which saw a man punch a hole in the wall. Two people were pictured coming out the house on Thursday night after the man was removed and taken to a nearby hospital . The obese man lived with an older man, a woman in her 30s, another young man in his 20s and a boy believed to be under 10 . The man's family, who did not go to hospital, declined to talk to the Daily Mail Australia when approached today. The obese man lived with an older man, a woman in her 30s, another young man in his 20s and a boy believed to be under 10. Neighbours said they were a quiet family who had only moved into the area in the last two years. A Fire and Rescue NSW spokeswoman said five crews - or about 20 workers - attended the scene. He was moved out of the house on a ramp, which was built sloping out of the house's front bedroom window. Another ramp was built up into the ambulance. An Urban Search and Rescue semi trailer was brought to the scene to assist with the rescue. Rescue workers were forced to wear protective overalls and respiratory gear because the house contained asbestos.

"He may be out of the Wimbledon championships – but the reasons for Andy Murray’s four-letter outbursts during his humiliating defeat by Grigor Dimitrov were still being feverishly discussed yesterday. Did a row with his girlfriend Kim Sears a few minutes before play prompt him to turn towards the players’ box and shout incredulously: ‘Five minutes before the f***ing match?’ Had there been a disagreement with his new coach Amelie Mauresmo? And who was the target of his ‘Shut the f*** up!’ attack, which he screamed in the direction of Miss Sears, Miss Mauresmo and his mother Judy Murray? Scroll down for video . Contrite? Murray arrives at coach Amelie Mauresmo's house yesterday with a card... and leaves in good spirits . Here – as Murray prepares to return to training in Miami – the Daily Mail examines speculation surrounding his flare-up and names the main suspects. KIM SEARS: . Face of the defeated: Murray's loss was chronicled by the change in expressions of girlfriend Kim Sears . The story of Murray’s defeat was chronicled blow by blow in the facial expressions of his loyal girlfriend Kim Sears. Occasionally she appeared to offer advice beyond the standard ‘Come on Andy!’, preferred by much of the Centre Court crowd. Fact: They didn’t leave together after the match – Andy jumped in an All England Club courtesy car immediately after his post-match press conference and had not changed out of his kit. Their separate departures would not normally be cause for speculation but Miss Sears did accompany him after his 2012 defeat by Roger Federer – and on Wednesday was said to have been ‘looking upset’ when she left without him. Wicked internet speculation that she had chosen five minutes before the big match to dump him/tell him she was pregnant/say she had always liked Roger cannot be substantiated. But the breaking news last night was that Miss Sears had accidentally let slip the ending of a box-set TV series they had been watching. Yesterday his grandfather Roy Erskine, 82, said of the ‘five-minutes’ mystery: ‘Normally he’ll be alone in his dressing room so I have no idea what could possibly have gone wrong.’ AMELIE MAURESMO: . Coach: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court . The French former world number one started coaching Murray after he lost in the semi-finals of the French Open last month. Recently when asked about their professional partnership, she volunteered that things were getting ‘smoother and smoother’ perhaps implying there was a time when they were less so. Fact: Miss Mauresmo was seen sprinting up the stairs to the competitors’ box just moments before Murray came on to court to face Dimitrov. Did she tell him to change his strategy? Might she have clashed with him over tactics? Was something she said playing on Murray’s brooding mind? Yesterday a track-suited Murray arrived at her flat near the ground for a pre-arranged meeting. He was carrying what appeared to be a card in an envelope with a single name written on it. Cards declaring ‘Sorry I Told You to Shut The F*** Up’ are not widely available – but in any case, it is Amelie’s 35th birthday tomorrow. The pair spent more than two hours inside before Andy left alone. But conspiracy theories which suggested coach and player were about to separate amid some unspecified acrimony fell flat when he failed to stomp out in a strop. 'Off his game': Andy Murray's play was 'not quite right' during their warm-up according to his friend Dimitrov . Enraged: The defending champion also yelled 'shut the f*** up!' at his team according to photographers . Speculation: The 23-year-old Bulgarian (pictured with Murray after his win) said 'it is just a feeling' when he told reporters Andy was not playing to his best ability. The pair are close friends and play together regularly . JUDY MURRAY: . Andy’s mother and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match. Fact: Mrs Murray was at court 18 to cheer her other son, Jamie, to victory in his mixed doubles opener with Australian Casey Dellacqua. Little brother Andy had already lost the first set by the time she arrived. Last week Andy joked he was ‘the number two son’, and that his family seemed to spend a great deal of time watching the number one. Support: Andy’s mother Judy and long-time former coach remains a constant presence. Except, that is, for some possibly critical minutes on Wednesday at the start of the match . Another theory: Was Mrs Murray shouting advice that contradicted Murray’s coach? Perhaps. But even for a grumpy Scot in a foul mood, it is surely beyond the realms of possibility that he would tell his own mother to ‘shut the f*** up’. Afterwards she stressed she knew of nothing that might have upset him. MAGGIE MAY: . Roger Federer has entered the debate over Wimbledon’s all-white dress code, saying it is ‘too strict’. The seven-time champion urged the All England Club to ‘loosen its grip’. He said: ‘We’re all white. White, white, full-on white … My personal opinion, I think it’s too strict. ‘ . Tighter rules were brought in this year amid concerns that sponsors were weaving more colour into players’ kit. The couple’s beloved border terrier, named after the Rod Stewart hit, has previously used Twitter throughout her master’s Wimbledon appearances. This year she has not tweeted even a bark. Has she been unwell? Fact: Four years ago Mrs Murray revealed Andy was ‘worried sick’ throughout the tournament after Maggie fell ill. THE BANANA: . Murray has previously relied on bananas for their energy-giving qualities. Fact: On the advice of a nutritionist, he cut back on bananas last year – and won Wimbledon. This year he admitted he was back on them – and lost. FATE: . Play began on Centre Court at noon rather than the usual time of 1pm. Murray’s early start led to suggestions afterwards that he he was not mentally prepared for his game. Was he given only five minutes’ notice of the change? Murray dismissed the speculation in his BBC blog yesterday, declaring: ‘There was nothing different in the build-up, and no reason to expect that kind of performance.’ ANDY MURRAY: . Perhaps the player himself is the only real suspect. Could it simply be that he lost? It is the only theory he publicly supports. ‘Yeah,’ said Murray. I certainly lost the match, yeah.’ Shock: Dimitrov, who ranks at No13 in the world, was astounded when he secured his place in the semi-finals . The fashions may have changed since their hit duet 45 years ago. But Cilla Black and Sir Cliff Richard’s devotion to each other clearly has not. The singers have been firm friends since their pop heyday and released the duet Walk On By in 1969. Yesterday, they arrived at the Royal Box arm-in-arm, laughing and joking as they enjoyed the women’s semi-finals. They also chatted to Love Actually actor Colin Firth and Inbetweeners star Laura Haddock in the Royal Box. Sir Cliff, of course, is a Wimbledon regular and in 1996 gave an impromptu performance of Singing in the Rain on Centre Court during a long delay in play caused by rain.

"For most politicians, image is everything. Not a hair out of place, no grimace or gurning caught on camera, each public appearance carefully stage managed.

Ed Miliband's grim experience wrestling with a bacon sandwich or Nick Clegg's habit of looking glum in all pictures have attracted widespread ridicule. And yet for Boris, it seems, there is no dance routine too ridiculous, no uniform too ill-fitting, no sport too demanding and, famously, no zip-wire too high for the wannabe Tory leader to turn to his advantage. To mark Jeremy Paxman's final appearance hosting Newsnight, Boris took him for a ride on a tandem around London and outed the presenter as 'the last one-nation Tory working at the BBC' I'll be bike: Boris persuaded Hollywood star Arnold Schwarzenegger to mount a Boris Bike during a photocall in London in March 2011 . The political heavyweight appeared piled on the pounds when taking part in the Ridelondon Grand Prix in August last year, although aides blamed an unflattering billowing t-shirt .

"A 17-year-old cheerleader who had just graduated from high school in New Jersey was shot in the head and killed on Sunday. Cheyanne Bond had been walking down a street in Newark at about 9.45pm when she and her male friend, also 17, were attacked. The teenager, who had planned to study nursing at college, was ordered to get on her knees before being shot 'execution style' a relative said. Scroll down for video . Loss: Cheyanne Bond, 17, was forced to her knees and shot in the head on Sunday . Ambitious: Cheyanne, pictured right at her high school graduation, had been planning to study nursing at college . Police have released security camera footage of two young men seen near the crime scene, who they believe may have witnessed the shooting. A reward of $12,500 is also being offered for help in catching the killer, as Newark mayor Ras Baraka raised concerns over rising gun violence in the city. Cheyanne was the third homicide to be reported in Newark in less than 24 hours at the weekend. Her uncle, Michael Bond, told CBS New York that his young niece never had a chance. 'They told her to get on her knees and they shot her in the head execution style,' Bond said. 'Just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.' The teenager, who was described by school friends as quiet and hard working, had graduated from Malcolm X Shabazz High School a week before she was shot.

Tragic: Cheyanne, who had been living with a guardian since her mother's death 10 years ago, had been excited about starting college . Loved: The teenager's guardian described Cheyanne, pictured on her way to prom, as 'an angel and a blessing' Friends of Cheyanne, who knew her as Shay, gathered at the site of the shooting earlier this week to leave candles and messages of support. Her father Walter Ramey declined to be interviewed by TV crews, and said only that he wanted his daughter’s killer caught. The money the family had put aside to pay for her college fund is now being used for funeral expenses. Cheyanne had been living with a guardian in Irvington, but was also registered at her father's address while she was attending high school. She moved in with her guardian and aunt, Samera Newsome, after the death of her mother about ten years ago. Newsome said Cheyanne had left the house at about 6pm on Sunday, and hadn't planned to be out late. She described the girl she had looked after for so long as 'an angel and definitely a blessing', telling NJ.com Cheyanne was 'just a normal teenager living her life'.

Fun kid' who was part of the school's cheer leading team. 'She had her friends, she loved to laugh, she loved to be at school,' he said, adding: 'She was quiet. She wasn’t a real loud, rowdy type of girl.' During the vigil for the teenager, the Rev Thomas Ellis, of anti-crime group Enough is Enough, called for an end to violence. 'When you lose a young person to gun violence, you have to come together. The violence stops when we stop it,' he said, according to NJ.com. Police have not released a motive for the killing yet, but said they had not ruled out robbery.

"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford today admitted he's used 'every drug you can probably think of' - but insisted he's only ever used alcohol in his office. The beleaguered mayor, who returned to City Hall on Monday after nearly two months in rehab, said in an interview with CBC that he's used cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. 'You name it, I've abused it,' he said - but later clarified that he has not used heroin. In an astonishing moment, Ford admitted: 'I was born with blond hair, I'll die with blond hair. I was born . with this disease, I'm going to die with this disease.' Scroll down for video . Revelations: In his first sit-down interview since returning to city hall, Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted he had consumed alcohol in his office - but denied ever taking drugs there . Yet despite his admission, Ford said he wants to stand for re-election in October, claiming it is up to the people of Toronto whether he has a future as mayor. He acknowledged he had smoked crack when . reporter Dwight Drummond held up a picture showing him with what . appeared to be a crack pipe, but he denied that he was a crack addict. Ford insisted that he consumed the drugs in his 'personal time' but did admit to drinking while in his City Hall office. In police interviews last fall, Ford's former executive assistant Kia Nejatian said he had found a marijuana joint in Ford’s desk drawer at city hall, throwing doubts on his claims. He also blamed the substance abuse for the racist and homophobic language he's used in the past. 'I think that goes along with having this disease,' he said. 'You do things, you say things that aren't you. I take full responsibility. All I can do is apologise and deal with this disease. This is an everyday battle. This is the beginning of a long journey.' He went . on: 'I was born with blond hair, I'll die with blond hair. I was born . with this disease, I'm going to die with this disease.' Back to work: Ford shakes hands with members of the public as he takes part in the East York Canada Day Parade on Tuesday in his first public appearance since returning from rehab . Ford . repeatedly refused to say whether he'd resign if he falls of the wagon . again and that he wouldn't be giving up his job to give himself time to . deal with his substance abuse issues. Asked if that was good enough for the people of Toronto, Ford said it would be up to them to decide in the October 27 election. 'I'm taking one day at a time. I did not drink yesterday, I haven't drunk today,' Ford said. Ford acknowledged last year that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor'. His reign as mayor has been marred by revelations about his drinking problems and illegal drug use. But he insisted he's been abusing drugs and alcohol for years and said his job is not what drove him to abuse substances. Young fan? He holds a baby as he attends a picnic on Tuesday. He has vowed to run for office again . 'I love my job and keeping busy is the best thing for me,' he said. Ford had entered the GreeneStone facility in Ontario on May 1 to be treated for alcohol addition after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack; Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials.","Rob Ford admitted using cocaine, marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms .

"The chief operating officer of Facebook has apologised for the manipulation of 700,000 users' accounts in a controversial secret study. Sheryl Sandberg's comments were the first from a Facebook executive since it was revealed that the social network altered users' newsfeeds to see if it had an effect on their emotions. It was also a climb down from Tuesday's insistence that it was an experiment covered by the network's terms and conditions. Scroll down for video . Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg apologised while addressing a conference in India after it was revealed the social network manipulated some users' news feeds . It emerged at the weekend, when the . experiment's results were revealed in a paper published in a journal, that . Facebook allowed researchers to manipulate the content that appeared in . the main section, or news feed of about 700,000 randomly selected users . during a single week in January 2012. The data-scientists were trying to . collect evidence to prove their thesis that people's moods could spread . like an 'emotional contagion' depending on the type of the content that . they were reading. None of the . participants in the Facebook experiments were explicitly asked for . their permission, though the social network's terms of use appears to . allow for the company to manipulate what appears in users' news feeds . however it sees fits. Facebook's . data-use policy says the California-based company can deploy user . information for 'internal operations, including troubleshooting, data . analysis, testing, research and service improvement.' Ms Sandberg . is in India where she addressed a gathering during a session organised . by Federation of Indian chambers of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi. She . said: 'This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different . products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated. 'And for that communication we apologise. We never meant to upset you.' She . also told television network NDTV in India during an interview that 'we . clearly communicated really badly about this and that we really . regret.' Ms Sandberg was in New Delhi to meet entrepreneurs and businesswomen at a session organised by Federation of Indian chambers of Commerce and Industry in New Delhi . Later she added: 'Facebook has apologised and certainly we never want to do anything that upsets users.' Her comments come as it emerged today the British . Information Commissioner said that it wants to learn more about the . circumstances underlying the study carried out by two U.S. universities . and Facebook. The study . concluded that people were more likely to post negative updates about . their lives after the volume of positive information appearing in their . Facebook feeds had been purposefully reduced by the researchers. The opposite reaction occurred when the number of negative posts appeared in people's news feeds. The inquiry is being coordinated with authorities in Ireland, where Facebook has headquarters for its European operations, as well as with French regulators. The concern over Facebook's experiment comes amid interest in Europe about beefing up data-protection rules. The European Court of Justice last month ruled that Google must respond to users' requests seeking to remove links to personal information. It emerged at the weekend that Facebook allowed researchers to manipulate content as part of a study into emotions . Suzy Moat, a Warwick Business School assistant professor of behavioural science, said businesses regularly do studies on how to influence behaviour. She cited the example of Facebook and Amazon experimenting with showing different groups of people slightly different versions of their websites to see if one is better than another at getting customers to buy products. 'On the other hand, it's extremely understandable that many people are upset that their behaviour may have been manipulated for purely scientific purposes without their consent,' she said. 'In particular, Facebook's user base is so wide that everyone wonders if they were in the experiment.' Facebook's director of policy in Europe, Richard Allan, told MailOnline: 'It’s clear that people were upset by this study and we take responsibility for it. 'We want to do better in the future and are improving our process based on this feedback. 'The study was done with appropriate protections for people’s information and we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have.' An official statement from the site added: 'Our academic research and publication proposals are reviewed internally when proposals are made and before they are submitted for publication. 'This review analyses the impact on user data, including appropriate safeguards to help ensure the research does not disclose information associated with a specific person’s Facebook account and that it uses the minimum amount of data required for the study.'","Sheryl Sandberg apologised for 'poor communication' of the study .

"David Cameron was today warned the Northern Ireland peace process is in 'state of stagnation' during his first bilateral talks with Sinn Fein leaders. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuiness used a 'frank' meeting with the British Prime Minister to claim he is not fulfilling his obligations under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. It is the first time Mr Cameron has held a one-on-one meeting with the republican party since coming to office, despite regularly holding individual talks with the DUP. It is the first time Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have held a bilateral with David Cameron since he became Prime Minister . The Prime Minister hosted a meeting with the republicans in the House of Parliament, as negotiations continued over the outstanding peace process issues including flags, parades and the past in Northern Ireland. It is the first time Mr Cameron has held a one-on-one meeting with the republican party since coming to office, despite regularly holding individual talks with the DUP. Mr Adams said that Mr Cameron was aware there were 'difficulties' in the process and would meet Sinn Fein again in the autumn. Speaking to reporters outside the Palace of Westminster, Mr Adams said: 'This is the first meeting that we have done as a Sinn Fein delegation with the British Prime Minister. 'We made the point to him that he is not fulfilling his obligations in terms of the Good Friday Agreement, that the process is in a state of stagnation at this time.' Mr Adams said he had made the point to the governments in both Dublin and Westminster that they needed to demonstrate 'leadership and a fulfilment of their obligations'. The meeting, and fresh talks at Stormont, come six months after marathon negotiations chaired by former US diplomat Richard Haass ended without agreement. Shortly after Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Cameron convened an official meeting in Number 10 with Stormont First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister, Mr McGuinness. He was joined by Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and officials from both governments. But later Mr Cameron held a separate meeting with Mr Adams and Mr McGuiness, the first time he has sat down with Sinn Fein alone since become Prime Minister. Martin McGuinness (2nd R), Michelle Gildernew (2nd L), a Sinn Fein MP, Gerry Adams, the President of Sinn Fein, and Mary Lou McDonald (C), the Vice President of Sinn Fein, prepare to address the media in front of the Houses of Parliament . Tensions have been heightened since Mr Adams was sensationally arrested in May over the murder of a widowed mother of ten who was abducted from her home during the Troubles more than 40 years ago. He was questioned for four days by detectives investigating the murder of Jean McConville - abducted and killed by the Provisional IRA in 1972 and later buried on a beach in the Republic of Ireland. After his release, Mr Adams condemned ‘sustained, malicious, untruthful campaign’ alleging his involvement in the killing. His arrest came less than a month after Mr McGuiness’s historic handshake with the Queen at a reception for the Irish President during a state visit to Windsor Castle. Mr McGuinness joined in a toast to the Queen during a State banquet at the castle. As the meetings were held in Downing Street, talks got underway in Belfast aimed at resolving outstanding disputes as part of the peace process. A three-day session of intensive negotiations focused on the outstanding peace process issues started at Parliament Buildings, Stormont. Another three day round of talks is scheduled for next week. Prime Minister David Cameron (far right) and Northern Ireland Secretary meet Northern Ireland First Minister, Peter Robinson (second from left) and his deputy, Martin McGuinness (far left) in the Prime Minister's office at the Houses of Parliament . Delegations from the five parties in the power-sharing executive are trying to achieve some degree of progress and reduce community tensions before the biggest day of the loyal order marching season on July 12. But with parties having seemingly entrenched positions on many of the issues, the prospects of a substantive deal before then appear slim. Arriving for the talks, Sinn Fein's lead negotiator Gerry Kelly acknowledged there was public scepticism about what the negotiations would achieve. 'From our point of view we are setting the scepticism aside,' he said. The renewed talks bid comes at Stormont six months after marathon negotiations chaired by former US diplomat Richard Haass ended without agreement. While draft proposals outlined by Dr Haass remain on the table, with the party leaders having met periodically to discuss the outstanding issues since January, efforts to strike a deal in his absence have made little progress. In recent years serious rioting has broken out in north Belfast in mid July linked to a contentious Orange Order parade on a short stretch of road next to a nationalist neighbourhood. An imminent determination on whether that parade will be allowed to proceed this year hangs like a shadow over the new talks initiative at Stormont and has the potential to destabilise the process. The talks involving the Democratic Unionists, Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists, the SDLP and Alliance Party are being facilitated by a senior civil servant.","Prime Minister has first bilateral with republican party since taking office .

"The Commonwealth Bank has finally apologised for dodgy financial dealings that spanned over a decade and lost its customers hundreds of millions of dollars. On Thursday, chief executive Ian Narev faced the media to issue a long-awaited apology - a week after a Senate report slammed the bank for its poor handling of the scandal. 'To all the customers who received poor advice, I apologise unreservedly,' Mr Narev told reporters in Sydney. Scroll down for video . Some of Commonwealth Bank's financial advisers switched clients' life savings into high-risk investment products without permission . 'We are truly sorry and we acknowledge the financial hardship that you suffered as a result of the poor advice.' A Senate report - headed by former Western Australia senator Mark Bishop - blasted the bank and corporate watchdog, Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), for their lacklustre responses to fraud and misconduct allegations levelled at some of CBA financial planners. Chief executive Ian Narev has apologised to Commonwealth Bank customers who were affected by the scandal . It also recommended a royal commission be launched into the bank. Between 2003 and 2012, customers lost large amounts of life savings after they were switched into high-risk investment products without consent, and in some cases financial planners were forging client signatures to approve profit-producing product switches. Mr Narev also announced a review into the bank's financial dealings over the 10 years called the Open Advice Review program on Thursday. It will allow customers to request a review of their case from the bank, and a further option would be available to have it reviewed by an independent panel chosen by the bank. Mr Narev said the bank has already paid out $52 million worth in compensation to 1,100 people who were affected by the scandal, but some reports suggest the number affected might be as high as 12,000. But he said any more money to be paid out would be 'inconsequential' for shareholders in the $130 billion banking giant. And investors seemed unmoved by the developments. CBA shares rose 63 cents on Thursday to $81.55. But critics say the bank's latest review doesn't go far enough. Mark Bishop said the new compensation review did not differ much from existing arrangements. 'I welcome the apology of Mr Narev - that is a welcome development - but overall what we have on the table is marginal change at best,' he told the ABC. Law firm Maurice Blackburn, which has represented affected CBA customers, questioned the appointment process for the bank's independent panel and customer advocates. 'If it's the Commonwealth Bank that appoints them, then that's not independent,' Maurice Blackburn partner John Berrill said. Former Senator Mark Bishop chaired and handed down the senate report that called for a royal commission into the bank and slammed its response to the scandal . But federal government figures backed the review, including Treasurer Joe Hockey, whose mother-in-law was among those hurt by the scandal. 'You've got to have a plan to ensure that people are given appropriate compensation. They're starting to do that but there's obviously a way to go,' he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott played down the prospect of a royal commission into the financial planning industry. 'I don't want to overdo the reviews because in the end what people expect from government is appropriate action not endless study, particularly studies which don't necessarily lead to outcomes,' he said.","Chief executive Ian Narev has apologised for the dodgy financial dealings .

"Acclaimed Irish author Colum McCann was badly injured after being attacked while trying to break up a domestic dispute just outside the gates of a famed Ivy league school . McCann was reportedly trying to break up a fight early Saturday evening between the woman and her boyfriend at a New Haven, Connecticut hotel. Yale University calls the city home. He instead ended up with a concussion, broken cheekbone and some broken teeth from the 'shocking, cowardly attack in broad daylight on a busy street,' he told the Irish Times in a statement. Critically acclaimed: Colum McCann's 2011 novel Let the Great World Spin won him awards around the world . The assault reportedly happened when the novelist stepped in while a man and woman were fighting outside The Study at the Yale Hotel around 10.00 p.m., according to the New Haven Independent. First responders arrived to find him on the sidewalk bleeding from the head, police told the paper. He was taken to the hospital, released later that night and returned home to New York City. ‘I was trying to help someone out,’ his statement said. ‘I was cold-clocked without warning. I had a severe concussion, a broken cheekbone, some broken teeth and a spirit that has been temporarily bruised. ‘But I am recovering quickly and I’ve been overwhelmed by the generous response from friends and strangers alike.’ He credited an nearby off-duty paramedic with rushing to his aid as the attacker fled the scene. McCann told the Times he was in New Haven to attend a conference on empathy at Yale University for Narrative 4, a non-profit organization he is involved in. He was forced to pull out of a Sunday event because of the attack. Where it happened: McCann was knocked out on this sidewalk just outside The Study, a popular book store and hangout spot just off campus . ‘I suffered a few injuries but nothing that can’t be quickly healed,’ he continued. ‘If anything, I was shaken out of the ruts of my ordinary perception, and I have been struck the genuine caring nature of people asking about how they can help out.’ The award-winning author then used the opportunity to call attention to ‘others who suffer far worse violence. ‘We need to speak out against this sort of thing. The police have not yet arrested the attacker but I believe they are very close to pressing charges, using video and witness evidence,’ he added. ‘It could have happened anywhere in the world. The fact that it happened on the edge of one of the world’s foremost colleges campuses simply highlights how prevalent this sort of situation is,’ said McCann. New Haven, where Yale University is located, does have an above-average crime rate, but it is not as common for attacks like this to occur on or near the campus. Police told the Independent that an investigation remains ongoing, and that they are working under the assumption this was not a random attack. ‘What we believe happened is that the victim tried to intercede in what appeared to be a domestic dispute between a man and a woman,’  said Assistant Police Chief Archie Generoso. ‘He saw a woman pushed to the ground. He tried to assist the woman. ‘He asked the woman if she wanted him to call the police. He urged her to do so. She said she didn’t want to call the police. The guy said, ‘It’s your decision.’ He turned around, began to walk away, and he was assaulted,’ Generoso continued. McCann is home recovering and should be back to normal within a few weeks. He has written six novels, including 2011’s Let the Great World Spin – which earned him international acclaim and several awards including the International Impact Award and many other honors.","Colum McCann was attacked outside a popular bookstore/cafe just off Yale University's new Haven, Connecticut campus .

"Blackpool find themselves in the farcical situation whereby they have just eight professionals and have had to cancel a pre-season tour to La Manga. With just 25 days to go until their Championship season gets underway at Nottingham Forest, chairman Karl Oyston and new manager Jose Riga are locked in a stand-off over transfer targets. Riga has only been in charge of the Seasiders for five weeks - the only signing to date being Estonian striker Sergei Zenjov - but there is no sign of either side backing down and tensions remain high. Rebuilding job: New boss Jose Riga has been force to scrap a summer tour to Spain . Defender Tony McMahon penned a new deal to make him the sole out-of-contract player to remain. Teenage centre-back Harrison McGahey - an impressive performer in keeping the club up last season - looks set for a move to League One Sheffield United, while there are a host of players on trial, including former Chelsea midfielder Jacob Mellis, at the dilapidated training ground Squires Gate. They were due to fly out to La Manga on Sunday for a nine-day trip but have called it off through a lack of players, shining a light on the shambolic circumstances currently engulfing the Fylde Coast side. It throws up yet more questions as to how Riga goes about preparing for the new campaign, given a friendly against Penrith on Saturday and then another when Burnley visit on August 2 are the only matches planned. Keeping calm: Chairman Karl Oyston says there's no need to panic . Oyston, however, is convinced that nothing is wrong at Bloomfield Road - even though the new boss is still yet to give any sort of press conference or media briefing since taking over. ‘There is no panic,’ he told BBC Sport. ‘In fact, I see it as a benefit rather than a downside. It allows the manager to bring in his own team, as opposed to a manager picking up a squad that is already overloaded and he doesn't think is good enough.’ The manager handed Oyston a sizeable list of up to 50 targets to enquire about last month and has seen minimal return. News of the tour cancellation is just another sorry chapter in the recent history of a side who just three years ago were in the Premier League and only suffered relegation on the final day. Lonely: Tony McMahon (right) is one of only EIGHT contracted players . As well as that, Sam Oyston - who runs the club’s loss-making hotel - tweeted about spending the afternoon pigeon shooting alongside brother George inside the stadium. The tweet was later deleted. The lack of a squad and - gallingly - a goalkeeper is an obvious cause for concern but there is a further undercurrent of discontent behind the scenes. The Oyston family, who have recently openly mocked fans, have paid themselves and companies they own £26million since the club’s unexpected rise to the top flight, with supporters protesting angrily towards the end of last season in the first show of overt dissent against the ownership in years. Sportsmail understands that club president Valeri Belokon, whose combined loan of £7.2m to the club still hasn’t been repaid and helped sign players plus build a stand, is growing ever restless at the club’s position.

Dasha Kopylova, three, posed in front of this bear cage in Russia for a photograph moments before the animal ripped her hand off and began eating it . The animal lashed out after Dasha poked her hand through the bars of its cage while her mother Olga's back was turned (pictured, Dasha in hospital) The tragedy happened at a Russia holiday camp where Olga works as a cleaner. She had taken daughter Dasha along with her to keep an eye on her. Olga, 35, said: 'I can't afford a place for her in one of the private kindergartens so when I don't have anyone to look after I just take with me. 'The bear is kept in a cage at the park and she wanted to have a picture taken to show her friends. I did warn you not to get too close but I left alone for a second because she asked for a drink of water. 'I only turned my back for a second when I suddenly heard her screaming, and I ran back to find her lying on the ground next to the bear cage. 'She had a bloody stump where a hand had been and I saw the bear holding it in his front paws, chewing away. 'I tried to provide the first aid and took her to the local hospital. But local doctors said they could not provide the necessary help. 'There was not even an ambulance to transfer my girl to the nearest city hospital in Shakhty.' Olga says she took Dasha to work with her at a holiday camp where the bear is kept as an attraction, but the accident happened while her back was turned to get water . Dasha is now in a stable condition but faces rehabilitation work to get used to life without her right hand .

"They are two of the most destructive computer viruses ever created, tailor-made for cyber-espionage and capable of wreaking havoc on government systems. Both Flame and Stuxnet are believed to have been used by the U.S. government to wage online warfare against hostile regimes. Now The Washington Post has claimed, citing anonymous Western officials, that the United States and Israel jointly developed the Flame computer virus that collected intelligence to help slow Iran's nuclear program. The so-called Flame malware aimed to map Iran's computer networks and monitor computers of Iranian officials, the newspaper said. Collaboration: Sources say the two nations worked together to develop Flame, with the purpose of damaging Iran's nuclear program . It was designed to provide intelligence to help in a cyber campaign against Iran's nuclear program, involving the National Security Agency, the CIA and Israel's military, the Post said. The cyber campaign against Iran's nuclear program has included the use of another computer virus called Stuxnet that caused malfunctions in Iran's nuclear enrichment equipment, the newspaper said. Current and former U.S. and Western national security officials confirmed to Reuters that the United States played a role in creating the Flame virus. Since Flame was an intelligence 'collection' virus rather than a cyberwarfare program to sabotage computer systems, it required less-stringent U.S. legal and policy review than any U.S. involvement in offensive cyberwarfare efforts, experts told Reuters. The CIA, NSA, Pentagon, and Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Flame is the most complex computer spying program ever discovered. Two leading computer security firms - Kaspersky Lab and Symantec Corp - have linked some of the software code in the Flame virus to the Stuxnet computer virus, which was widely believed to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.

"Scandal: Simon Walsh (pictured), a former aide to Boris Johnson, is on trial accused of viewing sadomasochistic pornography which was 'likely to cause serious injury' A gay former aide to Boris Johnson admitted to being a sadomasochist who enjoys a 'strange sex life' but denied possessing extreme images of men engaged in acts 'likely to cause injury', a court heard. Oxford-educated barrister Simon Walsh, 50, who was once tipped to be the Lord Mayor of London, is accused of possessing extreme pornography and an indecent picture of an underage boy. Some of the images found on Walsh's Hotmail account showed violent sex acts and one email included a sexually graphic description of a hanging, Kingston Crown Court heard. Mr Walsh was sacked by the London Mayor and his chief of staff Sir Edward Lister in November after refusing to stand down from his post as a mayoral appointee to the London fire authority. He has been denied access to any of his computer files since being arrested in April last year - since which time he has been unable to work as a barrister. He refuses to quit as a member of the City of London Corporation, the Square Mile’s local authority, and denies owning extreme pornography and having any contact with underage boys. He said he could not recall even opening the photo that allegedly shows an underage boy, and added that it had been sent to him unsolicited. Giving evidence in court today, he denied ever hurting anyone and said 'I know the limits and I respect them'. Referring to images involving himself and two . other men from a New Year's Eve party, taken in a  mirror, he denied they were pornographic and said he took them 'as a record of what we have done. I . was asked to take them by the other parties and I then sent them on to . them.' All parties were responsible for . safety, he said, and 'it was not like a safety announcement like when a . plane takes off, but people know if it hurts you say ""ouch"" and it . stops.' Asked if he ever remembered anyone being hurt, he replied: 'Not at all.' The 'explicit' photographs from the party were 'amateurish' and 'could not pass muster as pornographic images', the court was told.The Oxford-educated top barrister told the court during his evidence that the photographs of himself and two other men taken during a New Year’s Eve party were simply a 'record' of what they had done, and denied they were pornographic. Thomas Wilkins, prosecuting, questioned whether involving himself in the activities the photographs display would 'compromise your position as a judge and as somebody with these roles in local government'. The alderman replied: 'When I stand for roles in public office I give up a right to privacy.' Walsh was sacked by the London Mayor (pictured) after being charged with five counts of possessing an extreme pornographic image and one count of possessing an indecent picture of a child . Walsh, of Southwark, denies five counts . of possessing an extreme pornographic image, and one count of possessing . an indecent picture of a child. Asked about the alleged underage image, which was sent as an attachment via email and which remained in his inbox, he denied knowledge of contact with the sender – despite the message reading ‘enjoy, fella.’ Opening the case last week, Mr Wilkins said: 'Pornography is extreme and therefore illegal if it is grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise obscene and shows an activity likely to cause serious injury.' The jury is being asked to decide . whether Walsh's images constitute 'extreme pornography', which carries a . sentence of up to three years in prison. Mr Wilkins said of Walsh: 'He is a gay man who has what he described as a strange sex life. 'He doesn't dispute that he uses the email account purely for his sex life. 'He doesn't dispute that he is interested in bondage and sadomasochism. 'He disputes that the images are extreme or pornographic.' 'I know the limits': Walsh, a top barrister, denied the charges at Kingston Crown . Court (pictured) and disputed whether the images were extreme pornography . Walsh's solicitor, Myles Jackman, of Hodge Jones & Allen, has been given special permission to send live tweets throughout the trial. He is believed to be the first English lawyer to be allowed to do so. The court heard that Walsh's password for his account was 'scat' - the word used for the use of excrement in sex - and that he used the Hotmail account solely for his sex life. The court heard he received as series of emails over many months on this account which showed people engaged in graphic sexual practices. Commenting on the images, Mr Wilkins added: 'There is a serious risk of injury from such actions.' The case hinges in part on whether the images fall under the 'extreme pornography' criteria of depicting 'an act which results, or is likely to result, in serious injury.' The case continues.

"Residents of what is thought to be Europe's oldest town cut their dead in half and buried them from the pelvis up, according to archaeologists. The newly discovered ancient settlement, thought to date back to 4700BC, is near the Bulgarian town of Provadia, about 25 miles from the country's Black Sea coast. Archaeology professor Vassil Nikolov led the dig which focused on the town itself and its necropolis, where the strange and complex burial rituals were discovered. Strange rituals: Some of the corpses found in the necropolis attached to what is thought to be Europe's oldest town were sliced in half and buried from the pelvis up . Ancient: Researchers believe the town, located 25 miles from Bulgaria's Black Sea coast, is Europe's oldest urban settlement and was home to between 300 to 350 people . A whole corpse: Researchers have as yet advanced no theories as to why some corpses were mutilated before burial and others were interred in their entirety . 'Now we can say that the Provadia salt pans location is the oldest town in Europe, [dating from] roughly 4700 to 4200BC,' he told CNN. There is as yet no clue as to why some corpses have been sliced in half and buried from the pelvis up, but researchers found evidence to show some residents of the salt-producing area were wealthy people. Professor Nikolov told the Sofia Globe the town's 300 to 350 residents lived in two-storey homes and earned their living mining the surrounding area for salt, which was as important to the ancient world as oil is today. 'The salt water was evaporated by different techniques in ceramic bowls,' Professor Nikolov told CNN. 'Salt produced was used as money because salt was essential for both humans and animals.' Wealthy: The town's residents lived in two-storey homes and mined the surrounding area for salt, an important resource in ancient times . Security: To protect their wealth, their town was surrounded by stone walls three metres high and a phenomenal two metres thick . The nearby town of Provadia remains an important salt centre to this day, with much foreign investment in the area devoted to extracting the stuff. But in ancient times Provadia-Solnitsata would have needed little in the way of outside money since, as the only place in the Balkans where salt was produced at the time, it was the 'mint' of the region. To protect their wealth, their town was surrounded by stone walls three metres high and a phenomenal two metres thick, which researchers believe are the earliest and most massive fortifications of Europe's pre-history. 'Bun-shaped hairstyles': Discoveries of spiral-shaped copper needles have even given archaeologists clues as to the hairstyles of the town's ancient residents . Skeletons: British, Japanese and German scientists have so far confirmed the Bulgarian team's findings, which were made during a two-month dig over the summer . This map shows the town's location near Provadia, just 25 miles inland from the major coastal city of Provadia . Other findings suggested that even 7,000 years ago the residents of the town had already developed a class system. Archaeologist Margarita Lyuncheva, a member of Professor Nikolov's team, told CNN that finds of spiral copper needles for hairdressing in some graves showed 'there are two grades of people, [one] probably with higher social status'. She added: 'We think that women had a sort of bun-shaped hairstyle.' British, Japanese and German scientists have so far confirmed the Bulgarian team's findings, which were made during a two-month dig over the summer.","Bulgarian town thought to date back as far as 4700BC .

"A 70-year-old man in Washington D.C. has spent more than 40 years locked away in a D.C. hospital for the criminally insane. His crime: stealing a necklace worth $20. Franklin H. Frye was sent to the psychiatric wing of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in 1971 after he was found not guilty by reason of insanity for stealing the necklace. Six years ago, a public defender filed a motion asking a federal court to grant Mr. Frye an unconditional release. In the motion, attorneys for Mr. Frye cited his recovery over the last four decades he spent in psychiatric captivity as grounds for his release. Frye's case, however, is yet to be heard by a judge. Psych ward: Franklin Frye has spent more than 40 years in the St. Elizabeth's psychiatric facility for stealing a $20 necklace . In what the Washington Times - which broke the story about Mr. Frye after reviewing his case and federal court records - describes as 'a serious judicial breakdown,' Mr. Frye's case seems to have slipped through the cracks. According to the paper, the original judge assigned to Mr. Frye's case died in 2007 - when the motion for Mr. Frye's release was first filed. The case wasn't transferred to a judge who is still breathing until the last few weeks. 'Mr. Frye has been waiting over five years to have this motion heard by . the court,' Silvana Naguib, a lawyer now representing him, wrote in a . Jan. 8 legal filing. 'Mr. Frye was accused of stealing a necklace that was valued at approximately twenty dollars,' Ms. Naguib continued in the motion. 'He has been at St. Elizabeth's Hospital almost continuously since.' Glacial pace: Frye's most recent motion for his release was filed six years ago - but is yet to be heard by a judge . Like St. Elizabeth's Hospital's most famous resident, John Hinckley Jr. - the man who infamously shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981 - Mr. Frye has been permitted to spend short amounts of time out of the hospital. Until December, he was part of an outpatient program at Washington Hospital Center. That program ended because of funding problems - and Mr. Frye was sent back to the psychiatric ward. Frye has filed several motions for his release over the last 40 years, including one two years after he was committed. In that motion, the hospital director recommended that Mr. Frye be unconditionally released. The judge, however, approved a conditional release so Mr. Frye could look for a job. 'In the early years of Mr. Frye’s hospitalization, Mr. Frye would sometimes get in fights with other patients, often over money, food, clothing and the other hotly desired commodities of institutional life,' Ms. Naguib wrote in her motion. 'However, in the last decade, as Mr. Frye has aged, these conflicts have all but vanished. Now, nearly 70, Mr. Frye displays no dangerous behavior of any kind.' Infamous: John Hinckley, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan, is also held at St. Elizabeth's Hospital . In his latest motion, Mr. Frye's attorneys reiterate the claims made in the 2008 motion that was never heard by a judge: 'Mr. Frye has recovered his sanity and no longer suffers from a mental illness as defined by law.' Just one day after Naguib filed the most recent motion on Frye's behalf, his case was transferred to a living judge. It's unclear when - or if - the judge will rule on the motion for Mr. Frye's release.","Franklin Frye has been locked away in the St Elizabeth's psychiatric facility since 1971 .

"Ancient rock etchings along a dried-up lake bed in Nevada have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in North America, scientists said. The petroglyphs, which date back at least 10,000 years, were found on limestone boulders near Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada's high desert. The carvings are abstract with tightly clustered geometric designs including diamond patterns and short parallel lines on top of a longer line, but no-one knows who carved them. Petroglyphs, which date back at least 10,000 years, have been found on limestone boulders near Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada's high desert (pictured). The rock etchings have been confirmed to be the oldest recorded petroglyphs in North America, scientists said . The etchings are similar in design to some . found at a lake in Oregon that are believed to be at least 7,600 years . old. Later drawings sometimes depict a spear or antelope instead of abstract patterns. The oldest petroglyphs were found on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe's reservation land. Eugene Hattori, the curator of . anthropology at the Nevada State Museum in Carson City who co-authored a . paper on the findings, said: 'We initially thought people 12,000 or 10,000 years ago were primitive, but their artistic expressions and technological expertise associated with these paints a much different picture.' His research is published in the Journal of . Archaeological Science. Geochemist Larry Benson, who used radiocarbon testing to date the etchings, believes the petroglyphs could be as much as 14,800 years old. The oldest petroglyphs (pictured) were found on the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe's reservation land. Later drawings sometimes depict a spear or antelope instead of abstract patterns . Radiocarbon testing dated the carbonate layer underlying the petroglyphs to roughly 14,800 years ago. Geochemical data, sediment and rock samples from adjacent Pyramid Lake show they were exposed to air from 13,200 to 14,800 years ago and again from 10,500 to 11,300 years ago. 'Whether they turn out to be as old as 14,800 years ago or as recent as 10,500 years ago, they are still the oldest petroglyphs that have been dated in North America,' said Benson, a national research scientist emeritus for the U.S. Geological Survey and curator of anthropology at the University of Colorado Natural History Museum in Boulder. Dennis Jenkins, an archaeologist with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, called it a significant discovery. He led recent excavations of obsidian spear points near Paisley, Oregon, that he dated back 13,200 years, and noted that the bigger challenge is identifying who created the petroglyphs. Nobody knows who created the etchings but some believe they show meteorological patterns, while others simply say they are amazing patterns created by Native Americans thousands of years ago. A Native American dressed in traditional regalia  is pictured . 'When you get back into this time period, if you speak with Native Americans they will tell you they were made (created) there and that is obviously their people and their artwork,' Jenkins said. 'But approaching it from a scientific point of view - what we can prove - at this point, it is impossible to connect these to any tribal group.' William Cannon, a longtime archaeologist for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management who discovered the petroglyphs at Long Lake in Oregon, brought the Nevada site to Hattori's attention years ago. He said they bore similarities to petroglyphs at nearby Winnemucca Lake and Hattori began connecting the dots. The etchings in Nevada and Oregon have relatively deep, carved lines dominated by linear, curved and circular geometrical designs. Researchers have suggested the etchings represent various meteorological symbols, such as clouds and lightning and even perhaps the Milky Way. 'But we really have nothing to go on for these particular petroglyphs that go back 10,000 or more years,' Hattori said.","U.S. scientists found the petroglyphs on limestone boulders near Pyramid Lake in northern Nevada's high desert .

"For those hoping that a decent rugby game had arrived, think again. For Sidhe’s Rugby Challenge 2 takes all fans’ wishes and boots them firmly into touch. A lot of this is down to fundamental flaws in its gameplay. Looking past the shoddy animation and terrible character models, the AI just can’t understand formation. Not fun: Although these screens look promising, in action, the game doesn't capture the sport very well . This effectively takes away any sort of structured attack – resulting in most matches looking like a blend of hot potato and playground favourite ‘IT’. Passing is clunky and unresponsive – a quick tap firing the ball the length of the pitch one minute or an ineffective pop pass the next. At the breakdown, it’s nearly impossible to use your backs given how fast (and offside) the other team close you down and the ref will almost always get in the way. Defence is not much better. Simply putting the controller down is almost as effective as playing. The AI will tackle anything that moves, while the clunky battle at the breakdown doesn’t really take into account team momentum. When playing against the computer, rarely does the opposition’s scrum-half manage to pass it wide, opting mostly to charge in himself. Then there are the set pieces – which are some of the most boring yet in the genre. Scrums involve pushing two thumbsticks the direction you want your team to push. And kicking and line-outs are a case of timed presses when at the correct point on a metre. Not only that, but there are a complete lack of set-plays, so any tactics go out of the window. You’re also constrained to using a behind-the-action camera view. Although it gives you the choice of a sideline and closer-to-the-action camera, both are nigh on unplayable. The best thing about this game are the graphics, but even these fall well short. Given the attempted TV-style presentation during matches, it’s hard to avoid the shoddy, gormless character models that plague each cutscene. Boring: Scrums and other set pieces are cumbersome and the lack of set plays does nothing to help matters . Equally poor is the game’s commentary. With the likes of Grant Nisbett and All Black legend Justin Marshall at the helm, it’s a shame that it just doesn’t work. Both are equally annoying, and chime in with observations that rarely have anything to do with what’s going on. ‘I agree’ is as far as interaction between the two go and the historical facts Nisbett treats you to before each match are equally as stilted. All of the above obliterate any sort of redeeming qualities the game features – be that a large selection of licensed teams, varied game modes (including the Lions tour) and character customisation. The long wait for a decent rugby game continues. Rugby Challenge 2 The Lions Tour Edition is out now.

"Mutliplayer gaming is entering the next generation. And perhaps no title shows just how far online warfare has evolved better than Titanfall. This first-person shooter is a timed exclusive for Xbox One from Respawn Entertainment and EA where players take sides choosing either the Militia or IMC in a story-driven multiplayer experience. At Gamescom, Daily Mail Games went hands-on in a 6 vs 6 match-up where as the Militia force, the team is sent to extract a pilot who is key to the resistance but are intercepted by the IMC (Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation) and a battle ensues. Awesome: The battles are incredibly fun to play - especially when wielding some of the mechs ' weaponry . At the beginning players are able to select the load-out of their character and their Titan ranging from anti-Titan to short-range weaponry. The pace and gameplay Titanfall has to offer look superb. Titan’s are on a timer and can be called in to stand and defend on their own or be entered and controlled by you, the player. Titan’s are hugely powerful but also a big target for enemies, one of the more enjoyable tactics is flanking a Titan and jumping onto their backs to quickly deplete their health from close range. The maps can be traversed without having to touch the ground. Players are able to jump, double jump, run along walls and easily travel along rooftops. This allows for another dimension of gameplay with many players seeking the best vantage point on the map. Characters with have their own traits and progression with a lot of in-game context and storyline. One great addition is the new ending provided to the multiplayer game. In the game mode previewed, Attrition, instead of a score limit being reached and people and kicked back to a lobby, Titanfall introduces the Epilogue; the losing team must make their way to the dropship for extraction within a given time limit whilst the winning team has to hunt down the escaping losers before they make it. No boundaries: There is bucket-loads of character progression as well as an engrossing storyline . A simple but ingenious addition gives a great turn on how to end a multiplayer FPS experience.

It's remote distance means that scientists are observing it at a time when the universe was in its infancy. Pictured is an artist's rendition of the newly discovered most distant galaxy named z8-GND-5296, whose light began its journey to Earth just 700 million years after the birth of the universe . The galaxy is thought to be 30 billion light years from Earth but we can only see it as it was 13.1 billion years ago because of the way the universe is expanding. A new spectroscope - an optical device for producing and observing a spectrum of light or radiation - on the Keck 1 space telescope in Hawaii confirmed its distance by measuring its ‘redshift’ or wavelength. Although some more distant candidate galaxies have been detected their existence has not yet been fully established in this decisive way. The galaxy has a redshift of 7.51 meaning it was born only 700 million years after the Big Bang. Few galaxies with redshifts greater than seven have had their distances confirmed spectroscopically. A new spectroscope - an optical device for producing and observing a spectrum of light or radiation - on the Keck 1 space telescope (pictured) in Hawaii confirmed its distance . Its red, ultraviolet light colour implies it’s rich in metal and churns out stars over a hundred times quicker than the Milky Way. Professor Bahram Mobasher, of California University in Riverside, said: ‘What makes this galaxy unique - compared to other such discoveries - is the spectroscopic confirmation of its distance.’ Light travels at about 186,000 miles per second so when we look at distant objects we see them as they appeared in the past. The more distant we push these observations the farther into the past we can see. Professor Mobasher said: ‘By observing a galaxy that far back in time we can study the earliest formation of galaxies. ‘By comparing properties of galaxies at different distances we can explore the evolution of galaxies throughout the age of the universe.’ The detection of ever more remote galaxies are on the horizon with the construction of the powerful Thirty Metre Telescope in Hawaii and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile (pictured) along with the 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope . The researchers’ observations, described in Nature, show the galaxy named z8-GND-5296 is forming about 330 stars each year. By comparison the Milky Way forms only two to three stars per year. The new distance record-holder lies in the same part of the sky as the previous record-holder at a redshift of 7 - which also happens to have a very high rate of star-formation. Project leader Dr Steven Finkelstein, of Texas University in Austin, said: ‘There are way more regions of very high star formation than we previously thought. ‘There must be a decent number of them if we happen to find two in the same area of the sky.’ Professor Mobasher said the detection of ever more remote galaxies are on the horizon with the construction of the powerful Thirty Metre Telescope in Hawaii and the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile along with the 6.5 metre James Webb Space Telescope in space. He said: ‘By the end of this decade we should expect to find many more such galaxies at even larger distances allowing us to witness the process of galaxy formation as it happens.’","This compares to two or three stars that the Milky Way produces annually .

"It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words. And an exhibition designed to show the beauty of data demonstrates that some of the most important scientific theories, from evolution to genetics can be summed up in diagrams and charts. From an early representation of an ordered universe in Robert Fludd’s Renaissance work ‘Great Chain of Being’ to a rainbow of circles showing the generic similarities between humans and animals, the ‘Beautiful Science’ exhibition at The British Library explores the work of scientists and statisticians through the ages. As striking as a Vincent Van Gogh painting, this beautiful NASA map visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world during the period from 2005 to 2007. Today's scientists have access to data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully . It is organised into three themes – public health, weather and evolution. In the 19th Century scientists were obsessed with finding out about the spread of disease and infection. Florence Nightingale’s seminal diagram demonstrated that far more soldiers perished due to preventable epidemic than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield during the Crimean War. The famous nurse was also a keen statistician who understood the power of conveying her ideas about preventing the spread of disease visually and her work resulted in a drop in deaths from preventable diseases in 1858. William Farr, a friend of Florence Nightingale, also has an intriguing diagram made up of circles on show at the exhibition, showing the cholera deaths between 1840 and 1850. This map by Eberhard Werner Happel in 1675 represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner's and explorers' observations . He plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from the disease as he (wrongly) believed that cholera was spread by miasma or ‘bad air’ but said the circles and use of colours make ‘the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye,’ and later set up the first national system for collecting vital statistics. A collection of maps and charts prove that people have always been fascinated by the weather. An unusual map by Eberhard Werner Happel in 1675, represents early attempts to produce semi-scientific illustrations of the ebb and flow of the ocean currents as understood at the time from mariner and explorers’ observations. A later map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the British Isles and was created by the captain of Charles Darwin’s HMS Beagle. Florence Nightingale's diagram of the causes of mortality in the Army from 1858. In this diagram, she demonstrates that far more soldiers perished due to preventable 'zymotic' (epidemic) diseases (shown in blue) than died from wounds inflicted on the battlefield (red) or other causes (black) during the Crimean War . Robert FitzRoy, who is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service, was concerned about the weather as he had survived many storms as a mariner and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms. Modern maps showing weather patterns sit alongside early interpretations in the exhibition and one animation by Nasa visualises the flow of ocean surface currents around the world between 2005 and 2007 – and bears some resemblance to a Vincent Van Gogh painting. Today’s scientists have access to mass amounts of data collected by satellites and monitoring stations and the supercomputing power to analyse and render it usefully. Displaying this flow data visually allows scientists and the public to better understand how ocean circulation impacts weather around the globe. Here are two of the Circos Visualisations of Genomic Data, which use colourful to circles to compare the human genome with that of certain animals, such as monkeys and dogs, pictured left and right . This famous diagram - the only illustration in On the Origin of Species -  depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors. The letters across the bottom of the diagram represent potential species, which gradually evolve into new species, some of which survive and others which go extinct . Another modern creation is a chart by showing social media weather sentiment and visualises daily temperature, precipitation, wind, and sunshine levels in a rainbow of colour. A large section of the exhibition is dedicated to the theory of evolution, which has itself evolved over the years. A beautiful representation of ‘The Great Chain of Being’ created by Renaissance alchemist Robert Fludd in 1617 shows the Aristotelian concept that classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe. In this diagram William Farr plotted cycles of temperature and deaths from Cholera as he (wrongly) believed that the disease was spread by miasma or 'bad air' but said the circles and use of colours make 'the diagram represent the facts in a striking manner to the eye' A great ladder links God and other divine beings to astronomical bodies, man, animals, plants and minerals. Each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection (upwards towards man), providing a hierarchical organisation of life that laid the groundwork for the development of taxonomies and ultimately evolutionary trees. Charles Darwin’s famous diagram – the only one from his book On the Origin of the Species – is also no show and depicts the diversification of life from one or more common ancestors. A map from 1863 shows the tropical and polar air currents over the British Isles and was created by the captain of Charles Darwin's HMS Beagle. Robert FitzRoy is thought of as the grandfather of the modern weather service and became the first weather forecaster to use wind and temperature data to predict storms . This weather chart visualises daily temperature, precipitation, wind, and sunshine levels over the course of a year using social network data. It also compares 714,843 sentiment-analysed online messages captured about the weather throughout 2011. The size of the grey bubbles indicates the amount of messages remarking about the weather . Ernst Haeckel, who was inspired by Darwin, used evolutionary ideas to create elaborate tree diagrams organising all life on Earth and the genealogical history of man. The trunk of the tree in his diagram ‘On the Origin of Man’ represents the ancestral history of man, as his ancestors moved through various stages, such as primitive worms, amphibians and apes. This tree reflects Haeckel’s belief that evolution was a process of perfecting and that man represented the pinnacle of evolution. Modern charts show scientists’ continuing interest to unravel the mysteries of life and evolution. Brightly coloured Circos diagrams compare the human genome with four other animals, while a molecular ‘tree of life’ that is also circular in shape, shows the changing global diversity of birds over space and time. Robert Fludd's Great Chain of Being (1617) classifies life on earth into a hierarchical order with respect to the rest of the universe. A great ladder links God and other divine beings to astronomical bodies, man, animals, plants and minerals. Each animal is fixed on a rung in order of perfection (upwards towards man). From the goddess Sophie, the chain extends down to animals, plants and minerals . The exhibition, which is on display at The Folio Society Gallery at the British Library, until 26 May, shows the challenge of presenting big data in interesting ways is nothing new and shows how scientific and technological breakthroughs have allowed us to visually interpret masses of information. Dr Johanna Kieniewicz, lead curator of Beautiful Science, said: ‘The British Library is home to the nation’s science collection and we’re thrilled to be opening up our fantastic collections in the Library’s first science exhibition. ‘As big data is becoming a topic of such huge interest, we particularly wanted to show the important connections between the past and the present. Data that is centuries old from collections like ours is now being used to inform cutting edge science.’ This is the Avian Tree of Life, which was published in Nature. The Molecular tree shows the changing global diversity of birds over space and time. It shows that since millions years ago, birds have undergone considerable diversification . Ernst Haeckel, who was inspired by Darwin, used evolutionary ideas to create elaborate tree diagrams organising all life on Earth and the genealogical history of man.

"Primitive organisms may have existed on Mars during a period when life was forming on Earth. This is according to a recent study by Opportunity rover which suggests Mars may have been capable of supporting microbial life for hundreds of millions of years. Opportunity, which celebrates 10 years of Mars exploration today, has uncovered evidence that benign, neutral-pH water flowed on Mars around four billion years ago. Scroll down for video... This composite image shows a self-portrait that was taken by the rover Opportunity weeks before its tenth landing anniversary on Mars. The rover's panoramic camera (Pancam) took the images . Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. Instead the rover has lived beyond its prime mission and roved the planet for nearly 10 years. The rover is currently at 'Solander Point' at the rim of Endeavour Crater on Mars. The rover hasn't moved in over a month as it waits for better weather on the red planet. During its time on Mars, the rover has identified rock laden with what scientists believed to be clay minerals. Their presence is an indication that the rock has been altered at some point in the past through prolonged contact with water. The evidence comes from samples from the rim of a 3.7 billion year old crater, named Endeavour, and is believed to be the earliest evidence of water activity yet discovered. Opportunity investigated the rocks at a spot dubbed Matejivic Hill. The samples revealed a type of clay that commonly forms on Earth when water flows through fractures in the rock. The finding adds to the more-recent Curiosity mission, which found evidence of ancient habitability 3.5 billion years ago. ‘These [benign] water conditions existed over a long period of time,’ Ray Arvidson, lead author of the new study and Opportunity deputy principal investigator told Space.com. Scientists believe that that life first started on Earth nearly four billion years ago. Professor Arvidson suggests life may have been able to survive on Mars for longer stretches that previously believed, at a time when life was getting a foothold on our own planet. ‘Maybe not globally,’ he told he told SPACE.com. ‘[Habitable environments] could have occurred here and there regionally. And it may not have been for the whole time continuously. We don't know.’ Opportunity touched on Mars ten years ago today, three weeks after its twin, Spirit. Both robots were tasked with 90-day missions to seek out signs of past water activity on Mars. Spirit was declared dead in 2011, but Opportunity is still operational. Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004 in what was to be a three-month mission. 10 years later, and it is still active on the red planet .","Evidence is from the rim of a 3.7 billion year old crater named Endeavour .

"It is the biggest photo ever created of the moon - and lets budding astronomers explore the lunar north pole like ever before. Nasa today revealed the stunning six-and-a-half feet (two-meters)-per-pixel image, which covers an area equal to more than one-quarter of the United States. Constructed from 10,581 pictures, the mosaic provides enough detail to see textures and subtle shading of the lunar terrain. Use your mouse below to begin exploring the Lunar surface . LRO entered lunar orbit in June 2009 equipped with seven instrument suites to map the surface, probe the radiation environment, investigate water and key mineral resources, and gather geological clues about the moon's evolution. Researchers used additional information about the moon's topography from LRO's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter, as well as gravity information from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, to assemble the mosaic. Launched in September 2011, the GRAIL mission, employing twin spacecraft named Ebb and Flow, generated a gravity field map of the moon -- the highest resolution gravity field map of any celestial body. Nasa used cameras aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), to create the high resolution mosaic of our moon’s north polar region. Web viewers can zoom in and out, and pan around an area. Constructed from 10,581 pictures, the mosaic provides enough detail to see textures and subtle shading of the lunar terrain. 'This unique image is a tremendous resource for scientists and the public alike,' said John Keller, LRO project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. 'It's the latest example of the exciting insights and data products LRO has been providing for nearly five years.' The lunar north pole in a completely zoomed out version of the image . The images making up the mosaic were taken by the two LRO Narrow Angle Cameras, which are part of the instrument suite known as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC). The cameras can record a tremendous dynamic range of lit and shadowed areas. 'Creation of this giant mosaic took four years and a huge team effort across the LRO project,' said Mark Robinson, principal investigator for the LROC at Arizona State University in Tempe. 'We now have a nearly uniform map to unravel key science questions and find the best landing spots for future exploration.' The entire image measures 931,070 pixels square – nearly 867 billion pixels total. A complete printout at 300 dots per inch – considered crisp resolution for printed publications – would require a square sheet of paper wider than a professional U.S. football field and almost as long. The image would cover a quarter of the US . If the complete mosaic were processed as a single file, it would require approximately 3.3 terabytes of storage space. Instead, the processed mosaic was divided into millions of small, compressed files, making it manageable for users to view and navigate around the image using a web browser.","Nasa image constructed from 10,581 photographs taken by an orbiting spacecraft .

"Apple could be deliberately making your iPhone slower when a new model comes out, an influential tech columnist has claimed. Catherine Rampell, who writes in the New York Times, said that Apple could be engineering the new operating system so it only works properly with the newest version of the product. She added her iPhone 4 became a lot slower when she downloaded iOS 7 - and that the only solution seemed to be to buy the iPhone 5. Catherine Rampell, who writes in the New York Times, said Apple could be engineering its operating systems so that it only works properly with the newest version of the product, such as the iPhone 5S pictured . Rampell accused Apple of having run out of ideas so was trying to ‘brainwash’ its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C because they look nice. Rampell’s claims are likely fuel conspiracy theorists who have long held that Apple engages in ‘planned obsolescence’, a term which has been around since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The theory states that manufacturers of everything from cars to microwaves build in a certain lifetime to a product and then it will simply stop working, forcing consumers to buy a new one. In the piece, called ‘Cracking the Apple trap’, Rampell writes that her interest was piqued when she upgraded to iOS 7. The piece generated such a debate it was featured on a number of tech blogs and she was invited on major US TV network CNN to discuss it. Rampell writes: ‘At first, I thought it was my imagination. Around the time the iPhone 5S and 5C were released, in September, I noticed that my sad old iPhone 4 was becoming a lot more sluggish. ‘The battery was starting to run down much faster, too. But the same thing seemed to be happening to a lot of people who, like me, swear by their Apple products. Rampell accused Apple of trying to 'brainwash' its customers into buying the new iPhone 5S and 5C, pictured, because they look nice . ‘When I called tech analysts, they said that the new operating system (iOS 7) being pushed out to existing users was making older models unbearably slow. ‘Apple phone batteries, which have a finite number of charges in them to begin with, were drained by the new software. ‘So I could pay Apple $79 to replace the battery, or perhaps spend 20 bucks more for an iPhone 5C. It seemed like Apple was sending me a not-so-subtle message to upgrade.’ Apple has faced allegations that it is guilty of planned obsolescence before. When it started using more tamper-resistant screws experts said it was to stop users getting into the phone and fixing it themselves if there was a problem. Last year Apple was sued in Brazil by the Brazilian Institute of Politics and Law Software over the launch of the iPad Air. The organisation claimed that because it had the new retina screen it made the iPad 3 redundant and that Apple was changing its devices too quickly. In her column Rampell said: ‘When major innovations remain out of reach, and degrading durability threatens to tick off loyal customers, companies like Apple can still take a cue from the fashion industry. ‘If you can brainwash consumers into developing new tastes that make the old stuff look uncool for aesthetic rather than functional reasons, you still have a shot at harvesting more sales from your existing customer base. ‘But it seems Apple may have already figured this out too. Just check out the wait times for the iPhone 5S in that shiny new gold colour’. MailOnline has approached Apple for comment. Commenting on the news, Brian Barrett from Gizmodo dismissed Rampell's claims: 'The iPhone 4, was released to the general public in 2010. [Since then] that phone has been through countless firmware updates, taken untold photos, been charged improperly, been dropped. It has, in short, been used. 'I don't doubt that Rampell is coming from a place of genuine frustration. But it's misinformed, and worse, misleading. Technology becomes obsolete. Batteries don't last forever. That's not exclusively Apple's problem, nor is it exclusively Apple's fault.' Apple's iOS 7 was the fastest software upgrade in history, according to official figures, with 200 million devices running the operating system within five days, only 9 million of these were new iPhones.","Catherine Rampell, a New .

"Sometimes it’s easy to forget just how much of a presence humanity has in the solar system today. Aside from the multitude of satellites in orbit around our own planet there are dozens of active and defunct spacecraft currently located all over the place. And in this fantastic graphic created by Outer Places they’ve shown where almost all the active spacecraft in the solar system are, what they’re doing and what their status is. Scroll down for the full graphic . Outer Places has created a graphic that showcases the various active spacecraft currently in the solar system. This ranges from Nasa's Messenger spacecraft, the first ever to orbit Mercury, out to Voyager 1, which is now the first and only manmade object ever to reach interstellar space . The journey begins at Mercury where Nasa’s Messenger, currently the closest spacecraft to the sun, is in orbit. The Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (Messenger) probe arrived in August 2011 and is the first ever to orbit Mercury. Since its arrival it has been returning unprecedented images and data about the solar system’s innermost planet. Japan's Akatsuki spacecraft, meanwhile, failed in an attempt to orbit Venus in 2010 - but it might be able to try again in 2015. Moving further out to the second planet from the sun, Venus, we find Esa’s Venus Express. This spacecraft entered orbit on 11 April 2006 and has since been performing extensive studies of the Venusian atmosphere. A few days ago Esa announced it would attempt a daring plunge into the planet’s hostile atmosphere in June in a last-gasp attempt at further science as the spacecraft runs out of fuel – and it’s likely Venus Express will not survive the ordeal. The busiest planet by some distance is Mars, which has been the subject of dozens of missions from various countries all over the world, starting with the Soviet Union back in the 1960s. Today there are three spacecraft in orbit, with two more joining later this year, and two active rovers on the surface: Opportunity and Curiosity . Next on the scale we have five spacecraft that are currently observing the sun: Stereo A and B, Ace, Soho and Wind. Together, these spacecraft provide us not only with an opportunity to study the sun, but also with an early warning system that helps protect satellites when a solar flare erupts. At Earth the graphic doesn’t detail the hundreds of satellites in our around our planet – there are simply too many – but instead focuses on ISEE-3. This is a defunct Nasa satellite that will be making its way past Earth next week – and amateur rocketeers are gearing up to try and take control of the spacecraft as it swings by in June. At the moon, meanwhile, there are three orbiters: the twin Artemis P1 and P2 probes, which are measuring the effect of solar wind on the surface, and also the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which amongst various tasks is studying future landing sites for manned missions. Not shown is China’s Chang’e 3 lander, which landed on the surface in December 2013 and deployed a rover named Yutu that unfortunately experienced a malfunction and is currently lying dormant on the surface. Mars is the busiest of the lot as various countries around the world clamour to understand more about the barren red planet that may hold clues about out future – or even our beginnings as we search for life on its surface. In orbit are Nasa’s hugely surrcessful Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, in tandem with Esa’s equally impressive Mars Express mission. All have provided us with stunning imagery of the surface of Mars, and some have even caught glimpses of rovers we have sent to the surface such as Curiosity. September of this year will see two new arrivals – India’s first mission to the red planet, Mangalayan, which is notable for being ‘built on a shoestring budget.’ The other is Nasa’s Maven mission, an advanced vehicle that will study the Martian atmosphere in great detail. Moving out still, in the asteroid belt we find the Dawn spacecraft, which will become the first probe to visit the potentially water-harbouring dwarf planet Ceres in February 2015. Arguably the most successful spacecraft humanity has ever sent into the unknown is Cassini. It arrived at the Saturnian system in 2004 and has since provided us with unprecedented data and images about this fascinating place. In 2017, however, the Cassini mission will end with the spacecraft being sent to its destruction in Saturn, with no additional mission to Saturn yet in the works . Towards Jupiter, meanwhile, Esa’s Rosetta spacecraft is just weeks away from rendezvousing with comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and will enter orbit later this year – the first spacecraft ever to do so. Jupiter is currently devoid of any human presence but will be greeted by Nasa’s solar-powered Juno in July 2016, the furthest a spacecraft will ever have operated on solar power alone. Around Saturn is found one of the most successful spacecraft to date - Cassini - which has furthered our understanding of Saturn arguably more so than any probe around any planet. Cassini has studied Saturn’s fascinating moons, including sending the probe Huygens to the surface of Titan in 2005, and has revealed many secrets of the Saturnian system. The next spacecraft of note is New Horizons - on 14 July 2015 it will become the first manmade object ever to visit the icy world Pluto. And, finally, the last two active spacecraft are Nasa’s Voyager 1 and 2 probes - both of these are on their way out of the solar system, although only the former is so far technically in interstellar space.","Website Outer Places have created a graphic showing the location of all active probes in the solar system .

"The cults of Apple, Google and Facebook continue to be formidable forces in today’s society. These technology giants have employee populations larger than some small towns, and fans that are willing to pay any price to have their latest release. Now one Berkeley-based designer has unveiled his vision of what towns designed by these Silicon Valley groups might look like. For Facebook, Mr Twu, has designed campus housing 9,400 staff in Menlo Park, California. It includes a number of high-rise blocks, a sky bridge over a motorway and its own train station . Alfred Twu’s vision focuses on Google, Apple, Facebook, and Electronic Arts, but he's also created with a generic space to serve as a model for smaller start-ups. ‘The booming tech industry has created huge demand for housing in the San Francisco Bay Area, driving up housing costs and leading to long commutes,’ said Mr Twu. ‘Meanwhile, tech workers flock to San Francisco and Oakland, seeking the high-density urban environment that Silicon Valley lacks. This is Alfred Twu's vision of a iTown which is dedicated to Apple workers. The main office building is circular and features an iMaill, iSlabs and iTowers. It also has its very own underground road network . The Google headquarters housing is shown in this aerial view from the east. Mr Twu created the design after wondering what would happen if 10,000 Google employees working at the main Mountain view campus were provided with on-site housing . ‘What might it look like if tech campuses replaced their parking lots and provided all the necessary housing on-site?’ For Facebook, Mr Twu, has designed campus housing 9,400 staff in Menlo Park, California. It includes a number of high-rise blocks, a sky bridge over a motorway and its own train station. This is Alfred Twu's vision of a iTown which is dedicated to Apple workers. The main office building is circular and features an iMall, iSlabs  - large slab-like buildings - and iTowers. It also has its very own underground road network . Mr Twu’s notes that technology workers' impact on housing prices is a divisive topic in the Bay Area. The issue stems from a shortage of housing in Silicon Valley, which was originally research labs and electronics factories. Now, software is dominant, and a lot more programmers can fit in the same space.  ‘In fact,’ he says, ‘many don't need a desk at all.’ Electronics Arts headquarters features a total building area of three million square feet housing five huge blocks for employees . Google, for instance employs 10,000 at its Mountain View headquarters.  Surprisingly, that number of apartments can fit on the parking lots and open spaces of the suburban campus. ‘Most would be in towers of 30 to 50 floors, with the rest in lower blocks lining the site,’ said Mr Twu. Such a concentration of people would also create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only San Francisco offers, he added. ‘This study assumes regular apartments, with an average of 800 sq ft per family of 2,’ he said. ‘It also assumes very limited parking.  Co-op style housing typically can get down to 200 square feet per resident, roughly double the efficiency of apartments.  That would still be a lot of housing in one spot though.’ This is part of an on-going trend.  Sao Paulo's Vila Olimpia neighbourhood, for example, is planning a huge building full of micro-apartments rise in 2016, to serve employees of Google, Intel, Microsoft, and Unilever. This is what the iPlaza could look like from the northwest campus entrance in Apple's iTown. Such a concentration of people would create the critical mass to attract the trendy services and amenities that currently only San Francisco offers, said Mr Twu. The view from Highway 280. This is a long north-south Interstate Highway in the San Francisco Bay Area of Northern California . Google employs 10,000 at its Mountain View headquarters.  Surprisingly, that number of apartments can fit on the parking lots and open spaces of the suburban campus as shown here . According to a report in Co.Exist , Bruce Katz, head of the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program, has suggested that instead of housing tech campuses in suburban areas, the will see the tech economy give rise to innovation districts. Mr Twu doesn’t necessarily believe that San Francisco should be the location for these mega-tech cities. ‘I was thinking about what exactly are the things in San Francisco that attract people who have jobs 50 miles away and go back and forth every day,’ Mr Twu told Sydney Brownstone at Co.Exist. ‘And part of it's just being around other people, being around different stores and restaurants.’ But many believe having a town dedicated to technology workers could create its own problems. Not least, the choice of entertainment options on a Friday night. This is a view from the roof of an office building in iTown.

"Online shopping has revolutionised how we buy groceries, but it still requires a fair amount of time sat ordering items from a laptop or mobile device. To make spending our money easier, Amazon has launched a magic wand-style device called Dash that acts as a handheld, personal shopping assistant. It scans barcodes of items that are running low in cupboards or fridges, for example, or customers use voice commands to add goods to an online shopping list. Dash (pictured) is a free, black and white wand-like device available to customers of Amazon Fresh in select U.S states. It scans barcodes of items that are running low in cupboards or fridges, or users can use voice commands to order goods. Each scanned or spoken item is then added to their basket on Amazon Fresh .

Amazon Dash is a free device but only works with Amazon Fresh, which is only available in Southern California, San Francisco and certain neighbourhoods in Seattle. Although Amazon hasn’t revealed when its Fresh service will be rolled out globally, Amazon's UK vice president Doug Gurr said in February: ‘We don’t publish forward strategy plans but history would suggest that once we roll out something across North America, typically that leads to international expansion.’ In addition to groceries, Amazon Fresh sells a total of 500,000 items including electronics, household tools, software, games and entertainment. The Amazon Dash tool complements Amazon's  Flow app that launched in February. Flow uses augmented reality to help people discover information about items around them. Dash, pictured, connects to a smartphone or laptop via Wi-Fi. It has a built-in barcode scanner and microphone. Once an item is added to the basket, users checkout using the Amazon Fresh site on a laptop or via an app. Amazon Dash is a free device but is only currently  available in Southern California, San Francisco and Seattle . For example, when a user holds the phone’s camera over an object - such as a book, game or box of cereal - the app will identify what it is, and reveal more information about the product. This includes the author, release date, calories of food items, and more. It also lets users scan and dial phone numbers of launch websites from magazines, adverts or posters. Other items will start playing audio clips or video clips when the app scans it. Amazon Flow works in a similar way to Google’s Googles. Once an item has been identified, it can be shared on social networks or that item can be bought directly from Amazon.

"It might not be the most prestigious of world records, but a teen has officially become the world’s fastest texter. Sixteen-year-old Brazilian Marcel Fernandes Filho managed to type a 25-word paragraph in 18.19 seconds - equivalent to 82.5 words per minute - using an app called Fleksy. This pipped the previous record by 0.25 seconds, earning Fernandes his place in the history e-books. Scroll down for videos . Marcel Fernandes, a 16-year old physics student from Brazil, has beaten the world's fastest texting record, typing the 25-word paragraph in only 18.19 seconds. This beat the previous record by 0.25 seconds and was set using a keyboard app called Fleksy . Fleksy is a mobile keyboard app designed by software company Syntellia. Through the use of simple swipe features and large ‘keys’, Fleksy claims to allow users to experience a keyboard more akin to one found on a desktop computer. The app follows in the wake of other popular typing apps such as Swype and Microsoft’s Word Flow. To claim the record, Fernandes had to type a specific paragraph without using autocorrect or predictive text features. The passage was: ‘The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world. In reality they seldom attack a human.’ The time set by Fernandes beat the previous record of 18.44 seconds set by Microsoft’s Gaurav Sharma in January. And his time was more than twice as fast as the initial time from when the record was first set in March 2010, a mere 35.54 seconds set by Franklin Page. Fleksy, available on iOS and Android, uses large letters and a simplified keyboard layout to enable people to type words quickly. They say their app mimics computer keyboards and even lets people type easily without having to look at their phone or tablet . Fernandes set the record on a Samsung Galaxy S4 and was flown out to New York City by Fleksy after winning an online competition. Although the record attempt was made back on 25 April, it was only recently confirmed by Guinness. Fernandes, a college student studying physics, told CNN how he honed his skill after losing patience with a computer monitor in 2009. ‘So one day I got so stressed out about it that I literally took a hammer and broke my desktop monitor,’ he says. ‘With no money to buy a new one, I resorted to using exclusively my iPhone 3GS, which I had at the time, to do everything I needed to do. ‘I basically lived, from that day on, using my smartphone.’ All record applications need to be submitted online at: http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/set-a-record/intro .

"Worker ants can process information far more efficiently than Google, a new study claims. The researchers found that while an individual ant that is hunting for food walks a random path, their collective foraging behaviour transforms from chaos into order. Together, they can process information efficiently to secure ample food to allow a colony to thrive. Chaotic? A new study claims that the while an individual ant hunting for food (pictured in this scanning electron micrograph) walks in a random way, their collective foraging behaviour changes this chaos to order and makes the more efficient than Google, experts claim . Woodland ants work together to fire smelly acid into the air to ward off predators. The group attack using formic acid to protect a nest is enough to scare off woodpeckers and jay birds. Fire ants bind together to build a life raft in order to survive floods. They use their claws and mandibles to grip each other and link together in a similar way to how waterproof fabric is woven. An individual ant’s exoskeleton is moderately hydrophobic so it can shrug off water, but the ants enhance their water repellence by linking their bodies together. Rock ants continually monitor the area near their nest in case they find a more suitable home, especially if there's is in a state of disrepair. Lead researcher Carolina Doran from Bristol University said: ‘This strategy of adjusting their information gathering according to their actual needs and the real value of higher rungs on the property ladder may help ants to evaluate their housing market in a measured and thorough way that puts many of us to shame.’ Nasa has send 800 common ants to live on the International Space Station to teach scientists how they move in low gravity. It is hoped that the eight colonies will give experts new ideas of how to build robots that interact with each other. Last week, a study from the Georgia Institute of Technology revealed that ants' skills at building stable underground tunnels in, loose sand could help engineers design the next generation of rescue robots. They used cameras to monitor the way fire ants use their antennae as extra limbs to stop themselves from falling. The mathematical study found that the creatures are capable of using problem-solving strategies and the move from chaos to order happens in a surprisingly efficient, self-organised way. Understanding the ants could help experts analyse similar phenomena such as how humans behave when using the internet or even lead to the development of smart transport systems. The Chinese-German research team expressed everything that is known about the foraging of ants in equations and algorithms and fed them into computers. They found that ants use intelligent navigational strategies to divide themselves into ‘scouting’ and ‘gathering’ groups when searching for food. While individual wandering ants might seem chaotic, they are actually leaving a trail of pheromones to allow the ‘gathering’ ants to shorten their journeys to food sources. As . ants carrying food repeat the route, a ‘self-reinforcing effect of . efficiency’ comes into play, saving the colony time and energy, . according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National . Academy of Sciences. Professor Jurgen Kurths of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research told The Independent . that single ants quickly . become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor. He told the Independent: ‘That . transition between chaos and order is an important mechanism and I’d go . as far as to say that the learning strategy involved in that is more . accurate and complex than a Google search.’ Better than Google? Study co-author Professor Jurgen Kurths said: 'These insects are, without doubt, more efficient than Google in processing information about their surroundings' ‘These insects are, without doubt, more efficient than Google in processing information about their surroundings.' Previous studies have suggested that older ants lead dangerous scouting parties as they are the most expendable in a colony, but this new study suggests the opposite is true. The scientists revealed that the experience of individual ants contributes to the group’s foraging success, so older ants have a better knowledge of a nest's surroundings. The foraging of younger ants is a learning process rather than an effective contribution to scout food, according to the study. ‘While the single ant is certainly not smart, the collective acts in a way that I'm tempted to call intelligent,’ Professor Kurths said. ‘The ants collectively form a highly efficient complex network and this is something we find in many natural and social systems.’ Fast food: While single ants can appear chaotic (pictured), they quickly become part of an orderly line of ants crossing the woodland floor, thanks to pheromones laid down by 'scouting' ants to ensure that workers can carry food as efficiently as possible .","Individual ants hunt for food in a random way, but collectively the creatures process information effectively to turn chaos into order .

"Yet more pictures of Apple's iPhone 6 have been revealed, showing the handset side by side with the current iPhone. The leak came from former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases. They appear to confirm the handset will have a larger 4.7inch screen, and that Apple has moved the power button to allow the handset to be operated easily with one hand. Scroll down for video . Leaked shots of what appears to be the iPhone 6 is shown next to the current 5S. It has a 4.7-inch (11.9 centimetres) screen, according to reports, and is likely to be announced in September . The iPhone 6 (left) has the same fingerprint sensor as the 5S (right), but is noticeably larger . According to Lin, the iPhone 6 comes with a 4.7-inch display, more rounded than the previous models. He described the device as being 'very grippy' in the hand. The device also has a headphone socket - despite recent rumours Apple could abandon a dedicated socket and instead use the lightning connector currently used for charging. The leaks are the latest to hit Apple, all  showing an identical, slimline design. However, Apple has not commented on the pictures. Former Taiwanese pop star Jimmy Lin who also leaked the iPhone 5 and the iPad Mini ahead of their releases, shown with the iPhone 6 shell (right) New shots of the rumoured iPhone 6 have been revealed ahead of an expected launch in August or September this year. Other recent images, republished by nowhereelse.fr, are similar to ones leaked before and lend credibility to claims this is what the next device will look like. The latest photos show that the tentatively named iPhone 6 will be made from metal, and will also be much thinner than Apple's current range of devices. Rumours suggest Apple is working on two versions of different sizes, with one being 4.7 inches (11.9cm) diagonally, the same size as the HTC One. Latest images of Apple's supposed iPhone 6 were leaked last month (shown), showing a phone with an ultra-thin design and rounded images. The power button, typically found on the top of previous iPhones, appears to have been moved to the side, making the device easier to operate with one hand . A larger version is also expected to be released, measuring 5.5 inches (14cm) - slightly larger than Samsung's 5.1-inch Galaxy S5. In the images some changes to button placement can also be seen. The power button, usually found on the top of iPhones for example, appears to be located on the side of the device. The volume and lock buttons, however, will seemingly remain where they are. Look familiar? The rumoured back of Apple’s new iPhone 6 looks similar to that of the HTC One (pictured right) with a horizontal line at the top and bottom and curved edges. It also suggests Apple may have found a way to make its 'True Tone' flash technology smaller as the whole is different to an iPhone 5S . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up . until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest . phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18 . millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By . comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6 . millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches . (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 0.31 inches (7.9 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One is 0.37 inches (9.3 millimetres). It is believed the iPhone 6, which some think will go by the name of the iPhone Air, will sport a 1704 x 960 resolution display, and a powerful A8 processor. The iPhone 5s, by comparison, has a 1136 x 640 resolution, and the A7 chip. These hardware changes will be in addition to the features of Apple's latest iOS 8 software, unveiled last week, which include health monitors and smart notifications. This latest in a long line of leaks comes as Apple chief executive Tim Cook and senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, Eddy Cue, visited Apple’s new campus in Austin, Texas. During the tour, the pair told employees to prepare for the ‘exciting products’ the company has lined up for this year. This was previously teased in an email from Cook to employees in Christmas last year. These products could include Apple’s rumoured smartwatch and the iPhone Air. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . In May, Australian blog MacFixit said: 'We have just received from our contact in China a photo of what seems to be the back of an iPhone 6. 'We believe the picture to be genuine as we have received leaked product pics in the past that have also proven to be legitimate after official Apple product launches.' German phone firm Deutsche Telekom then began telling customers Apple's iPhone 6 will launch on 19 September. The operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators, it has been claimed by apfelpage.de. Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . According to Apple Insider, however, the date could be little more than an informed guess. 'The date is consistent with Apple's recent launches, making it likely an educated guess,' it said. Apple historically launches its new iPhone models on Fridays, and 19 September does fall on a Friday this year. Apple also began selling its latest smartphones during the same week last year, as the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c both became available on 20 September. In 2012 Apple made the iPhone 5 available on 21 September. Prior to that, the iPhone 4S launched a few weeks later, on 14 October 2011. Leaked images (pictured) and reports about Apple's next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year. If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen . French site nowhereelse.fr recently posted a video of a 'dummy' handset. It was made using an industrial model of the handset believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design. Taiwanese media then reported supply-chain sources similarly claiming a 4.7-inch screen version of the iPhone 6 will reach stores in August, with a 5.5-inch or 5.6-inch model released in September. However, the Economic Daily News did not say which markets would receive the phone first.","More images of the hotly anticipated iPhone 6 have been revealed .

Playlists are made by music experts, the service recommends various playlists based on time of day and mood or activity. Google said it would explore ways to incorporate aspects of Songza into its existing streaming music service over the coming months. For now the four-year-old Songza service, which creates 'expert-curated' music playlists intended to match users' activities and tastes, will remain unchanged for existing users. 'Today, we’re thrilled to announce that we’re becoming part of Google,' it said in a blog post. 'We can’t think of a better company to join in our quest to provide the perfect soundtrack for everything you do. 'No immediate changes to Songza are planned, other than making it faster, smarter, and even more fun to use.' Google did not provide financial terms of the deal, though a report in the New York Post earlier this month citing unnamed sources said Google had offered to buy the company for $15 million. The search giant said: 'Over the coming months, we’ll explore ways to bring what you love about Songza to Google Play Music. 'We'll also look for opportunities to bring their great work to the music experience on YouTube and other Google products.' The deal comes one month after Apple Inc acquired Beats for $3 billion.

The deal comes one month after Apple Inc acquired Beats for $3 billion. Apple's purchase of Beats, which also touted its expertise curating music playlists, was viewed as an effort to jump-start Apple's position in the fastest-growing segment of the music market. Sales of digital music downloads have declined in recent months, while streaming services such as Pandora Media Inc and Spotify have become increasingly popular with consumers. Google launched a $9.99-per-month Play All Access subscription music service in 2013, and the company said last month its YouTube video website was preparing to launch a paid streaming service. Google would not say how many employees Songza had but it said the company would continue to work from its base in New York. Google plans to use Songza's technology in its own music-streaming service, as well as its YouTube video site.","Songza creates 'expert curated' playlists .

Accurate locations, and the distances and bearings between them, were essential for the artillery - and all the maps show the British Trench Map Grid System as an overlay. This is a 'unique referencing system' often used in associated written records, said the National Library of Scotland which digitised the maps. 'Comparing trench maps to each other over time, and to the current maps allow a graphic insight into the changing topography of the Western Front,' explained the library website. ‘Maps have always been vital tools for military commanders, allowing them to form a picture of the terrain for planning attack and defence, but their value rose to greater prominence than ever during the First World War.’ It is estimated more than over 34 million British maps of the Western Front were printed between 1914 and 18, the vast majority by Ordnance Survey.

A selection of the maps highlight artillery gun emplacements, machine guns, mines, wire entanglements, and observation posts. Many show the names of nearby farms, villages, woods, and other landmarks, too. Pictured is Serre in France. It was one of the strongly fortified villages held by the Germans at the beginning of the Battle of the Somme. The village, about five miles north of Albert, marked the most northern point of the main attack on the 1 July 1916 . Other maps record the names that fighting soldiers gave the trenches (pictured). This image shows trenches around Pys and Warlencourt Eaucourt in Picardie. The trenches were recorded on 2 December 1916. Until early 1918, German trenches were usually overprinted in red, with British or Allied trenches, where shown, in blue. After this point, the colours were reversed to match the French map system . Accurately plotting positions and the measurements between them became crucial for planning bombardment, and for firing on hidden targets based on their precise location. The earliest mapping in the National Library of Scotland's archive is from 1915 for Bas Maisnel (pictured) and Neuve Chapelle . Artillery was also vulnerable to long-range rifle and machine-gun fire, and maps allowed defensive positions to be set up. Due to the difficulties using existing maps of France and Belgium, the decision was taken to resurvey much of the area behind the British Front from late 1914 onwards. But, the survey work was dangerous, and aerial photography was used for enemy trench mapping, artillery maps, and other large-scale maps. British field survey and mapping on the Western Front was officially coordinated by Major E.M. Jack, in collaboration with W.C. Hedley at the War Office and Colonel Sir Charles Close at the Ordnance Survey. From October 1914, large-scale maps . were printed by the Ordnance Survey at Southampton, with the War Office . concentrating on smaller-scale maps, but aspects of production moved to France and Belgium during the War. Lithography . allowed maps to be drawn straight onto the printing stone, or onto . transfer paper from which it was laid down onto the stone, and sheets . could be printed rapidly by hand. Until . early 1918, German trenches were usually overprinted in red, with .

The earliest mapping is from 1915 for Bas Maisnel, and Neuve Chapelle. In . 1918, the speed of the German Spring Offensives and advances from . March to June resulted in the front lines moving more than 60 miles (96km) west, while the Allied retaliation from the summer onwards drove the . Germans rapidly back to the east, but trench maps were still compiled . and were of value until the end of the War. Although every country involved in the conflict had medium scale mapping for reconnaissance purposes, the emergence of trench warfare created the need for much more detailed maps. Early maps were based on enlarged versions of existing French and Belgian maps, such as war office map of Cambrai recorded in 1912 (pictured left).

The final design for the bike, which will race in September. Its Canadian inventors claim it can reach over 87mp/h - with just a single rider. The rider is reclined inside the vehicle, which has a complex series of gears to reach maximum speed . The shell is made of carbon fibre . Standard bike wheels and tyres are used. The rider will also rely on a video camera to see, as the cockpit is entirely enclosed. 'Our mission at AeroVelo is to inspire creativity in the public and challenge the norms of conventional design by doing more with less,' the team, led by Cameron Robertson & Todd Reichert, said. It has previously created human powered helicopters and planes. 'Each year we recruit a student-based team to tackle a high-profile, thought-provoking engineering project. 'This year we will break the human-powered speed record at 133.8 km/h (83.1mph) by building the world's most efficient bike, Eta.' The bike will, they claim reach speeds similar to a car. 'For perspective, our human-engine will produce at maximum 1 HP, 100 times less than the average car, but innovative engineering will allow our bike to achieve a car’s highway speeds. Bluenose, an early version of the design, at Battle Mountain, Nevada, where it reached speeds of 78MPH (125 Km/h). 'It all comes down to efficiency, which is actually the reason that the bike is called Eta. 'Eta is the Greek letter often used in engineering as the symbol for efficiency.' The team have spends months on the design, reducing or eliminating the forces that are resisting our forward motion. 'By streamlining the body (ie. making a smooth contour with no massively separating turbulent vortices) we can reduce the aerodynamic forces by about 20 times,' they say. 'Our team is deep into detailed design and prototyping, and will have the vehicle ready for the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge (WHPSC) in Battle Mountain, Nevada this September,' they say. 'Beyond challenging the world record, we calculate that our incremental improvements in aerodynamics, mechanical efficiency, and rolling resistance will make it possible to achieve speeds in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph).' The firm is using off the shelf components where possible. 'Wherever possible we've prioritized mature technologies and used novel design and better optimization/analysis to achieve the desired performance gains. 'We have budgeted an extensive portion of our timeline for testing - to shake down the design, work out the bugs, and be ready to break the world record.' Backers can go to Kickstarter to help fund the project, which is aiming to raise $30,000.

"It really will be Titanic occasion – in terms of scale and location and not that sinking feeling – when Carl Frampton makes his bid for the IBF world super-bantamweight title on September 6. Promoter Barry McGuigan will stage Frampton’s challenge to Spain’s Kiko Martinez in a specially built arena on the site from which the Titanic was launched in Belfast. The 16,000-crowd - the biggest fight attendance ever in Northern Ireland – will assemble in a space around the new Titanic Museum and cranes of the old shipyard. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Carl Frampton talk about Kiko Martinez . Battle ready: Kiko Martinez and Carl Frampton (right) after the press conference on Tuesday . The temporary stands will be erected and then taken down, in quick fire-fashion, similar to the conversion of Wembley Stadium for Carl Froch’s victory over George Groves. A rescued Titanic stairway in the museum, as well as the slipway into which the great ill-fated ship was launched and the tug which pulled it into the water, will be used for VIP entertaining. The boxing set-up must be in and out quickly to accommodate the Belfast Proms. This unique project has required the support of Northern Ireland’s first minister Peter Robinson. Frampton himself is thrilled by the concept and said: ‘I mustn’t be letting anybody down here. ‘I’m already virtually in shape for the fight. Everybody in Ulster expects me to win a world title as a matter of course but I know it’s not as easy as that. Big hitter: Frampton is launching a bid for the IBF world super-bantamweight title . ‘I’m preparing for a tough fight.’ This a rematch following Frampton’s earlier stoppage of Martinez in an eliminator. But the Spaniard has regrouped since to beat Frampton to the IBF belt. Martinez claims: ‘I have regained all my confidence from winning the title and I have no doubts about coming back to Belfast to defend it.’ The idea for the very special setting was born, ironically, from McGuigan’s memory of an open air fight in a huge temporary arena which used to be erected in the car park of Cesar’s Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. McGuigan lost his world title in 120-degree heat there to American Steve Cruz in 1986.

"The Rapport Radio looks like a standard lamp with a bendy neck and head (stock image) It’s the ultimate mood music – a radio that changes tune to suit how you are feeling. British students have invented a camera and face-recognition software that detects a listener’s mood and picks a suitable song. If they are happy with the choice and smile, the radio cranks up the volume; but if they frown, it tries another tune. A very angry look tells it to switch off. The prototype Rapport Radio looks like a funky standard lamp with a bendy neck and head. The gadget’s head hides a speaker and a webcam and the device is linked to a computer that plays the music. It is the brainchild of students at the Royal College of Art and Imperial College London, where it is one of nearly 50 student inventions on display this week. The software decodes the listener’s facial expression and tells the radio what to do and how to move. A . smile leads to the neck and head being lifted and a frown leads to it . ‘nodding’ to show it realises the music isn’t suitable and it is about . to be changed. The system could also be of use to the paralysed. For instance, bed sores could be avoided via a frown which commands that the position of the mattress be changed. Yifei Chai, one its inventors, said the facial-recognition software could control other household gadgets. He added: ‘You could go home and look desperately at your kettle and it will start boiling water for you.'","Rapport Radio looks like a standard lamp with a bendy neck and head .

"Facebook's mass manipulation of almost 700,000 users has caused uproar - and today Sheryl Sandberg was forced admit it was a mistake. However, a Brooklyn-based artist and programmer has built a tool that allows you to see it for yourself - and run Facebook’s controversial mood experiment on your own news feed. Scroll down for video . Sort it out: The Facebook Mood Manipulator allows you to filter the posts that appear in your feed based on the emotions they invoke . The plugin for Google's Chrome browser can be installed here. When the Facebook Mood Manipulator is installed, a small white box will appear in the top right corner of the News Feed. It contains a set of sliding scales labeled with four emotions: positive, emotional, aggressive, and open. Above the scales the Facebook Mood Manipulator prompts, 'How would you like to feel?' Users can slide the scales back and forth and watch how their feed is affected in real-time. For instance, sliding the 'Emotional' scale all the way to the right yields more photos of weddings and babies. Maxing out the 'Aggressive' filter can lead to a feed peppered with politically oriented posts and news of a gun showdown in Georgia. The 'Facebook Mood Manipulator' is a simple browser extension that lets you select how you want to feel and filters your Facebook Feed accordingly. Lauren McCarthy, the mastermind behind the project, built the tool in response to Facebook’s research into massive-scale emotional contagion.

Maxing out the 'Aggressive' and 'Emotional' filters can lead to a feed peppered with politically oriented posts and sad news . The Facebook Mood Manipulator even uses Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC), the same system used in the Facebook study, to evaluate phrasing in each Facebook post. McCarthy says she saw the Facebook study, but wanted to make the implications more tangible. 'Why should Zuckerberg get to decide how you feel?' She writes on her website, 'Take back control… manipulate your emotions on your terms.' Facebook has publicly apologized for such manipulations. The California-based firm carried out the experiment during a week in 2012. During that time, negative posts were deprioritized in the data feeds of 689,003 users, to see if it generated a more positive response. Posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word. The experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500. According to Facebook, nobody's posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up on some feeds. It found that negative posts elicited a . swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news . led to more negative posts. ‘When . positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts . and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the . opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. The company issued a statement last week claiming it 'never met to upset anyone' by altering the feeds of almost 700,000 users, adding, 'the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this.' Today, while on a visit to New Delhi, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg admitted that experiment was 'poorly communicated,' marking the first public statement on the study by a Facebook executive since the outrage erupted. 'This was part of ongoing research companies do to test different products, and that was what it was; it was poorly communicated, and for that communication we apologize. We never meant to upset you,' she told the Wall Street Journal. During one week in 2012, Facebook manipulated feeds of just over 689,000 users to highlight either positive or negative items, and then monitored responses over the course of a random week. The site has since apologised for the way the paper described the research, and any anxiety that was caused . ‘The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product,' said Facebook data scientist Adam D. I. Kramer. ‘We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. ‘At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends' negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. 'We didn't clearly state our motivations in the paper. 'Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone.' During the experiment, Facebook deprioritized content in users' News Feeds, based on whether there was an emotional word in the post. Tests affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2500 - for a week, in early 2012. According to Kramer, no posts were 'hidden,' they just didn't show up in certain users' feeds. 'Those posts were always visible on friends' timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads,' he explained. The study found that negative posts elicited a . swell of positive responses, but also that a reduction in positive news . led to more negative posts. ‘When . positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts . and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the . opposite pattern occurred,’ said the researchers. ‘These . results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook . influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for . massive-scale contagion via social networks.’ Of the millions of posts analyzed, 4 million were found to be positive and 1.8million were determined to be negative. The . findings led the team to conclude that ‘in-person interaction and . nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion.’ This . experiment was limited to users who viewed Facebook in English, but it . is not known across which geographic boundaries. 'At the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it - the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week,' continued Kramer. 'I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused.' Commenting on the reports, Brett Dixon, director of the digital marketing agency DPOM, said:  'Despite Facebook's insistence this was merely an academic experiment, it sails perilously close to the illegal world of subliminal advertising. 'There's a reason this insidious form of manipulation is banned - it is an abuse of people's freedom to choose.' 'But let's keep some perspective,' he added 'This was a research project, not the birth of some social media thought police.'","Browser extension for Google's Chrome Browser allows you to filter your own News Feed depending on mood .

"A same-sex penguin couple are putting their straight neighbours to shame after being dubbed the best penguin parents a Kent zoo has ever had. The Humboldts, called Jumbs and Kermit, have taken on the chick of a female called Isobel who had to abandon her egg to find food. It is the second egg the pair has been given, after the first failed to hatch last year, and this latest baby was born on 12 April. The two male Humboldts called Jumbs, pictured left, and Kermit, pictured right, were given the egg earlier this year. It hatched on 12 April. The unnamed chick is pictured between the couple. The egg was laid by a female called Isobel who had to abandon it to find food . In May 2012, a pair of same-sex Gentoo penguins called Inca and Rayas adopted a chick at Faunia Park in Madrid. But it isn’t just penguins that have been known to form same-sex relationships. Domestic . rams are statistically among the mammals most likely to form gay . relationships, with 8 per cent of male sheep forming male-to-male bonds. Dolphin males have also . been known to pair up, with relationships lasting as long as 17 years. While marine biologists have spotted bisexual activity in the . bottlenosed species. Homosexual . wild Australian black swans sometimes form threesomes with two males . and a female, which has led to higher breeding successes. This setup doubles . the chance of reproduction, and the males can more effectively guard a . nest against a predator. The male chick doesn’t yet have a name. Traditionally, zoos and wildlife parks wait to name a chick in case it doesn’t survive, but a spokesman for the Wingham Wildlife Park told the MailOnline that he’s doing ‘really well’ at the moment and the team are optimistic. With previous births, the park has run a competition on its Facebook page to name chicks, and is planning to do the same once this baby is in the clear. The male couple first paired up in 2012, effectively leaving two females without mates. Isobel lays eggs each year with her partner Hurricane, but Hurricane refuses to incubate the egg forcing Isobel to leave it to eat. Staff at the park therefore stepped in with this recent chick, and gave the egg to the gay pair. During the official announcement on the park’s Facebook page, a spokesman said: ‘Kermit and Jumbs are a same-sex pair of penguins who bonded over two years ago. ‘While unable to reproduce themselves, we gave them an egg this year, which had been abandoned by one of our females. Traditionally, zoos and wildlife parks wait to name a chick in case it doesn't survive, but a spokesman for the Wingham Wildlife Park told the MailOnline the new chick, pictured, is doing 'really well' at the moment and the team are optimistic. The male couple first paired up in 2012 . ‘Kermit and Jumbs have since hatched this egg, and the one-month-old baby is showing that these two penguins are excellent surrogate parents, and dare we say some of the best penguin parents we have here.' Wingham Wildlife Park’s owner Tony Binskin told the BBC: ‘Whilst pair bonding often results in no result other than eliminating those two animals from the breeding population of that species, in captivity it can have greatly positive effects. ‘We are still very much starting our breeding efforts with this species, and this is only our second year of breeding, but having such good surrogate parents available should we need them is a huge bonus for us.’ Judges, including Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, pictured left, and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, pictured right, visited London Zoo yesterday to launch Google's latest Impact Challenge.

"Tim Howard's superhuman effort to make 16 saves in America's World Cup game against Belgium could have been helped by his tourette's, experts have claimed. They say the condition, which Howard has, can give sufferers more cognitive self-control, not less. Researchers believe this is a lifetime of trying to control tics and also leads to improved timings. Scroll down for video . Safe hands: USA goalkeeper Tim Howard made a record 15 saves in his country's World Cup defeat to Belgium . Tourette’s syndrome is a neurological condition that affects the brain and nervous system. Named after French doctor, Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who first described the syndrome in the 19th century, it is characterised by involuntary noises and movements. Tics are usually vocal (grunting, coughing and shouting) or physical, with typical movements including jerking the head or jumping up and down. Most sufferers are first diagnosed during childhood and it is linked to ADHD and obsessive compulsive disorder.Source: NHS . The U.S. goalkeeper made 16 saves in this weeks heartbreaking knockout match . against Belgium, the most by any keeper in a World Cup match in nearly . half a century. After . the game, Howard was hailed a national hero, sparking a flurry of . internet memes and even a prank to change the Wikipedia picture of the . US Secretary of Defence to a shot of him diving to catch a ball. 'I’ve never counted how many tics I have in a game,' he said in a 2013 interview with Spiegel Online when asked about the condition. He said his tics include blinking, clearing his throat, and muscle tensing. 'It happens all the time, without any warning, and it increases the nearer an important game draws,' When the ball is far away, he says he indulges his twitches. 'I don’t suppress it,' he told the German publication. However, he said when an opposing player approaches, he calms down. 'I have no idea how I do it. Not even my doctors can explain it to me. 'It’s probably because at that moment my concentration on the game is stronger than the Tourette’s syndrome.' Mr Popular: Howard has been lauded as a national hero after his performance in Salvador on Tuesday . The British Psychological Society today pointed out that his tourettes may have helped, tweeting 'People with Tourette's have more cognitive self-control, not less - more from @ResearchDigest http://ow.ly/yHB5S  @TimHowardGK #USMNT' It pointed to a 2006 study in the UK. Sven Mueller and colleagues at the University of Nottingham asked nine young patients with Tourette’s and 19 controls to sometimes make fast eye movements towards an onscreen target, and sometimes to do the reverse – to make fast eye movements in the opposite direction to a target. A coloured border on the screen told them which rule to follow, and the rule changed every two trials. Switching between the two commands takes mental effort, especially when the natural reflex to look at a suddenly appearing target must be inhibited. As expected, the participants were slower to respond whenever the rule changed, as they adjusted their mental ‘set’ to the new rule. Glum: In the end Howard was unable to prevent the USA losing 2-1 in extra-time at the last 16 stage in Brazil . However, to the researchers' surprise, without sacrificing their accuracy the Tourette’s patients actually slowed down less than the healthy controls. The researchers said the patients’ superior performance at the task “may reflect a compensatory change in which the chronic suppression of tics results in a generalised suppression of reflexive behaviour in favour of increased cognitive control”.","US Keeper made 16 saves in heartbreaking knockout match against Belgium .

Moyes will face another ordeal at the hands of angry fans if his side fail to beat Aston Villa on Saturday and there are plans for a plane to fly over Old Trafford before the game with a banner calling for him to be axed. But the defiant boss insisted that only makes him more determined to succeed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Moyes react to defeats and see what players should leave . Bold claim: UInder-fire Manchester United boss David Moyes has said his predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson would have struggled to do better this season . In the firing line: An angry Manchester United fan approaches Moyes during the 3-0 derby defeat to City at Old Trafford on Tuesday . Club legend: Sir Alex Ferguson played a part in the hiring of Moyes to take over at United . All change: Moyes took over at United in the summer but has struggled to inspire his team . Moyes said: ‘If Sir Alex were here this year it would be difficult for him as well and I’m sure he’d agree. ‘People are aware there’s a squad that is ageing, so it would have been a tough season for whoever was in charge of United this year. It could have been the case no matter what.’ Some fans turned on Ferguson after the Manchester derby defeat at Old Trafford on Tuesday over his part in appointing Moyes. But that prompted Mourinho, a close friend of Fergie, to speak out in his defence. The Chelsea manager said: ‘He made United what United is. He deserves to retire and enjoy life. ‘Now he’s responsible for what? For what? United lose a match and it’s his responsibility? Speaking out: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has defended Sir Alex Ferguson after United fans turned on him during the 3-0 City derby loss . Mutual respect: Mourinho, right, and Ferguson are close friends . 'United struggle in the Premier League and it’s his problem? (Wayne) Rooney misses a goal, or (David) De Gea makes a mistake and it’s his fault? Let him retire in peace.’ Moyes, who has presided over seven home defeats this season, insisted Ferguson’s faith and support are key factors in why he will survive the crisis. He said: ‘The people who appointed me are incredibly knowledgeable football people — in fact, it was probably the most knowledgeable person who gave me the job. Home woes: Moyes has presided over seven home defeats for United this season . Frustrated: United striker Wayne Rooney shows his displeasure during the 3-0 loss to City . Yellow peril: Yohan Cabaye, now playing for Paris Saint-Germain, scored the only goal when Newcastle beat United earlier in the season . Theatre of nightmares: Liverpool striker Luis Suarez scored one of his side's three goals in the 3-0 win over United at Old Trafford . Bragging rights secured: Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure celebrates scoring his side's third goal in the 3-0 win over United in the derby . ‘They saw somebody who could do the job at Manchester United and know what the club is about and the style of the job so you have to trust those people. They trust me and for that reason we’ll go on working together. ‘I have continued with the philosophy and style that I believe I work in and that I believe Manchester United work in. I came here with a long-term job, not a short-term one.’ Stewards had to guard Moyes’ ‘Chosen One’ banner in the Stretford End on Tuesday night amid fears it could be torn down, and unhappy fans have paid for a plane to fly over Old Trafford on Saturday with the message ‘Wrong One — Moyes Out’ in red lettering. Trying to get his message across:  Moyes is under pressure after United's poor season . Burning issue: The Chosen One banner featuring Moyes' face will remain on display at Old Trafford, despite unrest at the results this season . On guard: Stewards stood by the 'Chosen One' banner after the City defeat after fears fans would try and remove it . The Scot said: ‘It’s something people are entitled to do. But that’s not what I’ve sensed. ‘I sense a stronger level of support in Old Trafford — for their club, for their team. If anything, I would say United supporters this year have been as good as people have seen them for many a year. ‘It’s a long journey here and this is just the start of the journey. You work hard to get to this place and I’m probably even more driven now because we’re in a position where it’s easy for people to say it can’t be done. Well, that’s the job that we’re going to do.’ Tough times: United fans have been forced to watch their team struggle this season under Moyes . Plenty to ponder: Moyes will be looking for United to bounce back against Aston Villa on Saturday . Asked if the ‘Chosen One’ banner has become a hindrance, Moyes replied: ‘It makes no difference to me. I’ve said from day one here that until I’m successful I’ve got no need for any banners. ‘I’ll be happy when I’ve won trophies and then I can have a banner up there rightly.’","David Moyes insists Sir Alex Ferguson could not have done better this season .

"Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy has told supporters that the club would consider sharing a ground while waiting for their new stadium to be built. Spurs announced in April that they hope to complete the £400million Northumberland Park Development project and move into a new stadium for 2017, although that date could be forced back unless a public enquiry is resolved. Speaking to the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, Levy admitted that stadium-sharing was looking increasingly likely - with Wembley, the Olympic Stadium and Milton Keynes Stadiummk being considered as possible venues, according to the Daily Telegraph. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Tim Sherwood on his tenure as boss . Let's get together! Daniel Levy has confirmed that Tottenham would consider ground-sharing . A move to the Olympic Stadium could potentially see a ground-share with local rivals West Ham - who won a battle against Tottenham to move into the stadium as anchor tennants for the 2016 - 2017 season. Levy also used the discussion to defend the constant change of managers during his tenure at White Hart Lane. New home? the Olympic Stadium is a possible venue, although that could involve sharing with West Ham . The chairman is searching for his eighth manager since arriving at the club in 2001, and his fifth in six years following the dismissal of Tim Sherwood. Levy insists that most clubs have adopted the same strategy, while claiming north London rivals Arsenal and Manchester United were the exceptions. Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax coach Frank de Boer are the favourites for the position. Who's next?

"Google’s next I/O developer conference in San Francisco is set to kick off later tonight, with numerous new products and services set to be revealed. This will likely include the latest iteration of the Android operating system, rumoured to be called ‘Lollipop’. And Google will also be unveiling a wealth of new technologies including its previously teased 3D-mapping tablet Tango, its next range of Nexus tablets, and wearable devices. Scroll down for video . Google's I/O 2014 developer conference kicks off today at 9am PDT (5pm BST) in California. The event is famed for its reveal of the latest Google products and services, with previous announcements including Google Glass. Talks and sessions can be watched live on Google's site . The . current prototype is a 5-inch phone containing customised hardware and . software designed to track the full 3D motion of the device, while . simultaneously creating a map of the environment. These . sensors allow the phone to make over a quarter million 3D measurements . every second, updating it’s position and orientation in real-time. It then combines that data into a single 3D model of the space around the user. The technology could be used to capture the dimensions of a person's home simply by walking around the table. Directions to a new location could continue beyond a street address into a building that had been mapped by someone else. Project Tango could also be used by the visually-impaired to navigated unassisted in unfamiliar indoor places. Or, when shopping, the tablet could be used to find the exact shelf a project is located on. Google also highlights some of the gaming aspects, such as playing hide-and-seek with a virtual character. I/O (which stands for input/output and ‘innovation in the open’) is an annual developer-focused conference run by Google that reveals insights into the tech giant’s research and development. Previous conferences have seen significant new announcements such as Google Glass and the Nexus 7 tablet, as well as upgrades to existing services like Google Maps. This year is expected to be no different - although there’s no place this time around for Google+ at any of the talks over two days, according to the schedule. The event will kick off with the keynote speech at 9am PDT (5pm BST) today and can be watched live on Google’s I/O site. It’s widely expected that Google will announce the next version of its Android operating system, 5.0, on the first day, which will follow the current method of picking the name based on sweets and desserts. Each iteration takes the next letter in the alphabet. Previous iterations were ‘Jelly Bean’ and ‘KitKat’, with this latest OS thought to be called ‘Lollipop’ - although rumour mills have been wrong before, with many thinking the last update would be ‘Key Lime Pie’. Other notable talks on the first day will revolve around wearable computing. Google has already introduced the Android Wear platform but the full launch is expected at I/O 2014, with smartwatches from a variety of manufacturers including Samsung and HTC expected to be announced. Pacific Crest analyst Evan Wilson . believes Google, alongside unveiling a new version of its Android operating . system, will put a 'heavy focus' on extensions . for smartwatches and smart home devices. 'We think Google will . directly counter Apple’s recent announcements of health products (Apple . HealthKit) and home automation (Apple HomeKit),' he said. Anyone for lollipop? It's widely expected that Google will announce the next version of its Android operating system, 5.0, on the first day. Previous iterations were 'Jelly Bean' and 'KitKat', with this latest OS thought to be called 'Lollipop' - although rumour mills have been wrong before . Google has previously used the I/O developer conference to unveil new technologies such as Glass, pictured here worn by co-founder Sergey Brin. Google Glass recently launched in the UK and was developed by Google X - a facility devoted to technological advancements . Meanwhile, a talk on the second day reveals some other technologies to be announced: ‘A 3D tablet, an Oscar, and a little cash. Tango, Spotlight, Ara. ATAP.’ ‘ATAP’ here refers to Google’s Advanced Technology and Projects lab. The ATAP lab is behind the Tango tablet, which will be a device capable of mapping its environment in 3D. Its goal is to use 3D scanning technology, akin to that in Microsoft’s Kinect sensor, to create 3D maps of an environment. This means that a person’s phone or tablet, for instance, could produce highly detailed interior maps of buildings, rooms and houses. And this could allow a device to provide directions inside a building, beyond just a street address. Project Ara, meanwhile, is heralded as ‘the only phone you’ll ever need’. Google's innovative Project Tango is pictured. The technology uses 3D scanning sensors, similar to Microsoft's Kinect, to create whole maps of interior locations. It can be used by a device to automatically build a 3D map of anywhere the user is, allowing for far better indoor navigation . Project Ara, pictured, is Google's much-anticipated modular smartphone that could be available in January 2015 for as little as £30 ($50). Each component of the smartphone will be upgradeable including the camera and battery, making it the 'only smartphone you'll ever need' Each component of the jigsaw-like Ara phones will be upgradaeable, from the camera to the battery. The so-called modular smartphone is expected to go on sale in January 2015, and could retail for as little as £30 ($50). I/O 2014 is also expected to be where Google unveils new products in its Nexus line of tablets. The next Nexus 10 tablet, rumoured to have a resolution of 2560 x 1600, will compete with Apple’s iPad Air and Amazon’s Fire HDX. The smaller, HTC-built Nexus 8 tablet will also be unveiled. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, suggests that Google is also planning to reveal its Android TV. This set-top box, powered by Android, will let users control their TV with any Android device such as a smartphone or tablet, or perhaps even with Google Glass. The second generation Nexus 7 (pictured), co-developed with Asus, was made available on 26 July 2013, with the Nexus 8 thought to be following this year. Here on 24 July 2013 Hugo Barra, director of Product Management at Android, holds a new Nexus 7 tablet during a Google event . And Google is also expected to reveal an in-car system known as Auto Link - a competitor to Apple’s CarPlay. Its exact purpose is unknown, however, with some suggesting it may just be a way to control Android devices via in-car buttons. On the home front, Google’s Nest Labs . - which makes network-connected thermostats and smoke detectors - . announced earlier this week that it has created a programme that allows . outside developers, from tiny startups to large companies such as . Whirlpool and Mercedes-Benz, to fashion software and 'new experiences' for its products. Integration . with Mercedes-Benz, for example, might mean that a car can notify a . Nest thermostat when it is getting close to home, so the device can have . the home’s temperature adjusted to the driver’s liking before he or she . arrives. And, finally, one of the last talks at the conference could also prove to be the most interesting. ‘Robotics in a new world’ could be a look at some of the artificially-intelligent devices Google is developing, including its smart driverless cars.","Google's I/O 2014 developer conference starts today in California .

"Nasa's vast SLS rocket, which will launch payloads of upto 130 tonnes into orbit and could make its first flight in 2017. It is set to become the largest rocket ever built, dwarfing the rockets that took man to the moon and paving the way for manned missions to Mars. Nasa today said it has signed a $2.8 billion contract with Boeing to build the giant rocket it is hoped will take us into deep space. It comes as the team complete the Critical Design Review (CDR) on the core stage – the last major review before full production begins. 'Our teams have dedicated themselves to ensuring that the Space Launch System (SLS) – the largest ever - will be built safely, affordably and on time,' said Virginia Barnes, Boeing SLS vice president and program manager. 'We are passionate about NASA’s mission to explore deep space. 'It’s a very personal mission, as well as a national mandate.' This milestone marks NASA’s first CDR on a deep-space human exploration launch vehicle since 1961, when the Saturn V rocket underwent a similar design review as the United States sought to land an astronaut on the moon. Scheduled for its initial test flight in 2017, the SLS is designed to be flexible and evolvable to meet a variety of crew and cargo mission needs. The initial flight-test configuration will provide a 77-ton capacity, and the final evolved two-stage configuration will provide a lift capability of more than 143 tons. The rocket will be used to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, and to help us explore the outer reaches of the solar system. 'The potential use of SLS for science will further enhance the synergy between scientific exploration and human exploration,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for science at NASA Headquarters in Washington. 'SLS has the promise of enabling transformational science in our exploration of the solar system and cosmos.' Currently under construction, NASA’s Space Launch System will be the world’s most powerful launch vehicle. Designed to enable human exploration missions to deep space destinations, including an asteroid and Mars, SLS is working toward a first launch in 2017. For that first flight test, the rocket will be able to launch 70 metric tons (77 tons) of payload into low-Earth orbit, almost three times what the space shuttle could carry. From there, SLS will be evolved to a configuration that will be able to carry 130 metric tons (143 tons), more weight than any rocket ever has been able to carry. 'While many people think of the Space Launch System in terms of human exploration, SLS could have a wide application in a lot of other areas, including space science,” said Steve Creech, assistant program manager for strategy and partnerships for SLS. How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway . Nasa's previous rockets, the Saturn, Shuttle and right, the smaller configuration of the new SLS . There will be two versions of the rocket. The smaller, 70-metric-ton SLS will stand 321 feet tall, provide 8.4 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, weigh 5.5 million pounds and carry 154,000 pounds of payload. The massive 130-metric-ton-configuration will be the most capable, powerful launch vehicle in history. Towering a staggering 384 feet tall, it will provide 9.2 million pounds of thrust at liftoff and weigh 6.5 million pounds. It will be able to carry payloads weighing 286,000 pounds to orbit. 'For missions to the outer planets, for example, SLS could make it possible to do things that are currently impossible, such as sending larger scientific spacecraft with more instruments to far off destinations with reduced transit times.' Agency scientific and engineering teams have been evaluating whether there would be potential benefits from launching deep space robotic spacecraft, such as the Europa Clipper, a proposed mission to one of Jupiter's icy moons, on the SLS rocket, and determined the rocket would enable the spacecraft to fly direct trajectories to our solar system’s outer planets, rather than using planetary gravities to gain speed, reducing transit time compared to current launch vehicles. In the case of the Europa Clipper, for example, the transit time would be reduced to less than half of what it would be using other launch vehicles. 'For as long as people have been launching rockets into space, mission designers have had to work within certain limitations – a spacecraft can only be so heavy and it has to fit within a certain width,” Creech said. 'Depending on how large you make it, it can only go so fast, which in some cases limits where you can go. 'Today, if you want to send a mission to the outer planets, you have to be able to make it fit within that box. With SLS, we’re about to make that box much larger. An artist's impression of the giant rocket taking off . An artist's impression of the vast hanger needed to set the rocket up for flight . 'With the space shuttle, for example, we were able to launch missions like NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope that were about the size of a school bus. 'With SLS, you can design a spacecraft even larger than the space shuttle that carried Hubble. 'It’s going to open up an entirely new way of thinking about how we plan and design planetary science missions.' 'The Space Launch System could be really game-changing for space science,” said ACO manager Reggie Alexander. 'For some missions, it makes it much easier and quicker to carry them out. 'A Mars sample return mission, for example, could be flown using only one rocket instead of three. 'But for other destinations, SLS lets you do things we could only dream of before – like collecting samples from the geysers of Saturn’s moon Enceladus.' The top section of the rocket .

"Banks in an independent Scotland would be at risk of an Iceland-style meltdown which saw savers lose billions, a leading ratings agency has warned. Standard and Poor’s sounded the alarm after figures showed the assets of Scottish lenders would be more than 10 times bigger than the entire country’s economy. It would leave the government unable to guarantee savings in the event of a collapse, echoing the crisis which engulfed Iceland in 2008 when all of its banks were allowed to fail. The assets of banks in an independent Scotland would outstrip the entire economy by more than the peak in Iceland, where banks failed in 2008 . It is the latest major warning about the financial uncertainties facing Scotland if voters decide to back independence in September’s referendum. First Minister Alex Salmond has repeatedly claimed Scotland has the economic muscle to go it alone. Before the financial crash he used to point to Iceland as part of an ‘arc of posterity’ which showed small economies could thrive. But in 2008, Iceland’s banks crashed. With assets totalling 880 per cent of GDP, the government of the small country was unable to bail them out and billions were lost. Some 340,000 savers lost deposits when Icesave collapsed, 200,000 of which were British. Alex Salmond has unveiled proposals for high-speed cross-Border trains from an independent Scotland in a St George's Day pitch to English voters. In a brazen attempt to convince business leaders in northern England to back the break-up of Britain, he said a 'feasibility study' will be launched in an effort to slash journey times to Cumbria, Leeds and Manchester. Marking England's national day at an event in Carlisle, Mr Salmond said Westminster plans for high-speed rail - known as HS2 - will take 'decades to spread up from the South'. The UK Government has already announced proposals to include Edinburgh and Glasgow in a third phase of the HS2 network. However, if Scotland becomes an independent country, Coalition sources have warned there would be no economic case for building north of Manchester and Leeds because there are no major population centres on their side of the Border. The First Minister said joint plans for a high-speed rail link were already being discussed with Westminster. But he added: 'An independent Scotland could do more. Rather paying our share of the borrowing costs for high-speed rail, as we wait decades for it to spread up from the south, we can use that money to build high-speed rail from the north instead.' Governments in Britain and the Netherlands were forced to repay £3.18 billion to members of the public who lost their deposits when Icesave, an online subsidiary of Iceland's Landsbanki, collapsed in the 2008 crisis. According to latest estimates, banks in an independence Scotland would have assets worth 1,200 per cent of GDP. As a result, an independent Scotland would be unable to guaranatee the savings held in banks which went to the wall, Standard and Poor’s said. ‘In our view, the willingness and ability of a future Scottish government to support its banking system is challenging at this point, not least because system assets could be over 1,000 per cent of Scottish GDP. A new banking market would mean additional costs and risks.’ Even joining the EU – as Mr Salmond hopes to do - would not be enough to protect the banks’ assets. ‘These arrangements would likely be unfunded, leaving the comparatively very sizeable deposit bases of the largest Scottish banks backed with an implicit guarantee by the Scottish government,’ S&P said. ‘We note a possible parallel here with Iceland, where in 2008 the national deposit insurance scheme could not honour claims when the country's outsized banking system failed.’ It also warned that a separate Scottish banking market would create additional costs for banks on both sides of the border. The Scottish Government wants to share the pound in a formal currency union with the Bank of England, but all major UK parties have pointedly ruled this out. The absence of an effective deposit guarantee scheme could see a flight of Scotland's banks across the border, it said. A spokesman for pro-Union campaign  Better Together said: ‘Scottish savings and mortgages are more secure as part of the UK.’ But a Scottish Government spokesman said: ‘Scotland has all the attributes needed to be an economically successful independent country.’ Meanwhile, a separate survey found Scots businesses will lose a third of English customers if Mr Salmond’s bid to break up Britain succeeds. An ICM poll found 36 per cent would be less likely to deal with companies north of the Border following a Yes vote. Some 340,000 savers lost deposits when Icesave collapsed, 200,000 of which were British . The survey of 2,000 consumers in Scotland, England and Wales asked specifically about companies such as Scottish Widows, Scottish Power and Standard Life. Gregor Jackson of ICM said: ‘Some of these brands are old and keeping “Scottish” in their names is perceived to be a strength, but this research suggests that in the event of a Yes vote, consumers in the rest of the UK would be less likely to deal with them.’ Iain McMillan of CBI Scotland said that after a Yes vote, Scotland would become a ‘foreign country’ to consumers south of the Border.","Standard and Poor's warns savings in banks could not be guaranteed .

"Alan Irvine will explore the possibility of luring ‘Rolls Royce’ Jack Rodwell to West Bromwich Albion once he lands Joleon Lescott. Irvine worked with Rodwell at Everton and wants to tap into his football contacts to attract bigger names to the Hawthorns. Lescott is expected to sign for Albion after he undertook a medical at the club yesterday and Irvine wants at least five more quality players to strengthen his threadbare squad. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alan Irvine reassure West Brom fans of his credentials . Signings: New West Bromwich Albion boss Alan Irvine is keen on Joleon Lescott and Jack Rodwell . Rolls Royce: Irvine is a keen admirer of Rodwell and wants to bring the midfielder to the Hawthorns . Close: Lescott completed his medical at West Brom and Irvine hopes to wrap up the deal soon . Rodwell moved to Manchester City in 2012 for an initial £12million after progressing through Everton's academy but has been troubled by injury and only made 26 appearances for the club. ‘I know Jack really well as I live in Southport,’ he said. ‘He's had some injury problems but is a very good player. He was a Rolls Royce as a kid but I don't know his situation. ‘Manchester City bought him for a huge amount of money so I can't imagine he would be someone available for a small fee.' Irvine admitted that bringing in high-calibre players on loan could provide a solution but said such deals would be completed towards the end of the window. ‘What you tend to find is loans happen later,' he said. 'Let's put everyone in together in pre-season and see what happens in terms of the squad. ‘I certainly think getting loan players in is a way of strengthening the squad but we cannot wait until that situation happens as we have too small a squad.’ Big money: Rodwell (right) signed for City in 2012 for £12m and would command a big fee again .

"Alan Irvine admits West Bromwich Albion have been handed a run-in from hell by the fixture computer but is aiming to replicate Crystal Palace’s thriving finish in similar circumstances last season as he takes control at the Hawthorns. The new head coach has challenged his players to get the club to safety as quickly as possible so the final five matches against Liverpool, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Chelsea and Arsenal are rendered largely inconsequential. West Brom’s run-in echoes that endured by Norwich City last season when they faced Liverpool, United, Chelsea and Arsenal and collected only one point and were relegated. Scroll down for video... Safety first: New West Brom boss Alan Irvine wants to secure points before a difficult run-in . But Irvine wants his players to channel Palace, who beat Chelsea and Everton, among others, and came back from 3-0 down to snatch a draw with Liverpool as the season reached a climax. ‘It’s the Premier League so straight away there are an awful lot of very, very tough games,’ he said. ‘It’s a difficult end to the season that’s for sure, but you’ve got to play everyone anyway. ‘Getting safe before then would be helpful that’s for sure. But that’s what you’ d be aiming to do. You want to be in a really good place as quickly as possible. ‘You look at Palace’s end to the season as opposed to Norwich’s and of course they produced some outstanding results against the top teams.’ Flying Eagles: Cruystal Palace rose to the occasion to survive a difficult run-in last season . Irvine is already under pressure from fans angry at his appointment, given his two previous managerial roles – at Preston North End and Sheffield Wednesday – were not in the Premier League and ended with the sack. But the 55-year-old, who moves from head of Everton’s academy, defended his standing in the game. ‘I understand I wouldn’t have been the name of everybody lips but I’ve got this job now,’ he said. ‘I know the Albion fans are incredibly passionate but I’m incredibly passionate – hopefully together we can have success. ‘The only way I can do that is by winning games. Every single manager or head coach will be judged on results on the pitch. Unfortunately that won’t happen for a number of weeks but it does give me time to work with the players and get them ready. My passion is for coaching.’ Downers: Norwich were not able survive a challenging climax to the season and were relegated . He will also need to work quickly in the transfer market with West Brom’s squad threadbare. ‘We’ve got 16 players and three of them are goalkeepers so that won’ t be enough for a Premier League season,’ he said. ‘We have to get more players in. We have some good players in the squad but it needs to be supplemented. ‘There aren’t any fullbacks at the club, a shortage of wide players, we have three senior centre-backs, we don’t have a lot of senior strikers. There are areas we need to address but it’s got to be quality.’","West Brom boss Alan Irvine wants to secure points before a difficult run-in .

"John Collins insists he never had any problem with Scott Brown on the training pitch during their time together at Hibernian and is looking forward to renewing their working relationship at Celtic. Collins has begun his role as Celtic assistant manager after being named as Ronnie Deila's right-hand man earlier in the week. The appointment raised questions about Collins' relationship with Brown, who was a Hibs player when the bulk of the first-team squad lobbied chairman Rod Petrie with grievances about the approach of then manager Collins during an infamous meeting in early 2007. That's rubbish: Ronnie Deila's new Celtic assistant John Collins insists he has no problem with Scott Brown . Collins soon led Hibs to the League Cup and Brown left for Celtic in a £4.4million move in the summer, and the former Scotland midfielder has no issues with the club captain. 'I worked with Scott at Hibs on the training pitch and he was a fantastic professional and an excellent player,' Collins said at Celtic's Lennoxtown training ground. 'Gordon Strachan asked me at the time about Scott coming to Celtic and I told Gordon he would be a wonderful signing for Celtic. I was proved right. He has been the captain, playing terrifically well, and an international. 'I'm looking forward to seeing Scott next week and working with him. The main man: Scotland international midfielder Brown is a huge fans' favourite at Parkhead . 'I had a terrific relationship with Scott on the training pitch and never had one problem with him ever. 'Why? Because he's a good professional who loves training and likes performing well.

"Alan Stubbs is closing in on his first job in front-line football management with Hibernian. As Sportsmail first revealed on Wednesday, the Easter Road club approached Everton for permission to speak with their reserve-team manager about succeeding Terry Butcher as boss at the start of this week. The Goodison club reluctantly agreed to Hibs’ request and Stubbs impressed chief executive Leeann Dempster during an initial discussion and has continued to tick the right boxes in subsequent talks. On the verge: Everton Under-21 boss Alan Stubbs appears set to be named Hibernian manager . Sources close to the negotiations last night described them as ‘positive’ and barring a late change of heart, Dempster will recommend Stubbs’ name to the board for approval over the weekend ahead of his unveiling early next week. Former Easter Road No 2 Mark Venus was also interviewed by Dempsey and impressed the former Motherwell supremo. Yet the fact he left for his annual holiday without having had notification of a decision from the club suggests he is being overlooked on this occasion. Former Hibernian captain Ian Murray, now manager of Dumbarton, has also linked with the position but, contrary to reports elsewhere, he has not spoken to his former employers. Impressive: Stubbs (right) enjoyed 'positive' talks with Hibs chief executive Leeann Dempster (left) John Collins, Stuart McCall and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink were mentioned in dispatches following Butcher’s axing but were all non-runners. Stubbs was quickly identified by Dempster as the identikit of the man Hibs were looking for to rebuild the club. The former Celt is well versed in Scottish football from his five years at Parkhead between 1996 and 2001 and has made it clear that he covets a managerial job. History: Stubbs (left) has experienced Scottish football during his five-year spell as a player for Celtic . He was interviewed for the Everton manager’s job following Davie Moyes’ departure a year ago but chairman Bill Kenwright opted for Wigan’s Roberto Martinez. Stubbs, who enjoyed two spells with his Merseyside boyhood heroes as a player, is well regarded within Goodison but he feels the time is now right to strike out on his own. Provided his appointment gets across the line, his first game in charge will be a Ramsdens Cup tie on July 26.","Stubbs enjoyed 'positive' talks with chief executive Leeann Dempster .

"Target Corp and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season late last year, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed.Smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Those breaches have yet to come to light. Also, similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. Personal information: The attackers stole information including customers' credit card details . The sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls, but declined to elaborate. They also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the Target attack, they cannot be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the attacks. Law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from Eastern Europe, which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade. Under attack: Neiman Marcus has also come forward to admit it too was a victim of cyber attacks . Only one well-known retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since Target's December 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack. On Friday, Target said an investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Neiman Marcus said it was not sure if the breach was related to the Target incident. Theft: Target says that personal information including phone numbers and email and mailing addresses was stolen from as many as 70 million customers in its pre-Christmas data breach . Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain types of personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer. Merchants are required to report breaches when certain types of personal information, including social security numbers are compromised. It was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as Target.

No rest: Van Gaal could be involved with the Dutch squad until July 15 should they reach the World Cup final .

There is also the possibility that United will present Louis van Gaal in a press conference before the club head off to the USA for glamour games against LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter and Real Madrid, meaning that the 62-year-old could have an exhausting schedule lying in wait. It is also expected that United will have a host of commercial events in store once they land in the USA. Van Gaal, meanwhile, has been in constant discussions with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward during his involvement with the World Cup and he is understood to be delighted with the progress United have made in the transfer window, after the club this week sealed the signings of midfielder Ander Herrera and defender Luke Shaw.

Van Gaal had initially expected to be without the club’s England stars for the majority of the trip as it is normal practice for World Cup players to be given a four-week break following their elimination from the tournament. However, Van Gaal will now have a chance to meet the majority of his squad far earlier as the players have been informed that they must be ready to play against Roma in the second game of the tour in Denver on July 26.

"Celtic have handed a trial to young Benfica forward Sancidino Silva. The 20-year-old Guinea-Bissau international is currently out of contract at the Stadium of Light and keen to move on. He has been training with the Parkhead youth squad in Glasgow as the Scottish champions weigh up a move amid rival interest from Olympiakos and Besiktas. Most wanted: Benfica's Sancidino Silva has attracted the likes of Celtic, Olympiakos and Besiktas . Should Celtic decide to press ahead, Silva would not require a work permit as he holds a Portuguese passport. Meanwhile, Nir Biton may have returned to Celtic a married man after a lavish summer wedding, but all his attention is now focused on striving towards a different kind of happy union. The Champions League is the object of his desire. For Biton, returning to European football’s greatest stage would provide the chance to expunge some painful memories from his debut season at Parkhead. He made three appearances in the group stage last term, all of which brought varying shades of anguish. Little more than 60 seconds of a 2-0 defeat in Milan was followed by a late introduction against Ajax at Parkhead. That, however, lasted just 11 minutes before a clattering challenge on Thulani Serero earned Biton a red card and the wrath of manager Neil Lennon. Target: Nir Bilton wants to taste success in the Champions League after last season's disappointment . He was free of suspension in time to start the final game against Barcelona, only for that to morph into another nightmare as Celtic were routed 6-1. This wasn’t quite how the Israeli imagined it working out after moving from FC Ashdod last August. The 22-year-old midfielder’s season was then curtailed by a torn groin muscle sustained on international duty but he is back under new boss Ronny Deila determined to make a more substantial mark. Helping the club qualify for the Champions League is key, with the first qualifier against KR Reykjavik now just a fortnight away. ‘The Champions League is so important to a club like Celtic,’ Biton admitted. ‘We want to get to the group stage and, although it will be tough, I believe we can do it. ‘Last year, the Champions League was not so good for me but I have tried to learn from the red card against Ajax. I was a split second late for the ball and paid the price - but next time, hopefully, I will do it differently. ‘Sometimes these things can make you stronger, because after the red card I was extremely down. Alpine retreat: Biton and Celtic team-mate Virgil Van Dijk (right) take part in pre-season training in Austria . ‘My first few months at Celtic were a shock for me but experiences like that can only make you a better player. ‘It was difficult at first. I didn’t start the season that well. I was at a new club, with new team-mates and a new coach. 'I didn’t know about the expectations of the club and the football was so  different to what I was used to in Israel. It took me some time but  eventually I settled down and started to play better before my injury. ‘Football is all about confidence and you need to start to believe you can perform. I feel good now about myself, the team and the coach.’ The . positivity extends to Biton’s  personal life after his marriage to wife . Bar during the close season. The big day was happily concluded, despite . some pre-match jitters. ‘It was the best day of my life,’ he grinned. ‘It was a great party at night with about 600 guests. Hitched: Nir Bilton returns to Celtic training after a summer wedding in Israel . ‘We celebrate weddings differently in Israel and I was probably more nervous before that than I would be before a big game. But, once I had a few drinks, I was OK. ‘It was a great occasion but I didn’t have time for a honeymoon because I was injured last year and wanted to get back fit for pre-season with the new manager and staff at Celtic. ‘Everyone wants to prove themselves to the new coach.

"Ronny Deila last night confirmed Celtic were poised to conclude a deal for Craig Gordon – as the Scottish champions brace themselves for a big-money bid for Fraser Forster. La Liga holders Atletico Madrid have been linked with an £8million move for Forster to replace Thibaut Courtois, who has returned to Chelsea. Southampton are also keen on the World Cup squad member and may well step up their interest after drafting England goalkeeping coach Dave Watson onto their staff. Circling: Several clubs, including Atletico Madrid, are interested in signing England keeper Fraser Forster . In safe hands? Craig Gordan looks set to return to Scottish football . Deila still hopes to keep Forster at Parkhead but recognises the financial reality if an irresistible offer is forthcoming. The capture of ex-Scotland international Gordon is not linked to Forster’s exit but would provide a hugely experienced option for a key position in the squad. Deila is confident a deal can now be finalised for the 31-year-old, who is fit again after two years without a club following a serious knee injury. ‘We are getting closer with Craig Gordon, it is down to the small details,’ said the Norwegian. ‘I think we can make this happen but it’s not confirmed yet. ‘But we also need to have alternatives. You always make contingency plans. We have a much bigger scouting network here. In Norway it was only me, but we always have the chance to bring in good players. ‘Craig needs time. If he can get back to his old levels then he will be a very good international-class goalkeeper. ‘If you are going to bring in older players then they need to have the right mentality and Craig has that. ‘He can help the young players improve and have a good influence on the group.’ Gaffer: Celtic manager Ronny Deila (R) believes Craig Gordan will provide experience in a key position . Newcastle and Southampton are both tracking Virgil van Dijk, but Deila insisted no bids had yet been tabled for the Dutch centre-back or Forster. ‘I have always been used to this kind of situation because at Stromsgodset I lost half a team every year,’ he said. ‘It’s a positive. If no one wants your players then you are doing something wrong. ‘There are always going to be rumours, but that is all they are at the moment. ‘When someone faxes Celtic with an offer then it is real and we will have to make a decision. ‘But there is nothing concrete right now and I am positive about the rest of the window as well. ‘Peter (Lawwell) doesn’t call me to tell me it’s a rumour. He will call me when there is something true and so far I’ve heard nothing. ‘I am hoping that remains the case. I want to keep these players but I know there is always the possibility the club can get good money, which can be reinvested. That’s a good way to work.’ Dutch of class: Newcastle and Southampton have been tracking . Celtic  defender Virgil Van Dijk. Forster is due to join up with the Celtic squad during the second week of their Austrian training camp and could play in the friendly against Dukla Prague a week on Friday. ‘We will have Emilio Izaguirre and Fraser for the last game out here, but Efe Ambrose will meet up with us in Glasgow because of the visa problems,’ said Deila of his World Cup participants. ‘It takes time to get the papers sorted but the good thing is that Efe has played games. It’s more important for Fraser to come because he needs games.’","Celtic are expecting a big money bid for England keeper Craig Forster .

"James Forrest could miss Celtic’s Champions League qualifiers as Ronny Deila seeks to resolve the player’s fitness issues once and for all. The winger netted the last-gasp goal that defeated Shakhter Karagandy and sealed a £15million jackpot in last season’s group stages. But a thigh problem has become the latest issue in a catalogue of injury and illness experienced by the 22-year-old over the past two years. Out? James Forrest (right, with Mikael Lustig and Adam Matthews) may miss the Champions League qualifiers . Deila views Forrest as an outstanding talent but will take all the time required to help him back into peak condition before selecting him for action. Celtic face Russian side FK Krasnodar in their first pre-season friendly this evening, with their European qualifier against KR Reykjavik just 12 days away. ‘James is out for some weeks,’ said Deila. ‘We will see what happens in terms of the qualifiers. We will take it from week to week. ‘I don’t want to rush James. He has been out for such a long time that he needs time to get his fitness up. I saw in training that he didn’t have the fitness needed to be consistent. ‘When he is fit, then he can start playing games. He is a very explosive player. When you are in and out, you can push too hard to get back and end up having to start all over again. ‘It’s very important that we take our time with him and get out his potential. If it continues the way of the last year or two then that will never happen because of all the injuries. ‘It’s better to keep him out for a good while now to really get him fit. From there, we can get him into games. James is an exceptional talent but you need that fitness to play game after game. The medical staff know what to do with him. It’s just about getting the time to do it.’ Get that sorted, please! New Celtic boss Ronny Deila is refusing to rush Forrest back into action . Deila is targeting a new wide player as Derk Boerrigter has also been frequently injured since arriving at Celtic from Ajax last summer. ‘It’s similar with Derk,’ he added. ‘He has been out for a long time but is working well. He seems okay but when you have been out for a long time it can take months to get on the same level again. ‘Derk and James are the quickest wingers we have. Last season, a lot of midfielders were used in wide positions. Finding another winger is something we will look at.’ Craig Gordon is, however, poised to become Deila’s first signing. The Norwegian revealed earlier this week that a deal for the ex-Scotland goalkeeper was close and it is now expected to be finalised within the next 48 hours. Travelling: Forrest is said to be out for weeks but was still with the squad as they flew to Austria . The Celtic boss has also insisted Celtic could afford Stromsgodset prodigy Martin Odegaard – but he has no immediate plan to move for the 15-year-old midfielder. Deila promoted the talented teenager into first team football while in charge at the Norwegian club. Odegaard – who has trained with Manchester United and Bayern Munich – has expressed a wish to work with his old manager again in the future. But Deila’s successor David Nielsen claimed he was too pricey for Celtic and would end up with Barcelona. ‘It’s incorrect to say that Martin is outwith our range,’ Deila told Norwegian TV. ‘Martin must do what is best for him and we will do what is best for us - we’ll see if our paths meet at a later date. ‘Martin is a good player but not even close to being a Celtic player at the moment. But there’s no doubt that he has the capability to be in the future.’","The Bhoys have flown to Austria for a pre-season camp .

"The NHS rationing body is poised to ban the use of a drug that could delay the need for chemotherapy among men with advanced prostate cancer . The NHS rationing body is poised to ban the use of a drug that could delay the need for chemotherapy among men with advanced prostate cancer. Abiraterone, which gives at least four months’ extra life, is offered to men on the NHS after treatment and when they are running out of options. The pill’s manufacturer, Janssen, and campaigners want thousands to receive earlier treatment before chemotherapy, but draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence would ban this. Last year, abiraterone was used before chemotherapy by 3,000 men in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund, which picks up the bill when a treatment is awaiting approval by Nice. It was the second most requested treatment backed by the fund. Doctors say the figures show the drug, which was developed by British scientists, is now more likely to be used before chemotherapy, and some men have survived on it for almost five years. Sir Andrew Dillon, chief executive of Nice, said the drug would not be cost-effective at this stage of treatment. A month’s treatment costs £3,000, but the NHS and the Cancer Drugs Fund pay less through a discount scheme. Professor Paul Workman, of the Institute of Cancer Research, said the drug was a victim of its own success as its novel action meant it did not fit easily into the current system for assessing treatment. He added: ‘Abiraterone, which was discovered and developed here at the Institute of Cancer Research, is now used as standard after chemotherapy and has extended the lives of thousands of men in the UK with advanced prostate cancer. Last year, abiraterone was used before chemotherapy by 3,000 men in England . ‘The decision to refuse use of abiraterone before chemotherapy will deny many thousands of men the opportunity to access the drug earlier in their course of treatment. ‘It is a particular blow for men who are unable to have chemotherapy because they are too old or too frail, since they could now miss out on abiraterone too.’ Professor . Peter Johnson, Cancer Research UK’s chief clinician, said the plan did . not make sense, adding: ‘Nice has previously agreed that abiraterone is . an effective and cost-effective drug for men with prostate cancer who . have already had docetaxel (chemo), and there is no reason for it to be . any less effective before the chemotherapy – if anything, the reverse.’ Mikis . Euripides, of the charity Prostate Cancer UK, described the draft . guidance as a ‘huge blow’ for men with advanced disease. ‘It seems unforgivable that such a powerful and beneficial treatment should be left tantalisingly out of reach,’ he said. ‘We . implore Janssen and Nice to work together to do everything in their . power to make this vital treatment available as soon as possible for all . in England and Wales who need it.’ Sir . Andrew said: ‘We hope that during this consultation, the manufacturer . uses this opportunity to look again at its submission and provides the . committee with additional information which may enable them to . reconsider.’ Janssen said it was disappointed, but would ‘work constructively’ with Nice. In . 2012, Nice attempted completely to ban the use of abiraterone, also . known as Zytiga, but was forced into a U-turn after a public outcry and a . rare intervention from the Department of Health.","Abiraterone gives at least four months’ extra life .

"Marion Bartoli believes Amelie Mauresmo is the 'perfect' person to help Andy Murray cope with the pressure of defending his Wimbledon title. Murray took the tennis world by surprise by appointing Mauresmo, a former Australian Open and Wimbledon champion, as his coach after the French Open. Initially the deal is only for the grass-court season but both are hoping it will extend beyond that. All smiles: Marion Bartoli believes Amelie Mauresmo (left) is the perfect person to help Andy Murray (right) The partnership did not get off to the best start with Murray's third-round loss to Radek Stepanek at Queen's Club, but their focus from the start will have been Wimbledon. After ending Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles winner 12 months ago, all eyes will be on the world number five when he steps out to begin his defence on Monday. Bartoli is well-placed to judge Mauresmo's capabilities because it was the 34-year-old to whom Bartoli turned last year for help at Wimbledon. Frustrated figure: Murray lost to Radek Stepanek in the third round at Queen's Club . With Mauresmo in her corner, Bartoli went on to become one of the most surprising champions in Wimbledon's long history. She said: 'If Andy's looking for someone who can help him deal with the pressure of defending the title and coming back again to Wimbledon then he hired the perfect person, because Amelie's really someone that is able to take all the stress away and make you feel extremely comfortable. 'I really felt that way when she was coaching me as my Fed Cup captain or as my adviser during Wimbledon. She was able to give me some small but great advice in order to deal with my stress. 'She prepares you for the worst and gives you some advice in order to deal with that, so when you start to face that situation you are ready. 'I really felt she was a tremendous help to me last year, especially in the final and semi-final.' Bartoli expects Murray and Mauresmo to hit it off on a personal level as well, saying: 'They're both extremely funny, I think they will joke around a lot. 'Amelie's been in every situation, she's been a player, a coach, on the bench as a Fed Cup captain. She knows really well what she's speaking about.' Nation expects: Murray goes into this year's Wimbledon as defending champion having won it last year . While Murray was warming up for his Wimbledon defence at Hurlingham on Thursday, Bartoli was stepping out for a public match for the first time since her shock retirement last August. The unlikely venue was Liverpool Cricket Club, with Bartoli accepting an invitation to play in the Liverpool Hope University International Tennis Tournament. Football played a big part in Bartoli's decision to accept the invitation. The 29-year-old is a huge fan and is hoping to return later in the year to watch a match at Anfield or Goodison Park. Eyes on the prize: Bartoli beat Sabine Lisicki to win the women's singles final at Wimbledon last year . 'Liverpool, soccer, tennis, grass - that's a great combination,' she said. 'If you tell me, clay court, Roland Garros, maybe it would be more tricky. But grass, England, Liverpool, that works pretty well. Wimbledon's right around the corner, there's going to be some amazing memories, it's just a great time.' Bartoli has insisted since laying down her racquet little over a month after winning Wimbledon that she has never had any regrets. She has done some media work but her main post-retirement activity has been launching a fashion business. Warm embrace: Bartoli (right) hugs her then coach Maursemo (left) after her Wimbledon triumph . Bartoli is currently working on a line of tennis bags, and she said: 'I feel extremely lucky that I've been able to realise my dream as a tennis player but I don't like to call myself a retired person, it's just like I've finished the first part of my life and now I'm starting the second part, which is as a fashion designer and creator. 'This is something I really love to do, I want to explore that and I'm working really hard, just like I did on the tennis court. 'I feel like I'm 1,000 in the rankings and I need to become a Wimbledon champion. It's a long way to go. It took me 22 years to fulfil my dream in tennis, I truly hope it won't take me that time in fashion.'","Marion Bartoli says Amelie Mauresmo is the perfect person for Andy Murray .

"That Marin Cilic raced clear as the first man through to the quarter-finals on Monday represents something of an irony. There was very little clarity about his appearance at last year’s tournament. Instead, there was a cloak of secrecy followed by a prolonged period of mysterious exile. Cilic, 25, pulled out at the second-round stage 12 months ago citing a knee injury. That only emerged as a ploy to ‘avoid adverse publicity’ from a failed drugs test when the International Tennis Federation banned him for nine months last September. Through: Marin Cilic defeated Jeremy Chardy is straight sets to set up a quarter-final against Novak Djokovic . The previous April the Croat was found to have a banned stimulant called nikethamide in his system through a urine sample at Munich’s BMW Open. The sport’s governing body accepted his excuse that the substance had been ingested inadvertently via a dietary supplement. He had run out during the Monte Carlo Masters in March and sent his mother to the pharmacy to buy more without realising the French version contained different chemicals. The ITF said a simple internet search would have alerted Cilic to the dangers and handed him a backdated ban accordingly. He appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport regardless and had his sentenced halved, resuming his place on the ATP circuit at October’s event in Paris. Soon after he turned to compatriot Goran Ivanisevic and employed him as his coach. The pair have known each other for 11 years and since their professional union Cilic has built his world ranking back up to the levels prior to his absence. He is the 26th seed here. Ivanisevic produced one of Wimbledon’s greatest moments by winning the men’s singles title in 2001 as a wildcard and appears to have added thrust to his charge’s game. Blip: The Croat was found to have a banned stimulant called nikethamide in his system at Munich¿s BMW Open . Cilic beat Tomas Berdych, the sixth seed, in straight sets as dark descended on Friday and Jeremy Chardy went the same way. ‘The main part that is coming from Goran to me and what I  feel in this relationship is big  confidence,’ said Cilic, understandably given Ivanisevic’s indomitable character. ‘Having him over here beside me is definitely another big plus. He’s been in the second week of Wimbledon many times, so of course I’m leaving up to him all the small details to give me some advice. Opponent: Cilic must now try and defeat the No 1 seed Djokovic on Wednesday . ‘Goran is different when he plays and when he’s off the court. When he’s coaching he’s very calm character and very positive.’ Cilic, who won Queen’s in 2012 and was beaten by Murray last year before his positive test came back, declined to say lessons had been learned from the episode but insisted personal protocols for taking supplements is ‘in a good part now’. He added: ‘For me, the most important part was that I found some mental toughness out of all of that. When I came back, it gave me more motivation to work and use every opportunity I have to be prepared for every tournament.’ ‘I used that time off as well for physical preparation. I was doing a lot. Now I am feeling very well.  I think my game is on a high level.’ Wisdom: Cilic believes his success is down to his new partnership with compatriot Goran Ivanisevic .","Marin Cilic is through to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a straight sets win against Jeremy Chardy .

"It took just four minutes for Marouane Fellaini to serve a reminder of his worth. Thrown on with an attacking remit during Belgium’s World Cup opener against Algeria, he rose inside the penalty area, twisting his awkward frame and using his bushy barnet to flick home the equalising goal in a 2-1 victory – it was classic Fellaini, a vintage not witnessed since his time at Everton. After 10 months without a goal for club or country, perhaps this was the turning point in his faltering career. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Fellaini: I want to be a Manchester United legend .

VIDEO Fellaini is terrific for Belgium - Kompany . One man, however, was not for turning. For Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal had already decided that Fellaini was not for him. The 26-year-old is available for transfer at Old Trafford, chief executive Ed Woodward having been instructed by the new Dutch manager to offload last summer’s £27.5million signing. It charts the sorry demise of a player . once feared by Premier League defences. And therein lies the . accelerating factor behind Fellaini’s failure. Dud: Marouane Fellaini struggled to make an impact following £27.5m move from Everton . Ruthless: Louis van Gaal has made it clear which players he wants when he takes charge at United . VIDEO Van Gaal will rebuild United - Yorke . For David Moyes – the man who took Fellaini with him to United and knew his merits more than anyone – never once deployed him as a second striker, the role in which he had excelled, inspired and intimidated for the Toffees. Instead, he was used as a holding midfielder, a position which exposed his shortcomings as a ball player, completely negating the effectiveness of his size, athleticism and hunger for goals. He was so poor in the Champions League quarter-final exit to Bayern Munich that one foreign newspaper refused to even rate his performance. Yet Fellaini never protested, seemingly content to drift through the campaign. Even when criticism became concentrated on the Belgian, Moyes refused to reposition his flop. The Scot’s stubbornness was staggering. Not so Champion: Fellaini was so poor in one game against Bayern Munich that a foreign newspaper refused to give him a rating . Indeed, there was an interesting exchange between former United defender Rio Ferdinand – not thought to have been a fan of Moyes – and BBC presenter Gary Lineker during coverage of Belgium’s second-round victory over USA. Ferdinand offered: ‘I think his (Fellaini) best position is off the frontman. At Everton we played against him numerous times. I saw him play against Chelsea, Man City, his best games in an Everton shirt were off the frontman. ‘He's difficult to play against. He gets that ball into him, he's awkward, he puts his arms everywhere, and that's where he's most effective for me.’ Lineker replied: ‘Hence why he didn't fit in at Manchester United because he never got the chance to play there?’ To which Ferdinand came back: ‘Well I think you play players in their best positions and I think his best games for Everton were up there, causing problems for centre halves.’ Fellaini has started each of Belgium’s three matches since his game-changing impact against Algeria. Like Moyes, however, Marc Wilmots has used him in a midfield berth and again he has struggled to exert any influence. But Van Gaal, it would appear, had determined Fellaini’s fate before the tournament began. Fellaini made just 16 starts for United and five more from the bench, failing to score in any of those. Moyes paid the price and was sacked. It is likely that Fellaini will follow him out of the door.","New boss Van Gaal has told United to sell midfielder .

"New Wimbledon hero Nick Kyrgios pulled off a sensational victory over Rafael Nadal on Tuesday night — pushed by the desire to prove his mother wrong. The 19-year-old Australian explained: ‘Last night (Monday) I noticed that my mum had said in an interview she thought Rafa was too good. It made me a bit angry and spurred me on.’ Kyrgios was given a raucous ovation by the Centre Court crowd after beating Spain’s stunned world No 1 Nadal 7-6, 5-7, 7-6, 6-3. Winner: Nick Kyrgios defeat World No 1 Rafael Nadal to earn a spot in the Wimbledon quarter-finals . Asked what message he was now going to send to his mother Noraila, who is Malaysian, he replied: ‘I will just text her a smiley face.’ The huge-serving Kyrgios has spent most of this year playing on the humble Challenger circuit, and his world ranking of 144 was so low that he needed a wildcard entry to get into these Championships. Yet now he is in the last eight and plays another big server in Canadian Milos Raonic for a place in the semi-finals. John McEnroe, three times men’s singles champion, said that he might even be ready to win Wimbledon now as bookmakers cut Kyrgios’ odds to 14-1. ‘We’ve been waiting for this for a while,’ McEnroe said in his commentary for the BBC. ‘We keep saying, “Who’s the next guy?” and I think we found that guy right now. That was absolutely stunning, to see what he did to the world No 1. How did he keep that up? ‘He actually had this feeling about him... that he absolutely believed he was going to win this match. He’s acting to me like he can win this tournament. Shock: Nadal was beaten 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 out on Centre Court . The last guy I saw like this is Boris Becker. No fear whatsoever — ""no matter what comes my way I’m going to be better than them”.’ Kyrgios said he did not want to stop at beating twice-champion Nadal. ‘It’s been the best week of my life,’ he added. ‘I’m not feeling pressure, just the motivation to keep going. ‘I’m a normal kid like any 19-year-old who likes to play on his Xbox. The big stage is something I thrive on. Beaten: Nadal said 'you are in trouble' if your opponent hits every ball like Kyrgios . 'At 5-3 in the fourth the crowd erupted and you think of all the hard work you’ve done, I love that feeling. I believe in myself. ‘My serve got me over the line.

"Swansea defender Ashley Williams has been told he is not for sale this summer. The 29-year-old, who is wanted by Sunderland among others, has a year remaining on his current deal and the Swans do not want to lose him. His representative, Jamie Moralee, told the South Wales Evening Post: 'At the moment, there have been some bids coming in. Swansea have rejected those because they think Ash is important - everyone's clear on that. Wanted man: Swansea defender Ashley Williams (left) is a summer transfer target for Sunderland . On the move? Williams, pictured here in action against Everton, has just a year left on his Swans contract . 'Swansea are very clear that Ashley is not for sale. Whatever offer comes in, he is not going to be sold. 'That's the option they've got and we're comfortable with that. We respect that because he's their player, he's under contract.' Moralee admitted Swansea could cash in on Williams now or allow him to leave the Liberty Stadium for nothing in a year's time, but indicated that an extended stay at the Liberty Stadium is his preferred option. He added: 'If Ashley signs another contract at Swansea, he will probably end his career there. I'd like to think we can reach an agreement because that is Ash's preferred option."" Sunderland have registered their interest in Williams, to date with little encouragement from his current employers, but Moralee believes the Black Cats will not allow the matter to rest. Planning: Sunderland boss Gus Poyet is hoping to strengthen his defence before the start of next season . He said: 'Sunderland have made it clear that they will just keep bidding and bidding. They want the player and I understand that. 'Sunderland are trying to get their business done early, while others prefer to wait. It's too early for a big decision, but the transfer window has only just opened. Hopefully things will move along in the next week or so.'","Swansea manager Garry Monk wants to keep Williams .

"Under-fire Sepp Blatter has provoked yet more ridicule after dancing on stage at a FIFA event on Monday night. The 78-year-old was more David Brent than John Travolta as he, rather embarrassingly, shook his hips alongside Brazilian sultress Fernanda Lima. But the model is unlikely to be have been overwhelmed by Blatter's moves which is sure to have left her and the audience cringing. Eyes on the prize: FIFA president Sepp Blatter on stage alongside Brazilian model Fernanda Lima on Tuesday . Blatter sparked fresh controversy on Monday when he claimed allegations of corruption around the Qatar victory to host the 2022 World Cup was being driven by the ‘racism and discrimination’ of the ‘British media’. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said he found the remarks ‘completely unacceptable’ and stood up to the FIFA president in an auditorium at the city’s Renaissance Hotel. ‘The only reason I did it was because of what Mr Blatter said yesterday, which I found, as I’m sure many of you found, offensive,’ he said. Tough crowd: Blatter and Linda Barras attend the Opening Ceremony of the 64th FIFA Congress . Dyke shared his response to Blatter with the media. ‘I said: “Could I say that I regard the comments you made yesterday about the allegations in the British media in which you described them as racist as totally unacceptable. I have read the articles in the Sunday Times in great detail, and the allegations being made have nothing to do with racism. They are allegations about corruption within FIFA. ‘These allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered. We need to know from Mr Garcia (Michael Garcia, the independent FIFA investigator) tomorrow if he was aware of the material in the Sunday Times before it was published and, if not, whether he will now extend his investigation to consider these allegations. Mr Blatter, many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these allegations. It’s time for FIFA to stop attacking the messenger and instead consider and understand the message.’ Opposition:  Blatter addresses the room during a meeting of UEFA federations in Sao Paulo . Fury: Both FA chairman Greg Dyke and England's UEFA vice-president David Gill are unhappy with Blatter . Dyke said Blatter did not react as he stood at a lectern on the stage. ‘He said it would be addressed tomorrow in FIFA Congress,’ said Dyke. David Gill, the former Manchester United chief executive and current member of the UEFA executive committee, echoed Dyke in a press conference after the European governing body’s meeting had finished. When Dyke was asked if Blatter should now stand for re-election next year, he replied: ‘Dave Gill has real concerns.‘Obviously there would have to be a decision made by the FA board but I think that we all accept that four years ago he (Blatter) said he was only standing for one more term. ‘We were asked at a meeting fairly recently and our view was that among the British public there wasn’t any doubt that brand FIFA is severely damaged. And I suspect that’s the same throughout large parts of Europe. ‘I suspect there is a view within the FA that we would support that position (that Blatter should stand down) but we will decide that at the board, which is the proper place.’","Blatter danced alongside Brazilian model Fernanda Lima on Monday night .

"Robin Van Persie has given Louis Van Gaal cause for concern after going off with a grimace at half-time of Netherlands’ friendly with Wales in Amsterdam. Early suggestions were that the Manchester United striker had picked up a slight groin injury but whatever the extent it is a worry for the Dutch manager so close to the World Cup starting. Van Gaal spoke before this game about Van Persie’s fitness and stated he was ‘not 100 per cent’ after missing six weeks towards the end of last season through a knee injury. Decisive: Arjen Robben scored one and made one for Holland in their win against Wales . Number one: Robben celebrates after giving Holland a first-half lead against Wales in Amsterdam . Positive: Lens showed that Holland do have some strength in reserve with a cool finish against Wales . Team player: Robben then takes the plaudits after setting up a goal for substitute Jeremain Lens . Any further troubles will throw Van Gaal’s plans for Holland’s opening group game against Spain on June 13 into doubt. Holland: Cillessen 6.5; Janmaat 6.5, Vlaar 6.5, de Vrij 7.5, . Martins Indi 6.5; Fer 6 (Wijnaldum 46’ 6), de Jong 7 (Huntelaar 78’ 6), . Sneijder 7.5, Blind 6.5; Van Persie 6.5 (Lens 46’), Robben 8 . Louis Van Gaal 7 . Wales: Hennessey 6.5; Gunter 6, Gabbidon 6.5, Chester 6, Taylor . 6 (Dummett 83’); Allen 7.5, Ledley 6.5 (Huws 62’ 6); J Williams 7 (G Williams . 70’ 6), King 6.5 (Vaughan 78’ 6), Robson-Kanu 6.5 (John 70’ 6); Church 6.5 . (Easter 66’ 6) Chris Coleman 6.5 . Referee: Bulent Yildirim 7 . MOTM: Robben . Van . Persie’s importance to his country was illustrated by the way their . attack became blunted in the second half, although his replacement . Jeremain Lens did score a tap-in with 14 minutes to go to make the final . score 2-0. Arjen Robben had scored the opener in the first half by converting a rebound from a Van Persie shot. Wales . manager Chris Coleman will be warmed by the way his team, without . Gareth Bale, Aaron Ramsey and Ashley Williams, tested the hosts at times . and could have given their travelling something to cheer had a couple . of openings been finished more accurately. Much . was made in the build-up to this game of Van Gaal’s decision to switch . to a 5-3-2 system from Holland’s usual 4-3-3. He trialled it in their . previous friendly against Ghana last Saturday prompting Bert van . Marwijk, the man who led his nation to the World Cup final four years . ago, to question the wisdom of changing tactics so close to the . tournament starting. There . might be more sniping to come given Van Gaal sprung a surprise by opting . for a 4-4-2 diamond formation here. More strings to the Oranje bow or . too much tinkering? Wesley . Sneijder operated at the front of a midfield four behind Van Persie and . Robben and with that trio on song, as was the case from kick-off, their . positioning shouldn’t matter. Say cheese: Louis van Gaal is grabbed for a selfie with a Holland fan before the game . Time's up: Holland captain Robin van Persie was taken off at half-time . Assist: Van Persie's first-half shot was parried into the path of Robben who opened the scoring . Impact: Jeremain Lens replaced Van Persie at half-time and scored Holland's second goal . Within . two minutes Daryl Janmaat dispossessed Neil Taylor and fed Robben who . lashed over, then 60 seconds later Van Persie fashioned space and forced . Wayne Hennessey into a good save. In . the ninth minute Robben fooled debutant James Chester with a run in . behind to break the offside trap and when Stefan de Vrij’s lofted ball . found him a goal looked certain. But the Bayern Munich player dragged . his shot wide. It was . whirlwind stuff yet this Welsh side, even shorn of its stars, can play a . bit and gradually the visitors found a foothold in the game. Joe . Allen, captaining his country for the first time, was breaking forward . with the ball and executing sharp passes. Jonny Williams began finding . joy on the right hand side. Then . in the 20th minute Taylor released striker Simon Church down the left . flank and his cross would have led to a tap-in for Andy King had Bruno . Martins Indi not stretched to nick clear. It was a spell that will . encourage Coleman for forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers. Van . Gaal’s team came again though. Robben played a one-two with Sneijder . then jinked past Danny Gabbidon only to continue tip-toeing too long so . when he fired his shot Chester was able to clear off the line. In . the 32nd minute he did not wait to pull the trigger. Van Persie beat . Chris Gunter on the left and cracked a shot that Hennessey could only . divert into the path of Robben who struck instantly. Van . Persie could have made it two soon after but he sliced his effort just . wide after being teed up by Daley Blind. It was to be the last act in . his game, replaced at half-time by Lens with cameras picking up a wince . that will make Dutch fans do just the same. The . Dynamo Kiev forward did add gloss to Holland’s win by slotting in at . the far post after a perfect cross from Robben, released by Sneijder, . but it is clear any absence of Van Persie will cast a huge shadow. Bum note: Wales player Hal Robson-Kanu changes his shorts at pitchside during the game . Support: Kevin Strootman, who will miss the World Cup through injury, was in the crowd to cheer Holland on . Have a word: Van Gaal talks to his assistant Patrick Kluivert ahead of kick-off . Stellar: Holland named a strong side including Robben, Van Persie, Sneijder and De Jong .

"If England need any encouragement ahead of what looks like a decisive Group D clash against Uruguay in Sao Paulo on Thursday then they really need only look at Saturday’s match tape from the Estadio Castelao. For a team ranked seventh on the FIFA list ahead of this World Cup, Uruguay were feeble in losing against unfancied Costa Rica. Even their rather grumpy coach Oscar Tabarez admitted he was concerned about the way they had played and, in particular, their defending. ‘We didn’t expect this to happen, conceding goals in situations where we hadn’t before,’ said Tabarez. ‘We started leaving space and they benefited from the space; they took over. Grim viewing: Oscar Tabarez watches Maxi Pereira leaving the pitch after his late dismissal . Surprise: Costa Rica's shock win 3-1 over Uruguay has totally opened up Group D . Joy: Costa Rica's Oscar Duarte celebrates scoring their second against Uruguay . ‘The goals . are the visible result of a whole series of things that came before. As . the coach I am ultimately responsible, but there is a disappointment . when you concede goals like that. ‘We have to improve against England, recover ground we have lost.’ Despite scoring the game’s first goal, Uruguay lost control of the midfield in the second half and never got it back. Costa . Rica were able to break on the South Americans with ease and Uruguay’s . cause was not helped by some rather lamentable attempts to defend . set-pieces. Roy Hodgson and his staff will have noted this like the rest . of us and it’s inconceivable that Steven Gerrard will not spend some . time on his dead-ball deliveries this week. Uruguay . have issues with discipline, too. They lost defender Maxi Pereira to . the World Cup’s first red card deep in stoppage-time when the game was . lost. It was an ugly swipe at the ankles of young Arsenal forward Joel . Campbell and was indicative of Uruguay’s darkening mood. Finish: Despite their shock win Costa Rica must stay grounded if they want to progress, says Jorge Pinto . Nervy: Uruguay's Luis Suarez looks on from the bench as his side succumb to an opening match defeat . The . talking point ahead of the England game, of course, will be the fitness . of Liverpool’s Luis  Suarez. Without him they really are half the team . they can be. Former Manchester United  forward Diego Forlan remains a . willing worker but  limitations remain in his game. Despite . Tabarez’s claims on Saturday, Suarez is still not fully fit. It would . be an enormous  surprise, though, if he does not replace Forlan in Sao . Paulo, a game his country really must win. As . for Costa Rica, they will move forward with real hope now. Unlike . Saturday’s opponents they benefit from a genuine sense of unity and in . 21-year-old Campbell they have a striker with a real point to prove. Loaned out to Spain and Greece by Arsene Wenger, he will return to . Arsenal after this tournament. Costa . Rica assistant coach Paulo Wanchope said: ‘He really wants to go back . to Arsenal and play and I told him that the only way to do that is on . the pitch. He did well today and I think that he needs to perform even . better against Italy and then England to have that chance to go back to . Arsenal.’","For a team ranked seventh on the FIFA list ahead of this World Cup Uruguay were feeble in their defeat to Costa Rica .

"Wayne Rooney claims former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo is motivated solely by personal glory as the pair prepare for the start of the World Cup. Rooney claimed Ronaldo is obsessed with his own achievements. Ronaldo ripped off his Real Madrid shirt and posed for the cameras after scoring in the Champions League final victory last month. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney on England and Ronaldo star for Portugal against Ireland . Relaxed: Wayne Rooney says he is more concerned about the team than individual accolades . Star man: Cristiano Ronaldo takes a shot in Portugal's 5-1 win over the Republic of Ireland . Rooney, who played with Ronaldo between 2004 and 2009, said: ‘I’m not a player who needs a legacy – like Cristiano, he has to have that. I’m more about winning as a team. He wants to have his moments. I’ve won player of the year, it’s nowhere near as good as winning a trophy with United.’ Meanwhile, Rooney is convinced that there is nothing to fear from Juventus pairing Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, who England will face in their World Cup opener in Manaus. ‘If I’m being honest, when you play a high tempo they have struggled,’ he added. ‘The Italian league is nowhere near the tempo of the Premier League. Even when we played AC Milan, with Nesta and Maldini as centre halves, they really struggled when we played a high tempo. If we can do that we can give them problems.’ Previous: Ronaldo gives then Manchester United team-mate Rooney some stick after his sending off in Euro 2006 . Public enemy No 1: Ronaldo winks at a team-mate after Rooney's marching orders . Rooney has convinced himself that this England team is better than the ‘golden generation’ who reached the quarter-final in 2006 or the decrepit 2010 team beaten 4-1 by Germany in Bloemfontein. ‘The Italian players should be looking at us and how they can control our team,’ he added. ‘We’re not really too focused on Pirlo. ‘He has been a fantastic player and Italy have some great players, but so have we. ‘They should be more worried about our team. It is exciting and the young players bring a lot of energy and excitement. You can see with Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling that there’s no fear with them. They’ll be good players, big players for us. ‘This is probably the best squad of players I’ve been involved with since I’ve been with England.’ The centre of attention: Ronaldo poses after scoring a penalty in the Champions League final . Touching down: Ronaldo and his team-mates arrived in Sao Paulo on Wednesday . Rooney has done so much in his career, winning five Premier League titles and the Champions League with Manchester United. Incredibly, he has yet to score at a World Cup. ‘If you look at my record in the World Cup qualifiers I had a pretty good record (seven goals). ‘That’s what I have to do at the World Cup. I want to score goals and help England be successful, but I honestly feel better than I have done for years. ‘I’m ready for this tournament and I know if I play my game I will do well.’ Stern test: Italy are a tough team, but they should be worried about England too, Rooney says . Defensive rock? Italy's Mario Balotelli (left) challenges Giorgio Chiellini during a training session . Doing well here means supplying goals and scoring them as England negotiate a tricky group involving Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Although Rooney is yet to get off the mark at a World Cup, he is one goal behind equalling Michael Owen (40 goals) and 10 behind the great Sir Bobby Charlton in an England shirt. ‘At my age I should break the record, but I just want to keep playing and trying to score. If I can get to Sir Bobby’s record it would be a massive achievement and I would be absolutely delighted.’ When he gets there, everyone will have a view on it.","Wayne Rooney claims former team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo is obsessed with his own achievements .

"Spain coach Vicente del Bosque is considering making changes to his line-up for Wednesday's World Cup Group B game against Chile after analysing the 5-1 humiliation at the hands of Holland. The defending champions head to the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro needing not only a win but also a vastly-improved performance after being torn apart by the Dutch. Del Bosque has now taken the time to study that defeat and admits he may switch some players around, although he refused to play the blame game. Scroll down for video... Tinkerman: Spain coach has hinted that he could make changes for the game against Chile . 'There may be some changes,' Del Bosque said. 'However, we don't want to rush into things. 'If I made a change, it wouldn't be to point the finger at someone. 'This is a short tournament and we would look to find the best solution.' Del Bosque is reluctant, however, to replace goalkeeper Iker Casillas despite his woeful display against the Dutch, which the national team captain described as the worst game of his career. 'As always Casillas has given proof of his captaincy and his commitment to the national team,' Del Bosque said. 'I remember when I came back to the changing room after the press conference, he was talking to his team-mates, acting as a captain.' Spain have faced criticism for bringing some players that were in the World Cup-winning side of 2010, with many not having been in top form in the 2013-14 campaign. Three Barcelona players in particular have been called into question: Gerard Pique, Xabi Hernandez and Jordi Alba. Flying Dutchman: Robin van Persie scored Holland's opening goal in their 5-1 destruction of Spain . However, Del Bosque insists that everyone who has travelled to Brazil deserved to do so. 'We have brought 16 of our 23 players that are world champions,' he said. 'They have taken part in qualifying and have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League and done well in La Liga. 'We have brought them because we are convinced that they are the best, even if others may have a different opinion. 'We do have seven new players.' All of the coaches that have so far tasted defeat in their World Cup openers have stressed the need to look forward and not to dwell on the result. Worried much? Iker Casillas has been heavily criticised for his performance against the Dutch . Yet the way Spain collapsed against the Dutch will not be forgotten any time soon by anyone connected to the squad. We knew Holland were going to be a permanent danger and we weren't able to stop them,"" Del Bosque said. 'We are badly accustomed to always having the result in our favour. We have to be prepared to face adversity but it's not easy. Against Holland we got a painful punishment. We are sportsmen and we have no choice but to lift ourselves up. We have to fight in the next game which is our aim. We need to accept defeat with patience and tranquillity. 'This is what I've tried to transmit to the team.' Make or break: Spain need to get a result in their next Group B game against Alexis Sanchez's Chile . Del Bosque's team defeated Chile 2-1 in the group stages of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, having lost their opener against Switzerland 1-0. The difference this time, however, is that Spain are coming off their worst ever result in the competition. 'We have enough experience,' Del Bosque said, 'and we have to combat their way of playing because Chile are a team that puts a lot of dangerous pressure.'","Spain coach Vicente del Bosque has hinted at making changes .

"Hours after signing for Chelsea, Cesc Fabregas was back down to World Cup business with Spain as they trained ahead of their game against Holland on Friday. Fabregas left Barcelona in a £30million move which will net him £150,000 a week but before he begins life in West London he has the small matter of a World Cup to defend.

In fact he talked up their chances of getting better with stars continuing to emerge from the Under-21 set-up all the time. He . said: 'The World Cup starts now. If we can concentrate throughout 21 . days then hopefully we will live up to the standards required of a world . champion. 'I won't reveal tomorrow's line-up. We will use the players who we think are the best - but we do have 23 very good players. 'I . don't think this is a team of veterans, I'd say we're mature. We're . simply not afraid of anything and that's not just because of our past . successes. 'I'm not worried about the future either. Looking at the Under-21 team I think we can have high expectations. 'Holland have changed a lot over the last four years, but we have not. 'Holland have a great school of football and have always had good World Cups. They are worthy rivals. 'I hold (coach Louis) Van Gaal in high esteem and I'm sure he's prepared well for the game.'

'We arrived here with a lot of enthusiasm even though we know the group will be very difficult,' he said. 'Starting off against the previous runners-up is not easy. 'But . we got here by remaining faithful to our style and so it will continue. Hopefully our style of play will bring us more success.""

The . pair played together at Real Madrid for three years and were most . recently pitted against each other as the Spaniards met Bayern in the . semi-finals of the Champions League. 'Robben . is a great winger,' Casillas said. 'I've known him since we were . team-mates and I've come up against him several times since. He's great.

"All eyes were on Lionel Messi, and here is his heat map . It was only 65 minutes in, but it had seemed an age. Nothing was going right. Free-kicks flew wastefully into orbit; darting runs were extinguished almost at inception; passes were snuffled up by the blue meanies of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Maracana stadium, an Argentinian enclave in Rio de Janeiro for the night, yearned for their little master to assume his rightful place as the true star of this World Cup, but it was not his night.

Messi with a monkey on his back is no Messi at all. Messi, . liberated from pressure by a goal in his opening game, may now elevate . this World Cup to a higher plane. It . was a beautiful passing advance, triangles working their way through . the deep Bosnian midfield, before the ball found Messi, as it so often . does for that is his genius, and he played an neat one-two with . substitute Gonzalo Higuain. Receiving the ball once more he ran from . right to left with such nimble feet that two Bosnian guards, Ermin . Bicakcic and Muhamed Besic, collided in his wake. Now with clear sight . of goal, he checked the position of goalkeeper Asmir Begovic and finished . perfectly, the ball coming off the inside of a post, so exceptionally . was it judged. And that is . what the greats do. Until then, it wasn’t his game. And then he made it . so. Until then, Bosnia looked more than capable of earning a point – an . 85th minute goal by Vedad Ibisevic confirmed the threat – and then it . was out of their reach. Messi had made it his night after all. From . here, the tournament begins – particularly if Cristiano Ronaldo decides . to match him for Portugal on Monday, as he so often does when similarly . challenged in Spain. Messi . was announced as man of the match at the end, a FIFA award he will . recognise as nonsense. If anything, the best players were the half-time . substitutes Fernando Gago and Higuain, whose introduction changed . Argentina’s formation and the course of the game.

It was the humble Gago’s . involvement that helped Messi rise above this. We should all be very . grateful.

Unfortunately, it is not just well-meaning amateurs and Wayne Rooney . that can lose their way by trying too hard, and Messi fell victim to a . very human flaw. He wanted it too much – the stage, the moment, the roar . that would greet one of those scuttling, scintillating runs, when the . ball appears to be tied to his foot by a strand of elastic and defenders . circle like so many crazed ants whose nest has been disturbed by the . sole of a sandal. Hacked down: Edin Dzeko (centre) is fouled from behind by Federico Fernandez . Flying out: Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero punches the ball away from Izet Hajrovic . Messi . reached for fabulousness time and again, but without luck or joy. Bosnia-Herzegovina have been well drilled by coach Safet Susic and . whenever Messi got possession he was immediately detailed by two, . sometimes three, blue shirts, obstructing his path, snapping at his . heels, as eager to destroy as he was to create. Not that Bosnia played a . negative game, far from it. They were just not so daft that Messi was . allowed to dominate the way his sponsors would have wished – the way his . life is portrayed in commercial breaks when impossible is nothing and . wizardry is real. What was . real in the Maracana was an opposition that had not fought its way to . Brazil to be anybody’s support act on their debut. Bosnia-Herzegovina . are the fifth of the former Yugoslav states to make it to a World Cup . – if one includes Montenegro as part of Serbia in 1998 and 2006 – and . the pride of the team and its fans was obvious. They suffered the most . horrid start, but recovered, and those who feared they might be . embarrassed here were quickly dissuaded of such negativity. A lesser . team could have gone under after the bad luck that befell them three . minutes in, but they regrouped and came at Argentina with impressive . ambition. Doubling up: Messi tries to escape the attentions of Senad Lulic (right) and Kolasinac . Trebling up! Messi (second left) has Muhamed Besic (left), Emir Spahic (centre) and Kolasinac for company . Pushing him out: Messi takes the ball as Kolasinac tries to get close to him . Blocked off: Messi (centre) is stopped by the intervention of  Senad Lulic (right) First the bad . news. Argentina won a free-kick 40 yards out to the left of goal, which . Messi whipped in dangerously. Giant full back Marcos Rojo rose and . headed it on, striking Sead Kolasinac on the boot for an unknowing . diversion past goalkeeper Begovic. It could easily have been a prelude . to a humbling World Cup debut, but Bosnia are made of stronger stuff. From there, Sergio Romero in Argentina’s goal, received a thorough . workout. Miralem Pjanic of . Roma was pulling the strings in the centre of midfield and it was his . ball in the 14th minute that showed Bosnia were in no mood to accept . defeat. It dropped over Argentina’s high line defence and was gobbled up . by midfielder Izet Hajrovic. Fortunately for Argentina, Romero was . alive to the threat and he dashed from his line to save. Human shield: Edin Dzeko keeps the ball from Argentina defender Hugo Campagnaro . Stretching a point: Bosnia midfielder Izet Hajrovic attempts to control the ball . Getting stuck in: Maxi Rodriguez (left) thunders into a challenge with Bosnia's Muhamed Besic . Pjanic’s . set-pieces were proving as dangerous as his passes, and four minutes . before half-time he picked out Senad Lulic with a fine inswinging . corner, the resulting header forcing another excellent save from Romero. Ibisevic’s late goal was no more than they deserved, even though Romero . was weak for it. Perhaps it was for the best. Bosnia can build from . here, and look potential qualifiers, Messi is free to take his . sun-blessed talents deeper into the tournament. He may return here on . July 13.

"Tim Cahill's super-strike has been hailed for its brilliant technique that left fans around the world purring and showed that there is nothing better than a sweetly struck volley. But did it rank among the best volleyed efforts of all-time? Sportsmail looks back on the best volleyed goals that rival Cahill's in a list of football's greatest volleys. Crash, bang, wallop: Cahill showed there's nothing better than a sweetly struck volleyed goal . Brazil-liant: But where does Cahill's goal rank among the all-time greatest volleyed strikes? 1 Marco van Basten: Holland v Russia, June 1988 (European Championship final) The enormity of the occasion and the tightness of the angle mean Van Basten's iconic effort might never be beaten. Waiting for the ball to drop over his shoulder, where most would have panicked the Dutchman produced a moment of magic, hooking the ball back across the 'keeper and into the net. Simply the best: Van Basten's goal had everything - an outrageous piece of skill on a huge occasion . 2 Zinedine Zidane: Real Madrid v Bayer Leverkusen, May 2002 (Champions League final) Again, the sense of occasion helps, and in club football they don't come any bigger than the Champions League final - but this was genius from Zizou. With a pretty average high ball dropping in the penalty area the Frenchman's thinking was - as usual - one step ahead of the rest. Swinging his left boot at a right-angle he made an almost impossible shot look easy. Classic: Zidane's goal decided the Champions League final at Hampden Park in Glasgow, 2002 . 3 Tony Yeboah: Leeds v Liverpool, August 1995 (Premier League) Everyone knows that any goal that goes in off the crossbar looks twice as good as one that doesn't - and Yeboah's stunning shot was already looking good before it hit the woodwork. Despite leaning back just to control the strike the Ghanian controlled his effort to send it flying past a despairing David James. Hero: Yeboah was a Leeds icon - not least for his brilliant goal against Liverpool at Elland Road . 4 Paolo Di Canio: West Ham v Wimbledon, March 2000 (Premier League) A brilliant and memorable effort from the mad Italian's playing days as he pulled off the perfect scissor-kick to score for West Ham. Made even better by Di Canio's fairly casual celebration despite the ludicrous goal he has just scored - maybe he wanted to see a replay? Brilliant: Di Canio's stunning scissor kick set up West Ham for a 2-1 win over Wimbledon at Upton Park . 5 Ronnie Whelan: Republic of Ireland v Russia, June 1988 (European Championship group stage) Whelan's goal is almost forgotten about at times, coming in the same tournament as Van Basten's best efforts, but it shouldn't be. The former Liverpool captain's left-footed volley flew into the top corner from a long throw-in in a move that most wouldn't have even bothered attempting from the edge of the area. Brilliant. Delight: Whelan celebrates his wondergoal that left his Irish team-mates ecstatic . 6 Robin van Persie: Charlton v Arsenal, 2006 (Premier League) Van Persie loves a spectacular goal and this was no different - running onto the ball on the edge of the penalty area he somehow maneuvered his body to slam home this volley. Never forgotten: Van Persie celebrates his volleyed effort for former club Arsenal against Charlton . 7 Jeremy Goss: Norwich City v Bayern Munich, October 1993 (UEFA Cup) One of the biggest nights in Norwich City's history and they came to call on a man who had a habit of scoring big goals - Jeremy Goss reacted fastest to a loose ball on the edge of the area and cannoned his shot past the 'keeper. Local hero: Goss scored for Norwich in Bayern Munich's first home loss to an English club . 8 Nayim: Real Zaragoza v Arsenal, May 1995 (European Cup Winners Cup final) 'Nayim - from the half-way line' was a taunt that followed Arsenal for years after this dramatic effort. A bit of a 'hit and hope' effort but the dramatic nature of the goal - coming in the closing minutes of extra-time to win a European final - and the fact that it came from a full 45 yards out, has to rank it among the best. Helpless: Nayim's brilliant last-minute effort gave David Seaman no chance in the Arsenal goal . 9 Tim Cahill: Australia v Holland, 2014 (World Cup group stage) It takes something special to pull out a move like this on the biggest stage of them all - particularly for the lowest ranked team in the tournament. Cahill brilliantly controlled and finished a routine ball across the penalty area all in one vicious swipe of his left boot. Pick that one out: Cahill recorded probably the best goal of the tournament so far in Porto Alegre . 10 David Platt: England v Belgium, June 1990 (World Cup round of 16) Platt's swivel to strike home a brilliant moment was one of England's most important goals - saving a nation from more dreaded penalties. The midfielder showed brilliant technique to secure England a place in the last eight - what would the Three Lions give for a moment like this in Brazil? Flying high: Platt celebrates his brilliant goal to guide England past Belgium after extra time .","Cahill scored a wondergoal as Australia went down 3-2 to Holland .

The 22-year-old, with Juan Cuadrado and Carlos Bacca, announce on a vine that 'we're going to scare (little Armero)', before jumping out on him from behind the curtain and frightening the life out of him. The South American side, who are playing in their first World cup for 16 years, have set the tournament alight, and if they can stay this relaxed, then they may have a real chance of going all the way.","James Rodriguez and Colombia team-mates play a prank on Pablo Armero .

"Adventurer Nick Hancock headed out into the Atlantic today  to begin his second bid to live for two months on Britain's loneliest outpost, Rockall. His last attempt to break the record for living alone on the tiny, remote rock in the Outer Hebrides ended before it even began at the end of May last year. Heavy seas stopped him leaving his boat and he was forced to make the 15-hour return trip to Leverburgh on nearby Harris. Not particularly inviting: Rockall in the North Atlantic is an isolated pinnacle which only four people have ever managed to sleep on . Ready: Nick Hancock left for Rockall today . But now the Chartered surveyor and former Officer Training Corps cadet is to try again by landing on the rock tomorrow, weather permitting. On Twitter Hancock announced: 'We're heading to #Rockall today!' before loading his equipment on to the chartered Kilda Cruises boat at Leverburgh on Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Hancock, 38, from Ratho near Edinburgh, is raising money for the charity Help for Heroes, and plans to make regular broadcasts for TV and social media from Rockall. Hancock has been practising load winching to ensure he gets his survival pod - created from an 8ft yellow water tank and powered by a small wind turbine and solar panels for charging his satellite communications - up on to Rockall. 'The only real physical side is the initial climb and hauling the pod and equipment up,' he says. The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11ft by 4ft, and is 13ft below the summit. The 'rockpod' footprint will leave accessible only the flattish platform on the summit for Mr Hancock to scramble up to for exercise. Last year Hancock set off for Rockall, an eroded volcano, which lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides with the intention of spending 60 days on the remote sea rock, which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high. He had taken all food and water with him and planned to live in a 23 stone shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record. But when he arrived, the swell around the rock made it impossible for him to safely scramble on.He also admitted his wife Pamela did not want him to go. The couple have a two-year-old son Freddie. Survival pod: Hancock's bright yellow pod, made from a 8ft water tank will be his home during his isolation . Greenpeace activists were the last to occupy Rockall in 1997 in protest at plans to expand oil exploration . Hancock, who in 2012 stayed for a short while on Rockall as part of a reconnaissance mission for last year's mission, had aimed to set two endurance records on the isolated islet and raise £10,000 for the Help for Heroes charity. Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than Rockall itself. Being in such an isolated location, only four people have ever slept there, and less than 100 have landed on it. The first record for time spent on Rockall was 40 days in 1985, when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived on the rock from 26 May to 4 July to affirm Britain's claim to the islet, which has been disputed by Ireland, Iceland and Denmark. His record was broken in 1997 by three Greenpeace activists who stayed there for 42 days in protest at north Atlantic oil exploration.","Only four people have ever managed to spend a night on the rock, which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high .

"A metro strike in Brazil's biggest city has entered its fifth day with union . leaders threatening to . shut down the subway line serving the stadium hosting the tournament's . first World Cup game on Thursday. Workers in Sao Paulo voted to remain on strike for an indefinite period despite the fact that a court has ruled the strike illegal. It comes as the country's former president advised football fans to get to World Cup matches 'on foot, barefoot, by bike, by donkey'. Angry dispute: Strikers clash with police at the Ana Rosa metro station in Sao Paulo . Disruption: Public transportation workers line up on the subway tracks at the Corinthians Itaquera station . Metro stations in Sao Paulo have been closed since Thursday, causing huge traffic jams in the city. The city's Regional Labor Court yesterday said that unions had broken strike rules by not providing a minimum level of service; at least 70 per cent of trains during the day and 100 per cent during the morning and evening rush hours. The court . met over the weekend because of concerns about the strike's effect on . the World Cup, which Brazil's leaders had hoped would be a chance for . Latin America's biggest and richest country to shine on the . international stage. It ordered the unions to pay fines of 100,000 reais per day (£25,000) for the first . four days of strike and 500,000 reais (£130,000) per day from today. Unrest: Subway workers in Sao Paulo have taken their strike into a fifth day . Getting ready for kick off: Brazil fans cheer while gathered outside Itaquerao stadium . Union leaders angered by the decision refused to pay the fines and warned that the strikers would try to shut down the subway line serving the stadium hosting the tournament's first game on Thursday. 'The government is declaring a war against its workers,' said Alex Fernandes, the union's general secretary. 'They sit down to talk to us or there won't be subway service during the World Cup.' Meanwhile, in a recent . interview, the country's former president advised fans to get to World . Cup games ‘on foot, barefoot, by bike, by donkey’. Luiz . Inácio Lula da Silva, who helped Brazil get awarded the tournament, . dismissed questions about the lack of metro service to stadiums and . problems with other infrastructure that has fallen far short of early . promises. ‘We never had problems walking,' Lula said, suggesting spectators go to games ""on foot, barefoot, by bike, by donkey.’ Closed: Security officers talk to commuters at the Corinthians Itaquera station . Party atmosphere: A Brazil fan dresses up for the opening ceremony rehearsals at the Itaquerao stadium . Authorities in Sao Paulo . have been able to provide limited subway service, but the strike has . resulted in traffic chaos clogging key streets and has closed the main . subway stations in the city. If . the walkout continued until Thursday, it would be difficult, if not . impossible, for many fans to get to Itaquerao stadium for the opening . match featuring Brazil and Croatia. Brazil . will play Croatia in the newly-built stadium, also known as Arena . Corinthians, which is about 12 miles (20 kilometres) east of the city . centre. Sunday was the fourth day of the strike, and it closed more than 30 subway stops. World Cup visitors arriving in the city have run into more traffic jams than usual in a city already used to heavy congestion. 'There was no minimum care for the population, causing great disturbance, even in terms of public safety,"" said judge Rafael Pugliese, who was on the panel that imposed the fine. Vital link: People fill the Corinthians Itaquera station where the opening game will take place . Bad timing: A passenger stands at the closed Belem metro station where a sign hangs that reads in Portuguese 'Strike' The . strikers are demanding an increase of more than 12 per cent, but the Sao . Paulo state-owned company that runs the system says that isn't possible . because fares haven't gone up the past two years. The workers have so far been offered 8.7 per cent and the court in Sao Paulo agreed with this offer. Sao Paulo’s governor Geraldo Alckmin said he would dismiss employees who did not come to work today. The president of the metro workers’ union, Altino Prazeres, told O Globo newspaper: ‘It is not our intention . to continue the strike into the World Cup. Our intention is to solve . the problem. But that should be the government's aim too.’ Police officers, teachers and public transportation workers have staged strikes in the weeks leading up to soccer's premier event. The strikes have overshadowed protests over the cost of putting on the World Cup, which had been feared for possible disruptions following last year's huge anti-government demonstrations during the Confederations Cup soccer tournament.","Sao Paulo court ruled the strike illegal and ordered unions to pay fines .

"Flying enthusiasts are being offered the chance to buy the trip of a lifetime – alongside one of the only two airworthy Lancaster Bombers in the world today. Costing £2,150 per seat, a 10-seater Piper Chieftain will be powering in the sky with the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum’s legendary aircraft. The Lancaster will be in the UK, flying from Canada to England, for four days, arriving on August 8, making the 18-hour trip for the first and final time. Amazing experience: Enthusiasts have the chance to fly alongside the Lancaster bomber in August . Final flight: The Lancaster will be making the journey from Canada to London for the last time . It is the only time the plane, which will be teaming up with the Battle of Britain Memorial Lancaster while in the UK, has been in a suitable condition to make the flight since the Sixties. It will be the first time the world's last two airworthy Lancaster bombers have flown together. Kent-based company Action Stations is selling the flights on board four Piper Chieftains over five days, on which there are 130 seats available. The price includes a 40-minute flight, flying alongside the 69ft-long Lancaster – with a wingspan of 102ft - for about 30 minutes, as well as a tour of the plane and a photo opportunity. During the flight, the Avro Lancaster Mk X - dedicated to Andrew Mynarski, the last Canadian airman to be awarded the VC in World War II – will move from side of the observation aircraft to the other. Stephen Burt, CEO of Action Stations, said: ‘To see such a large, historic aircraft flying so close you can wave to the pilot will be a deeply moving experience. 'Waving distance': Passengers will flying on board Action Stations' Piper Chieftains . Flight with a view: The Lancaster will be flying at below 10,000ft as the cabin isn't pressurised . ‘Over 55,000 aircrew lost their lives flying similar machines during the Second World War, and the poignancy of the occasion will not be lost.’ The Piper Chieftains will leave from Humberside, where the Lancaster will be based, down to Lincoln Cathedral. The building in the Lincolnshire countryside would have been one of the last views bomber crews had of England before embarking on their mission. The planes will then fly out towards the North Sea, and over The Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Museum, home of the Avo Lancaster Just Jane – giving those on board the chance to photograph the two bombers together. After that, they will head to the beaches of Grimsby to see the Lancaster ‘flying in a maritime setting’, before returning to Humberside, where the Merlin will land, taxiing over to the viewing area.

Burt added: ‘We offer these flights to ensure the memory of those . aircrews who gave of themselves in our hour of need, is never forgotten. ‘We . can appreciate and enjoy the aircraft that are kept in museums, but it . is only when they are fired up and flying that these legendary machines . capture the attention and imagination of all. ‘And . if the story of the heroism of those people is to be passed on to . future generations, it will be through the regular flying of these . aircraft - their sight and sound will inspire future generations.’ The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft. Take off: The flight will follow the Lancaster bomber on a 30-minute flight . A Second World War Lancaster Bomber is pictured at the Lincolnshire Aviation Heritage Centre . It . is most famous for its involvement in the Dambuster raids, which saw 19 . Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes Wallis's 'bouncing bombs' in 1943. The . plane was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - which . features the aircraft used by Canada from World War II until today - in . 1978, when it underwent a 10-year restoration, and has remained . airworthy since 1988. Action . Stations, which has raised funds for good causes including the Kent Air . Ambulance, the RAF Benevolent Fund, and the Battle of Britain Memorial . Trust, also offers flights in other classic aircraft, including . Spitfires and Hurricanes. Mr .

Once in a lifetime: It will mark the final time a Lancaster flies from Canada to England . Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War . 'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website. The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's Lancaster Mk X, which was built at Victory Aircraft, Malton, Canada, in July 1945, will be flying to the UK in August. The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War. As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died. The crew member survived and lived to . tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - . the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War. The . Lancaster bomber, which is flying to the UK in August, was dedicated to . Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'. It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron. Unique opportunity: The passengers will fly alongside the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War . In . 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing . centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany. It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963. With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display. Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.","Observer Piper Chieftains will fly alongside Lancaster bomber over UK .

"Have an idea for an unusual trip but don’t have the funds to pay for it? This could be the site for you. A South African company has started a global crowdfunding travel website, aiming to raise the cash for those who can't afford to go on the holiday of a lifetime. Mark Karimov, the CEO of Trevolta, said he wants to make travel more accessible and use crowdfunding as the means to make the dreams come true. Trevolta the crowd-funding site. You, too, can get other people to pay for your trip of a lifetime . ‘The idea is to make travels more accessible to people. It’s not a secret that most people don’t travel because it’s expensive,’ he said. ‘At Trevolta we allow people to raise funds for their travels using crowdfunding and sponsorships. Friends, family, inspired people can back the trip and make it a reality.’ And while some seem a little self-indulgent – taking a trip on Route 66 – and others appear a little overly optimistic– feeding the homeless in ten European countries – there are many worthwhile projects that people are trying to raise funds for. Users have between 10 and 90 days to get their money but any cash you do raise, you get to keep (unlike other crowdfunding sites) although Trevolta will keep 5 per cent plus Paypal will take another 3.9 per cent. Not getting his kicks: One Trevolta user wanted $10,000 to make a trip on Route 66. He only managed to raise $15 . ‘Some . travels are really inspirational and travellers go on a journey not for . themselves, but for other people – volunteering, charity, etc,’ said . Karimov. ‘Mostly . travels are not about destination, it’s about the process, about the . impact and about making a difference either on your life or in someone . else’s. ‘Today technology allows us to raise funds for all of that and more – connect with people and tell your story. Crowdfunding for travellers is one of those stories.’ Trevolta launched in January this year and has attracted 436,000 users raising £46,000 to date. The company is earning money but Karimov knows that he has a tough journey ahead of him. ‘We will always stick to our vision – to make travels cheaper and accessible to everyone, so unless we find some gold mine, we will stick to finding the ways to increase our success stories,’ he said. ‘Even after finding gold in a mine we’re still probably going to fund some trips with it. Because nothing that you buy actually makes you richer – only travels.’","Trevolta has already attracted more than 436,000 users .

"A group of holidaymakers is suing an airline after a flight from Mexico to Manchester was delayed for 19 hours. Hundreds of passengers were left stranded in Cancun when an administrative error grounded flight TOM195. The jet was denied permission to fly through US airspace as some of the passengers' passport details had not been entered into a database as required. Stranded: Nick Marriott (third from the left) his wife (second from left) and their two grown-up daughters were returning from Mexico when they were delayed for 19 hours . Passengers spent five hours at the airport in Cancun as a result of the gaffe before being told the flight would not depart until the following day. They were put up in a local hotel and eventually landed at Manchester Airport some 19 hours late. Thomson Airways initially offered £10 compensation although later increased it to £100 per passenger. But some travellers - furious at the 'token' original offer - believe new EU rules on delayed flights entitles them to up to £500. Administrative error: The Thomson plane was not allowed to fly through US airspace as some passengers' details had not been entered into a database as required . Among those taking action is Nick Marriott, 46, who says the delay in November ruined his family's £4,700 dream holiday. The council worker, who travelled with his wife and two children, 20 and 18, said he had to fork out £45 for airport food as well as fund an extra stay in a kennel for his pet dog. Passengers are also claiming for lost earnings. Mr Marriott said: ‘Thomson Airways managed the situation terribly. It was only after over five hours that they offered us bottles of water and started to suggest that the flight probably wouldn't leave that night. ‘The whole experience was a nightmare and a terrible way to end what had been a fantastic holiday in Mexico.’ A . spokesperson for Thomson Airways said: 'We would like to apologise for . the inconvenience caused to customers travelling from Cancun, Mexico to . Manchester Airport on flight TOM195 in November last year, after their . flight was delayed.' She . explained: 'Thomson Airways operates a fair and thorough process to . deal with EU Delay Claims in line with the regulation. The law in this . area is complex and some situations will not result in an entitlement to . compensation. Long day: Passengers were forced to wait at Cancun Airport for five hours before they were eventually told their plane would not depart until the following day . Finally home: Thomson Airways initially offered £10 compensation to delayed passengers, although later increased it to £100 per person . 'The clause ‘extraordinary circumstances’ does encompass a number of eventualities, and this can include the failure of communication services operated by a third party, which in this instance resulted in the US authorities being temporarily unable to authorise these customers to fly through their airspace. This failure was beyond our control and is extremely rare.' The airline added: 'We’d like to reassure customers that we are committed to maintaining an excellent on-time performance across our flying programme, and we work hard to maintain the title of most on-time charter airline. 'As this case is now subject to legal proceedings we are unable to comment further.' The Marriotts, from Sheffield, and 20 other passengers who were on the delayed flight are being represented by law firm Thompson Solicitors. Solicitor Martyn Gwyther said: ‘The way in which Thomson Airways have treated their passengers is appalling, as were their attempts to get off cheaply by flouting their responsibilities.’ But a spokesman for the airline said: ‘We would like to apologise for the inconvenience caused to customers after their flight was delayed. ‘The law is complex and some situations will not result in compensation.

"As summer kicks into gear, thoughts tend to turn – not unreasonably – to the prospect of a nice cool beer, possibly in a leafy garden in a suitably pleasant pub. But anyone feeling thirsty in London at the moment should beware the cost of their drink. Taking care of the pennies: A bottle of beer will cost you a lot more in London or Oslo than in Berlin . According to research, the British capital is among the top five most expensive cities in the world if you want to enjoy a quick hops-based tipple. The new study, conducted by online travel search engine Go Euro, assessed the average price of a small 33cl bottle of beer (rather than a full pint) in 40 of the world’s biggest cities. It discovered that those seeking value for money when it comes to liquid refreshment should avoid Norway, Switzerland and Japan, as well as the UK, but might want to consider a weekend trip to Poland, Germany, the Czech Republic or Portugal. The findings rank the Norwegian capital as the most expensive place to buy a round. A small bottle of beer costs an average of £2.87 in Oslo. In London, by comparison, the cost is a less steep – but still pricey - £1.72. We'll worry about the bill tomorrow: Oslo is the most expensive city in the world for a beer . Prices are also eye-watering in Zurich (£2.46), Tokyo (£2.45) and Israel’s seafront city Tel Aviv (£1.92) – with these three cities eclipsing London in the top five.

Captain W Van Ginkel, who was about to board the airline's Flight SA 025 jet to fly to Johannesburg, reportedly removed all his clothes except his pants at Harare International Airport, Zimbabwe. He was immediately arrested for incident exposure, meaning 90 passengers were delayed for five hours while a new pilot was called in. Apology: South African Airways said it was sorry to passengers for the delay after the incident . The incident happened after the metal detector beeped as the captain walked through it – so he was asked to remove his shoes and try again, but it still beeped, according to NewZimbabwe.com. He was then asked to remove his belt, but the detector went off again. As security officials frisked Ginkel, he became frustrated and stripped down to his pants – in front of staff, crew and passengers. The pilot walked through the metal detector, but was arrested by pilot for indecent exposure. A police spokesman said Ginkel was later fined for ‘criminal nuisance’ and released. Security outrage: The incident took place at Harare International Airport, Zimbabwe - pictured . The airline was forced to call in another pilot as Ginkel was judged unstable to proceed with the flight. The incident, which happened Tuesday morning, caused a five-hour delay of the flight. A spokesman for the airline Tlali Tlali said: ‘We regret the incident and we would like to apologise to our passengers and our stakeholders at large. ‘This is a matter which the airline will investigate in order to fully understand the circumstances that led to the detention of our crew member. ‘Once we have all the information, we will decide on what course of action to take. ‘We cannot apologise enough to our passengers for the inconvenience caused by the late departure of SA 025 from Harare to Johannesburg.’","Captain Ginkel reportedly removed his clothes at Zimbabwe airport .

"Women shouldn't wear bikinis on the beach in the Indian holiday state of Goa, according to a senior minister. Sudhin Dhavalikar, public works minister for Goa, said women should cover up on public beaches for their own safety and even went as far as suggesting that bikinis should be banned altogether. The politician's suggestion that women 'attract' sexual harassment by wearing the swimsuits in the popular holiday destination has drawn fierce criticism from women's rights activists. Cultural differences: The minister claimed that women should not be allowed to wear bikinis in public . Mr Dhavalikar said: 'Wearing bikinis can attract problems like molestations. 'I feel that wearing bikinis should be banned on the beaches. We should not allow such types of people (in bikinis) to enter public places.' And the controversial minister went on to suggest that women should also not be allowed to go out in the evening to bars. Banned: The public works minister called for bikinis not to be allowed on public beaches in Goa . The minister added that 'scantily dressed girls visiting pubs project the wrong culture and this should be stopped. 'Young people go drinking and it often leads to law and order problems. Our sisters and daughters are getting spoilt.' The inflammatory comments have drawn criticism for a victim-blaming culture, with activists claiming the outdated attitudes are partly responsible for the country's much-publicised high rates of rape and sexual assault. Goa is a hugely popular holiday destination for Britons, particularly those looking for winter sun. And Mr Dhavalikar's comments follow a string of high-profile rape cases that have focused the world's attention on how India deals with sexual crimes. Hotspot: Goa has long been a popular winter sun destination for holidaymakers and attracted tourists looking to embrace yoga and spirituality . In December 2012 a 23-year-old physiotherapy student was gang-raped so violently on a Delhi bus that she died from her injuries. Just a month ago, two teenage girls were raped and then hung from a mango tree in a northern Indian village and locals claimed police only acted after they sat around the bodies of the girls and refused to leave them. It is not just local women who are victims of sexual violence. In January this year a 52-year-old Danish tourist was gang-raped in New Delhi in an attack that lasted for hours. In the same month, an 18-year-old German charity worker said she was sexually assaulted on a train in southern India by a fellow passenger. According to the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India, tourism figures fell significantly after the much-publicised rape in 2012, with visits by female tourist dropping by 35 per cent.","Goa minister calls for a bikini ban on beaches .

"She is the quintessential English rose. But it was a thoroughly French affair when actress Keira Knightley married in a low-key ceremony in sun-drenched Provence yesterday. In a scene filled with bohemian chic and so idyllic it could have been one of her films, she skipped into the ceremony with girlish excitement, wearing daisies in her hair. The bride exchanged vows with James Righton, singer and keyboard player with pop band Klaxons, in the town hall – or La Mairie – of the hilltop village of Mazan in the south of France. Mr and Mrs: Keira Knightley and James Righton looked picture perfect as they headed to the Mazan Town Hall, in France, where they married today . Thrilled: The happy couple can barely contain their excitement as they get married . Beaming smile: The actress was seen smiling happily as she emerged from the ceremony hand in hand with her new husband, Klaxons musician James Righton . Dressed in an above-the-knee strapless tulle dress, cropped Chanel boucle jacket and ballet pumps, Keira, 28, star of Atonement and Pride And Prejudice, looked utterly carefree. She arrived hand-in-hand with the groom after being driven to the venue in the back of a grey Renault Clio. James, 29, who was introduced to Keira by television presenter Alexa Chung in 2011 and proposed last May, opted for a navy blue suit and light blue tie. The couple both wore sunglasses. They swept into the picturesque village, which boasts traditional Provencal sloping stone roofs and ramparts dating back to the 12th Century, just after 11.30am for the service in the grand Hotel De Ville, three miles from where the bride’s family own a £3 million farmhouse. The town was once the home of the Marquis de Sade, France’s greatest sexual adventurer. Many of the wedding guests were staying in his former home, the Chateau de Mazan, which has been converted into a five-star hotel. Relaxed: The actress, who is estimated to be worth around £30million wed her musician beau in a low-key ceremony in the south of France . Relaxed: After exchanging vows, the delighted couple drove away in a silver Renault Clio . Nearest and dearest: The couple wed in front of an audience of just 11 guests, many of whom chose casual attire for the ceremony today . Laidback: Guests applauded the happy couple as they made their way down the steps and into a waiting car . Beaming with pride, the bride’s mother, playwright Sharman Macdonald, 62, wore a blue and white silk dress as she made her way into the town hall  with her husband, actor Will Knightley, 67. Other guests reflected the laid-back, bohemian mood of the day, dressing casually in chinos and open shirts and trainers. The 30-minute ceremony was conducted in French by the local mayor, Aime Navello, with an English translation provided by his daughter. It took place in front of just 11 guests, including the groom’s Klaxons bandmates. Speaking after the service, Mr Navello, a retired headmaster, told how the couple became man and wife after saying a simple ‘Oui’ instead of the traditional ‘I do’. ‘We had a translator as I read out the marriage act in French,’ he said. Va va voom: Keira and James opted for a silver Renault Clio rather than a flashy motor to whisk them to their post-ceremony celebrations . The carriage awaits: Keira's small party of 11 guests clapped as she left the building holding tight to her new husband's hand . ‘As is customary, I asked Keira first if she would accept James. We had wondered whether they might reply “I do” like the English. ‘In fact, as we posed the question in both French and English, they both replied with a “Oui” and a “Yes”.’ But Mr Navello admitted he had never heard of the bride – a global star and household name who has built up a £30 million fortune. He added: ‘The first I heard of the marriage was a couple of days ago when someone in my town hall who knew Keira took a message which asked for complete secrecy. 'I kept my word and didn’t even inform any of my 27 town councillors. The simple life: The high-profile couple chose this picturesque building in a sun-soaked corner of the south of France for their springtime nuptials . ‘Normally I know most of the couples I marry. Many of them are children I used to teach, but I haven’t heard of Keira, nor for that matter James. ‘Keira was a charming bride, very modest and simple in her attitude, as was James. I got the impression that it was a very moving experience for both of them.’ Just after midday the newlyweds emerged into sunshine as man and wife where they were greeted by a small group of guests and cheers from well-wishers. ‘It was a very moving ceremony,’ said one. ‘Keira looked extremely moved by the whole thing – there were certainly tears of happiness. 'There were cheers of “Well done, Keira” when she came out, but there were so few people present so they didn’t make much noise.’ The couple were then driven back to the Knightley family farmhouse to continue the celebrations at a reception for 50 guests, including actress Sienna Miller and Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. Bed and bawd: Guests stayed at Marquis de Sade's Chateau de Mazan . Courtship: The actress is seen left strolling with her now husband James Righton in New York, and right, meeting at the airport ahead of their wedding .

"While most newlyweds dream of falling into a hammock and doing precisely nothing immediately after their 'Big Day' one young American couple decided that a regular honeymoon just wasn't romantic enough for them. Instead Mike and Anne Howard decided to pool their savings, quit their jobs and embark upon an epic adventure that turned into the world's longest honeymoon. Covering six continents, 33 countries and 302 places in 675 days the holiday of a lifetime included 57,397 overland miles, 226,152 photographs, 110 hikes, 105 buses, 46 jars of peanut butter, 41 safaris and 39 scuba dives. Scroll down for video . Anne and Mike Howard spent 675 days on honeymoon taking in 302 places, including Machu Picchu in Peru . The epic adventure took in 41 different safaris including the Masai Mara in Kenya . Snap happy: The couple took over 220,000 pictures on their travels . Mike said: 'We met a couple of friends who were talking about doing a . round-the-world trip, and we spoke to another person who had just . completed one. So we thought, we could take this nest egg and buy a . house or a car, or we can do something that most people wait to do until . they're retired. 'Why not do this in our late twenties and early . thirties, and we'll have these amazing memories rest of our lives? ' And in true modern traveller style, the media-savvy New Yorkers blogged their every movement to their 15,000 online fans (check them out on Facebook.com/HoneyTrek). Using Anne’s background as a magazine editor and Mike’s as a media strategist and photographer the couple launched the HoneyTrek.com blog to share the experience with friends and family. Irish charm: Dancing on The Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland . Milestone: Celebrating 500 days while travelling to Chile from Bolivia . Matching outfits: Going green in Mui Ne, Vietnam . Starting in South America, they moved through Africa, Asia and Europe, sharing snaps and updates with their followers on social media as they went. Their travel philosophy was to go to places too far to visit while they have jobs and too rugged to tackle when they are old. Their favourite place was Myanmar (formerly Burma) for the friendly people and fascinating blend of styles and cultures. Mike also fell in love with Entre Cielos in Mendoza, Argentina. He said: 'Only one or two people before us . had stayed in the property. They built a loft above an actual vineyard, . and brought in a German treehouse architect. To get to the room, you go . through the vines, off this ladder, and into this vineyard loft. There . was a big Jacuzzi tub out on the porch. It was really great drinking . wine there, having a vineyard loft experience.' The couple say there are too many . memories to list them all, but also highlighted having a cheetah jump on . top of their open-roof safari vehicle in the Maasai Mara in Kenya, . wreck diving the WWII ships in Coron, Philippines and watching the . Northern Lights from the Arctic Circle in Norway as highlights of their . immense trip. And, maybe surprisingly for some married couples out there, they both say that the trip has made their relationship stronger. In an interview during the trip with CNTraveler.com Anne said: 'People were like, ""You must really like your husband. I don't think I could spend that much time with mine."" It made me, think, ""Yeah, I do really love him. I think it's going to be okay, right?"" 'You start to bond on a level that is not possible on a regular schedule. Your brain starts to fuse and you can sense each other's needs or humor or reactions. We play off of each other really well.' Mike added: 'We've just become even better husband and wife than when we started. It's so amazing to have someone to share those experiences with, and the next day laugh about the scary thing that happened and become stronger for it.' Wrapped up: At the Tuckerman Ravine, New Hampshire . Here we go!: The couple take off on the Gorge Swing over Victoria Falls in Zambia, which has a 160ft free-fall . A private view: At Badcaul in Scotland . The couple set up a blog called HoneyTrek to share their adventures . Mike and Anne are now turning their passion for travel into a business, offering bespoke advice to travellers wanting to follow in their footsteps through Trip Coach a . one-on-one guide to world travel. They say: 'We did our 675-day trip around the world for just under $40 per person per day, including flights, food, lodging, activities…the works. This is an average of the pricier countries like Japan, Australia and Norway ($75 per day) with the less expensive places like Bolivia and Southeast Asia ($20 per day). Traveling around the world turned out to be less expensive than the mortgage on our apartment. 'We were really scrappy on the road when not in nice resorts, which was . maybe two times per month. We did all overland travel, and very few . flights—and when we did fly, it was on miles. 'We also took shared vans and . local transport. Our top travel tips include: . - have separate credit and debit card accounts in case one disappears . - pack the right technology; it’s the hardest thing to get on the road . - buy your flights as you go... an around-the-world plane ticket will cost more and severely limit your flexibility . 'We would also say always travel overland via local transportation whenever possible as we think that is one of the most valuable experiences we've had on our entire trip. You miss so many things when you fly; on land, you see the scenery and the stops and the food stalls and the guys motorbiking through the rice fields and how locals live along the way.' Check out Trip Coach, a one-on-one guide to world travel combining their knowledge and passion and offering bespoke advice to anyone looking to explore the world. Angelica Malin, editor of online travel and lifestyle magazine About Time says: 'This couple did what we all dream of; escaping the 9-5 and travelling the world, each day more adventure-filled than the next. 'Holidays and honeymoons are often too rushed as trying to pack everything in at once. Here's five ways to make the most of your trip:1. Planning - make sure you use websites, guide books and friends to find out what's best and what can be missed in the city2. Get out early - carpe diem! You'll get the most out of your trip by getting out of bed. 3. Look for homestays and flat shares - if you want a taste of local culture, homestays are a great way to experience the local culture first hand4. Get flight ready - keep flight day stress to minimum by checking in online, and try to take minimal luggage.5. Look at seasonal timings - some countries may be cheaper to travel to at different times of the year, check out which destinations have more favourable flight prices in the less fashionable seasons.'","Trip included 41 safaris, 39 scuba dives and 110 hikes .

"Swiss Super League side Sion have been attempting a rather unorthodox way of placating travelling fans - by offering them free tickets and local delicacies before games. Last Sunday, around 600 supporters of away side Luzern were treated to white wine and grilled cheese with pickles from the Valais region in Switzerland where Sion are based. And it must have worked in some way as the home side went on to win 3-1, their third victory in five home games. A board of cheese and wine, much like that had been offered to away fans by FC Sion . FC Sion's Tourbillon stadium in Switzerland . In July, Sion sent out the following press release: 'Valais has a reputation for acceptance and friendliness. We want to honour this image and make a step in your direction, in the spirit of sport and fair play. 'The move is the idea of club owner and president Christian Constantin, who has become somewhat infamous for his regular disposal of managers - sacking 28 of them during his 10-year reign at the club so far. But, despite the show of good nature, he also added a layer of threat to away fans at the end of the  press release, saying: 'And if it doesn’t work out, then I’ll close the away stand after the winter break.' FC Sion's owner Christian Constantin came up with the idea in an attempt to prevent crowd trouble . Some Luzern fans, however, were clearly not won over by the idea, setting off flares in the away section of the Tourbillon stadium. But in a home game in August, fans of Basel went even further, when about 1,000 of them chipped in 10 Swiss Francs each per head - approximately the same cost of a ticket - and gave the collection back to Constantin with the message: 'Mir löhn uns nid kaufe', translating as: 'We won’t allow ourselves to be bought.'","Sion offer away fans free tickets and local delicacies to curb crowd trouble .

"Aidy Boothroyd masterminded his England U20 side to victory over Germany as they got their three-game tour of Holland off to a winning start. The game was settled in the first half by an own goal by Germany’s Niklas Sule in the 34th minute. England, with up-and-coming stars such as Arsenal duo Isaac Hayden and Chuba Akpom and Southampton pair Matt Targett and Harrison Reed, are involved in the four-team tournament along with Turkey and Holland in a competition designed to replicate the experience they will likely face later in their careers. Callum Robinson of Aston Villa (left) and Derby's Kwame Thomas celebrate England's winner over Germany . England beat Germany 1-0 in the first game of the three game tournament in Holland . England (4-3-3): 13 Christy Pym (Exeter City); 2 Isaac Hayden (c, Arsenal), 5 Dominic Ball (Tottenham Hotspur), 6 Kortney Hause (Wolves, on loan at Gillingham), 3 Matt Targett (Southampton); 4 Harrison Reed (Southampton), 7 Matty Grimes (Exeter City), 11 Paul Digby (Barnsley); 8 Kwame Thomas (Derby County), 9 Chuba Akpom (Arsenal), 10 Callum Robinson (Aston Villa, on loan at Preston). Subs: 16 Joe Rothwell (Manchester United) for Reed, 84 . Goal: Sule 34 og . And Boothroyd was pleased with the start his Young Lions, who also featured two players from League Two Exeter City, made to the tournament. He told The FA.com: ‘We’re delighted to start off with a victory against a very strong German team. 'When we looked at their squad we could see they had a lot of players born in 1994, so many were a year older than ours. 'They had a number of players that had won the U19 European Championship too – so to start off with a win against that side is very pleasing. 'It was a tight game. We’ve hit the post, they’ve hit the post and we’ve both a number of good chance too.

"When Simon Cowell broke the news to ITV top brass that he would not be a regular judge on The X Factor this year, he assured them he would try to stay involved with the show. And, just one day before the biggest final yet, at Wembley Arena, he is planning to make his presence felt. While he cannot make the 24-hour round trip across the Atlantic because of his commitments on the U.S. version of The X Factor, Cowell has asked for a satellite link so he can watch the final live in his home in Los Angeles tomorrow. Making his mark; Despite being on the opposite side of the world, Simon Cowell will be putting his stamp on the X Factor final . And he is also planning a surprise live appearance, either via satellite or the internet video service Skype, to comment during or after the final. The symbolic gesture is seen as a way for Cowell to acknowledge senior production staff on the show who have endured a torrid few months of controversies and an embarrassing three million drop in viewers. My source in LA says: ‘Simon has stayed abreast of the show from America and has continued to have daily conference calls with his staff in the UK. ‘But he didn’t want to appear in the early weeks because he needed to concentrate on his day job. There was also no point in him overshadowing Gary Barlow and the other judges.’ Meanwhile, I am pleased to report Louis Walsh has pledged to return next year if he is wanted. The only original judge had been considering bowing out after this weekend. But now Louis says: ‘I’d like to come back. I love the show 90  per cent of the time.’ X Factor Judges: Louis Walsh, Tulisa, Kelly Rowland and Gary Barlow . Louis would be delighted to see Cowell return next year, although he concedes this is unlikely. He tells me: ‘I am going to be honest, without him there on the live shows it’s not the same. It’s like a big ship with no captain. He’s got a great instinct and he tweaks everything.’ Dermot O’Leary’s now familiar dance as he comes on stage has impressed executives. My source said: ‘The Dermot dance has made it very likely he’ll be asked back. He has made the show his own this year. He needed to step up with Simon gone — and he has.’ Marcus Collins is favourite to win, but industry insiders believe teen sensation Amelia Lily or girl group Little Mix would be better winners. Previous solo male winners — Matt Cardle, Joe McElderry, Leon Jackson, Shayne Ward and Steve Brookstein — have struggled after X Factor.

Hewer takes up his new job in January, replacing Jeff Stelling. Assurances: Despite having a demanding new job, Nick Hewer pictured with Sir Alan Sugar and Karen Brady, has promised not to let it interfere with his role on The Apprentice . He has signed an exclusive deal with Channel 4 which is limited only to daytime, giving him the continued flexibility to appear on other channels in prime time. ‘We have no problem with him continuing on The Apprentice for as long as he wants to,’ a Channel 4 insider says. Negotiations between caustic Jason Gardiner and ITV broke down over money. The Dancing On Ice judge has been replaced on the new series, which begins next month, by his friend Louie Spence, who found fame on Sky1’s Pineapple Dance Studios, . A source says: ‘Jason was not going to come back without a pay rise because he has found that the show takes a big personal toll. Last year he received death threats.

"Tulisa Contostavlos has confirmed speculation she will not be returning to The X Factor judging panel. The former N-Dubz singer, 24, announced the news on her Twitter page on Tuesday, declaring it was 'time to do something different'.

Tulisa's decision to depart following two years on the ITV talent show comes as veteran judge Louis Walsh confirmed he would be returning alongside Gary Barlow. Back for more: Gary Barlow, Louis Walsh and Nicole Scherzinger will all be be back on the panel for this year's show . The Irish music manager also gave a strong hint that Sharon Osbourne - who left the panel after the 2007 series - was returning. He told RTE Ten: 'I'm back, I am definitely back. Me and . Gary, we're the bookends and I'm sure Sharon Osbourne's back and I . helped to get her back, because she's great fun.'

In an interview with the MailOnline in March, Nicole admitted she hadn't made up her mind about returning following a year on the UK series and the previous year on the US version. She said: 'I'm definitely dancing around with the idea.

"Next time you log into Amazon  to manage your Kindle and e-books, you could be putting your personal details at risk. A German security researcher has spotted a vulnerability in the retail giant's website that hackers could exploit to gain full access to users' accounts. The flaw, which can be exploited when a user downloads a malicious e-book, has been active since at least July this year, despite being reported to Amazon’s security team. Scroll down for video . The Kindle flaw was originally discovered by German security expert Benjamin Mussler in October last year and fixed in December. However, when Amazon redesigned its Manage Your Kindle page, earlier this year, the flaw was reintroduced. The vulnerability is exposed if a user downloads a malicious e-book . It was originally discovered by German security expert Benjamin Mussler in October, and was subsequently fixed in December. Everyone who uses Amazon's Kindle Library to store e-books or to deliver them to a Kindle, is potentially at risk, said Mr Mussler. Cross Site Scripting is also known as XSS and is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. It lets hackers add and run their own scripts into web pages viewed by other users. In a typical attack, a hacker 'inject' malicious code into a legitimate website. When a user visits the site, through a malicious link, the code is 'executed', which means it carries out whatever task the hacker has set it. This can be used to steal login details, access accounts or added viruses to devices. However, he stressed that the users most likely to fall victim to this vulnerability are those who obtain e-books from untrustworthy sources, such as pirate e-book sellers. However, when Amazon redesigned its Manage Your Kindle page, earlier this year, the flaw was reintroduced. ‘Amazon's Kindle Library, also known as Manage Your Content and Devices, and Manage your Kindle, is, at the time of writing, vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks,’ explained Mr Mussler. ‘Malicious code can be injected via e-book metadata.' Mr Mussler continued that once an attacker manages to add a malicious e-book to a victim's library, the code is executed as soon as the victim opens the Kindle Library web page. ‘As a result, Amazon account cookies can be accessed by, and transferred to, the attacker and the victim's Amazon account can be compromised,’ added Mr Mussler. The attack is known as Cross-Site Scripting, or XSS.

Everyone who uses Amazon's Kindle Library to store e-books or to deliver them to a Kindle, is at risk, said Mr Mussler. ‘From the supplier's point of view, vulnerabilities like this present an opportunity to gain access to active Amazon accounts,’ said Mr Mussler. ‘Users who stick to e-books sold and delivered by Amazon should be safe.’ Amazon has not yet responded to MailOnline’s request for comment.","Flaw was originally discovered in October last year, and fixed in December .

"On the evening of June 2, 1993, flushed with the joy of having finished my final exams in history, and by several celebratory glasses of wine, I took it upon myself to stand up in one of the dining rooms of my Oxford college — in front of a number of Fellows — and burst into song. Among the audience were the nation’s future  bankers and barristers, plus a fellow  history undergraduate who would one day become Chancellor of the Exchequer: George Osborne. Dressed in a suit and a dark green tie, my voice echoing around the wood panelling of that beautiful room in Magdalen College, I launched into the egomaniac’s hymn to self-indulgence, My Way. No 1 fan: Harry Mount at Magdalen College, Oxford in February 1991 with his Elvis Poster . ‘And now the end is near, and so I face the final curtain ...’ It seemed a fitting song with which to salute my last days among old friends at a much-loved institution. But that wasn’t why I chose My Way. It wasn’t the song I liked, but the singer. Many people know My Way as a Frank Sinatra tune, but for me it was the version sung by Elvis Presley that had my heart. I carefully imitated his precise, much-rehearsed cadences, his pauses and that deep, Mississippi-meets-Tennessee accent. By then, I knew it so very well. Though my books have included a . treatise on Latin and a reflection on British architecture, my latest is . on what has been perhaps my greatest passion: Elvis. From . the age of six, my life orbited around him. In 1978, I stumbled on my . first Elvis record, buried in a stack of my parents’ LPs — otherwise . classical — behind the telly in my North London childhood home. Obsessions don’t spring to life fully . formed. Elvis began as a mild interest, a glimpse of something that only . later hooked deeply into me. I liked Elvis; I didn’t yet love him. As I grew up, I cast aside other childish things, but the interest in Elvis kept growing steadily for  a decade. Elvis the Pelvis: A young Presley showing off the moves that made his name . In my early adolescence, I moved on to more fashionable singers, such as Jimi Hendrix and — I admit it — The Smiths. Back then, I liked to think that listening to them was an act of rebellion, but, as with most teenage fads, these bands were conventional, drawn from a handful of supposedly edgy groups, which were, in fact, sanctioned by everyone else in my set. Towards the end of my time at school, as I grew more confident and was prepared to be a little different, I put aside those fads and returned to Elvis. Then my real obsession began — created by the unique combination of his name, looks and extraordinary voice. What I wanted more than anything was to visit Graceland, Elvis’s home in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1991, aged 19 and during my holidays from Oxford, I arranged to spend a summer in America. Today, 23 years on, I still remember the ecstatic thrill as the tourist minibus crossed Elvis Presley Boulevard and rolled through Graceland’s gates, twisted into the shape of musical notes and a pair of wrought iron Elvises brandishing guitars. The bus halted outside the portico, where we were met by an English tour guide, an undergraduate at Loughborough University. Like me, he had been allowed to work . in America thanks to a student visa. His job seemed far more enviable . than mine, working for a conservative think-tank in Washington DC. I . remember the real, burning jealousy I felt for that tour guide. It . intensified that evening when I bumped into him in a diner near my motel . in suburban Memphis. ‘Do . you get to go upstairs?’ I asked, trying to mask my excitement. Upstairs . — banned to visitors — was Elvis’s bedroom and the bathroom he died in. Was he allowed into Elvis’s parents’ room, then still lived in by . Elvis’s aunt, Delta Presley Biggs? ‘Afraid . not,’ he said. ‘That’s for family only. Not sure I’d be that interested . anyway, I’m not really an Elvis fan.’ Not an Elvis fan! The blind fool . had the best job in the world. These days, I’m obsessed with politics — . but I’d have swapped my political job with his in a heartbeat. I was captivated not only by the King’s music, but his story; a combination of fairytale and tragedy, straight out of Hollywood. Dream: What Harry wanted more than anything was to visit Graceland, Elvis's home in Memphis, Tennessee . There was the dirt-poor boy who became . rich beyond his wildest dreams; the dangerous rebel who outraged the . country, then joined the army; the sex symbol who only had eyes for his . mother. The divine Adonis . who became a fat wreck; the good ole southern white boy who never . uttered a racist word; the anti-drugs campaigner hooked on prescription . drugs; the global superstar who barely left America. Over the years of my obsession, I built something close to an Elvis shrine in my childhood bedroom. My . holy relics included a green tin Elvis Presley Boulevard road sign; a . 1987 black and gold baseball cap, commemorating the tenth anniversary of . his death; a Sun Records T-shirt; and a copy of the outsize, . gold-plated sunglasses worn by Elvis in the studio when he recorded . Always On My Mind, only a few weeks after his 1972 separation from his . wife, Priscilla. That, incidentally, was the song I chose to sing in . Graceland’s recording booth, on my visit there in 1991. I . have never worn the gold sunglasses (in company, anyway) and I wonder . now why on earth I bought them — or, for that matter, the ceramic Elvis . White Christmas pot pourri holder that dangled over my bedroom window . for several years in the late Eighties. Only the most extreme popular music obsessives go in for this sort of thing. The King: Elvis Presley performing on the Elvis Comeback TV Special in June 1968 . How many classical music enthusiasts own a Vienna street sign commemorating the house where Brahms died in 1897? Can you buy Elgar pot pourri holders at the Last Night Of The Proms? I’ve stopped acquiring memorabilia. A decade ago, in the build-up to birthdays and Christmas, I laid down a diktat to friends and family: ‘No Elvis-related presents, please.’ It wasn’t that I had gone off him; more I began to wonder why liking someone’s voice meant you should want to own a pot pourri holder with his face on it. While my attitude to Elvis changed over the years, he hadn’t. Through the years of my obsession, he’d been lying dead in the Tennessee earth. (His coffin was moved from Forest Hills Cemetery in Memphis to Graceland two months after he died on August 16, 1977, to escape grave-robbing fans.) That’s the funny thing about being a fan. Once you’ve fixated on your subject, whether it’s a pop star, football player or Renaissance painter, they remain immutable, though as years slip by, you may fall in and out of love with them. I only really stopped being obsessed with him in the summer of 2005, at the age of 33, when I moved to Manhattan as the New York correspondent for a British newspaper. Familiarity with America — and a second visit to Graceland — meant some of the glamour evaporated. In the words of Elvis’s old Memphis friend, BB King, had the thrill gone? Obsession: Harry only really stopped being obsessed with Elvis in the summer of 2005, at the age of 33, when he moved to Manhattan . Well, not entirely. I still get a residual buzz when I find that others share my affection for the King. In a recent interview, Joanna Lumley chose Elvis as her pin-up because, as she put it, he ‘always calls people “sir” and “ma’am”. Sex appeal and manners — wow!’ I’ve always liked Joanna Lumley; I like her even more now. These days, I don’t read books by Elvis’s old hairdresser, as I once did, nor do I buy any more Elvis-related goods. The Elvis Presley Boulevard road sign is relegated to the bathroom. The pot pourri holder is no longer on public display — but it is in a drawer somewhere; I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away. Middle age has swept away the tendency to obsession that crops up in lots of teenagers — whether for Justin Bieber, Star Wars figures or Commonwealth stamps. The devotion to your chosen object is real enough at the time. But the fanaticism is also a safe refuge from the harrowing worries of adolescence, teenage shyness or a romantic void. In my case, middle age may not have killed off all my shyness or entirely filled that void, but it has mercifully smoothed away the extremes of my obsession. These days, Elvis is only sometimes on my mind.","Harry Mount became a fan of Elvis Presley when he was a teenager .

"Supporters: Lettice, centre, with sisters Felicity, left, and Bunty . It’s usually a case of rags to riches on Britain’s Got Talent. This year it could be more a case of riches to riches. Lettice Rowbotham, one of the first acts to be tipped for stardom by the judges, is not only extremely wealthy, but her mother is a renowned painter whose work is collected by the Royal Family. Sherree Valentine Daines’s impressionist paintings can sell for up to £10,000 a piece, and have been shown at the Tate and the Barbican in London. She has painted both Michael Parkinson and Joanna Lumley, and counts Jeffrey Archer among her fans and collectors. Her success no doubt helped fund Miss Rowbotham, 24, through several public schools, including the £30,000-a-year Purcell School of Music in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and Charterhouse in Godalming, Surrey, where day fees are more than £20,000. In fact Miss Rowbotham’s background is so posh producers of Channel 4’s Made In Chelsea, a reality show following heirs and socialites living in west London, approached her for a starring role, which she turned down to concentrate on her electric violin. Miss Rowbotham currently lives at her parents’ £3million 18th century six-bedroom mansion, which boasts a glass spiral staircase and music room, in a village outside Dorking in Surrey. Referring to judge David Walliams’s comment that she was the ‘poshest’ contestant to audition, she said: ‘I’ve never really considered myself posh, it’s mainly about talent.’ Miss Rowbotham said she was encouraged to audition by her younger sisters Bunty, 19, and Felicity, 16. She said: ‘It was so much fun. I do like to party and going to pubs so I was a little hungover at the audition. I want to be as big as Beyonce, have my own tour and merchandise.’ But the keen skier and windsurfer, who practises up to six hours a day, admitted she has no plans to tone down her extravagant lifestyle. Indeed, she was still in bed at 3pm yesterday after a late night out. Scroll down for videos . Lettice has played with Olly Murs on Radio 1. She described the X Factor winner as 'upbeat and bouncy' Lettice practices the violin for up to six hours a day. Aged seven, left, and performing on BGT, right . Mum: Sherree Valentine Daines with one of her paintings. She counts the Royal Family and Jeffery Archer among her collectors . ‘There are plenty of people around me who will probably encourage me to have a few more early  nights,’ she said. ‘But I’ve always been a party animal and I’ve got plenty of energy.’ After her performance on her electric violin to three modern chart tracks, the BGT judges were quick to compliment her. Simon Cowell said: ‘Lettice, not only are you brilliant, you have a fantastic personality as well, you are one of the people I am going to remember coming away from this.’ Miss Rowbotham’s mother’s website states: ‘It is almost impossible to overstate the influence and contribution of Sherree Valentine Daines to the contemporary art scene in this country. ‘Her unquestionable virtuosity has made her a favourite with many celebrity collectors including members of the British Royal Family and she has been the portrait artist of choice for the great and good of public life.' A look at her CV would show that Lettice Rowbotham is hardly undiscovered talent. Even before she auditioned for BGT the violinist performed for thousands alongside pop stars Olly Murs and Kelis, and even for Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace. The Royal College of Music graduate, who is good friends with former X Factor winner Matt Cardle, is no stranger to high profile concerts. According to her Facebook page, she has played for the late Sir David Frost at Arundel Castle, West Sussex, as well as at London’s Royal Albert Hall. She has even told how she performed for Russian president Vladimir Putin at his daughter’s hush-hush wedding in Morocco in 2012. In 2011, the violinist appeared on a BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge session with former X Factor winner Murs, who is signed to Simon Cowell’s record label, Syco. Miss Rowbotham, who used to be part of a female group called High On Heels, has also toured America with two other musicians. Yesterday she said: ‘Performing with Olly was an amazing experience. He is a lot of fun and is always very upbeat and bouncy.’ She is not the first act to have already appeared in front of huge crowds before entering Britain’s Got Talent. Last week, Paddy Jones and her dance partner Nico Espinosa got to the semi-finals despite winning a Spanish version of the programme. A secret email also revealed the show’s executives sent out requests to top talent agencies looking for experienced acts.","Lettice Rowbotham, 24, has been tipped for stardom by the judges .

"The former fattest man in the world has lost almost two thirds of his weight  - but now wants an operation to remove his excess skin. Paul Mason, 51, once weighed an incredible 70 stone - almost half a ton - and firefighters had to demolish the front of his house so he could be removed using a fork lift truck and taken to hospital. But after NHS surgery two years ago, the former postman from Ipswich, Suffolk, has slimmed to only 25 stone. Former world's fattest man Paul Mason has shed almost two thirds of his weight after NHS surgery to reduce his stomach size . Mr Mason, who once ate about 20,000 calories a day, says he is now desperate to lose more weight but has been told by the NHS he cannot have the surgery until his weight is at a 'stable level' for at least two years. He said: 'It's OK them saying that, but that only applies to people who don't have much weight to lose. 'It needs doing now and probably in . another four or five years. It doesn't matter how much toning up you do, . it's only going to get worse.' He said the excess skin was hampering his efforts to walk, which would help him lose even more weight. He added: 'My skin splits. The skin behind my knee tears because of the weight of the excess skin.' Mr Mason is now writing a book about his . experience and looking into the prospect of consultancy work, talking to . people about eating disorders. He has also started his own jewellery business and says he wants to work towards a life where he can learn to drive, go on holiday and settle down with a partner. Mr Mason said: 'I've always been interested in the jewellery. 'Eventually, when I'm a lot more mobile . and don't need the wheelchair, I will have a proper work shed and a kiln . and will melt down scrap silver - and make my own custom-made silver.' 'He hopes to sell his work online and at a stall in Ipswich town centre. He added: 'When you get your life back . under control it's rewarding, you can do what you want and look at . things in a new angle.' Paul Mason says excess skin is preventing him from losing more weight because it makes it difficult to walk . New life: Mr Mason first met Miss Mountain when she got in touch to help him in his quest to have a second operation to remove layers of excess skin . Mr Mason ballooned to his incredible . size by eating ten times the amount needed by a normal man due to a . compulsive eating disorder. He claimed his binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a . deterioration in his mother's health. Mr Mason quit his job as a postman when his weight prevented him from completing his deliveries. As his weight soared he was left unable . to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked . after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front . wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to . lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia . operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million. At the height of his food addiction, he . was gorging an entire packet of bacon, four sausages and four eggs . complete with bread and hash browns for breakfast. He would then eat quadruple portions of . fish and chips along with two kebabs for lunch followed by a roast . dinner, curries or pizza and more chips in the evening. Mr Mason would also eat up to 40 packets of crisps, sausage rolls and pasties as snacks during the day. His weight loss has meant he is able to go out and about again in his motorised wheelchair, and can walk short distances.","Paul Mason, from Ipswich, Suffolk, once weighed an incredible 70 stone .

"Clueless star turned Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, 47, is dating a 25-year-old toyboy who is just a year older than her son, MailOnline can reveal today. The actress, a three-times divorced mother-of-two, is dating Michael Evers, an aspiring actor and model who lives in her building in Los Angeles - and the pair were seen working up a sweat as they hiked around their neighborhood today. A friend of Evers joked: 'Michael is the Ashton Kutcher of West Hollywood - he's already dated Nora Schweihs from Mob Wives and she was a LOT older than him! Scroll down for video . Cougar town: Clueless actress turned Fox contributor Stacey Dash goes for a morning hike with new toyboy Michael Evers in Los Angeles today . Ex-love: Budding actor Michael Evers and his former girlfriend, Mob Wives: Chicago's Nora Schweihs in June 2012 . 'But he really likes Stacey and he's taken her hiking and to the Sunset Tower Hotel and she's taking him with her to New York next month.' Stacey is mom to son Austin, 24, from her relationship with singer Christopher Williams, and a daughter, Lola, 11, from her second marriage to James Maby. She has been married three times - and after divorcing Lovell in 2005, she had a short-lived one-year marriage to James Maby, that ended in 2005. Her third marriage to actor Emmanuel Xuereb ended in divorce in 2011 after she accused him of physically abusing her throughout their marriage and claiming she was too afraid to report him to the police. She won a restraining order against Xuereb, and that was still in effect at the time her divorce was granted. 'She likes younger men now,' a friend said: 'She has turned into a cougar.' When the Mail Online contacted Evers, he said:'I don’t want to talk about Stacy right now, but she is a great girl.' A representative for Stacey told MailOnline: 'I can confirm that Stacey is not dating the actor seen in the pictures. He actually is one of Stacey's neighbour's nephews. They just went on a run.' Speaking in 2011, Stacey, who appeared in VH1's Single Ladies, said that after three marriages she was happy to be on her own, admitting: 'A lot of it was me needing a man to define me. I’m finally at a point where I want to define myself. 'The most important thing is knowing yourself and loving yourself and loving yourself by you, not by anyone else. What I’ve realized after being married so many times is that I don’t need a man to be happy. That has been my greatest lesson and that’s why I try to teach my children-to love themselves. They don’t need someone else’s approval or definition. They can do that themselves.' Despite this, Stacey said she would marry again, saying: 'Absolutely. I’ve been engaged six times, married three and I still believe it’s possible.' Stacey, who appeared in VH1's Single Ladies, joined Fox News in May as a contributor after proudly publicly proclaiming her Republican views.

President of Programming Bill Shine. Stacey, who remains best known for her portrayal of valley girl Dionne Davenport in Clueless in which she appeared alongside Alicia Silverstone, will offer cultural analysis and commentary across Fox News' daytime and prime time program . Her . Republican beliefs caused a firestorm for the actress during the 2012 . election when she publicly announced her support for Mitt Romney, unlike many African American voters. In the past two years she has made . several appearances on Fox News as a guest commentator including . appearing on the new Fox News show Outnumbered as a guest panelist. ‘I . just think that the Democrats and the liberals have taken advantage of . showbusiness, but California and showbusiness is the purest form of . capitalism, and that's a fact,’ she said during an appearance on Fox and . Friends in early April. She went on to explain that she is a proponent of states’ rights and the importance of localized government programs. ‘For the federal government . to just throw a big blanket over a big entire country and say ""We're . all a bunch of babies and now we're all warm and cozy"" is just a bit . ridiculous,’ she said. The New York Post recently reported that Stacey is in talks with the network about developing a satirical comedy series about a single mom in Hollywood. Trio of trouble: Alicia Silverstone (left), the late Brittany Murphy (center) and Stacey Dash starred in the 1995 high school comedy Clueless . During an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan at the time, Stacey used a line made famous by Martin Luther King Jr, saying that she chose her presidential pick 'not by the color of his skin but the content of his character'. The interview came after she received a barrage of social media attacks for calling a vote for Romney 'the only choice for your future'. While many took issue with Stacey, then-Vice Presidential candidate Paul Ryan reached out to her to thank her. 'He said thank you so much for your support, and that I was brave and that they support me and I thought that was so generous and kind, lovely,' Dash told Morgan. She said that she switched from supporting President Obama in 2008 to endorsing his 2012 opponent 'because of the state of the country'.

"Medical attention: Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London . The prison officers involved in a violent incident with one of the men accused of killing Fusilier Lee Rigby deny any wrongdoing. Woolwich murder suspect Michael Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail in south-east London on Wednesday. It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison’s high-security wing. Today, the Prison Officers' Association (POS) said it is 'angry that the Ministry of Justice have done little to avoid sensationalist reporting' of what happened. The Ministry has refused to confirm that Adebolajo has been injured. Last night, the Metropolitan Police said it had started an investigation but no arrests have been made. In a statement, the POA said the officers involved 'strenuously deny any wrongdoing' and that the prisoner had been 'subjected to restraint using techniques' which are 'only used where necessary'. It added: 'Our members strenuously deny any wrongdoing and the POA will be supporting them legally and emotionally during this difficult time. 'The use of restraint is only used where necessary when dealing with incidents up and down the country. 'The POA will fully co-operate with any police investigation and are hopeful that this matter will be resolved quickly and we expect the officers to be completely exonerated.' Adebolajo, from Romford, east London, is one of two men accused of murdering Fusilier Rigby outside Woolwich barracks on May 22. When he appeared in court last month charged with the murder, he complained about his treatment at the hands of prison staff. Accusations: Adebolajo is accused of hacking Fusilier Rigby (left) to death together with Michael Adebowale, 22 (right, in a court drawing). The two suspects are due to stand trial on November 18 . Violent incident: Adebolajo lost two teeth as he was restrained by officers at Belmarsh jail (pictured) in London . During the June 5 hearing via . video-link from the prison, he was flanked by prison officers in full . riot gear. Belmarsh staff asked for him to be handcuffed on the basis he . was ‘unpredictable’ and had refused to comply with their orders. The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, terminated the video-link after Adebolajo launched into a series of rants against prison staff. The unit in which he is being detained . has the highest security classification in the country, and holds . notorious terror suspects and dangerous felons. Inmates have included Al Qaeda . preacher Abu Qatada until his deportation earlier this month, and . fanatic Abu Hamza, who was extradited to the US last year. The cost of . keeping each inmate in the unit is estimated at £65,000 a year. Jail: It is understood several officers were called in to help after Adebolajo began acting violently on Wednesday, and he was injured during the subsequent melee in the prison's high-security wing . Crowds of wellwishers line the street as the funeral cortege of Fusilier Lee Rigby drives away from Bury Parish church on July 12 following a funeral service attended by 800 . A November 2009 inspection report on . Belmarsh criticised the ‘extremely high’ amount of force used to control . inmates at the prison, and said large numbers of inmates claimed they . had been intimidated by prison staff. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘The police are investing an incident which took place at HMP Belmarsh on July 17. ‘It would be inappropriate to comment while the investigation is ongoing.’ A Scotland Yard spokesman said: ‘We . can confirm that an allegation of assault was passed to the Metropolitan . Police on July 17 by Belmarsh Prison. An investigation has been . started.’ Rigby, 25, a father of one from Middleton, Rochdale, died . from multiple wounds after he was attacked in the street. The Prime Minister and thousands of . mourners attended his military funeral last week, at which his . two-year-old son Jack wore a T-shirt bearing the words ‘My Daddy My . Hero’. Adebolajo is charged with murder and . possessing a revolver. He is also accused of the attempted murder of two . police officers. His alleged accomplice, Michael Adebowale, 22, is . charged with murder and possession of a firearm.

"Thibaut Courtois has revealed he is close to signing a new contract with Chelsea after ousting Petr Cech as Jose Mourinho's first-choice goalkeeper. After three seasons on loan at Atletico Madrid, the 22-year-old Belgium goalkeeper has returned to Stamford Bridge and taken the place Cech has occupied for a decade. Courtois has two years remaining on the contract he signed when moving from Genk in July 2011, with an extension close. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho discusses Petr Cech and Thibaut Courtois' rivalry . Safe hands: Thibaut Courtois, with Vincent Kompany, kept goal for Belgium against Australia on Thursday . Glove affair: Courtois is on the verge of a signing a new deal at Chelsea after a three-year loan spell in Spain . 'It's not yet signed,' Courtois told Sky Sports. 'I am here with the national team so it is difficult, but when I am back at Chelsea I will probably sign the new contract.' Courtois started the first three Barclays Premier League games of the season ahead of Cech. It is a situation reminiscent of when Cech was installed as number one ahead of the established Carlo Cudicini after his signing from Rennes in June 2004. Mourinho's decision led to suggestions Cech would leave, but the Czech Republic goalkeeper remains after Monday's closure of the summer transfer window despite reported interest from Paris St Germain and Real Madrid. Tough call: Jose Mourinho has made Courtois his first choice keeper at Stamford Bridge . Staying power: Petr Cech, paying here for Czech Republic against USA, was linked with a move to PSG . Courtois added: 'We don't talk about the situation, but of course I know he has played 10 years at Chelsea and that now I am playing and for him it's not the nicest situation. But that is the decision of the board and the trainer. 'He is working hard in training to be ready when I cannot play or I am maybe not playing well. We work well together. 'Of course as a professional and a winner you always want to play every game, so we will see what the decision is of the coach.

"When it comes to designing handbags, Anya Hindmarch is constantly on a quest to find beauty in the banal. Last season saw the British accessories designer transform her London Fashion Week catwalk-turned-conveyor-belt into supermarket sweep with dancing salesmen, glamorous lady shoppers pushing trollies and all the usual household essentials transformed into handbags. Anya's AW14 totes, which came emblazoned with washing detergent and cereal packaging became the season's must-have arm candy. So what has she got lined up for SS15? Fashion goes fun! Anya Hindmarch, one of Britain's most esteemed accessory designers, unveiled her SS15 handbag collection at London Fashion Week today . Always one to put the fun into the last day of London fashion week, Anya's catwalk was modelled on a fairground, complete with skeletons, giant teacups and, of course, handbags. Her totes were as bright as her catwalk and, perhaps in a nod to back to school season, came emblazoned with customisable stickers. Fun at the fair: Always one to put the fun into the last day of London fashion week, Anya's catwalk was modelled on a fairground . Back to school: Her new season totes came emblazoned with customisable stickers and quirky slogans . The perfect rave accessory? Lots of her handbags, which came in neon colours such as orange and yellow, which glowed the dark . The sticker bags for grown-ups were plastered with giant pencils, rainbows and slogans such as 'bags have feelings too'. It's these quirky details that really define Anya as a designer. Proving to be the perfect rave companion, most of her handbags are glow in the dark and come with huge chandelier tassels and paint splatters. Discussing the inspiration behind her designs, Anya said: 'SS15 was inspired by the idea of taking stickers that were my schoolgirl version of ""personalisation"" but making them beautifully and handcrafted in leather. My idea was that you can ""sticker up"" your handbag or phone or notebook and make it into your own personal artwork or buy bags that already have sticker designs worked into the leather. 'I love the combination of a grown up snakeskin handbag smothered in leather stickers.' Watched from the front row by super-fan Poppy Delevingne, as well as Richard E Grant and Caroline Sieber, Anya's colourful show had Twitter abuzz. A fun end to fashion week: As London Fashion Week draws to a close today, Anya was clearly keen to have some fun on the runway . Famous fans: Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy and her handbags are now loved by the likes of Poppy Delevingne and the Duchess of Cambridge . Artsy: The bags, which cost around £1,500, came in bright hues and splattered with tonal paints . Can't wait until next season to get your hands on one of her bags? Fear not. The designer, whose thousand-pound totes are loved by everyone from Angelina Jolie to the Duchess of Cambridge, has created a cut-price offering for her thrifty fans. She has exclusively designed special packs of Kellogg’s Frosties - renamed as Fashion Flakes - which will be sold next to her famous tote bags and clutches in flagship stores from Bond Street to Hong Kong. There she is! Anya runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans . Frow: Poppy Delevingne (left) and Caroline Sieber (right) attend the Anya Hindmarch SS15 presentation . Will he be toting one? Richard E. Grant sat on the front row at the Anya Hindmarch SS15 show . The move comes after the success of her AW14 cereal inspired handbags launched earlier this year featuring Kellogg’s famous mascots Tony the Tiger and Cornelius the Cockerel. The cereal packs - made at Kellogg’s Manchester factory - will go on sale in Anya Hindmarch stores this week priced at £3 and are expected to sell out quickly following their launch at London Fashion Week. Hindmarch's career began at the age of 18 when she was studying in Florence, Italy. Noting that drawstring leather duffle bags were popular, she borrowed £600 to import some to England and quickly sold 500, with a little help from Harpers & Queen magazine. A year later she had opened her first shop in Hackney. Fast forward 25 years and she now runs 60 shops in 17 countries and counts the likes of Keira Knightley, Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller, Madonna and the late Margaret Thatcher as fans. Sorry, Cara. It looks like your new Mulberry totes have been knocked off the season's most coveted list. Can't afford the real deal?

"Neo-nazi Beate Zschaepe  delivered a final snub to her alleged victims yesterday – turning her back on their lawyers and relatives as  she entered court for her mass  murder trial. Then she sat impassively as the marathon case began with prosecution claims  of how she and her psychopathic lovers assassinated immigrants in a bid to build a Fourth Reich in Germany. Zschaepe, 38, is in the dock with four members of the National Socialist Underground (NSU). It is alleged they believed random executions – nine businessmen and a policewoman over a 13-year period – would lead foreigners to quit Germany forever, leading to a ‘pure race’ like that championed by her idol Adolf Hitler. Scroll down for video . Accused: The trial in Munich will focus on 38-year-old Zschaepe, who is charged with complicity in the murder of eight Turks, a Greek and a policewoman . Scrutiny: In a break with standard practice the court allowed Zschaepe's face to be filmed as she entered the court in a dark suit, her arms folded, before turning her back to the cameras . Spotlight: Hundreds of reporters queued outside the Munich courthouse in the hope of gaining one of the few available seats in the packed courtroom for the start of a trial scheduled to last for more than a year . A total of 84 court days have been . earmarked for the trial but some observers are saying it could last more . than two years, with hundreds of witnesses to be called. Zschaepe, who has been branded the . ‘Nazi Bride’ by the German media, walked into court in a black trouser . suit and a white blouse with her hair dyed chestnut brown and her arms . folded. She then turned her back contemptuously on the lawyers . representing relatives of those she and her helpers allegedly killed, . and began chatting with her legal team. As she sat down, angry demonstrators . were outside the courthouse in Munich waving placards calling for . justice amid the tightest security for a post-war trial seen in Germany. Start of proceedings: Jailed co-defendants arrive at the Munich courthouse, southern Germany today . Arrival: Semiya Simsek, left, and her brother . Enver , children of NSU victim Enver Simsek arrive at court as policemen . evacuate a young woman of Turkish origin, who tried to get access to . the Munich courthouse . Tension: Police officers stand outside the Higher Regional Court amid protests outside . Anger: Demonstrators holding pictures of victims gather outside the court - the highest-profile neo-Nazi murder trial in Germany in decades opened amid tight security . Protestors: Police block protesters outside the courthouse - the case has caused anger among Turks in Germany . Scrum: Journalists and policemen surround Munich's mayor Christian Ude as he listens to two young women of Turkish origin, who try to get access to the courthouse . Hundreds of police held back a crowd . shortly after the hearing began as two Turkish girls tried to storm the . building shouting ‘Death, death, death to Fascists’. Some held up photos . of the victims and one banner read, ‘Why were the authorities blind?’ Another said, ‘Hitler-child Zschaepe, you will pay for your crimes’. Manholes were welded shut, airspace over the court building was closed and police sharpshooters took up positions on rooftops. Zschaepe’s lawyers derailed the first . day of proceedings with a motion seeking to dismiss the trial judge . because he insists she and her cohorts are searched for weapons before . they enter court while the police are not. The next hearings were postponed to later this month. Gang: The bodies of her alleged accomplices, Uwe Mundlos, 38, and Uwe Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide last year . When the case resumes it is expected . to expose grievous police and intelligence failings in allowing the NSU . cell – comprising Zschaepe and her two lovers – to allegedly operate for . so long, especially as they were under covert surveillance for much of . the time that the murders were under way. There is a feeling in Germany that the . authorities did not take the murders seriously because the victims were . foreigners and that the country has been ‘blinded’ to the threat of . violent neo-Nazism. The cell imploded after a botched bank robbery in . November 2011, 13 years after they went underground to live from the . proceeds of similar heists across the country. Her male accomplices, Uwe . Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, both died – Mundlos shot Boehnhardt before . turning the gun on himself. Love triangle:  From left  Uwe Mundlos, Beate Zschaepe and Uwe Boehnhardt who were all believed to be a macabre love triangle . Plot: Beate Zschaepe and Uwe Boehnhardt. Uwe Mundlos, 38, and  Boenhardt, 34, were discovered in a caravan in an apparent double suicide . Blown up: The NSU had been undetected until Zschaepe blew up her rented flat in eastern Germany a year ago and gave herself up to police . Zschaepe is charged with complicity in the murders of eight ethnic Turks, a Greek immigrant and a German policewoman. She is also accused of involvement in 15 armed robberies, arson and attempted murder in two bomb attacks. Her lawyers deny she was directly . involved in murder. Zschaepe has remained silent during her 18 months in . custody. She faces life in prison if convicted. Her sidekicks on trial are Ralf . Wohlleben, 38, and Carsten Schultze, 33, both accused of being . accessories to murder in the killing of the nine men. Prosecutors allege . they supplied the trio with the weapons used in the killings. Andre Eminger, 33, is accused of being . an accessory in two of the bank robberies and in the 2004 nail bombing . in Cologne that injured 22 people. He has a tattoo ‘Die Jew Die’ on his . stomach. The fourth man, Holger Gerlach, 39, is accused of three counts of supporting a terrorist organisation.

"Wasps' £30million takeover bid for Coventry's Ricoh Arena looks set to receive the green light from politicians in the Midlands city. Coventry City councillors told a public meeting on Tuesday of their intention to support Wasps' purchase of the council-run Arena Coventry Limited (ACL), the company that runs the Ricoh ground. Councillors confirmed in the meeting that Wasps plan to build a new training base in the city, relocating from their west London set-up in Acton. Wasps are set to move into Coventry's Ricoh Arena (above) on a permanent basis from next season . Wasps are planning to move home games from their Wycombe ground Adams Park to Coventry . Sky Bet League One football club Coventry City will continue to host home matches at the Ricoh ground, while Coventry politicians were at pains to safeguard the future of Coventry Rugby Club. Coventry's council were locked in a private vote over the mooted sale late on Tuesday afternoon, with the outcome expected to be revealed later. Coventry City Council leader, Coun Ann Lucas (Lab, Holbrooks), told the meeting: 'Wasps have spent years looking for a home that will help them fulfil their ambitions and visions. 'They believe the Ricoh Arena could become one of the best sporting arenas in Europe: we believe that too. 'Our main objective is to make sure Coventry is not disadvantaged in any way. 'It is no secret we have been negotiating with Wasps. Councillors also confirmed in the meeting that Wasps plan to build a new training base in the city . Sky Bet League One football club Coventry City will continue to host home matches at the Ricoh . 'We know they are absolutely focused on delivering success for their club, the Ricoh and Coventry. 'The benefit to having a top rugby club playing here alongside a successful football club is enormous. 'When Wasps played a Heineken Cup match here in 2007, it brought about £6million into the local economy.' Wasps owner Derek Richardson made a six-hour presentation to Coventry councillors in late-night talks on Monday ahead of the crucial vote. Wasps have been based at Wycombe's Adams Park for 12 years, but their search for a permanent home was accelerated by Irish businessman Richardson's club takeover in April 2013. Opposition leader, Coun John Blundell (Con, Wainbody), told Tuesday's meeting the Tory group would lend its support to Wasps' bid. 'After some initial reservations, and after listening to the arguments and after many hours of discussion, we will be minded to support the resolution subject to further consideration in private,' he said. Andy Goode converts Nathan Hughes' first-half try in Wasps' 25-14 defeat to Sale on Sunday . Ashley Johnson breaks through a tackle as Wasps dominated possession but still lost to Sale . 'If Wasps are successful they would want to build a training facility in the Coventry area. 'They also want to develop rugby in the community, which alongside the work Coventry Rugby Club do will also be of great benefit to young people across the city. 'We have sought assurances that Coventry City football club will be able to continue with their current arrangements at the Ricoh, and that Coventry Rugby Club will be fully involved in future rugby discussions with Wasps if a deal goes ahead. 'We have received assurances on both of these matters.'","London Wasps set to move home matches from Adams Park to Coventry .

"Frankie Dettori has been confirmed as rider of Ruler of the World in Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe. The jockey had rejected the opportunity to ride defending champion Treve, whose trainer Criquette Head-Maarek insists would have been a better option for Dettori. Dettori looked in danger of missing out on Europe’s top race when Head-Maarek requested he was replaced on the filly owned by his boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani by veteran Thierry Jarnet, the jockey on board when she won the 2013 Arc. Frankie Dettori (pictured) has chosen to ride Ruler of the World (pictured) in Sunday's L'Arc de Triomphe . Since then Treve has registered her third defeat of the season in the Prix Vermeille with Dettori suggesting the 2014 model is a pale shadow of the 2013 one. But Head-Maarek, who has expressed satisfaction with Treve’s preparation, told Agence France-Presse: ‘We will prove on Sunday he (Dettori) is wrong. ‘I don’t think she has gone mentally. She sweated before the Vermeille but then she did that before the Arc last year. ‘Mentally she is still strong, less so physically after her foot and back problems this year. I wouldn’t run her unless I thought she was mentally up for the challenge.’ Confirmation that Dettori would partner 2013 Investec Derby winner Ruler Of The World with Joseph O’Brien on stablemate Chicquita came after the duo emerged from their last serious work-outs at Aidan O’Brien’s Ballydoyle base. Dettori opted against saddling last year's L'Arc winner Treve (pictured) to ride Ruler of the World . O’Brien is set to have a third Arc challenger with Yorkshire Oaks winner Tapestry a planned 120,000 euro supplementary entry this morning. Ryan Moore will ride. Dettori, a three-time Arc winner, triumphed in last month’s Prix Foy on the colt over the Arc course and distance. It will be a 26th ride in 27 years for the 43-year-old Italian, a sequence only interrupted by the broken ankle he suffered a year ago on Wednesday which cost him the winning ride on Treve. Conditions of his recent part-purchase mean Dettori, successful on his boss’s impressive debutant Moheet at Salisbury, is also unable to ride Sheik Joaan’s third runner Ectot, with Gregory Benoist maintaining his partnership with the Prix Niel winner. Both Ectot and Treve are shorter in the Arc betting than Ruler of The World but Harry Herbert, racing manager for Sheik Joaan, said the colt’s chances should not be underestimated. Herbert added: ‘Ruler of The World is almost a forgotten horse but he won the Prix Foy well. A truly-run Arc is made for him.’ Dettori (right) and Ruler of the World (centre) will hope to win this Sunday's L'Arc de Triomphe . Richard Hughes hit the front in the jockeys’ championship for the first time with a double at Salisbury on Elysian Flyer and Musicora. He now leads Ryan Moore by one (145-144). Hughes said: ‘It is just a pleasure to go past the best jockey in the world. I know he is not trying (to be champion) but I am.’","Frankie Dettori chooses to ride Ruler of the World in L'Arc de Triomphe .

"Newcastle ended their 20-game losing run in the Premiership with an enthralling 29-24 victory over Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park. Both sides scored three tries each and had their chances to score a four-try bonus win in an end-to-end second half but, after Noah Cato's 69th-minute score, the Falcons had the edge. Fittingly, Falcons' man of the match Ally Hogg ended 10 minutes of almost unbearable tension for the home crowd - after Tom Catterick crossed over for a try - when he booted the ball into the stand from a scrum right on the Newcastle line to end that losing run. Newcastle Falcons celebrate emphatically at the final whistle with victory over Exeter Chiefs . Newcastle Falcons players celebrate with the Kingston Park faithful in the South Stand on Sunday . It was a cracking game from the start with the Falcons making a mess of the kick-off as the ball rebounded back on the Exeter side and eventually a penalty into the corner saw Thomas Waldrom driven over from the line-out. It was Newcastle who reacted strongest and they launched several penetrating attacks with Hogg, Mark Wilson, Dom Barrow and Alex Tait feeding off Ruki Tipuna's darting runs. Two penalties resulted from the boot of Juan Pablo Socino in the 10th and 12th minutes. But Tipuna then paid the price for trying to run the ball out of defence as he threw a wild pass which saw flanker Ben White snap it up and break through for Exeter's second try. Almost immediately Socino released Hogg down the right and big number eight slipped the ball to Sinoti Sinoti, the winger scoring in the corner to make it 11-10 and then soon afterwards Socino landed a 50-metre penalty to increase the score to 14-10. Falcons back-rower Ally Hogg put in a man of the match performance against the Exeter Chiefs . Tom Catterick (right) celebrates scoring a try with Alex Tait  during the Premiership match . It was end-to-end stuff and when Newcastle made a mess of a line-out drive and turned the ball over, Exeter should have scored when they broke away. But Henry Slade kicked ahead when keeping the ball in hand would have really stretched the Falcons, who were vastly relieved to see the ball run into touch. The centre made up for his mistake when he scrambled over in the corner right on the stroke of half-time after some heavy-duty work by the Chiefs forwards and Gareth Steenson's conversion hit the bar to send Exeter take a narrow 15-14 lead into the break. Sinoti's typically aggressive run at the start of the second half led to a penalty which Socino banged into the Exeter 22 where the Chiefs infringed at the line-out maul and Socino slotted the ball home. Gareth Steenson (left) of Exeter Chiefs is tackled by Adam Powell of Newcastle Falcons . But then three penalties from Steenson in the space of 13 minutes swung then game in Exeter's favour. A careless offside from Tipuna's box kick allowed Steenson to kick in the 52nd minute and then the Exeter fly half kicked another five minutes later for handling in the ruck, followed by a third for a scrummage offence in the 65th. But then Newcastle scored twice in three minutes to stand the game on its head. Adam Powell and Gonzalo Tiesi combined to send in Catterick under the posts before Socino converted to level the scores at 24-24. Newcastle swept back through Rob Hawkins' superb offload to Tait down the left and Cato scored in the corner to make it 29-24 leaving Newcastle in the driving seat as the clock counted down.","The Newcastle Falcons edged out the Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park .

"Ten Ryder Cups and five majors but will Phil Mickelson ever be captain? With a record like that, nobody gets overlooked normally but I understand the mood among PGA of America officials was undiluted fury after his public questioning of Tom Watson’s stewardship on Sunday night. Rightly so. The mind went back to the 2008 Ryder Cup and Sir Nick Faldo’s weird stint as captain. When he came in for understandably hostile questioning at a press conference afterwards, Lee Westwood leapt to his defence. Phil Mickelson was clear and specific in his criticism of American Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson on Sunday . Mickelson (centre) looks despondent after Europe collect the Ryder Cup trophy against USA on Sunday . This was the same Westwood dropped by Faldo from the Saturday afternoon session. He was on his way to equalling Arnold Palmer’s record of 12 matches unbeaten when he was told on the 10th tee that he would not play after lunch. You can imagine what he thought privately about that crass piece of timing. Yet did Westwood use that as a stick to beat Faldo in public? Not in a million years. Sadly, Mickelson’s ego could not cope with being dropped for two Saturday sessions. Yes, he should have played in the afternoon; yes it was one more daft thing Watson did. Indeed, everything Mickelson said in the most dramatic press conference imaginable made sense but you cannot humiliate your captain in such a setting. It was a terrible act of betrayal. It left Ted Bishop, the PGA of America president, with his head in his hands at the back of the room. He should have been leaping to his feet in defence of the man he chose to lead the team. Indeed, you kept waiting for one player or official to speak up and say this was not the time or forum to be conducting an inquest. None did. It said much about what the players felt about a captain who was foisted upon them by Bishop and who was hopelessly out of touch. At 65, who would not be? Phil Mickelson, speaking in a press conference after Europe has secured victory at Gleneagles, claimed American captain Tom Watson had 'strayed from a winning formula' and compared his unfavourably to 2008 leader Paul Azinger. He said: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger did. 'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their 'pod', when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together. 'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well. 'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well. 'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.' Asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to Watson, he replied: 'I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best.' Watson responded to the claims by suggesting that the format should be changed in future years . Mickelson says the USA should return to the tactics which helped Paul Azinger's team win in 2008 . Mickelson was spot-on when he intimated the American display was a car crash you could see coming a mile off. How many times did you read in these pages in the lead-up to the event about how Watson seemed dogged by bad luck and bad judgment? It started when he went against his own philosophy of picking in-form wildcards by choosing the hapless Webb Simpson over the impressive Chris Kirk. The brilliant performance of Billy Horschel in the FedEx Cup, another on the outside looking in, was one more psychological blow in the build-up when America could not afford any. Watson capped it by dropping Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed from Friday afternoon’s foursomes after their morning performance had electrified the USA. Ryder Cups are all about momentum and that killed it stone dead. There are some things the Americans must get right if they are to end their run of eight losses in 10 matches. For a start, the FedEx Cup should be used to identify the hot players going into a Ryder Cup. They have also got to pick a Paul McGinley-esque captain in touch with his players and prepared to put in the hard graft to get the fine detail right. Steve Stricker would be perfect but because he has not won a major and does not sell tickets when you are announcing wildcards with a Broadway-style production, he probably has no chance. The Americans look glum as Europe stormed to victory at Gleneagles with a confident set of singles matches . Watson was congratulating Europeans before five o'clock as the hosts secured the win early on . America have also been served wretchedly by their two star players, Mickelson and Tiger Woods. Contrast their approach with that of Rory McIlroy, who said on Sunday he was more pumped-up for the singles than he had been for the final round of his two major wins this year. Emerging players such as Spieth and Reed actually get it but the Americans must pick the right captain and the PGA of America has to react to Mickelson’s mutiny. Start there and they will be on the right road to hosannas at Hazeltine in 2016.","The USA lost heavily despite having the higher ranked players .

The Haus am Bogensee, once owned by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, is up for sale . The 42-acre estate, nine miles north of Berlin, was converted into an East German Communist Party school after the end of World War II . Goebbels, pictured with Adolf Hitler, his wife Magda and his children, used the house as a place to write his virulent anti-Semitic speeches, as well as a place to indulge in several affairs with German actresses . Calling it a place of 'idyllic solitude', the main house, completed in 1939 and worth an estimated £12m, is where Goebbels retreated to write many of his vociferous anti-Semitic speeches. The 70-room complex, nine miles north of Berlin's city limits, is also where he indulged in a string of affairs with German starlets who were brought in by Goebbels to replace Jewish actresses at the Babelsberg film studio where he produced his propaganda films. This earned him the nickname 'Der Bock von Babelsberg' - the 'randy goat' - leading Hitler to put an end to his flings after Goebbels wife, Magda, threatened divorce. Almost 70 years after Goebbels had his six children poisoned with cyanide before committing suicide alongside his wife in the garden of Hitler's Berlin bunker as Russian troops neared, his country estate has been put on the market. The 42-acre property and grounds, owned by the city government, has been put up for sale twice since the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it was not sold. Despite the history of the 'love nest', there have been bidders this time around. Almost 70 years after Goebbels had his six children poisoned with cyanide before committing suicide alongside his wife in the garden of Hitler's Berlin bunker, his country estate has been put on the market . The estate is home to a large fishing lake. Goebbels described the tranquil area as a place of 'idyllic solitude' Marlies Masche of the Berlin Property Fund agency told the Independent on Sunday: 'We are not disclosing who they are or how much we are asking, because we don't want to upset prospective buyers.' In previous sales the background of any interested parties had to be investigated for any links to neo-Nazi groups in case they intended to make the place a shrine to Goebbels. The listed building, which has its own large fishing lake, was used as a school for East Germany's Communist Party youth movement following the war. Joseph Goebbels was one of the most important and influential people in Nazi Germany. Hitler put him in charge of the party's propaganda machine in 1929 and he played a key role in implementing the dictator's agenda. His limp and sharp tongue earned him the nickname among some as the 'Poison Dwarf'. He organised attacks against Jews, banned them from the world of the arts and media, censored the news and supported Nazi propaganda films. As WWII turned in favour of the Allies, he increased his propaganda in order to convince the German people of the idea of 'total war' and mobilisation. Goebbels killed himself and his wife, and their six biological children with cyanide capsules the day after Hitler committed suicide in 1945. The private villa used by Goebbels was converted into a kindergarten after the war ended but since 1990 it has been abandoned . The site's carpenter in the 1960s, Werner Binder, 76, said the place was heavily guarded at the time, but added: 'But once inside it was like being in a holiday camp.' Goebbels and his family lived in the house in the latter stages of the war, after Hitler had put an end to the propaganda minister's affairs, so they could be closer to him. Goebbels felt the estate was a safe place for them as it was outside of the main city, and boasted an underground bunker - which partially remains. The house also had a cinema and a fully intact banqueting hall. The elaborate hall still has the oak-panelled ceiling, French windows and open fireplace that were installed before Goebbels moved in at the start of the war. The Berlin city government hope the estate will be turned into a hotel, spa or boarding school. A spokeswoman said: 'We want total use of the site. The Goebbels villa is very difficult to separate from the rest.'","Berlin city government to sell Nazi propaganda minister's country home .

"All eyes will be on Mauricio Pochettino when Tottenham take on his former club Southampton this weekend - not that successor Ronald Koeman is paying much attention to that reunion at White Hart Lane. Having controversially replaced popular manager Nigel Adkins in January 2013, the former Argentina international was quick to win around not only the fans but admirers from afar. Saints' swashbuckling, high-pressing style earned plenty of plaudits and last season saw them enjoy their best-ever Barclays Premier League campaign. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman is not too concerned about Mauricio Pochettino facing his former team . Southampton are hoping to make it seven successive wins with victory against Spurs at White Hart Lane . Pochettino gestures to bring on Emmanuel Adebayor at his new club Tottenham . That success came at a cost, though, as a host of key players were poached in the wake of Pochettino and his staff moving to Tottenham in the summer. Odds on relegation were dramatically cut but Koeman's men have so far confounded the nay-sayers, as they start the weekend second in the standings on a run of six successive wins in all competitions. A seventh at the expense of Pochettino's side would be extra special for many connected with the club, although Koeman is not concerning himself with the background noise. 'For me [it does] not [give this game extra spice] because I wasn't here last season, but I understand for Mauricio Pochettino maybe it's special,' the Dutchman said. 'I think it's special for him and maybe for some players. 'We changed a lot this season our squad but it's always special for some players who worked with Mauricio last season. 'But there is no influence in the final result because the most important thing is to win the game or lose the game.' New signing Graziano Pelle (C) celebrates after scoring a contender for goal of the season against QPR . Spaniard Pochettino won many admirers for his high pressing game during his  spell on the south coast . While there have been numerous changes at St Mary's, Pochettino will be coming up against several familiar faces. That core of players has helped Southampton's plethora of new arrivals adapt, providing Koeman with a good foundation from which to build. 'Every manager has his own way of working but from the first day of this season what I saw was a great spirit in the team, and I heard that was one of the qualities of last season,' the Dutchman said. 'The team and the players are continuing with that. 'Okay, it was difficult because we had a lot of changes but we had good scouting in the club and we bought good players in and maybe the challenge now is higher than the last season. 'Everybody was surprised with the eighth position last season, but people love how the team is doing and we will do everything to keep that. Last season is the past and we have to look forward.' The determination to keep improving has not only impressed Koeman but a number of international managers, too. Saints captain Jose Fonte was called up by Portugal for the first time on Friday, following on from Nathaniel Clyne's selection by England the previous day. The right-back has played a key role in Southampton's fine start to the campaign and Koeman rates as one of the best he has coached in the position. Saints skipper Jose Fonte has received a first call up from Portugal for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers . Koeman has nothing but praise for defender Nathanial Clyne (L) who has received a first England call up . 'I think everybody is agreed with that call because he's doing a fantastic job and he's still 23 years old and still a young player,' Koeman said. 'He has had a great progression this season and is playing very good for the team. 'He's one of the best in his position because he's defending good and he's fast and he shows his physical side. 'In the last minute against QPR, he made a run about 60 or 70 metres and that showed his spirit for the team and he's a very good player.'","Mauricio Pochettino comes up against his former team when Tottenham host Southampton in their Premier League clash on Sunday .

"Sean Dyche has faith that Burnley's numbers game will eventually see them come good in the Barclays Premier League. The Clarets are propping up the table after six matches and are yet to win since returning to the top flight. Defensively, Dyche's side exceeded expectations by keeping three consecutive clean sheets prior to last weekend's 4-0 capitulation at West Brom, but they have also drawn six successive blanks in all competitions. Sean Dyche says his Burnley team will eventually find their scoring form having netted just one goal this term . Danny Ings' 21 league goals in the Championship last season helped fire Burnley to Premier League promotion . Sam Vokes formed part of a potent strike force with Ings last season, netting 20 Championship goals . A lack of firepower has not been helped by injuries to last year's potent strike pairing of Danny Ings and Sam Vokes but Dyche insists that a dispassionate analysis of Burnley's output so far tells a brighter story than the bare facts of their goal drought. 'We're only under the microscope because we haven't scored since the opening day of the season,' he said at a press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester. 'We also debrief with the players and behind all that we have the pro zone stats to work with. 'One example of that is six games into last season, we had 80 efforts at goal and 40 on target. 'This season after six games in the Premier League we've had 72 efforts at goal and 37 on target which is a statistically higher amount. One of the players charged with dragging Burnley out of their current scoring rut is deadline day signing George Boyd. The former Hull man has settled quickly in his new environment and now wants to put things right on the pitch. 'I'm loving it, there's a great team spirit here,' he said. Deadline Day signing George Boyd has been tasked with quenching Burnley's goal drought . 'The boys have been great and have made me feel really welcome. I'm loving the training and it's nice to be playing week in, week out. 'It's very similar to last year with Hull. We had a great team spirit there and that alone will get you several points a season. 'It's just important that we stick together as a group. As long as we do it, the goals and wins will come and we'll be fine.'","The Clarets are propping up the table after six matches .

"Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain admitted last season's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea was 'humiliating', but insists Arsenal are ready to take their revenge. The match at Stamford Bridge, in which Kieran Gibbs was sent off for a handball committed by Oxlade-Chamberlain, was Arsene Wenger's 1000th game in charge of the Gunners. This latest meeting is at a time when the Arsenal manager is celebrating another milestone - 18 years at the helm - and Oxlade-Chamberlain says Arsenal are desperate to avoid a repeat performance. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain described last year's 6-0 defeat to Chelsea as 'humiliating' experience . Last season Andre Marriner sent off Kieran Gibbs for a handball committed by Oxlade-Chamberlain . 'Last season at Chelsea was humiliating,' he told The Sun. 'We should not have collapsed. It was an embarrassing feeling and I felt deflated afterwards. It was a feeling I never want again. 'It will happen to every footballer at one point but it was a horrible day. We must make sure it never happens again. 'Nothing positive came out of that game so now we can focus on how we are going to beat Chelsea. We have enough in our team to go there and cause them problems.' The 21-year-old will be hoping for a place in the starting XI after a string of impressive performances in both domestic and European competition.

"Danny Cipriani  demonstrated his enhanced defensive qualities in front of England coach Stuart Lancaster as Sale ambushed Wasps to claim a back-foot win in Salford on Sunday. The Sharks moved up to eighth in the Aviva Premiership table, above the visitors on points difference, with this win founded on spirit and graft. While Cipriani missed four kicks at goal — three penalties and a conversion — in blustery conditions, he ran the show with assurance for the hosts and tackled resolutely in the face of a Wasps onslaught. Sale's Danny Cipriani (2R) shows his improved defensive talents with tackle on Ashley Johnson (R) Tom Arscott of  dives over the line to score the opening try during for Sale, his fifth of the season . Tom Brady of Sale is wrapped up by Will Helu and  Ashley Johnson of Wasps during a tight game . He was certainly not alone in that regard, as Sale held their ground with committed resistance led by outstanding captain Dave Seymour. ‘We have spent a lot of time on our defence and we spent a lot of that game defending,’ said Cipriani. ‘It was a gutsy win and we’ll take confidence from that.’ With Lancaster in attendance, Cipriani was asked if Test selection was on his mind and added: ‘Everyone has thought about that. I’m happy with the way I’m going. ‘Defence is an area I’ve been working on a lot and I’m happy I’m stepping up in that area.’ Cipriani did his England hopes good with a starring performance in front of watching Stuart Lancaster . Micahel Paterson, who was later sin-binned, gets up highest to claim a line-out as Sale showed fight . Andy Goode converts Nathan Hughes' first half try but Wasps were unable to continue their strong form . With the likes of Christian Wade in the backline Wasps always carried a threat, but they didn't create enough . His director of rugby, Steve Diamond, suggested the No 10’s defensive work has improved ‘beyond recognition’ and added: ‘He defended really well — he was putting people down then getting up and back into position. ‘He’s become a good player and he’s a good lad to coach.’ Sale went ahead through an early try by wing Tom Arscott, who was a livewire throughout, and although Nathan Hughes drove over at the other end, Chris Cusiter put the hosts back in charge when he scored after charging down a clearance by Charlie Davies. Following a drop goal and penalty by Cipriani, Christian Wade wriggled through to touch down by the posts and put Wasps back in the hunt, but Tom Brady’s try three minutes from time settled the contest. Dai Young, Wasps’ director of rugby, defended the absence of several frontline players for this game, saying: ‘Every change we made was a necessary change. We had enough ball to win that game three times over but we couldn’t do it.’ Ashley Johnson breaks through a tackle as Wasps dominated possession but couldn't capitalise . Tom Brady escapes the attentions of Wasps' Alapati Leiua to score the try that sealed the victory for Sale . Brady celebrates his late try with Mark Cueto as Sale recorded their second win of the season . Meanwhile, Newcastle ended their 20-game losing run in the Premiership with an enthralling 29-24 victory over Exeter Chiefs at Kingston Park. Both sides scored three tries and had their chances to score a four-try bonus win in an end-to-end second half but, after Noah Cato’s 69th-minute score, the Falcons had the edge.

"Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day. Saturday saw Liverpool get back on track with a 2-1 home win over West Brom and Manchester City keep in touch with leaders Chelsea after their win at Aston Villa. There were wins too for Hull City and Sunderland, while Leicester City vs Burnley and Swansea vs Newcastle ended two-apiece. GK - Brad Guzan (ASTON VILLA vs Manchester City) - 8 . Although Villa ultimately finished without a point to show for their efforts, Brad Guzan kept them in contention for long spells with a string of absolutely brilliant saves. He made good stops from David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Eliaquim Mangala in the second half but Guzan and Villa ultimately succumbed. Brad Guzan pulls off a flying save to keep Manchester City at bay during their match at Villa Park . DEF - James Chester (HULL vs Crystal Palace) - 7 . Hull claimed their first home win of the Premier League season against Crystal Palace and also kept their first clean sheet since the opening day. Chester played a central role in this and was watertight as part of a three-man defence. James Chester competes with Yannick Bolasie during Hull's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace . DEF - Nathan Baker (ASTON VILLA vs Manchester City) - 7.5 . Produced a committed performance at the centre of the Villa back line, always putting his body on the line. He made a superb early block on Yaya Toure and also thwarted Edin Dzeko with a last-ditch tackle as he bore down on goal. Nathan Baker jumps with Edin Dzeko during Aston Villa's match with Manchester City . DEF - Eliaquim Mangala (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7 . The defender has sometimes carried an air of nervousness about him - something that was particularly evident at Hull City last weekend - but here he was reliable and solid all afternoon. This will come as a huge relief for City and Manuel Pellegrini after they shelled out £32m for him. Christian Benteke looks on as Eliaquim Mangala controls the ball on his chest . DEF - Aleksandar Kolarov (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7 . A constant threat advancing forward down the left, as shown by the fierce shot that smashed against the post in the opening 10 minutes and the pinpoint cross that almost set up Sergio Aguero to score. Aleksandar Kolarov advances down the left-side for Manchester City at Villa Park . MID - Michael Kightly (BURNLEY vs Leicester City) - 7.5 . The man to finally end Burnley's goal drought - after 10 hours and 54 minutes of football - Kightly had an impressive afternoon as the Clarets picked up a much-needed point at Leicester. Kightly seized on a knockdown by Lukas Jutkiewicz to sweep the ball past Kasper Schmeichel after 39 minutes. Michael Kightly celebrates after scoring for Burnley at Leicester City . MID - Mohamed Diame (HULL CITY vs Crystal Palace) - 8 . The Senegalese midfielder has been excellent since arriving on Humberside from West Ham on deadline day, scoring three times in four matches. His header on the hour mark from Andy Robertson's cross set Hull on their way to an important victory against Palace. His manager Steve Bruce said afterwards: 'He's not quite complete but he's big, strong, athletic, he handles the ball well. He's good in the air.' Mohamed Diame celebrates Hull's opening goal in the win over Crystal Palace . MID - Jordan Henderson (LIVERPOOL vs West Brom) - 7.5 . Henderson was the match-winner at Anfield as Liverpool ended their recent slide with a win over West Brom - but his 61st-minute goal was merely the highlight of another commanding display from the England midfielder. Henderson had earlier played a one-two with Adam Lallana for Liverpool's opening goal before half-time. His boss Brendan Rodgers said: 'Jordan is the one player in the country who can dominate games without the ball because he has this wonderful physical capacity. But today was about him getting a bit more forward and his winning goal came when he arrived into the box.' Jordan Henderson slides to celebrate what proved to be Liverpool's winning goal against West Brom . MID - Andrew Robertson (HULL CITY vs Crystal Palace) - 8 . Another Hull player deservedly in the team of the week, Robertson is turning into one of the best signings of the summer. He was swinging in accurate crosses all afternoon and made one of them count when Diame headed in the Tigers' opener. Another impressive afternoon for the young Scot. Hull's Andrew Robertson holds off the challenge of Palace's Frazier Campbell . FWD - Sergio Aguero (MANCHESTER CITY vs Aston Villa) - 7.5 . A menace for Villa all afternoon, the only surprise was that it took Aguero 88 minutes to score. He hit the post shortly after the break and created openings for others. His effort late on, which doubled City's advantage, fizzed past Guzan from the edge of the box and took his season's tally to six goals. Sergio Aguero celebrates securing the points for Man City in their match at Villa . FWD - Papiss Cisse (NEWCASTLE UNITED vs Swansea City) - 8 . After a tough 2013-2014, in which he suffered from injuries, Cisse looks somewhere near his best and took his season's tally to four in three matches with a double to earn Newcastle a draw at Swansea. His first, Newcastle's first away goal in 763 minutes, was a glanced finish across Lukasz Fabianski, his second a poked goal after he found space between the defenders.

"Johan Cruyff has attacked both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, claiming the current Manchester United boss needs to organise his side better and the former never should have been appointed. The Dutch legend's relationship with Van Gaal has always been strained, and he didn't hold back when talking about the United manager's current problems. 'They need to be organised because they were totally disorganised and normally Van Gaal is a very good organiser to put things his way,' he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. Former Ajax and Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff  claimed Louis van Gaal needs to organise his side better . 'That's creating the basis. From then on you have got to build. '(United's turnaround) depends how quickly the other players adjust themselves.' The former Barcelona boss also believes the United hierarchy made a mistake in appointing Moyes last summer after 11 years spent in charge of Everton. Cruyff said that while Van Gaal's strength is normally his organisation, his current team is in disarray . Cruyff and Van Gaal's relationship has always been strained, the cause of which is the subject of debate . 'Moyes is a very good coach because I've seen many many years in Everton but he's not a coach which should fit with Manchester United because the focus for both teams are totally different. 'That's why the biggest mistake is to ask Moyes to come to Manchester United because it's a totally different team, a totally different mentality. 'The basic mistake was to sign him on. I think he is a great manager but not for Manchester United. He's just a great manager for another type of team.'

"For most managers, losing your captain for three vital games - two against direct rivals - would be a disaster. But such is the embarrassment of attacking riches at Louis van Gaal's disposal, he must now choose between a £37million World Cup winner and arguably one of the best young players in Europe to replace the suspended Wayne Rooney. Van Gaal no doubt would prefer to have Rooney available for Sunday's clash with Everton but as far as replacements go Juan Mata and Adnan Januzaj aren't too bad. Juan Mata shows off his strength during Manchester United training earlier this week . Adnan Januzaj takes a seat during a break in training earlier this week . Wayne Rooney is sent off during Manchester United's 2-1 win over West Ham last week . Wayne Rooney (centre) took a full part in training last week but will miss the game against Everton . Most managers would love to have such options, but who will the Dutchman choose? And what will it tell us about his long-term plans for Manchester United? The Dutchman has already proven during his short tenure at Old Trafford that he is not to be second guessed when it comes to team selection. He has, after all, used more players this year than any other manager and given debuts to several young players barely known outside the walls of United's Carrington training ground. But Mata, having scored twice this season already, may consider himself a slight favourite over his younger rival, who is yet to start a game in any competition this season. Van Gaal hinted as much during his Friday press conference, saying: 'In [Rooney's] position Juan Mata has played very well. I have to choose. I will miss Wayne because he is the captain of the team but Mata can also play very well.' That being said, however, the 26-year-old has been on the bench for United's last two games - and didn't even come on during the 2-1 win over West Ham last week. Louis van Gaal will have to choose between Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata to replace Wanye Rooney . Juan Mata celebrates coring against Sunderland in the Premier League to give Manchester United a 1-0 lead . Juan Mata scores against for United in the 4-0 win over QPR at Old Trafford last month . With Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao - neither of whom are blessed with much pace - to start up front, Van Gaal may decide that he wants more speed and dynamism in his front three - meaning Mata may be sacrificed. For all his talent on the ball and ability to open up defences, there is no doubt that Mata often slows United's play down. Januzaj, however, is one of those players who has the ability to get fans out of their seats with his direct style of play. Under former manager David Moyes, the 19-year-old was predominately seen terrorising opposition full-backs but many at Old Trafford believe that he will eventually develop in to the No 10 role. Van Gaal has used Januzaj sparingly this season but after he shone for United's U21s last week - scoring one and setting the other up - the Dutchman may feel he can no longer keep his No 11 on the bench. In recent years, United have lost many of their promising young stars - Paul Pogba, Ravel Morrison and Gerard Pique in particular - and that may too play a part in Van Gaal's thinking. Adnan Januzaj skips mast Joshua Onomah of Tottenham in United's U21s victory last week . Manchester United's U21 players mob Adnan Januzaj after he scores the winning goal against Tottenham . He must surely know that the longer he keeps Januzaj on the fringes of the first-team, the greater the chance he will leave. The Belgian was one of the few players to emerge with any credit last season during Moyes' disastrous reign and it was expected that this would be the year he really broke through and showed his full potential. However, a change in formation and the arrival of a flurry of expensive stars at Old Trafford have raised doubts about the future of Januzaj. Is he prepared to bide his time or will he look to move elsewhere in search of the game time a young player of his calibre no doubt deserves? Equally, should Mata find himself on the bench on Sunday, then it would surely signal the start of the end for him at United. If Mata isn't trusted in a home game against Everton, then when will he be trusted? It is a straight shoot-out between two talented - but different - players and whoever gets the nod will be under pressure to deliver. But who will Van Gaal choose, we will find out soon enough...","Wayne Rooney is suspended for Manchester United's game against Everton .

"Brendan Rodgers has warned Liverpool may have to endure further short-term pain before they can finally turn their ailing season around. Though there was some good news for Rodgers on Friday when Daniel Sturridge signed a new incentivised five-year contract, which could see him earn up to £150,000 per week, there are still a number of issues for the Liverpool manager to solve. Chief among them is how he sparks an upturn in Liverpool’s form. They have not won in the Barclays Premier League since August 31 and their Champions League aspirations are in jeopardy after an anaemic performance in Basle that Rodgers branded ‘soft’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Rodgers say Mario Balotelli needs to improve his goalscoring . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers believes the club may face more short-term problems before they get it right . Liverpool have not won in the league since August 31 and their Champions League hopes are in jeopardy . Liverpool face a potentially awkward fixture at home to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday afternoon and Rodgers has admitted the significant transition that went on at Anfield during the summer — and the process of bedding in new players — means they are vulnerable. ‘It’s hard for the supporters and I understand that,’ said Rodgers, who is considering giving Rickie Lambert his first Premier League start for Liverpool today. ‘It must be so difficult to see a team that for 18 months has been so fluent and dynamic. Now they probably look and see a team with maybe no resemblance to that in many ways. ‘I understand that and there is no-one more frustrated. We look at our game, which is based a lot on possession, but we’re also a big threat in transition when we’ve won the ball back and we’re on the break. We don’t look a threat at the moment. Basle captain Marco Streller scored the only goal of the game in their 1-0 victory vs Liverpool on Wednesday . 'I think the pain is for now. We lost a top-class player (Luis Suarez) and then had to bring in other players to help us now and for the future. Once these players settle in and adapt, and really understand how we work, we’ll move back to where we were. ‘There will be frustration now, absolutely. No-one respects that more than me. We have to work hard to get them settled and bedded in. These are players we believe will be outstanding but sometimes it takes a wee bit of time.’ Sturridge certainly has faith that Rodgers will find the formula to get Liverpool winning again and he revealed that his decision to extend his contract to the summer of 2019 was based on his belief that he will compete for the major honours. Liverpool's star striker Daniel Sturridge signed a new incentivised five-year contract at the club on Friday . ‘We were so close to success last season and it was a bitter pill to take not winning the league,’ said Sturridge. ‘But that’s just a taster of what the fans will get — but hopefully this time we’ll have the trophies to show for it. ‘Everyone is very obsessive in terms of wanting success and being winners. That’s what we are — that’s the Liverpool way. It’s the Liverpool way of life. The way the manager wants us to implement his style, his football, I think we will have success in the future and I’m just looking forward to those days when we’ll be lifting trophies and celebrating.’ Sturridge believes the Anfield outfit will be competing for major honours in the future .","Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has admitted the club are going through a bad patch at present .

"West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has told Saido Berahino to maintain his red hot form - even if it means sparking unwanted interest. The 21-year-old is the top English scorer in the Barclays Premier League with four goals this season ahead of the Baggies' trip to Liverpool on Saturday. He was tipped for a call-up to the Three Lions' senior side but has been included in Gareth Southgate's Under 21 squad for their Euro 2015 play-off games with Croatia instead. Saido Berahino has enjoyed a flying start to the season with West Brom . Irvine wants Berahino to continue his early season scoring streak and is not worried about interest from elsewhere. 'I certainly wouldn't want Saido not to play well because I didn't want him going anywhere else,' he said. 'It's in everyone's best interests that he continues to play as well as he's been playing - and continues to develop. 'And if in the end he goes somewhere else - and it's a move that is seen as taking his career to the next level, then that would be fantastic and he'd go with our blessing. Saido Berahino was unfortunate to miss out on a place in Roy Hodgson's senior England squad . 'So the message is to carry on playing well and scoring loads of goals - if he does that we'll all be happy.' Berahino's brace helped the Baggies beat Burnley 4-0 last week and they go to Anfield on the back of three straight wins. And if he keeps scoring then Irvine insisted he would not be under any pressure to sell the England Under-21 international. 'If Saido gets to the stage where there's a while load of big clubs chasing after him - then he'll have done a brilliant job for us in the meantime,' he said. Alan Irvine insists the Baggies are under no pressure to sell their star man . 'Then it becomes a matter of whether the club want to do business with anyone or not. There's no set rule as far as that's concerned. 'The club will make the decision on any player who's attracting attention from other clubs. 'As we've shown already this summer, we've kept hold of some players who other clubs were chasing - but we let others go.

"The reply from Johan Cruyff is emphatic. Would he have played like Louis van Gaal did at the World Cup? ‘No, I would not,’ he says. There is no room for doubt. It is clear that one of the world’s finest ever footballers is less than impressed with Manchester United’s current manager. It might have passed some by in England, but while Van Gaal’s Holland team marched on to the World Cup semi-finals in Brazil last summer, with their coach lauded in this country as a tactical genius, back home in Holland his old rival Cruyff was criticising the directness of the play, the lack of passing and the absence of the Dutch signature on their game. ‘The result is perfect,’ Cruyff does concede, for no-one had Holland down as semi-finalists prior to the tournament. ‘That’s what they needed to do. But you can talk about other things, the quality that the team had. A lot of times it’s a question of survival. I didn’t see the football that I would like.’ VIDEO Scroll down to see Louis van Gaal's difficult side in a Man United press conference . Johan Cruyff doesn't take a backward step when it comes to his thoughts on Dutch rival Louis van Gaal . Cruyff doesn't rate Van Gaal's style of play and describes the Manchester United boss as an 'organiser' Cruyff would have stuck to his own brand of Total Football, passing the ball, dominating the game through possession, come what may. When it is put to him that playing that way with the current Dutch team might have resulted in an earlier exit, he shrugs. ‘Everybody is like he is,’ says Cruyff. It is a curious dynamic in Dutch football, these two giant figures bestriding the stage with their respective factions. In Holland, you are either with Van Gaal or Cruyff. Cruyff was the great player — for most people, among the best ever, alongside Pele, Maradona, Messi and Di Stefano. Even now you can feel the reverence in which Cruyff is held. Last week he was at St Andrews playing at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championships, the European Tour event which uniquely pairs up celebrities with professional golfers. In the course-side hotel in which he is staying, man of the moment Rory McIlroy has just breezed through. Cruyff, though his own finest moments were mainly 40 years ago, is afforded similar deference by fans and staff. Van Gaal, by contrast, is the grafter. No more than average as a player, he forged a managerial career from the grass roots up to the European Cup, La Liga and Bundesliga titles while Cruyff, the superstar, was parachuted into the top jobs. Cruyff, unlike most greats, was a success as a manager, winning Barcelona’s first ever European Cup in 1992. But since he left that job he has barely coached and yet remains probably the most influential figure in world football. His tactics, and those of his mentor, Rinus Michels, of incessant passing and pressing, constant attacking and an almost obsessive desire to create, have transformed the game. Cruyff criticises the style of Van Gaal's Holland side at the World Cup: 'I didn’t see the football that I would like’ Cruyff concedes Holland's effort in making the semi-final in Brazil was beyond expectations for the team . Pep Guardiola is his best-known disciple and his Barcelona team of 2008-2012 were the best exponents of the craft. Closer to home, Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez are also clear followers. In fact, Cruyff would feel more at home with the playing style of Manchester United’s Sunday opponents, Everton, than the tactics of his compatriot. ‘Everton try to dominate the ball. If you have the ball, you decide what is going to happen.’ Everton and Liverpool, it seems, come closest to executing the principles he forged. ‘I think so,’ he says. The intensity of the Van Gaal- Cruyff split does seem curious. All Dutch teams, including Van Gaal’s, pass the ball exceptionally well. Both coaches have a penchant for the back three and for attacking football. They grew up in neighbouring Amsterdam suburbs and played at Ajax where Van Gaal, who played in Cruyff’s position, left because he couldn’t establish himself in the first team. Van Gaal then followed Cruyff as coach at Barcelona in the 90s, providing the link to Guardiola. Cruyff speaks during the Alfred Dunhill Links Championships at St Andrews . The former Holland, Ajax and Barcelona superstar hits off the tee on September 30 . Cruyff speaks with former Barcelona and Real Madrid legend Luis Figo at St Andrews . If there was a decisive battle that symbolises the struggle between the two dominant figures in Dutch football it came in 2011, when Van Gaal was made managing director at Ajax, a move which Cruyff, despite being a board member, was not consulted over. Cruyff went to court to ensure Van Gaal never took up his post, arguing that the board needed to consult all directors before making the appointment. The differences are minuscule but fiercely debated within the faith. And if it is a civil war, then Cruyff is the cavalier and Van Gaal the roundhead. For Cruyff’s taste, Van Gaal’s teams are too manufactured. ‘The difference is that he always organises a lot of things for people,’ says Cruyff. ‘And I always use the basic quality of people to achieve what I want to achieve. That’s a different way of thinking. I always love that they do things. And when it goes wrong, well, try to correct it in one way or another. His way is more as a very good organiser.’ At times, their personalities seem to infect all football debates, even when Cruyff is no longer a direct participant. So when Van Gaal’s Holland beat Spain 5-1 at the World Cup — the then holders with a side full of Barcelona players schooled the Cruyff way —some pronounced it the death of tiki-taka football. ‘That sounds absurd,’ says Cruyff. ‘First of all, the teams that play that way, like Barcelona or Bayern Munich now, they are attacking teams. The control of the ball is very important. You have got a rest and the opponents have to run. Cruyff (left) and players Michael Laudrup (centre) and Hristo Stoichkov after winning the 1992 European Cup . Van Gaal waves on the balcony of the Generalitat de Catalunya after winning the La Liga title with Barca . While Van Gaal was an average player, Cruyff was considered one of the world's best of all time . ‘The moment they make a little mistake, you’re in. That’s a way of playing I think that will never change because a good team with quality players will always do that. ‘You see the way Ajax played in 1974, so many years ago.’ ‘We didn’t need a type like this,’ explains Cruyff of his objections. ‘We needed other types of people. In golf you have one player and a coach for putting, a coach for approaching, a coach for driving. ‘In football you have one coach for 20 people. It’s absurd, because they are all individuals in different positions, with all kinds of different qualities, which you have to know. ‘You have to control the ball, you have to shoot with your left, with your right, control with the left, you have to run, you have to head, you have to dribble, a lot of things. Maybe I’m a very good coach for the offensive part and I’ll never be a very good coach for the defensive.’ SO Van Gaal (below) is more autocratic whereas he likes to delegate? ‘I always delegate. If someone is very good at something, whatever it is, he will be in charge.’ Cruyff insists he has no personal issue with Van Gaal, though they do not appear to have spoken since that dispute. ‘The last few years we didn’t meet because I lived in Spain and he was in Holland. It’s not a question that we don’t want to see him, because people always create a lot of things that are not there. I never have a problem with nobody.’ It is the Dutch way, of course, to have your conflict out in the open. There is another protégé of Cruyff’s currently doing rather better in the Premier League than Van Gaal. The pair go head-to-head in the 1982-83 season, Cruyff for Ajax (left) and Van Gaal for Sparta Rotterdam (right) Cruyff (left) and Van Haal (right) during their respective time as manager of Barcelona . Ronald Koeman was at the centre of Cruyff’s back three when he managed Ajax and then Barcelona. Koeman scored the goal that won the European Cup in 1992. His success at Southampton doesn’t surprise Cruyff. ‘He was always a key figure. At that time everyone was playing two up front and we were playing three at the back. It means organisation was required at the the back and that’s what he did. He’s a strong personality as well. He’s got the vision.’ But both being Dutch and ‘strong personalities’, they would get into discussions over tactics. Koeman the player was seemingly happy to query and question Cruyff the manager. Some might even call it arguing. ‘Of course,’ says Cruyff, quite happy at the suggestion. ‘Arguing is part of the game. That’s how you learn. ‘It’s not that I am right or he is. It’s that I see something and I say it but the other one must be capable of doing it. They have to solve the problem. So maybe when the manager says one thing, you could say: “But what if this happened?”. It’s just a discussion about football, which is beautiful.’ Or, as we would call it, ‘a dressing-room bust up’. The Dutch have always done football differently.

"Arsenal made it two wins from two in the UEFA Youth League as they produced a five-goal blitz to crush Galatasaray on Wednesday afternoon. After an even first half, Gedion Zelalem’s strike just before half-time triggered an avalanche of goals, with Kaylen Hinds, Chris Willock, Alex Iwobi and Daniel Crowley all getting on the scoresheet. The comprehensive win at Meadow Park in Boreham Wood followed up the Young Gunners’ 2-0 success at Borussia Dortmund on matchday one and put them in firm control of their group. Arsenal's Gedion Zelalem prepares to pull the trigger and score Arsenal's first goal against Galatasaray . Zelalem's shot heads towards the target as Galatasaray defender Gokcan Gelman tries in vain to block . Arsenal's Chris Willock tries to get the better of the grounded Yusuf Turkman during the first half . Arsenal: Ryan Huddart; Chiori Johnson, Stefan O'Connor (Eliot Wright 67), George Dobson, Tafari Moore (Marc Bola 74); Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Daniel Crowley, Gedion Zelalem; Alex Iwobi (c), Kaylen Hinds (Stephy Mavididi 80), Chris Willock . Subs not used: Bradley House (GK), Renny Smith, Ben Sheaf, Tyrell Robinson . Scorers: Zelalem 45; Hinds 58; Willock 59; Iwobi 66; Crowley (pen) 70 . Galatasaray: Muhammed Ali Buyuk; Safa Turkman, Gokcan Gelmen, Yusuf Turkmen, Soner Gonul; Cetin Turan; Ugurcan Kose (Gokhan Cira 84), Dogan Can Dapas (Bugra Yetkin 57); Birhan Vatansever (Furkhan Kopuz 67), Altug Tas; Kerem Caliskan . Subs not used: Mert Karaca (GK), Huseyin Ozturk, Ali Posta, Gokhan Goksu . Scorer: Kopuz 90 . Booked: Turan . Referee: Thoroddur Hjaltalin (Iceland) Arsenal started the match on the front foot with early opportunities for Hinds and Crowley though both were a little too high with their efforts. It was one-way traffic for much of the half as Arsenal penned their Turkish visitors in and Crowley came within inches when he ran on to Iwobi’s pass and rattled the crossbar from 20 yards. But just as it looked as though the sides would return to the dressing rooms scoreless, Zelalem set off on a run from just inside the Galatasaray half and darted into the open space in front of him. The German youth international then cut inside a defender and fired past Ali Buyuk in goal. The goal seemed to break Galatasaray’s spirit and it took just 12 minutes of the second half for Arsenal to gain their second. Tafari Moore made progress down the left-hand side and squared for Hinds to tap-in. A minute later and the contest was definitely settled when Willock fired home from 10 yards out and a fourth came shortly afterwards as Iwobi found the net from the edge of the box following Crowley’s assist. Daniel Crowley gets the better of Cetin Turan's unorthodox challenge . The highly-rated Crowley deserved a goal and he got one from the penalty spot after being challenged illegally in the box. Furkan Kopuz did gain a late consolation for the visitors but it took none of the gloss off a fine Arsenal display. The Gunners will seal their passage to the knockout round if they get the better of Anderlecht in their next two matches.

"Lewis Hamilton heads to Japan at the top of the drivers' championship after back-to-back victories at Monza and Singapore. The Mercedes driver now holds a three-point lead over team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg as he looks to take his maiden win at Suzuka. With questionable reliability and a fraught relationship between them, the Japanese Grand Prix could provide further twists in an already memorable championship scrap between the pair. Lewis Hamilton leads the drivers' championship coming into the Japanese Grand Prix . Hamilton (left) with Nico Rosberg, who he now leads by three points, in 2012 before they were team-mates . Ahead of what could be a defining weekend of the season, here are all the facts and stats. Venue: Suzuka . Circuit length: 5.807 kilometres/3.608 miles . Laps: 53 . Race distance: 307.471km/191.053 miles . Lap record: one minute 31.540 seconds (Kimi Raikkonen, 2005) 2013 pole position: Mark Webber (Red Bull) one min 30.915secs . 2013 winner: Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull) 2013 fastest lap: Mark Webber one min 34.587secs . Last season's fastest lap came from Red Bull's Mark Webber before he left his spot for Daniel Ricciardo . Number of corners: 18 (eight left/10 right) Tyre compounds to be used: medium/hard . Bumpiness: low . Overtaking chance: low . Engine severity: high . Brake wear severity: very low . Average lap speed: 237kilometres per hour (147.265miles per hour) Full throttle per lap: 66 per cent . Gear changes per lap: 40 (race = 2120) No of safety cars deployed since 2009: Five. Suzuka is one of only four tracks on this year's calendar where championship leader Hamilton has never won. He was victorious in Fuji back in 2007 but victory here eludes him as it does in Austria and Brazil - with the new race in Russia making up the quartet. McLaren are the most successful manufacturer at the Japanese Grand Prix with Jenson Button's victory in 2011 the team's ninth win. Ferrari are second, two wins adrift of the Woking team. Michael Schumacher is the most successful driver in the event's history. The German claimed his six wins in 1995, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2004. Michael Schumacher won in Japan six times, making the German the race's  most successful driver . In eight of the last 12 races at Suzuka, the man on pole has taken the chequered flag. Hamilton currently has eight victories to his name whilst driving for Mercedes and a ninth would see him take the record for wins with the German marque away from Juan-Manuel Fangio - who he sits level with for the time being. Max Verstappen, 17, will become the youngest driver to ever participate in a grand prix weekend when he takes the wheel of a Toro Rosso in Friday's first practice session. Reigning champion Vettel has won four of the last five races in Japan and the Red Bull driver heads to Suzuka on the back of his best performance of 2014 so far - a second-place finish in Singapore. Sebastian Vettel has won four of the past five races at Suzuka but is well behind the leaders this season . Last year's event was the first since Suzuka replaced Fuji as host in 2009 that a safety car has not been required during the race. Caterham's Kamui Kobayashi will be the only native driver on show - the 28-year-old finished third on his last showing in Suzuka back in 2012 with Sauber, his only F1 podium to date. Including the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in Aida, the world championship has been decided in Japan on 13 occasions - more than any other country.","Lewis Hamilton takes a three-point lead into the Japanese Grand Prix .

"Wales will be without midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen for their upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus in Cardiff. Manager Chris Coleman confirmed on Wednesday the Barclays Premier League pair would be absent for the games against the Bosnians on October 10 and Cyprus three days later. Arsenal playmaker Ramsey damaged a hamstring against Tottenham last weekend and has been ruled out of action for the next four weeks. Aaron Ramsey did not make the Wales squad after picking up a hamstring injury in the north London derby . Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen will also miss the matches against Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus . Liverpool midfielder Allen has not played since Wales' opening Euro 2016 victory in Andorra on September 9 after undergoing a hernia operation. 'We've got used to being without players who everyone talks about being the main boys,' Coleman said after naming a 26-man squad for the Cardiff City Stadium double-header. 'I've never had them altogether and we're also without David Vaughan and Andy Crofts, so that's four out of that midfield area. 'It's disappointing when you lose players of the calibre of Aaron and Joe, but I've got confidence in those boys to come in and do a job for us.

Bosnia are playing catch-up in Group B after a surprise home defeat to Cyprus last month but Coleman is aware that a side featuring the Premier League trio of Edin Dzeko, Muhamed Besic and Asmir Begovic are a dangerous proposition. 'Bosnia will be a wounded animal because they were expected to beat Cyprus,' Coleman said. 'They should have beaten them, they completely dominated the game but they couldn't score and were done twice on the counter-attack. 'They'll come to us, knowing they need to win and with a point to prove.

"Lewis Hamilton believes more maturity and a better work ethic set him apart from the man he was when he last tasted Formula One title success. The 29-year-old heads into the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka this weekend with a slender three-point lead over Mercedes team-mate and title rival Nico Rosberg. It is the closest Hamilton has come to adding to his 2008 drivers' championship crown, which he won at McLaren in his second season in F1. Championship leader Lewis Hamilton poses with a fan ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix . Hamilton, three points ahead of title rival Nico Rosberg, speaks to the assembled press ahead of Sunday's race . A perceived gung-ho style has sometimes yielded great results or silly mistakes from the championship leader, but he believes he has moved away from relying solely on his instinct and now understands what is needed to repeat his success of six years ago. 'I'm older, and I feel it!,' he replied when asked what the major differences were between then and now. 'Back then it was all instinct, I think my maturity was at a very early stage and I probably think that is the biggest change and hopefully I will keep getting more and more mature. 'Also my work ethic. My work ethic is a lot better, more serious and more understanding - it seems to be working well for me. The British driver holds an umbrella in the paddock to shield himself from the rain on Thursday . 'This has been the most consistent and best-performing season I have had in Formula One and I want to continue that for many, many years - it is like building blocks, I just need to keep working on it. 'You don't focus on the past but you don't forget about it. Ultimately what has happened in the past has defined today - it has shaped me personally, mentally and psychically into who I am today. 'Particularly this year, those experiences I have had I know this weekend will be a tough weekend, the next five could all be tough weekends, there is all the possibilities in the world I could be facing the toughest time of my life - but it is also possible it could be the greatest time of my life.' Victory in Singapore a fortnight ago, coupled with the retirement of Rosberg, saw Hamilton nudge back ahead in their back-and-forth fight for the title. Hamilton leads the pack into the first corner at the Singapore Grand Prix. He went on to claim victory . But Hamilton does not expect the German to be dwelling on his disappointment and has backed him to come out fighting in Suzuka. 'Nico is such a strong competitor,' he said. 'Always, since we were young kids, he has been so strong mentality and confident and sure of his abilities. 'He has shown time and time again his pace and speed but he has also shown how he overcomes things quickly. 'He handled the last race with dignity, it felt that he had moved on very quickly and I anticipate he will be coming here stronger than ever and I need to be ready for that.' Rosberg used the old adage that time is a great healer as he looks to regain the advantage in the title run-in. Rosberg, who hasn't won since July's German Grand Prix, pictured with his mechanics on Thursday evening . 'It is one of those moments and time is the best cure for such things,' he said of his Singapore retirement. 'It's been two weeks, which is plenty of time in the racing world. I'm here, I'm just as excited and optimistic as I was in Singapore. I've never come to Suzuka before in the most dominant car, so that's a great feeling.' Rosberg has now been forced to retire from two races this season, with Hamilton suffering the same fate on three occasions - but both have also been forced to nurse problems to the end of some grands prix. But, with Hamilton calling for improved reliability to give the drivers a 'straight battle' at the championship, Rosberg insists he is not losing any sleep over technical issues. 'I'm not worrying about reliability,' he said. 'I have this inner trust that the team is going to get the job done. I'm very confident. 'I'm not concerned, Even though it is a little weakness for us, in the big picture we have done an awesome job this year, so we mustn't now see this as a big problem for us as a team. It's a problem we have, but the big picture is absolutely spectacular.' There remains a possibility Sunday's race may yet be cancelled if the approaching Typhoon Phanfone passes close enough to Suzuka. In all likelihood any race that goes ahead will be affected by the rain and, although that would add another variable into the title mix, Rosberg is hoping for a wet race. 'The more rain the better - our car is so fast in the rain,' he added. 'I had pole at Spa the last time out when it was raining. The typhoon is very welcome!'","Hamilton leads Nico Rosberg in the drivers' standings by three points .

"Lewis Hamilton is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the Formula One World Championship. So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg . The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend.

'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility. 'In my mind I'm still hunting for it and I've got to go just as hard, if not harder, over these final races. I've just got to keep going.' After winning the last two races from pole position, Hamilton would appear to have momentum on his side. But given Mercedes' unreliability of late, he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn. 'Momentum is not something I generally talk about because it can be snatched away,' added Hamilton. Hamilton may have the momentum but Rosberg has shown how quickly it can all change over a season . 'Look at Nico. He had momentum from good results, and then one DNF (did not finish) and it was snatched away. 'I've also had that, so you just have to take it one race at a time. 'But I'm happy I've been at my best, getting the (recent) pole positions, maximising all the races. 'I now want to make sure these last five races - if I never do any more races in my life - are as good. They have to be the ones.'","Hamilton won in Singapore to move top of championship standings .

"Vijay Mallya has insisted the current difficulties he and fellow co-owner Subrata Roy are facing is having no impact on their running of Force India. At the start of the month Mallya was declared a 'wilful defaulter' by the United Bank of India due to non-payment of debts owed by his now grounded Kingfisher Airlines. A wilful defaulter is unable to borrow money from other financial institutions, could lose directorial posts in other companies, and potentially faces criminal proceedings for recovery of any debts. Vijay Mallya insists he hasn't borrowed money from any banks as he's pictured at a Kingfisher event . Roy, head of the Sahara conglomerate of businesses, is involved in a long-running dispute over his group's failure to repay billions of pounds to investors who were sold seemingly illegal bonds. Roy is currently imprisoned and working from a makeshift office in jail after failing to appear at a contempt hearing earlier this year. Speaking on the issues, Mallya said: 'Sahara Group have problems relating to funds raised from the public which the Securities and Exchange Board of India have determined were not raised as per regulations and need to be refunded. Mallya watches on after he signed Formula 1 driver Sergio Perez to Force India in December 2013 . 'Sahara claims the investors have been refunded and provided the necessary proof of refund to the Securities and Exchange Board of India. 'They don't seem to be able to verify the facts provided by Sahara. 'The agreement between Sahara and myself is they're shareholders in the team, they continue to be shareholders in the team. 'I have asked them if they would like to change the situation and they said no, they want to stay in.' Sachin Tendulkar shakes hands with Force India owner Mallya before the Indian Grand Prix . With regard to Mallya's position and the Silverstone-based marque, he added: 'As far as my situation is concerned, I'm not a borrower, I have not borrowed any money from any bank. 'Therefore all you read about may contain my name, but has to do with one of our companies, which is Kingfisher Airlines. 'If you continue to refer to me in my personal capacity, it conveys the wrong impression I'm a debtor in a sense, which I'm not. 'I've always run and managed the team which is doing better than it ever has in its history, and we're going forward from here.'","Mallya was declared a 'wilful defaulter' by the United Bank of India due to non-payment of debts .

"It is not quite a case of Lewis Hamilton versus Nico Rosberg being the only story at the Japanese Grand Prix. For, in the quiet hours of Friday morning, Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 17th birthday on Tuesday, will turn the wheel of a Formula One car for the first time at a race weekend. He will become the youngest man ever to have done so, beating Jaime Alguersuari, who made his debut in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, a fast-track promotion that caused Niki Lauda to question whether the Spaniard was safe to compete.

Verstappen believes his experience as the son of former F1 driver Jos has given him a lifetime’s preparation for the task. ‘This is a dream come true,’ said the Dutchman ahead of his introduction on the famously long and arduous Suzuka track. ‘It will be a very valuable experience, spending some time in the car and also getting used to working with everyone in the team, to prepare myself for next year. ‘I am not going there to break any records; I just want to gain experience.’ The 17-year-old appeared in good spirits as he prepares for his debut at this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix .

Sir Jackie Stewart, Britain’s most successful driver, gave Verstappen a cautious welcome, saying: ‘The world is looking at him. I’ve seen some great young drivers come into Formula One and the pressure has been too much for them. It can go either way. But, speaking on the BBC, Stewart added: ‘He’s an experienced racing driver and has won everything that can be won in karting. Toro Rosso believe they have to give him a shot.

"John Terry’s 100th Champions League appearance was clearly something to celebrate — though perhaps the Chelsea skipper was being a touch ambitious by attempting to score from 100 yards, his first-half free kick falling short and dribbling wide.

"It's been quite a week for 21-year-old Tom Thorpe. On Saturday, he made his Manchester United first-team debut with a late cameo in the 2-1 win over West Ham and then on Monday he capped a commanding performance as captain of the Under 21 side with a towering, last-minute header to beat Tottenham. But who is the latest exciting prospect to roll off the prestigious United production line? Tom Thorpe made his debut for Man United's first team in a late cameo during the 2-1 win over West Ham . Name: Tom Thorpe . Age: 21 . Club: Manchester United . Position: Centre-back . Why all the fuss? Not many players can say they've played in front of 76,000 at Old Trafford and 1,600 at Stevenage's Lamex Stadium within the space of three days, but Tom Thorpe impressed in both of these very contrasting arenas. The 21-year-old was thrown on by Louis van Gaal for his United first-team debut as they went backs-to-the-wall with 10 men to prevent West Ham stealing a stoppage time equaliser. Thorpe may have only been on the field for a few minutes but United got the job done, holding on for three precious points to alleviate the pressure on the Dutchman. Thorpe replaced Angel di Maria as United shored up their defence to hold on to the win over West Ham . 48 hours later and Thorpe was back to his day job as United's under 21 skipper as they beat Tottenham thanks to a late flurry of goals on a foggy night in Hertfordshire. Adnan Januzaj was the undoubted star attraction for those who turned out - and scored a spectacular free-kick - but the contribution of Thorpe was certainly worthy of note. He was rock solid at the back as goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard was seldom troubled and he showed tremendous presence in the air to power home a header from Januzaj's corner to settle the match 2-1 in United's favour. His goal was enough to send United top of the Under 21 Premier League too, ending a nice afterword to the extraordinary story of his weekend. Thorpe celebrates his winner for United's under 21s against Tottenham on Monday night . His goal took United to the top of the Under 21 Premier League . With United in the grip of an injury crisis, particularly at centre-half, Thorpe is likely to be again included in the squad for Sunday's home match with Everton. It was Patrick McNair that started in that position against West Ham but this weekend could see Thorpe's turn. He has waited patiently for his chance, a little longer than other members of the under 18 team he captained success in the 2011 FA Youth Cup. Of that talented crop, Tyler Blackett, Larnell Cole, Paul Pogba, Will Keane, Michael Keane, Ryan Tunnicliffe and Ravel Morrison all went on to make their first-team bows. But finally, at the age of 21, it looks like Thorpe's time has come. Louis van Gaal has not been afraid to play United's youngsters in the early weeks of the season . What's his background? For someone so young, Thorpe has already achieved plenty. As well as that Youth Cup triumph, in which United beat Sheffield United 6-3 on aggregate, he was a member of the England team that won the Under 17 European Championship back in 2010. Hailing from Manchester and a lifelong United fan, Thorpe joined United's academy at the age of 16 in July 2009 having already made half-a-dozen appearances for the club's under 18 side. He got his first taste of success in a red shirt as part of the under 17 team that retained the Milk Cup in Northern Ireland in 2009. His presence at the back is shown by the fact United conceded just two goals as they progressed through the tournament, beating County Antrim, Club Cantalao, Desportivo Brasil, Fenerbahce and Sheffield United. Thorpe lifts the FA Youth Cup after United's win over Sheffield United in the 2011 final . The summer of 2010 saw the defender sign his first professional contract and, after impressing in the youth team's eight-match unbeaten run from the beginning of the following campaign, he was elevated to the reserves. His debut at that level came on September 27, 2010 against Blackburn Rovers and he scored his first goal for them against Bolton on November 2. The season's highlight, however, was United's run in the Youth Cup which saw them defeat Portsmouth, West Ham, Newcastle United, Liverpool, Chelsea and then the Blades in the two-legged final. Thorpe had the honour of lifting the the Youth Cup at Old Trafford, the 10th time the club had won the competition. His performances earned a permanent place in the reserves squad for the 2011-2012 season and a maiden call-up to the first-team squad followed in late September, though he didn't take the field in United's League Cup win over Leeds United. The Man United team that lined up in the FA Youth Cup third round tie with Portsmouth at Altrincham in January 2011. (Back Row L-R: Tyler Blackett, Sam Johnstone, Tom Thorpe, Michael Keane, Gyliano van Velzen and Paul Pogba. Front Row L-R: John Cofie, Michele Fornasier, Larnell Cole, Ryan Tunnicliffe, William Keane) Thorpe spent some of the season out of position in midfield but he adapted admirably and was a central part of the team that won the Manchester Senior Cup, beating rivals City 2-0 in the final. More glory followed in 2012-2013 as he captained the reserves - now known as the Under 21s - to victory in the inaugural Under 21 Premier League. They beat Tottenham 3-2 in the Old Trafford final and Thorpe had yet more silverware to add to his collection. Last season saw Thorpe, as well as Blackett and Federico Macheda, head to Birmingham City for a spell on loan. Unfortunately, he wasn't able to gain the Championship game time anticipated as an ankle ligament injury curtailed his time at St Andrews. Having recovered over the summer, Thorpe returned as Under 21 captain and is now perhaps on the verge of a first-team breakthrough. Thorpe (left) and Michael Keane pose with the Under 21 Premier League trophy in 2013 . What about international honours? Thorpe has played for England at every level from Under 16s to Under 21s and has also been entrusted with leadership responsibiltiies. As mentioned, he led the Under 17s to victory in the 2010 Euros, which were staged in Liechtenstein as they beat a very talented Spain side 2-1 in the final. His first England appearance had come in the Victory Shield back in 2008 and he has played in midfield for his country on a number of occasions too. He captained the Under 19s to the semi-finals of the European Championships in 2012. Having emerged from a group containing Croatia, Serbia and France, England were beaten 2-1 by Greece in the last four of the competition staged in Estonia. Thorpe was a member of the England Under 20s squad for the World Cup in Turkey last year but the team, led by Peter Taylor, were woeful and failed to win any of their three matches. He came on as a substitute to make his Under 21 debut in England's 6-0 win over Scotland at Bramall Lane in August 2013. Thorpe takes on Chelsa's Bobby Devyne in the 2011 FA Youth Cup semi-final at Old Trafford . What are his qualities? The fact Thorpe has been handed the captain's armband for both club and country demonstrates a maturity beyond his years and leadership abilities. He is vocal at the back and good at marhsalling and motivating his team-mates. United like to play the ball out from the back and Thorpe is always aware of opposition players in his vicinity to play the correct pass. As his header against Spurs showed, Thorpe is powerful in the air, a useful attribute both at the back and from set-pieces going forward. His versatility in being able to play a central position both in defence and midfield is also an advantage. Thorpe tries to stop Liverpool's Toni Brito E Silva in an FA Youth Cup sixth round match at Anfield in 2011 . What happens now? Having gained a taste of life in the first-team, Thorpe will want more chances to show the United faithful what he can do. As long as United's defensive injury crisis continues, those opportunities could be there and Van Gaal is clearly willing to give youngsters their chance. He will continue to captain the second-string and if he continues to turn in performances as he did on Monday night, then those chances at a higher level should naturally emerge.

"Tom Thorpe’s thumping header in stoppage time gave Manchester United a dramatic win over Tottenham and sent them top of the Under 21 Premier League. The United captain rose above a static Spurs defence to power home an Adnan Januzaj corner with just seconds left on the clock. This was a contest that had meandered along for 87 minutes until Januzaj, seeking to persuade Louis van Gaal that he deserved a starting place in the first team with Wayne Rooney suspended until November, curled a breathtaking free-kick into the top corner.

Scorers: Januzaj 87; Thorpe 90+2 . Referee: Robert Hyde . Attendance: 1,671 . But straight from the re-start, United’s defence hesitated and the impressive Nathan Oduwa outjumped Anders Lindegaard in a 50-50 contest to win the bouncing ball and blast home from close range. Yet the drama wasn’t quite over as Warren Joyce’s team, in classic Man United style, plundered victory in injury time at the Lamex Stadium through a captain's intervention. Januzaj has threatened only sporadically prior to the last few minutes and put forward a weak argument that he should play ahead of Juan Mata or anyone else in the first team. But a moment of improvisation from the free-kick and an inch-perfect corner may yet persuade Van Gaal to throw him in against Everton on Sunday. United coach Joyce fielded no less than six players with first-team experience: Januzaj and Lindegaard, of course, but also Saidy Janko, Marnick Vermijl, Andreas Pereira and James Wilson. All but the Danish goalkeeper in that half-dozen were involved in that horror night at MK Dons just over a month ago. Januzaj was certainly the main attraction for the sizeable crowd assembled on a foggy night in Stevenage but his dazzling footwork was only seen in glimpses during a disappointing first-half. Tottenham's Nathan Oduwa jumps for joy after scoring his team's equalised just a minute after Januzaj's goal .

With the perfect pitch and loft, it flies over the head of goalkeeper Luke McGee and into the net. 90+1min Delivers the corner that is met by United captain Tom Thorpe to win the match . United’s only other chance of note came when Wilson, who memorably scored those two goals against Hull on his first-team debut at the fag end of last season, forced a save from Luke McGee after Janko’s mis-hit fell kindly for him. Instead it was Spurs who looked more threatening and England Under 18 international Oduwa, powerful and omnipresent, was their stand-out performer. On 11 minutes, he worked half-a-yard inside the box and curled a shot over the bar after Emmanuel Sonupe had picked him out from the right, and he seemed to have some kind of involvement in every Spurs attack after that. Just before that, Harry Winks crossed left-footed and tall frontman Daniel Akindayini couldn’t direct a difficult header on target. Cristian Ceballos also sent a flicked header wide of the mark from an Alex McQueen as Spurs continuously profited down the right. But Lindegaard wasn’t actually troubled until two minutes into the second half when Ceballos forced him into a save at his near post with a low drive. Two minutes later, he turned a vicious Oduwa shot round the post as Spurs continued to take the game to United. Mauricio Pochettino, watching from the stands, would have been impressed with his team's application.

Finally, United stirred. Dominic Ball was forced into a hasty clearance under pressure from Will Keane with McGee nowhere near it. Januzaj at last started to make his presence felt after switching to the right but his best opportunity came from a dead ball rather than dancing feet, when he curled a free-kick wide from a good position 25 yards from goal. It looked for all the world at that point we were heading for a stalemate, but the drama was just beginning.

"Manchester United keeper David de Gea claims other players are ready to step into the breach to fill the void left by Wayne Rooney's three-match suspension. Rooney will miss all his side's games in October, starting against his former side Everton on Sunday and including Chelsea's trip to Old Trafford, after being sent off during United's 2-1 Barclays Premier League win over West Ham. De Gea, speaking at the launch of Manchester United's first global sustainable technology partner Abengoa, said: 'Of course he's a really important player for us and he's the captain but we have other players ready to play these games. David de Gea claims other players are ready to step up during Wayne Rooney's three-match suspension . The Spanish goalkeeper was with Robin van Persie (right) at Old Trafford on Monday afternoon . 'We have a very important game on Sunday. We won very important points against West Ham with 10 players in a difficult match and if we win against Everton we'll be in a good position in the table. 'Fletch (Darren Fletcher) is the next captain and I think he will be a great captain. 'Of course it was a red card but Wayne Rooney is a top player and I think he has to keep going.' United's wobbly defence has conceded 13 goals in seven matches since the start of the season and De Gea admits that improvement is needed, but that a succession of injuries have disrupted the back-line. Given the firepower up front however, with Rooney, Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria all world-class players, De Gea says a good defence is now the key. He added: 'We have had a lot of injuries this season and it is difficult when you play with a different back four but I think we have a lot of good defenders. Rooney was given his marching orders by Lee Mason for kicking Stewart Downing against West Ham United . 'We have to play well and defend well - we know we have great strikers and midfielders so if we defend well we will win the games.' De Gea said there was now a 'new era' at United under manager Louis van Gaal but that the demands remained the same. He also conceded it felt strange for the players not to be involved in Champions League weeks. He said: 'It's the same club but with different people. We need to look forward and try to win titles - we know we have to (at least) be in the top four and after this we will see if we can win the league and FA Cup. 'It's strange for the team this week as this club has always been in the Champions League and it's difficult for us but now we have more time to prepare.

"Police are on alert for revenge attacks from Manchester United fans on Roma’s notorious ‘ultras’ ahead of the Italian club’s Champions League tie at the Etihad on Tuesday night. Hundreds of officers are on duty to prevent trouble between Manchester City and Roma’s hardcore supporters, who have a history of violence and disorder around Europe. But they are also aware that United’s troublemakers could use the occasion to seek reprisals for the violence that marred their infamous Champions League quarter-final against Roma in 2007. Police are on alert for revenge attacks from Manchester United fans on Roma's 'Ultras' ahead of Serie A side's clash with Man City on Tuesday night . Violence marred Manchester United's Champions League match with Roma at the Stadio Olimpico in 2007 . One Man United supporter looks dazed as blood pours from his head following violence in the Italian capital . Several United fans were stabbed before the first leg at the Stadio Olimpico and Italian police were accused of indiscriminately beating others in a series of baton charges. Francisco Totti, who once again captains Roma against City on Tuesday night, later issued a public apology to one female fan who was seen on camera being attacked without provocation, while Amnesty International were among those who called for an inquiry. Before the return leg at Old Trafford, 21 arrests were made as riot police tried to quell running battles between the two sets of fans. Roma captain Francesco Totti apologised to one female fan who was attacked without provocation in 2007 . Trouble flared again in Rome when the clubs met in the group stage later that year and a United fan was also stabbed before the 2009 Champions League final against Barcelona in the Italian capital. Roma’s return to Manchester has therefore raised as much concern over revenge attacks from United fans as the threat of clashes with City supporters. As many as 200 ultras are believed to be among the 1,600 Italian fans who have come over for the game. Most of them are expected to gather in the city centre and then march to the stadium under heavy police escort and helicopter surveillance. Ahead of the return leg in 2007, 21 arrests were made as police attemted to quell clashes between the fans .

"It is perhaps the most bizarre vote of confidence a manager has ever received — the football club owner standing outside of a London pub joking that the boss is about to be sacked. But when Newcastle chief Mike Ashley told a reporter that Alan Pardew was ‘dead, finished and over’ in Soho on Thursday night, he was as good as guaranteeing the manager’s future. Billionaire Ashley does not do Press interviews and, as his lawyers later insisted, he was ‘humouring’ the journalist who approached him while on a night out with friends. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has been under fire  of late with supporters demanding he gets sacked . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley denied he was being serious in saying manager Pardew could lose his job . Indeed, sources close to Ashley insist Pardew’s position is not under threat and he will be given time to improve results which see United bottom of the Premier League ahead of tomorrow’s trip to Stoke. Certainly, Pardew, 53, was not fazed by his paymaster’s comments. ‘I think he was trying to be supportive in his own kind of way,’ said Pardew. ‘They [the comments] are what they are and unfortunately we have had those sort of headlines for two or three weeks. ‘Sometimes things are taken out of context. If it was a sit-down interview done in a serious manner I’d be a lot more concerned than I am now, that’s for sure. The focus for me really can only be Monday night.’ Supporters held posters last week making it clear they want Pardew sacked as Newcastle United manager . He added: ‘[The owner] is obviously very keen for us to get victories, that’s what he’s about. That’s what we’re about, winning. ‘I’ve been under pressure at this club for a number of weeks now. All I can focus on now is the team and that’s what I’ll do.’ Ashley had been quoted in The Independent as saying: ‘One more game — if we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he’s gone. I have had enough. ‘Dead. Finished. Over. One more game then that’s it. What would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it has cost me a lot. I won’t put up with it any more. Honestly, answer me, what would you do? One more loss and he’s gone, he’s over, finished.’ Ashley: 'If we lose against Stoke on Monday night then he's gone. I have had enough. Dead. Finished. Over' But Ashley’s lawyers have since maintained: ‘Mr Ashley responded, tongue in cheek, that Mr Pardew had two more games before being sacked. ‘To put this into perspective, over the past few weeks certain reports have stated that they believe that Mr Pardew has two more games before being sacked. Mr Ashley was therefore humouring the reporter.’ A spirited comeback to draw 2-2 with Hull last weekend followed by a midweek win at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup has eased the pressure on Pardew. Papiss Cisse came from the bench to score twice against Hull, while £6million signing Emmanuel Riviere broke his duck for the club with a double at Selhurst Park. And Pardew says his own mood has been cheered by events of the past week. ‘You’re going to carry some scars so it does change your mood when you get lifts like we’ve had this week,’ he said. ‘In particular in the striking department we’ve really had a lift. Pardew was heartened by the 3-2 Capital One cup win against Crystal Palace in midweek . ‘We’ve looked OK in the majority of games and have deserved more points than we have. But at the same time we’ve looked like we’re not going to score too many goals. ‘The lift from the strikers has helped the squad and it will certainly settle us.’ It was during a 1-0 defeat by Stoke in April that Newcastle supporters rounded on Pardew amid his lingering fallout with Hatem Ben Arfa, who eventually joined Hull on loan last month. Again, during United’s last away outing in the league — a 4-0 defeat by Southampton — fans called for their manager to go. But planned protests in the subsequent home match with Hull were muted and the travelling contingent at Palace were supportive of the team. The Magpies salvaged a 2-2 draw against Hull in their last league game, with Papiss Cisse scoring twice . ‘We can’t argue with how the fans responded to us at Crystal Palace,’ said Pardew. ‘If they could replicate that at Stoke I would be absolutely delighted. ‘We’ve had two morale-boosting displays, the comeback draw against Hull and then the win at Crystal Palace which gives us something to lean on. ‘That’s given us all a lift and we go to Stoke looking for our first win. We must do better than just getting one win, of course, because there are a lot of games to go.’","Alan Pardew believes Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was being supportive in a bizarre kind of way after recent comments emerged after a night out .

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes admits he tried to sign Emmanuel Riviere during the summer - and says the goal-shy Newcastle striker will be a hit in the Premier League. The Monaco frontman joined the Magpies in a £6million deal and has started every game for his new club, although he is yet to open his account in the league. Riviere did, however, score twice during last week’s 3-2 win at Crystal Palace in the Capital One Cup and that has persuaded manager Alan Pardew to keep faith with the 24-year-old for Monday’s trip to the Britannia Stadium. Mark Hughes revealed Stoke tried to sign Newcastle forward Emmanuel Riviere during the summer . Hughes said that although they showed interest in Riviere the feeling didn't appear to be reciprocated . And Hughes revealed: ‘We had conversations with people close to him. ‘There was an indication he may be available this summer, so we pursued it to a certain extent. We were able to go and offer decent money but there has to be a feeling the enthusiasm we have for a certain player is reciprocated. We didn’t get that from the player or his advisers. ‘There’s always a point during the window where you think you have to draw a line under that one. That was the case with him.’ He added: ‘I have a lot of respect for his ability. He will be a good player in the Premier League. But it is not easy coming to a new country.’ The nformer Monaco man scored his first goals for Newcastle in their 3-2 win over Crystal Palace last week .

"Alan Pardew was still absorbing the impact of Peter Crouch’s goal when lightning flashed over the Britannia Stadium and the rumble of thunder drowned the sound of ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’. A storm is breaking over the Newcastle manager right now. Another defeat reopens the debate over his future, not that the subject was ever really closed. Newcastle fans hold up a banner portraying Alan Pardew as Pinocchio with the word hopeless underneath . Fans young and old called for the head of Pardew during defeat at Stoke City on Monday night . Indeed, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley kept his manager’s position in the news at the weekend by telling a reporter that Pardew would be ‘dead, finished and over’ if the team were beaten at Stoke. Ashley insists he was joking but the 1,751 in the away end, however, were not laughing on Monday night. Before a ball had been kicked they unfurled a ‘Pardew is a muppet’ banner, while ‘Sack Pardew’ cards — left over from the 2-2 draw with Hull last weekend — were also scattered among the travelling contingent. Newcastle supporters display a banner calling for the removal of manager Alan Pardew . Newcastle fans vent their anger at the club's owner Mike Ashley during Monday's game at Stoke . Newcastle manager Pardew acknowledges the travelling fans after the final whistle . It was during this fixture last season, a 1-0 win for Stoke in April, that fans rounded on Pardew. On that occasion, though, he was serving a touchline ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler and so was spared their scorn on the walk from dugout to tunnel. There was no hiding last night and, on half-time, they called for his head as he passed in front of them. It is easy to see why. For since Newcastle smashed Stoke 5-1 at St James’ Park on Boxing Day, Pardew’s side have won just five of 27 Premier League games. That is a return of 19 points from a possible 81. Newcastle fans hold up placards calling for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked . Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was at the Britannia Stadium to watch side lose to Stoke . Pardew remains defiant. ‘I was born battle-hard so that comes natural to me,’ he said. ‘It’s been tough because you want the fans to be behind you. They are questioning everything I do and that’s understandable, but I have to remain strong and makes sure I’m giving the team everything I can.’ Pardew’s fortitude is academic, however. It is whether Ashley is willing to remain strong in his support. He was here to witness this latest defeat and looked far from his ‘jokey’ self. No, there will be few smiling on Tyneside and, as another storm cloud gathers, Pardew is once again the lightning rod for supporter unrest.","Newcastle fans sang ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’ at Alan Pardew during 1-0 defeat at Stoke .

"Laurent Koscielny is hoping his name doesn't appear in the Guinness Book of Records anytime soon. It was revealed earlier this week that the Arsenal defender has conceded the most amount of penalties in the Premier League since August 2010. The Gunners centre half took his tally to seven in four seasons when he hacked down Eden Hazard last weekend during the 2-0 defeat by title rivals Chelsea.

Hazard converted the spot kick in the 27th minute to give Jose Mourinho's men the lead before Diego Costa sealed victory 12 minutes from time. Amazingly, Arsenal team-mate Wojciech Szczesny is just one place below Koscielny on the list of shame. And the defender, who is away on international duty with France ahead of their friendlies against Portugal (October 11) and Armenia (October 14), admits it is an area in which he must improve. 'I don’t know if Guinness have a record for that,' said Koscielny. 'Unfortunately, we do not choose. It’s something I have to resolve earlier in the play. 'When Eden comes very quickly, he either scores or I clear the ball. It was toss of a coin. 'I do not pass judgment on what you think of my games or my mistakes.

"Six games unbeaten but thoughts of invincibility couldn’t be further from Arsene Wenger’s mind. Not when he feels so exposed. Arsenal’s manager had a lot to consider after this north London derby, not least how he finds his squad threadbare in defence and midfield after £76million of summer spending. The latter of those departments was decimated here — Jack Wilshere hurting his right ankle and Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta falling to respective hamstring and calf injuries. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain wheels away after equalising for Arsenal against Spurs . The England midfielder gave Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris no chance from close range . Michael Oliver’s booking of Tottenham’s Nacer Chadli (left) after he celebrated his opening goal by cupping his hand behind his ear might have seemed harsh to some. However, Oliver obviously believed Chadli was trying to wind up Arsenal fans in such a heated local derby. I once cautioned Frank Lampard for the same thing at Anfield — much to his dismay. Curiously, Steven Gerrard did the same thing against Everton on Saturday and no action was taken against him. Wenger sought an investigation into how Ramsey and Arteta’s injuries could occur after being rested against Southampton in midweek, though his more pressing concern is that his midfield screen team will now miss this week’s crucial games against Galatasaray and Chelsea. The loss of Ramsey, brilliant for 45 minutes before injury against Spurs, will doubtless sting a side struggling to convert chances. But Arteta’s absence is more immediately significant considering the lack of rearguard options available, with Mathieu Flamini filling the gap on Saturday and making the mistake that allowed Nacer Chadli to score Spurs’ opener. Wilshere will be assessed further on Monday, but is likely to miss Wednesday’s Galatasaray tie. ‘I can play in midfield,’ was Wenger’s take on the dilemma. ‘I would consider playing Calum Chambers there. But I only have four defenders at the moment. Flamini is the only option I see.’ Chambers himself is throwing up something of an issue. The England defender, deputising at right back for the injured Mathieu Debuchy, is looking with each game to be a superb signing at £12m and 19 years old. But he’s also acquired four yellow cards and is one from a defence-wrecking suspension. Arsenal had no specialist defenders on the bench, though Wenger will not curb Chambers’ style. Jack Wilshere is a doubt for Wednesday's match with Galatasaray after picking up an injury . And Aaron Ramsey (left) and Mikel Arteta will definitely sit out the visit of the Turkish side . Arsenal have scored 11 goals this season, but their chance conversion rate is still only the 11th best in the Premier League . ‘He has to play his game,’ Wenger said. ‘The fact he is keen and committed maybe sometimes leads him to commit spectacular fouls. ‘It’s remarkable what he’s doing at the age of 19. It’s not often you see that quality at his age.’ Quality around the opposition box, particularly from corners, would have made the difference on Saturday. Arsenal had 16 shots to Tottenham’s six, but could only draw for the fourth time this term. After three games without a win, Galatasaray - who travel to the Emirates on Wednesday - beat Sivasspor 2-1 in the Turkish Super League to ease the pressure on new manager Cesare Prandelli. Wesley Sneijder was on form as Prandelli's men triumphed over Sivasspor, managed by Roberto Carlos, thanks to first half strikes from Aurelien Chedjou and Burak Yilmaz. They move up to fifth . Mesut Ozil was only fleetingly impressive, while Danny Welbeck was poor and £35m forward Alexis Sanchez started on the bench. Wenger indicated Welbeck and Sanchez lack confidence. ‘We need to give some time to Welbeck and Sanchez to gain some confidence,’ Wenger said. ‘But we have Ramsey, (Alex) Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ozil and Santi Cazorla so we have enough players who can score.’ Asked if Sanchez was struggling with confidence, Wenger said: ‘He has scored goals, until now. I’m sure he’ll score 15 to 20 goals.’ Spurs nearly emerged from a jerky performance with a win, only for Oxlade-Chamberlain to equalise late on. Mauricio Pochettino said: ‘The players need time to adapt to our philosophy because we play in a different system.’ Like our Arsenal Facebook page.","A late goal from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain rescued a point for Arsenal in the North London derby .

"A familiar face from the past returned to Dens Park yesterday to catch up with old friends and to pick up a Player of the Year trophy he won back in 2001-02. But despite the 12-year absence, it was almost as if Temuri Ketsbaia had never been away. As had been the case when he first arrived as a player at Dundee in October 2001, Ketsbaia was blown away by a welcome as warm as the unseasonably hot sun that beat down over Tayside. While he was being shown around by Dundee director of football operations John Nelms, up popped long-serving groundsman Brian Robertson whom Kestabaia immediately greeted like an old friend, before joking that his grass was far better now than back in the day. Temuri Ketsbaia shot to fame when he repeatedly kicked an advertising board after scoring for Newcastle . He played 78 times for Newcastle, pictured after scoring against Southampton at St James Park . Ketsbaia would make it clear, though, that the way he was treated by people like Robertson made it feel like the Dark Blues’ pitch was the place where he played his best football in the UK. That included his spells at Wolves, and, most notably, as a gifted but cantankerous midfielder at Newcastle United where he shot to fame by angrily kicking an advertising board after scoring a late winner against Bolton in 1998. And yet, while Ketsbaia revelled in the familiarity of it all, he admitted that his return as manager of the Georgian national team for Saturday’s crucial European qualifier has made him see how Scottish football is a completely alien environment to the one he left behind all those years ago. All it took was a glance at the Scottish Premiership league table. The 46-year-old already knew that Rangers and Hearts were out of the top flight due to financial mismanagement while Hibs had joined them in the Championship due to rank incompetency. But to see it there in black and white that the once-mighty Celtic, struggling so badly under Ronny Deila, were sitting in a previously unthinkable sixth-place in the table merely under-scored the old line that the past is indeed a foreign country. Ketsbaia has been manager of the Georgian national team since 2009 . In Ketsbaia’s mind, however, Scottish’s football’s well-publicised problems should be seen as an opportunity for clubs like his beloved Dundee. He feels that, in 2014, the opportunity is there for provincial sides to win the Scottish title; an ambition which proved far beyond Dundee even in the days when he earned £10,000-per-week there and starred alongside gifted talents including Juan Sara, Fabian Caballero and his Georgian international teammate Zurab Khizanishvili. ‘Scottish football is now very different,’ nodded Ketsbaia ahead of his showdown with Gordon Strachan’s men at Ibrox on Saturday. ‘We were just talking about this earlier. The best clubs in Scotland - Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian - they are all now in the second tier. ‘And Celtic are not doing very well either. They did not qualify for the Champions League, and they are not doing very well in the league. ‘Usually by now they are already saying Celtic are the champions of Scotland. But, right now, they are six points behind the leaders (Hamilton). His Georgia side face a tough test against Scotland when the two sides meet on Saturday evening . ‘So I think maybe it is time for the other teams in Scotland to challenge for the championship. There is not big money available in Scotland any more, even at Rangers and Celtic, so everything is possible. ‘Do I really believe another team outwith Celtic can win the title? Yes, that is what I am saying. It is possible. It is not the same Celtic as before. They have shown they are not unbeatable.’ For Ketsbaia, a swift saunter across the Dens Park turf doubled as a walk down memory lane. Albeit to a season when Dundee, for all the spending that would eventually see them end up in administration, finished an unimpressive ninth in the Scottish top flight. ‘I really enjoyed my football at Dundee,’ he smiles afterwards. ‘I played in Britain for five years, and the best I ever played was here. It was because I knew I was an important player for the club and I didn’t have the pressure of having to be the best every week to play the next game. ‘That really helped me to play my best football. I scored six goals and I really enjoyed it. While managing Anorthosis Famagusta in 2008, Ketsbaia came up against Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan . ‘I was sad that I did not stay for the next year but unfortunately I got injured playing with the national team and it was difficult for me with my knee to come back and play here. ‘But it’s nice to be back and to see where I used to play. It’s nice to see them doing well, too. ‘I think, for Dundee, they need to stay in the Premiership and it won’t be a problem. After that, you build slowly. You cannot build a new team in one year – not unless you spend millions of pounds, like in the past. ‘I wish to see this club continue to grow slowly and hopefully to one day win some trophies.’ Ketsbaia is no longer in touch with his former Dundee manager, the Italian Ivano Bonetti. But he asked after old friends like Barry Smith, the club captain who now manages Championship side Alloa Athletic. He also will never forget Steven Milne, the striker who is now manager of junior side Forfar Albion. As Ketsbaian collected a specially-made trophy from Dundee to mark his Player of the Year award 12 years ago, he recalled how Milne preventing him from winning a clean sweep in 2002. ‘We went to the different supporters’ club’s Player of the Year dinners,” he recalled. Ketsbaia battles with Barnsley's Jovo Bosancic in a Premiership clash in the 1997/98 season . ‘I missed out on only one Player of the Year award. I got them all except one! Milne, the forward, got the other one. You see, I lost only one and even now I still remember who got it! ‘It’s good to know Milne is still in football and so, too, is Barry, our captain. That’s very good. He was a good character and also a very nice guy in the team, on the pitch, and outside the pitch. I wish him all the best. ‘It’s good that people from my old team continue to be in football. Unfortunately, there are so many people involved in football now who have no idea and it is destroying the game. It’s better to have men who have been in football and understand football running things than people who want control just because they have money.’ Next up on Ketsbaia’s nostalgic tour of Scotland will be Ibrox on Saturday as his Georgians seek to inflict some serious damage on Scotland’s bid to reach Euro 2016. His only appearances there as a player saw Dundee lose 2-1 in February 2002 and Cypriot side Anorthosis Famagusta defeated 2-0 in a Champions League qualifier in 2005. ‘Ibrox is a good stadium with a nice crowd and it will be a good atmosphere to play football in,’ he said. ‘Will I be kicking any advertising boards if we win (like at Newcastle)? No, I only kicked them as a player. But if anyone thinks it’s going to be easy against us, it’s not.’ Just because Temuri Ketsbaia is an avowed fan of Scottish football won’t stop the Georgians trying to add to our woes.","Temuri Ketsbaia played for Dundee between 2001 and 2002, where he won Player of the Year despite only making 22 appearances .

"Ryan Bertrand can develop the goal threat to break back into the England squad, according to Southampton team-mate Jose Fonte. The on-loan Chelsea full-back blasted his first Saints goal as Ronald Koeman's men saw off QPR 2-1 at St Mary's on Saturday. Bertrand has two England caps and a Champions League winners' medal, but his season-long switch to Southampton is his ninth loan stint away from Chelsea. Ryan Bertrand smashes in his first Southampton goal past QPR goalkeeper Rob Green . The on-loan Chelsea left-back celebrates victory over QPR with his Southampton team-mates . Captain Fonte believes Southampton can now help 25-year-old Bertrand force his way back into Roy Hodgson's England plans. 'I've been telling him a lot he needs to get forward, that he needs to start scoring goals to get in the England squad,' said Fonte. 'He has the ability for that. He's a great player and he's been great for us so far. 'He came and he gelled very well. Also, we want to keep pushing him so he can be better and better. An animated Ronald Koeman shouts instructions to his Saints players from the touchline . Ryan Bertrand also put his defensive abilities to good use, clearing off the line from Wilfried Bony . Graziano Pelle wins the game for Southampton with an amazing acrobatic effort . And the Italian striker wheeled away to celebrate with his delirious team-mates . 'He's a player with a great pedigree. 'I think he's enjoying it here: we gave him a lot of confidence, a lot of self-belief. 'He's matured now, he's a little bit older and everything's getting together for him. 'I just hope he can keep pushing on, and I hope he can get in the England squad.' Southampton manager Koeman won 78 caps for Holland as a defender packing a goal threat, and he can see a kindred attacking spirit in Bertrand.

'We spoke about the possibilities after (Luke) Shaw went to United because we needed a player in that position,' said Koeman. 'If you are a Chelsea player that means you have good quality but he missed playing regular games. 'I like him as a player because he's an offensive left full-back. 'He has shown his qualities from the first day, but I expected this kind of quality. 'All he needed was to play every weekend, and now he's doing that it makes him stronger and more confident.'","Ryan Bertrand scored his first goal for Southampton in the 2-1 win over QPR .

"ARSENAL . Borsussia Dortmund . Galatasaray . Anderlecht . Arsenal were handed a difficult group in the Champions League despite being placed amongst the top seeds. Arsene Wenger's side were drawn against 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund in perhaps the toughest group they could have been given. The two sides met in last season's group stage, with Arsenal losing at home but winning against Jurgen Klopp's team in Germany. Tough task: Arsenal's reward for beating Besiktas is a group featuring two top sides . Borussia Dortmund . Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 6 W 3 L 2 D 1 . Star man: Marco Reus . Manager: Jurgen Klopp . Stadium: Westfalenstadion . European pedigree: Although not traditionally a giant of European football, over the past few years Dortmund have become on of the most feared sides in the Champions League. Klopp built a fabulous squad which shocked Real Madrid on the way to the 2013 final, and despite selling Mario Goetze and Robert Lewandowski to domestic rivals Bayern Munich, they are still a threat. Did you know: Borussia Dortmund reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League last season, despite having a smaller wage bill than Championship QPR. Galatasaray . Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 1 W 0 L 0 D 1 . Star man: Wesley Sneijder . Manager: Cesare Prandelli . Stadium: Turk Telekom Arena . European pedigree: Champions League regulars, but the Turks haven't been past the quarter-finals in the past two decades. However, they won the UEFA Cup in 2000, beating Arsenal on penalties in the final, and have managed to get out of their groups in each of the last two seasons. Did you know: Galatasaray's trip to the Emirates will see a return for former Arsenal favourite Emmanuel Eboue. The Ivorian full-back spent six years with the Gunners and became an unlikely hero after once being booed off the pitch by his own supporters. Anderlecht . Arsenal's Head-to-head: P 2 W 1 L 1 D 0 . Star man: Steven Defour . Manager: Besnik Hasi . Stadium: Constant Vanden Stock Stadium . European pedigree: A well-known name in European football, but always just outside of the elite. Last season saw Anderlecht pick up just one point in the Champions League group stages and, despite a talented young squad, they can expect little more this time. Did you know: Arsenal's only previous meeting with Anderlecht came in the final of the 1970 Fairs Cup, when they won 4-3 on aggregate (1-3 away, 3-0 at home) Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season . Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year . Excited: Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta didn't seem too unhappy with a difficult draw . The Gunners will have to travel to Turkey to face Galatasaray in one of the most daunting trips European football has to offer. Arsenal have already seen off Turkish side Besiktas in qualifying but struggled in the away leg, which they drew 0-0. On paper the easiest game Arsenal will play is against Belgian champions Anderlecht, but they will face a struggle to top the group and potentially avoid the biggest names in Europe in the second round.

"Chelsea club secretary David Barnard said manager Jose Mourinho had declared himself 'happy' with their Champions League draw. Mourinho's side were handed the simplest task of the English sides, as they were put in a group with German side Schalke, Portuguese club Sporting Lisbon and Maribor of Slovenia. And the Chelsea boss was quick to tell his colleague that he was satisfied with the prospect. Happy: Jose Mourinho said that Chelsea's draw was better than any of the other English sides got . Back again: Chelsea beat Schalke twice last season at the same stage in the Champions League . Barnard said: 'He texted me to say he was happy. Would you rather be in the groups with the other English clubs? You have got to be happy with that.' Horst Heldt, Schalke sporting director insisted however they would be out for revenge. He said: 'Our aim is the same as in recent years: We want to get through the group stage. We still have a score to settle with Chelsea, as we lost both matches to them last season.' Liverpool were given a rather tougher draw pitted against holders Real Madrid. Revenge: Schalke sporting director Horst Heldt believes his team can get a difficult result this time round . Madrid may be a daunting prospect for Brendan Rodgers' side, but Liverpool beat the Spanish giants 5-0 on aggregate in 2009 including a 4-0 hammering at Anfield. Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre said the the club were thrilled at the draw - and can cope without Luis Suarez following his move to Barcelona. Ayre, speaking after the draw in Monaco, said: 'You would never not want Luis - Luis is a fantastic player and made a fantastic contribution to Liverpool but so did a lot of other people. Leading the line: Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre says Daniel Sturridge can replace Luis Suarez's goals . Difficult draw: Last time Liverpool played Real was in 2009, but both teams have changed a lot since then . 'A lot of the goals that Daniel Sturridge scored were amazingly important for us last season and he will still be there banging them in and we are seeing goals from all over the park last season. 'So I think we are in great shape and will keep developing and improving.' He added: 'If you look at Liverpool as a football club this is our competition, we've won it five times and to play someone who has won it 10 times makes it extra special.' Arsenal's draw sees them face a difficult trip to Turkey to face Galatasaray, as well as playing 2013 finalists Borussia Dortmund. Still there: Club captain Steven Gerrard scored twice as Liverpool beat Madrid 4-0 four years ago . Arsenal's club secretary David Miles said: 'We know Borussia Dortmund well of course, and we are looking forward to it and hopefully can progress through this group - with the pre-requisite being to aim to finish top of the group. 'There were some tough teams in pot four we should have got and fortunately we steered clear of those.' VIDEO Klopp wary of 'easy' tag . Re-match: Robert Lewandowski, now departed from Dortmund, scored twice at the Emirates last season . Achievable: Arsenal hit back in Germany and managed to get out of their group in second place last year . Manchester City were given the toughest task of the English teams, facing German giants Bayern Munich and Serie A runners up Roma. Barcelona and Paris St Germain should dominate Group F, where they were drawn with Ajax and APOEL from Cyprus, while last season's beaten finalists Atletico Madrid are in Group A with Juventus, Olympiacos and Malmo.

"Gareth Bale believes beating Bosnia and Herzegovina on Friday night will be the first step to football overtaking rugby in Wales. The Real Madrid superstar became the first player to be named Welsh footballer of the year for a fourth time at a Cardiff ceremony on Monday night but it is a place at the Euro 2016 finals in France that Bale really craves. Wales have not qualified for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup in Sweden and Bale reckons that if Chris Coleman's side were to end that long wait then even the national sport of rugby would be eclipsed. Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring a late winner for Wales against Andorra last month . Bale shares a joke with Jonny Williams as he trains with the Wales squad in September . That would be some task given Wales have won three Six Nations Grand Slams in the last 10 years and came within a penalty kick of reaching the Rugby World Cup final in 2011, but Bale believes Welsh football is on the threshold of a great new era. 'We have massive potential and I want to make history with Wales and qualify for a major tournament,' Bale said after picking up his fourth Welsh player of the year award in five years. 'I feel football can overtake rugby soon. I remember when I was younger the Millennium Stadium was full every time I went to watch. 'Rugby has obviously overtaken it in recent years but I feel football is on the incline and we can get a lot of fans to the games and get the support behind us. 'It's not only important for us as a team to get to a major championship, but as a nation as a whole. 'We want to inspire more kids to play football and become a better national team.' The Wales rugby team celebrate their Grand Slam at the 2012 Six Nations Championship . Bale spared Welsh blushes in Andorra last month with his double strike, including a superb late free-kick winner, seeing off the Pyrenees part-timers and ensuring the Euro 2016 campaign would get off to a winning start. Despite the loss of key midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen through injury for this week's home qualifiers against Bosnia and Cyprus, expectations remain high around Coleman's squad with Bale providing the stardust to a group full of Barclays Premier League players. That optimism has been reflected by a dramatic rise up the FIFA rankings as Wales have climbed to 29th in the world, just two places short of their all-time high of 20 years ago. 'We've been together for quite a long time now, we get along really well and it's really a tight-knit group,' Bale said. Bale celebrates with Cristiano Ronaldo after the Portuguese forward scored for Real Madrid at the weekend . 'We're growing as players and as long as everyone stays committed and working hard we can go on to achieve our goals. 'We've got off to a positive start in the group with three points and we feel we've got the momentum behind us. 'We want to carry that into the next game and get a positive result.' Bosnia are first up at the Cardiff City Stadium on Friday and it is only four months since Safet Susic's side were gracing the World Cup finals in Brazil. But Bosnia surprisingly lost their opening Euro 2016 qualifier at home to Cyprus last month and Susic's future is said to be far from clear. 'We know they're a very good side, they showed that by getting to the World Cup and they've obviously got some good players,' Bale said. Bale will come up against Manchester City striker Edin Dzeko (above) when Wales face Bosnia on Friday night . 'But we believe in ourselves and hopefully we can get the victory on Friday. 'We've got two massive games but we just want to concentrate on Friday and not think about anything else. 'The fans can be the extra man. We haven't had too many big crowds in the past but I really feel we're on the rise now. 'As a team we're playing better and getting the right results and that shows in the rankings. 'We all firmly believe we're pushing in the right direction, and hopefully the fans will come out and support us and we can give them a good performance.","Gareth Bale named Welsh footballer of the year on Monday night .

"Garry Monk feels referees are giving Swansea a raw deal because they see his side as a soft target. Swansea have had Wilfried Bony and Angel Rangel sent off in their last two Barclays Premier League matches and manager Monk admits he has been left bemused by what he sees as refereeing inconsistencies in games involving his team this season. Monk says he has studied every single Swansea game on tape and expressed his concerns at an hour-long meeting he had with officials at the Liberty Stadium this week - but insists he won't stop drumming a fair play philosophy into his players even if it hurts them on the pitch. Swansea have had Wilfried Bony and Angel Rangel sent off in their last two Barclays Premier League matches . 'I just feel at this moment in time it is far too easy to book a Swansea City player,' Monk said ahead of Newcastle's visit to south Wales on Saturday. 'I have analysed every single foul we have committed this season and every foul against us, and in terms of the consistency level it does not add up. 'We are getting punished for everything but some teams come here and they commit five or six fouls straight away. 'Their plan is to be physical and that is the whole game plan, and when we stand up for ourselves we get punished for it. 'I don't know why it is, we try to play good football while other teams think the best way to stop that is to be physical and get in our faces. 'Maybe we are too much of an easy target.' Swansea boss Garry Monk feels his side are being harshly punished by referees . Monk revealed current Premier League referee Chris Foy, former official Alan Wiley and John Walton, of the Referees' Association, visited Swansea this week to discuss refereeing issues and hear his concerns. Ironically, Foy was in charge of Swansea's goalless draw at Sunderland last weekend when Rangel was sent off for two bookable offences, Monk being particularly unhappy with the nature of the second yellow card when he was adjudged to have obstructed Black Cats winger Will Buckley. 'If you look at Angel's second booking, what do you want him to do?' Monk asked. 'He cannot disappear, and in the lead up to his first one there was a foul against us that was not given. 'Those decisions go more against us than for us.' Monk also said he was exasperated by Sunderland striker Connor Wickham constantly going to ground at the Stadium of Light and questioned why Foy kept awarding him free-kicks in such circumstances. He promised that Swansea players would be fined if they did the same thing, saying winning that way would give him no satisfaction whatsoever. Chris Foy was among the officials who visited the Liberty Stadium this week . 'I talked to them about Wickham's performance at Sunderland,' Monk said of his meeting with the officials. 'He had the ball played up to him 13 times and on nine of those occasions he was on the floor. He is 6ft 3ins and about 14-15 stone, the same weight as Bony. 'But do Bony and Bafe (Gomis) go on the floor? No, because we promote for them to stay on the feet. 'I clocked what Wickham was doing straight away and I said to the linesman in front of me 'you watch the next time the ball gets played to him, he'll be on the floor. 'He did go to ground, so what does that tell you? That he is going to get the decision if he goes on the floor, and that is hard to take because you run the risk of yellow and red cards. Monk was particularly exasperated by Sunderland striker Connor Wickham constantly going to ground . 'But I have said to the players if we are going to win we will win properly because you will get more satisfaction out of it. 'That will be the way I want to do it, but I understand the players must feel the reward on Saturday. 'I don't believe in players going to ground if they have not been touched, if that were to happen I would deal with it afterwards.' Monk said Foy told him West Ham manager Sam Allardyce spoke to the Referees' Association about the difference between perceived big clubs and small clubs. 'Referees have a tough job and I am sure it is not intentional, but at this moment in time we seem to get punished for everything,' Monk said. 'I am not saying we do not make fouls that are yellow cards, but overall it looks too easy to punish us. 'We showed them examples and they could see clearly what I was talking about. 'It is so unjust and the way we play means we need more protection.'","Swansea have had Wilfried Bony and Angel Rangel sent off in their last two Premier League matches .

"Apple's CEO has launched a furious attack on claims the firm is able to access user's content in the wake of the iCloud hacking scandal. He also said claims the NSA had backdoors into Apple servers were untrue - telling Charlie Rose: 'We would never allow that to happen, they would have to cart us out in a box before we did that.' He said: 'We’re not reading your email, we’re not reading your iMessages. Scroll down for video . During an interview with US chat show host Charlie Rose, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) said: ‘TV is [a product] we continue to have interest in, but it's stuck back in the seventies. When you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock' Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011. Earlier this year, reports claimed Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV had been delayed until next year. Apple engineers working on the gadget were told not to expect it to launch until 2015, and the delay was blamed on cable companies refusing to do deal. Rumours claim Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures. The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV, as well as films and TV shows. It is also expected to be able to run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control. 'If the government laid a subpoena on us to get your iMessages, we can’t provide it. 'It’s encrypted and we don’t have the key. The door is closed.' But our business is based on selling these (pointing to an iPhone). 'It is not based on having information about you.' Cook also took aim at Google in the interview, although refused to name them. 'If they are making money by collecting gobs of personal data, you should be worried. 'From our point of view, we don't want it. 'I'm offended by lots of it - I think people have a right to privacy. 'For us, what we wanted was instantly to be totally transparent. In  a previous part of the interview, Cook addressed the iCloud breach, telling Rose . 'It wasn't hacked. There's a misunderstanding about this. 'What happened was, let's take you as an example. Somebody could say 'I know Charlie's ID' somehow, maybe it's his email, and they may guess your password. 'Or, that's not as likely—they might phish it. How do you phish it? I could pretend to be somebody else, and you could unknowingly give me your password. And that happens on the internet too many times today. 'That's the number one issue by far, and it's not just an Apple issue. This is an internet issue.' The first part of Cook's interview also covered Apple TV. Rumours of an all-in-one Apple TV set, that will broadcast live shows, has been on the cards since 2011 - but another launch event has passed without it making an appearance. Now Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook has revealed that TV is an area the firm continues to have great interest in, but admitted ‘if we’re really honest, it’s stuck back in the seventies.’ ‘The hardest decisions we make are all the things not to work on,‘ Mr Cook told the chat show host. ‘There’s lots of things we have interest in, but we know we can’t do everything great.’ When asked if TV was one of those examples, Mr Cook replied: ‘TV is one that we continue to have great interest in, but TV is one of those things that, if we’re really honest, it's stuck back in the seventies. ‘Think about how much your life has changed, and yet when you go in your living room to watch the TV, it almost feels like you’re rewinding the clock, and you've entered a time capsule.' He continued that the ‘interface is terrible' and people only watch shows when they come on, unless they remember to record them. However, PC Pro's Barry Collins believes Mr Cook is wrong. Mr Collins wrote: 'The stress of last week’s big Apple announcements must be getting to Tim Cook. 'The man needs a holiday. 'That can be the only explanation for some bizarre comments he made over the weekend, when he was asked about Apple’s TV plans.' He then goes on to explain all the ways in which TV has developed and advanced since the large, bulky sets of the 70s and the piles of videos using a series of pictures. Similarly, finance journalist Aaron Pressman tweeted: 'TV is stuck in the 70s? It’s too annoying to pay by credit card? @tim_cook needs to get out of his Apple bubble a bit more.'

"‘If you want to pay money, that’s what you want to see.’ Who said that less than a year ago about Hatem Ben Arfa? You guessed it right – Alan Pardew. It was after a sensational performance I had witnessed from the Frenchman at Villa Park where he scored one and set up the winner in a 2-1 victory for Newcastle United. Ben Arfa was simply brilliant that day, he was a joy to watch. The criticism was that he didn’t do it consistently enough, yet the week before that virtuoso Villa performance Ben Arfa has curled in a brilliant winner against Fulham. VIDEO Scroll down for Ben Arfa's Tupac tribute . Maverick: Hatem Ben Arfa left Newcastle and joined Hull on deadline day . I’ve lived and worked in Newcastle, and I regularly covered games at St James’ Park. I’m well aware the fans on Tyneside love their No 9s, but they also love a flair player and Ben Arfa is a special talent. But he’s a player who needs managing correctly, and I think it’s a shame for Pardew that he has seemingly waved the white flag with such a good player. Having followed Pardew’s managerial career closely, I know he has sometimes expressed disappointment that he doesn’t get the credit he feels he deserves. Admitting defeat: Alan Pardew has waved the white flag with Ben Arfa . I can understand where he is coming from. But managing a player like Ben Arfa and getting the best out of him would separate Pardew from some of the rest, and give people a reason to look at him in a different light. But Pardew has held his hands up and admitted defeat – he cannot ‘manage a maverick.’ Kevin Keegan did it with David Ginola, Sir Alex Ferguson with Eric Cantona, but Pardew has separated himself from the chance of getting anywhere near that kind of greatness by fundamentally refusing to work with Ben Arfa. Special talent: Ben Arfa proved to be a very special player at times for Newcastle . It could be a special signing for Hull City. And Steve Bruce can draw on his experience with the man who he describes as the ‘hurricane’, Cantona. Bruce was the Frenchman’s captain at Manchester United, the Hull boss was a leader in the dressing room the night of Cantona’s kung fu kick at Selhurst Park in 1995. Given all his experience of Cantona, if Bruce can’t get the best out of Ben Arfa then the player will have to take a long hard look at himself. But if Bruce gets Ben Arfa doing special things on the pitch, Pardew will be left to face more criticism from the demanding Geordie faithful. This time it will be totally justified. Been there before: Steve Bruce was Eric Cantona's captain at Manchester United and got the best out of him .","Alan Pardew has waved the white flag by selling Hatem Ben Arfa .

"Head coach Alan Irvine has warned West Brom they must be prepared to face Daniel Sturridge - despite the striker being left out of the England squad. The Liverpool forward was omitted by Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson for their Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia after a plea from Anfield chief Brendan Rodgers. Sturridge has not played for the Reds since August after suffering a groin problem and was left at home for their 1-0 Champions League defeat at Basel on Wednesday. Daniel Sturridge could be involved  against West Brom despite being left out of the England squad . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers insisted his striker shouldn't be called up as he recovers from injury . But Irvine feels the 25-year-old will be fit enough to play a part as the Baggies look to add to the frustration around Anfield. He told a press conference: 'Obviously he wasn't able to go and play for Liverpool, in a very important game in the Champions League, but I think he'll be close. 'I wouldn't be surprised if he turned up on the team-sheet, either starting or as a substitute.' The Baggies are chasing a fourth straight win in all competitions after their 4-0 victory over Burnley on Sunday. They go to Merseyside a point ahead of a stuttering Liverpool team, who are winless in their last three Barclays Premier League games. The England striker hasn't played since he got injured whilst on international duty last month . Baggies boss Alan Irvine his hoping to add to Liverpool's recent woes with a result this weekend . Albion are without strikers Brown Ideye (ankle) and Victor Anichebe (groin) and winger Silvestre Varela (hernia) but Irvine said the Baggies believe in themselves. 'They are a very, very good team, they have got some top players without a doubt, he added. 'It will be extremely difficult to go there and win - but we can and we will go there feeling that we can. We went to Tottenham believing we could win. We really did, we didn't go negatively. 'We went to White Hart Lane with two strikers. If we had gone there believing we couldn't win we would have gone with five midfield players but we went with two strikers. 'I think that was borne out by the way the lads performed. We went into the game against Burnley with a different plan, but with the same kind of belief. 'We will go to Anfield knowing it's a really difficult place to go. But can we win there? Absolutely, of course we can.'","Irvine warns Baggies that they should prepare to face Sturridge .

"Two brothers from Canada have come up with a novel idea - a book so small you need an electron microscope to read it. Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, currently the world's smallest book, is a reproduction of a 30-page tale that fits on the width of a human hair. The reproduction, which is printed with pure crystalline silicon, cost a staggering $15,000 (around £9,250) to create. The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. The  pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet . A single word from the world's smallest book - Teeny Ted from Turnip Town by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin . It was written by Malcolm Douglas Chaplin and published by his brother, Robert, at the Simon Fraser University, in British Columbia, Canada. The book's exact measurements are 70 micrometres by 100 micrometres. Its pages, which are too small to be read even using a microscope, are printed on a single tablet. Teeny Ted's story, Robert Chaplin said, is one of triumph - where the main character wins an annual turnip-growing contest. Teeny Ted from Turnip Town is a reproduction of a 30-page tale that fits on the width of a human hair . Following the minute book's inclusion in the Guinness Book of Records, Robert, who works as a fine artist, then raised enough money via a Kickstarter campaign to create a large print version of his brother's story. Robert, from Vancouver, Canada, wrote on his Kickstarter page: 'In 2007 I was permitted access to a focused ion beam and scanning electron microscope at Simon Fraser University. 'In my time working with this equipment I designed and published an original work on a microchip, as an array of 30 tablets. 'The tablets contain the text of 'Teeny Ted From Turnip Town' complete with an ISBN. 'In 2012 I received a Guinness World Record confirming my creation of the smallest book yet made.' The original, tiny version of the book has the ISBN reference number ISBN-978-1-894897-17-4.

"A lawsuit has been launched in an effort to reclaim millions of dollars from Australian businessman Geoffrey Edelsten in order to repay his huge debts in the US. On Wednesday the former millionaire's stateside bankruptcy trustee Soneet Kapila kicked off a case in the Melbourne Federal Court in a bid to seize local assets. Among these assets are millions worth of property, luxury cars, shares, and loans, News Corp Australia reported. Mr Edelsten declared bankruptcy in the US in Ohio in January of this year. Scroll down for video . A lawsuit has been launched in an effort to reclaim millions of dollars from businessman Geoffrey Edelsten . Mr Kapila was ordered by Justice Jonathan Beach via Mr Edelsten's Australian lawyer Leon Zwier to contact more than 40 creditors - both companies and individuals - who Mr Edelsten is believed to owe money to. These beneficiaries include the Australian Tax Office, to whom Mr Edelsten owes $4.58 million, and the National Australian Bank who are out of pocket $3.8 million according to case files. Additional parties Mr Edelsten owes money to apparently include Carlton Football Club, Etihad Stadium, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and his 90-year-old mother Esther who resides in a luxury retirement village in Melbourne. Mr Edelsten, pictured here with fiance Gabi Grecko, has debts that could top more than $50 million . In the filings the 71-year-old apparently admitted his debts could top $50 million, with American Express and the City of Melbourne also owed funds. Mr Edelsten's estranged business partner Rafael Mawardi is reportedly the main beneficiary in the US with $10.4 million owed to him. The pair have a colourful past together with partnerships in the form of fashion label House of Nurielle and a casino in the Dominican Republic behind them. Gabi Grecko (right) is an American DJ and model, and the pair plan to wed early next year . Mr Edelsten's Australian case is due back in court for a hearing on October 10, while the US bankruptcy case will return to a Florida court on September 15. The former doctor, who was de-registered in the late 1980s, was married to American socialite Brynne Gordon until earlier this year.

"I hate the loan system. This window has seen some bizarre deals – loans with a view to a permanent signing, loans with an obligation to sign permanently, a two-year loan deal, loans between Premier League clubs, and loans with the club sending the player out STILL paying his wages. Supporting a club is belonging to a club, being part of a club. The team representing that club goes on to the field and can generate passions and memories that very few other things in life can bring. I don’t expect the players to have the same love and support for a club that the fans have. But I do expect commitment for all the time they are there. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alvaro Negredo score a sensational scissor-kick . Loan star: Sebastian Coates joined Sunderland from Liverpool on a temporary deal . Making the move: Ricardo Alvarez has joined Sunderland on loan from Inter Milan on loan . At a time when, at the top level of our game, players have become so distant from fans, the plethora of loans sadly increase that distance. Sunderland signed two players on loan on deadline day – Sebastian Coates from Liverpool, and Ricardo Alvarez from Inter Milan. I’ve no reason to doubt they will both put in 100 per cent when asked to play for their ‘temporary’ club. But ultimately these players don’t belong to Sunderland. They’re not as committed to the club, because they don’t belong there. The same applies to all loans, although the bizarre nature of Alvaro Negredo’s ‘loan’ switch from Manchester City to Valencia is a bit different. He’s joined on loan, but at the end of his year-long stay back in Spain, Valencia are obliged to buy him from City. Heading to Spain: Alvaro Negredo has joined Valencia on loan who then have an obligation to buy . So why not just buy him now? And what’s to stop Valencia carrying out their obligation of signing him permanently next summer, but then immediately selling him on to a Premier League club, possibly one of City’s rivals? In this case, the commitment of Valencia to the player is questionable. Players loaned between Premier League clubs simply shouldn’t be allowed. The only exceptions should be Under 21s – loan moves for Jack Wilshere, Daniel Sturridge and, long before that, David Beckham proved fruitful. But on deadline day Gaston Ramirez, an international who set up Uruguay’s winning goal against Italy to take them through the group stage in Brazil, a player who was Southampton’s record signing only two years ago, a ‘statement’ signing after the club’s fantastic rise from the depths of League One back to the Premier League, joined top-flight rivals Hull City on a season-long loan. To Hull and back: Uruguay international Gaston Ramirez has left Southampton for Hull on loan . It’s a clever move from Steve Bruce – his record signing Abel Hernandez was also at the World Cup with Uruguay. The £9.5million striker might settle in quicker with a familiar face close by. Having lived in Hull I can see where Bruce is coming from with that thinking. But one Premier League club borrowing a World Cup player from another Premier League club is just wrong. If you want him – buy him. If you can’t afford to buy him, then don’t buy him. Loans like these can sometimes depend on which managers or chairmen are friendly with each other – this isn’t how football should work. Try before you buy: Radamel Falcao signed a year-long loan deal at Manchester United from Monaco . VIDEO Falcao completes Old Trafford loan deal . Reports suggest that Nani is on loan to Sporting Lisbon with Manchester United playing his wages in total during the year long spell. So in effect, United are part-funding Sporting’s Champions League games against Chelsea in the group stage. Funding promotion: Wilfred Zaha joined Manchester United before being loaned back to Crystal Palace . When United signed Wilfried Zaha 18 months ago, they immediately loaned him back to the Selhurst Park club, and Palace became the first club in second tier history to have a £15m Manchester United player help them secure promotion. Completely unfair on the rest of the challengers who missed out. In effect, United paid for Palace’s promotion because there was no way they would have gone up without Zaha. Some loans are understandable – Radamel Falcao’s serious injury that forced him to miss the World Cup would be enough to make any club want to ‘try before they buy.’ A serious glut of injuries, or the sudden departure of a key player, might also lead to loan moves. Some temporary transfers are understandable, but generally I’m not in favour of loans. Especially this one - the most bizarre loan I’ve ever known. Javier Manquillo’s move from Atletico Madrid to Liverpool in this window. It’s a two-year loan deal for a 20-year-old full-back. After the first year, Atletico can pay a fee to effectively buy him out of his loan and take him back to Spain. If that happens Liverpool are developing a player and getting absolutely no financial, long-term or significant short-term benefit from the deal. But Liverpool do have the option to buy if Manquillo stays the full two years. But this is Liverpool. This is not a club who have found themselves in the Premier League and need a significant amount of help to even survive. For me, Liverpool are bigger than loan deals, and certainly bigger than taking a player from Atletico Madrid who they will have to keep for two years before they can call him their own.","The loan system must be re-addressed because it is getting out of hand .
Temporary deals between Premier League clubs must be banned .
Big clubs loaning players but still playing wages creates an unfair advantage ."

"It was the moment Raju the elephant had waited a lifetime for – a family of his own. Last week the gentle giant, who captured the hearts of people from around the world when he cried as he was freed from chains after 50 years – joined five female elephants at Wildlife SOS's Elephant Conservation and Care Center in India. His new family, named the Herd of Hope, have all been rescued from barbaric treatment. Scroll down for video . Happy chappy: Raju, centre, was introduced to his new friends at a conservation centre in India . Enjoying himself: Raju smiles widely as he relaxes in the pool next to his new family - called the Herd of Hope . Gang's all here: Raju's friends have also escaped from great cruelty and now live in Mathura, northern India . And poignantly, they flapped their ears – an expression of joy - before touching him with their trunks as they welcomed him. Charity Wildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan, who led the rescue operation to save Raju, said: 'We are delighted Raju has fitted in so well with the first family he's ever had since he was orphaned by poachers as a calf. 'He had been so terribly brutalized for 50 years that we feared he'd be unable to live with his own kind. He didn't even know how to be an elephant. But now it's like he's always been with them. 'When we first released him, he held back and he was clearly wary. Three of our female elephants Laxmi, Chanchal and Sai Geeta ran up to him – their ears flapping wildly –a sign they were excited and delighted to meet him. They also made high-pitched trumpeting sounds – a greeting. Affectionate: One of Raju's female friends, left, strokes his trunk with hers. He was initially wary of contact because of his appalling treatment at the hands of captors . Rehabilitation: The pool's water lets Raju take weight off of his legs - which are painful from years of abuse . Taking it easy: Raju was poached as a calf - and endured an awful life as a tourist attraction - but can now relax . 'Then each of them touched him with their trunks, clearly reassuring him before they wandered off into the grazing land at our Elephant Conservation and Care Centre at Mathura. It was incredibly touching after all he'd been through.' On July 4 this year the charity along with their counterparts in India saved Raju from dying in his bonds in a daring midnight rescue operation. A  team of ten vets and wildlife experts from the charity were joined by twenty Forestry Department officers and six policemen to seize Raju in the Uttar Pradesh region. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'He'd been poached as a calf from the wild. Poachers either slaughter the mother, or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into. 'The mother cries for her baby for days after he's been stolen – the illegal elephant trade is sickening. The calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their owners – their spirits are effectively broken. '27 owners': Raju, right, was passed from owner to owne in captivity, and eventually was found in spiked chains . Playtime: Raju, left, has been able to start his recovery in the sanctuary, after being blighted by wounds all over his legs and body while in captivity . 'Raju's case was particularly tragic as we believe he has been sold again and again and might have had 27 owners – he's been treated as a commodity and beaten into accepting his new handler every two years of his life. 'By the time we found him he was in a pathetic condition. He hadn't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper. 'He had no shelter at night, and was being used as a prop to beg with from dawn until dusk or being used for giving tourists joy rides. And most heartrendingly of all – the chains that cut into his legs had been there for 50 years. It was horrific. 'It took us 45 minutes to remove the shackles that had torn into the flesh on his legs for the past 50 years – an act of unthinkable cruelty. 'His legs were so covered in abscesses and his feet so damaged by walking on hard tarmac roads, that we have spent much more than expected on his medical treatment, and we still have a long way to go as he has a serious limp and open wounds.' Tearful: Raju, pictured above moments before he was freed from captivity, can be seen with 'tears' streaming down his face . Cruel: According to his rescuers, Raju had been in chains for as long as 50 years . Bound: Raju's chains, seen up close above, took 45 minutes for rescuers to disentangle . The elephants Raju has joined have also suffered horrendously before they were rescued by the charity. The second most recent member of the herd is eighteen-year-old female Laxmi, saved from the streets of Mumbai ten months ago. Although she was young she suffered from severe arthritis, obesity and a heart condition. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'She'd been exploited and used as a begging prop, she was neglected and her owners had got her addicted to fried junk food. 'When we saved her she was 1,200 kilos overweight and so fat we had to use a crane to get her onto a specially-strengthened truck to drive her to our centre. She was so huge her knees were giving way and she had early arthritis. 'Our vets were concerned that she would not live much longer if she was not rescued immediately. But she has a great, if mischievous, character – even on the drive home her trunk kept sneaking through the window and she was searching in the drivers pockets for a treat. 'We have spent the last 10 months rehabilitating her – and at first it was a battle to get her to eat the food she should be eating. Now she's finally getting healthier, leaner and enjoying being a free elephant. 'But although Wildlife SOS was given legal custody of her by the Forest Department, her previous cruel owners are petitioning the courts to get her back and so now we are in a court battle to stop her being returned to the abusive situation we rescued her from.' Midnight raid: Rescuers from Wildlife SOS are seen above breaking Raju free from captivity . Chanchal, 16, was rescued on June 29 2012 on the outskirts of Delhi after she and a second elephant were hit by a speeding truck. The second elephant was killed instantly and Chanchal was left with cuts, shards of glass and wounds all over her body as well as a severely injured leg. She was undernourished and her owners were arrested for negligence. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'Her leg was fractured and it's taken us 18 months to nurse her back to health. She's slowly rebuilding her life.' Sai Geeta was a circus elephant who was rescued after she was made to perform for years with a broken right rear leg. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'She still has a terrible limp where the break was never treated – the fracture was severe and when we rescued her she'd suffered for years in pain as it was never allowed to heal as they never allowed her to rest.' Road to freedom: Raju was taken the sanctuary in Mathura, northern India, in this truck . Finally Phoolkali, who is blind in one eye was smuggled illegally for years before the charity was alerted to her plight and immediately stepped in to rescue her. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'Phoolkali had spent more than 40 years of her life doing hard labour, being abused and being underfed. And her maltreatment and severe abuse by her previous owners caused her to be blinded in one eye. 'Her owner would hide her in a windowless, deserted warehouse. Her owner would smuggle her across state borders in the dead of night to avoid detection by the authorities as he has no valid documentation for her legal possession. 'She was frail and scrawny and almost skeletal in appearance and covered in sores and wounds. 'Now she loves throwing mud on herself immediately after a long bath - much to the annoyance of her keeper - and also throws mud on him when he isn't paying attention.' Years to recover: The head of Wildlife SOS said that it takes years to recover from Raju's decades-long ordeal . Today the nightmare for Raju and his herd is a distant memory. And they are also enjoying a rehabilitation pool thanks to the generosity of donors to the centre. Mr Satyanarayan said: :We are overwhelmed by the generosity of people from so many countries around the globe. We hope that if the donations continue, better facilities can be established for Raju and the other elephants at the center who all deserve a better life to make up for the abuse they suffered all these years. 'When we rescued him, Raju had never been in a pool before – and now he spends hours relaxing inside it. We'd like to thank everyone who made a donation – every penny has made such a difference to the quality of his life. 'And while the pool is immensely pleasurable for him, it also is helping his rehabilitation as the water's buoyancy enables him to take the weight off his legs which are incredibly painful from years of being shackled. 'He still faces years of treatment to heal both the physical and psychological wounds. And sadly he's not alone. We have a dossier of 80 elephants whose life is in imminent peril and they also need to be rescued before they die of cruelty, exhaustion and abuse.' Now the charity has launched an appeal for £20,000 to mark World Elephant Day on August 12. Mr Satyanarayan said: 'Our hope is that along with Raju, we can rescue many more of these tragic cases before it's too late for them. It will enable them to taste freedom for the first time in their lives and live out their days in dignity, free from suffering and pain.'","Raju had been captured and bound in chains for as long as 50 years .

"In a scene reminiscent of the iconic Princess Diana Taj Mahal photo, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall were pictured on day three of their India tour in front of a magnificent Hindu Temple complex. And earlier in the day the couple became Slumdog royalty, where Charles was given an early birthday surprise. The gesture came courtesy of pupils at a school in the Govindpuri slum in the south of the city, a labyrinth of filthy two and three-storey shacks with precious little water or sanitation.

One of the largest 'jugghis'  in India, . with more than 200,000 inhabitants, families with six or seven children . cram into a single room. Water-borne disease is rife and rabid mongrels defecate in the streets as children play. In . amongst the squalor, however, is the Katha school, a whitewashed beacon . of hope for the slum's thousands of children, many of whom would be . forced into child labour without its help. The temple was constructed with the help of thousands of volunteers over five years and is now a huge tourist attraction . The Hindu temple has a colossal main area, which measures 141 foot high and 316 foot wide . Insight: Camilla pictured during a tour of the temple . The main monument is 'supported' by 148 elephants, which have huge importance in Hindu culture . Of its 1,350 pupils aged three to 17, 98 per cent pass their state exams while 56 per cent go on to university. Indeed, pictures of the non-profit school's success stories are pinned to the walls - along with how much they are now earning. One, a young woman called Gayatri, has . just taken her civil service exams and now works in the Indian . government's customs office earning 50,000 rupees a month - around £500. Until . last month she lived in the slum with her deliveryman father (who would . earn around 3,000 rupees per month or £30), but has now moved into an . apartment in a more salubrious area of the city. Parvinder . Kaur, assistant executive director of the school, which has so far . helped more than 162,000 children, said: 'Around 80 per cent of the . inhabitants live here permanently while the other 20 per cent are . migrant workers from rural India, labourers, carpenters, plumbers and . the like. Gesture: Prince Charles is presented with a cake from pupils at the Katha school as Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, looks on .

Charles Charles politely put his hands together for what is known as a 'namaste' greeting when he arrived at the Katha school . 'There are around 2 lakh (hundred thousand) people here living in houses with no real sanitation. ‘Success stories are looking down at you from these walls.' The . head teacher, Geeta Dharmarajan, began her project in 1990 by offering . vocational training to the slum's downtrodden women so they could earn . more money and over-rule their husbands' refusal to send their children . to school. ‘When Geeta . started, families were not willing to send their children to school. Their mothers weren't in control. The fathers wanted the children to . become servants. She focused on the mothers to give them income so they . could fend off the alcoholic fathers,’ explained Arun Seth, a board . member, whose former employer BT funded the growth of the school. Since . then it has become one of highest achieving schools for the poor. If it . was a government school, it would be ranked in India's top ten per . cent. Former Labour Health Sectretary Patricia Hewitt had played a key role in BT funding the charity which runs the school. The . couple arrived almost half an hour late - caught up in the city's . notorious traffic - but there were hundreds of locals waiting for a . glimpse of the VIP visitors. Celebration: Prince Charles is presented with a framed birthday card . The Katha pupils gave Prince Charles a cake with '65' in chocolate on top . He and his wife quickly went inside for a tour of the impressively clean facilities, chatting with some of the adorably excited nursery age children. The Prince told teacher Sudhir Jha he was ‘very impressed’ with the school's bilingual approach and its focus on lifting people out of poverty. Among the students they met was Kumar, 32, who was living in the slum with seven other people in one room when he joined a bakery course at the school. Now he is working in a restaurant earning 35,000 rupees a month and has moved out of the slum into a house of his own. ‘If it wasn't for the school I don't know what I would have done with myself,’ he said. ‘Thanks to them I am doing so well.’ He is still single, but has no plans to marry yet. ‘I want to get into a chain of hotels and become a big shot chef,’ he said. ‘Then I will think about settling down.’ During another part of the visit, the Katha schoolchildren kicked off Charles' 65th birthday celebrations early when they presented him with a home-made Black Forest gateau. Pupils gave him the cake with '65' in chocolate on top a week ahead of his pensionable birthday next week. The prince will celebrate his birthday on the last day of his nine-day tour to India before flying to Sri Lanka to represent the Queen at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The cake was made by catering students at the 1,300 pupil school under the tutelage of local Master chef Ram Kumar. One of the trainee bakers said they had out five eggs in the mix for a high cholesterol treat. The couple eventually went their separate ways with Camilla visiting workshops for young women training to be seamstresses and designers, while Charles viewed children learning computer skills. The Duchess asked the women to show them their skills and even tried her hand at some silk printing. The couple left after around 20 minutes, their convoy speeding through the dusty streets. Meet and greet: Charles speaks with a student during his visit to Katha Lab School . Prince Charles during his visit to the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun . While Charles went for a private lunch with the Vice President of India, Shri M Hamid Ansari, his wife went to the home of the British High Commissioner where she met with women from the Self-Employed Women's (SEWA). The Duchess was greeted with a welcome symbol painted out in red and white powder on the ground called a Rangoli. The SEWA organisation helps Muslim women break out from poverty by working for themselves and Camilla watched astounded as a group of ladies in brilliant jewel coloured saris span silk from cocoons using their feet. Camilla meets women from SEWA, a self-employed women's cooperative at the High Commissioner's Residence . 'I have never seen anything like that in my life. It is remarkable,' she said. The cocoons are especially cultivated and then boiled for the women to spin from. They can earn up to 800 rupees (£8) for a piece of cloth through SEWA, double what they would normally earn. Camilla then teamed up with her husband to visit one of the world's largest temples, Akshardham, opened in 2005. As . they arrived they were given garlands of fragrant frangipani, while . Charles was anointed with a red dot on his forehead known as a chandlos . by a Swami (or priest) and given a friendship bracelet. The couple posed outside the Hindu temple's colossal main area, which measures 141 foot high and 316 foot wide. It . was built from Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian Carrara marble and . is covered from top to bottom with elaborately carved details of flora, . fauna, dancers, musicians and deities.It also consists of 234 ornate pillars, nine domes and 20,000 religious figures. The main monument is 'supported' by 148 elephants, which have huge importance in Hindu culture.Photographs . of the couple posing outside the temple echoed a legendary picture of . Charles's late first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, who memorably sat . alone for photographers in front of the Taj Mahal in India in 1992.

With . a personal fortune of $22 billion, he is also the second wealthiest man . in Asia and is ranked 37 in the Forbes list of The World's Most . Powerful People. On Thursday Charles visited the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun which was established in 1906 and is the largest centre of its kind in South Asia, recognised for its wealth of knowledge on forestry. It trains most of India's forest officers and offers masters degrees in courses such as environment management, wood science and technology.","Charles was presented with the chocolate cake by pupils at the Katha school .

"If you thought memorising irregular verbs for French tests was hell at school, then spare a thought for the young inhabitants of the Spanish island of La Gomera. Despite protests, every primary school child on the Canary island is required to learn an archaic whistling language called Silbo, a version of which was once spoken by entire communities in the 16th and 17th century. The language consists of just two to four vowels and four consonants and employs whistling to make all of its sounds. Scroll down for video . Every primary school child on the Canary Island of La Gomera is required to learn a whistling language called Silbo in a bid to keep the archaic language alive . The language consists of just two to four vowels and four consonants and employs whistling (pictured) to make all of its sounds . Economic hardship in the 1950s put Silbo-speaking on the decline, as most Silbo ‘speakers’ were forced to move away to find an income. By the end of the twentieth century, the whistled language was dying out. But Silbo now has official protection as an example of ‘intangible cultural heritage’ which in part has spurred on a revival in the language. Silbo originates from a more ancient version of the language called ‘Silbo Gomero’ and means ‘Gomeran whistling’, according to a report by Today I Found Out. It was spoken in the Canary Islands and whistling could be heard from Gran Canaria to Tenerife  and from El Hiero to La Gomera. The language, which was used by the native Guanche people, was spoken well before Spanish settlement but died out around the 17th century. It is thought the Guanches originated from North Africa and brought the whistled language with them. Today however, Silbo is a whistled . form of Spanish. It was adopted in the 16th century after the last of . the Guanches adapted their whistled language to Spanish. One . study showed that Silbo is recognised in the ‘language centre’ of the . brain by Silbo whistlers, though regular Spanish speakers who were not . Silbo whistlers simply recognised it as whistling. It is thought that the whistling language of Silbo was developed as a form of long distance communication. La Gomera's landscape (pictured) consists of hills, valleys, and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape . A call for a revival in the language in recent years has been met with mixed emotions. Some locals think of Silbo as a language for peasants .

La Gomera’s landscape consists of hills, valleys, and ravines and a whistle can travel up to two miles across such a landscape. When La Gomera was largely an agricultural island, crops and herds of animals like sheep would be spread out across the hills, and herders would use the language to communicate with one another across these large distances. Silbo is not the only the whistling language. Separate languages using the mechanism of blowing air through pursed lips exists on the Greek island of Evia, in the town of Kuskoy, eastern Turkey, and in a town of the French Pyrenees .

"Conflict: MEP Nikki Sinclaire was a UKIP activist for 15 years but when she was finally elected, she saw the party's flaw . I grew up thinking that it would impossible for me to have a career in politics. I was a transsexual who lived on a council estate and attended a school where a teacher once gleefully led the laughter in class after I said I wanted to become an MP. I never thought I would prove them wrong. Much of my early life was dominated by uneasiness with my body. I eventually received treatment in my early 20s and became the woman I had always known I was. I refused to discuss this in public. Was I afraid of ridicule, or that my political views might not subsequently be taken seriously? Perhaps. I also did not want ‘Sex-Change MEP’ to be the default start to every headline. I had taken much inspiration from Margaret Thatcher. To me, her message was clear: personal responsibility, hard work, conviction and the ability to achieve regardless of background. I met her in 2008, a year before my election as an MEP and told her that I was going to get my country back from the EU. She said: ‘Never give up! However long it takes.’ I was elected to Brussels in June 2009 for UKIP, a party I had been a leading activist with for 15 years. It had been a long journey from foot soldier up through the ranks to the national executive committee, party secretary, political adviser and finally MEP. Once elected, I could fight the EU from within. But I soon discovered why UKIP has far more former members than current members – Nigel Farage. Nigel and I were always at opposite ends of an eternally feuding party. He was a key player in all UKIP’s civil wars. It was his way of dividing and conquering, and shedding his political opponents. Today he is on non-speaking terms with four out of the previous six UKIP leaders. In addition, more than 75 NEC members have resigned over UKIP’s 20-year history, and nearly all cite Nigel as the reason. Last week, Miss Sinclaire accused Nigel Farage of employing his wife and his 'mistress' Annabelle Fuller (right) Nigel struggles to get on with anyone. People would often face the wrath of his henchmen. He would make late-night phone calls to manipulate NEC members to vote in a certain way. During meetings he would throw tantrums and threaten to resign if he didn’t get his own way. ‘I just want to give up,’ he would shout. ‘This f****** party – I don’t know why I bother.’ The threats would work: party rules were frequently rewritten at Nigel’s behest. I once remarked that I thought Nigel had only ever read one novel and that was George Orwell’s Animal Farm – an allegory about Stalinism. I quipped that he took it as an instruction manual in how to run UKIP. Trying to organise UKIP is not l ike organising a political party. It  is more about organising the events that surround one man’s ego. The BBC once ran a piece on him accompanied by the soundtrack to XTC’s Making Plans For Nigel. It should be UKIP’s anthem. I once remarked that Nigel had only ever read one novel: George Orwell's Animal Farm - an allegory about Stalinism - and took it as an instruction manual in how to run UKIP . I first came across his spin doctor Annabelle Fuller when she volunteered at UKIP’s headquarters in Birmingham in May 2004. I had been tipped off that she was potentially a troublemaker, so I gave her mundane office tasks. I soon learned what her personality was like – definitely a devoted Faragista, but, I would argue, highly eccentric and lacking in political acumen. Nigel was not comfortable with me. I once remember a group of MEPs going out for a meal in Brussels and then ending up in a bar on Place Luxembourg. A UKIP MEP was making a fool of himself by coming on to a much younger female assistant. Nigel must have seen the disapproval on my face as he came over and said: ‘What happens over here stays over here.’ It was a typical Nigel warning. A more direct threat was made when I objected to UKIP’s inclusion in a new European Parliament  grouping which included some very Right-wing politicians, some of whom had convictions for violence. Nigel needed me to sign up in order for the group to get extra money from the EU for communications – without me it would be one short of 30 MEPs required to get higher levels of funding. He told everyone that I would cost the party £500,000 by not signing up. To my utter shame I signed the next morning. This was not the first time – nor would it be the last – that I feel that I was bullied by Nigel Farage. 'Nigel shamed me into signing a bill to save UKIP money. He said I would cost the party £500,000 if I didn't' As UKIP MEPs, we held informal meetings, chaired by Nigel as party leader. One meeting will always stick in my mind. We were discussing finances, and this led to a wider discussion as to how EU funding should be spent. But I had a few detailed questions about UKIP’s money – each of our 13 MEPs received €76,000 a year from the EU’s communications budget, or £63,000 (that’s €5 million over a parliamentary term). I challenged him as to whether we would see accounts, and where  the money was going. Nigel was furious. His answers were dismissive but I continued to push. Nigel flipped. His fist suddenly hammered down on to the table in front of me. I felt the rush of air past my face and jerked backwards.  I was trembling. ‘Stop it!’ he screeched. ‘You are interrupting the meeting, you are interrupting me, and if you don’t stop I’ll ask you to leave.’ He shamed me into a voting for something I was against. He told everyone I would cost the party £500,000 if I didn't sign . By the end of 2009, after more of Nigel’s abusive, insulting behaviour towards me, I said I wished to resign from the group. Once again he tried to use intimidation to prevent me leaving. After my resignation in January 2010 he went straight to the BBC and began criticising me. The party removed the ‘whip’ and I became an independent MEP. Soon after David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010, he said he ‘didn’t want to bang on about Europe’. I noticed a section in the Coalition agreement that said if a 100,000-signature petition was submitted it may be considered for debate in the Commons. So I set up a campaign calling for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU that collected much more than the required number of signatures. We duly forced a debate in 2011 during which 81 Tory MPs defied a three-line whip by supporting calls for a referendum. Neither UKIP nor Nigel Farage supported the campaign. Yet on the day of the debate, he sought to claim the credit. I later challenged him, pointing out that he was not one of the signatories. He belatedly scribbled his name on the petition. All of a sudden the party was interested in taking me back. Chief executive Steve Crowther invited me to a meeting with Nigel at the Goring Hotel in London. 'Now, he is accusing me of smearing because I revealed he had been employing his wife and Annabelle' I was offered a place on UKIP’s list for this year’s European elections in exchange for the petition’s database. This would have breached data protection laws and negotiations broke down. Farage is a hypocrite and a bully. He talks a good game, but in 15 years as an MEP he – unlike me – cannot point to one tangible achievement that has moved an ‘In/Out’ referendum closer. He has no time for intelligent women. He is fine with adoring,  submissive females, but not those who stand up to him. There is no woman in a senior position in UKIP now who was in that post five years ago. When I was the only woman on  the NEC, the committee would  hold meetings in the bars of gentlemen’s clubs – I was not permitted to join them. My intervention in the European Parliament last week – where I asked Nigel about the claim that he employs his wife Kirsten and ‘former mistress’ using taxpayers’ money – wrongfooted a normally savvy and quick-thinking politician. He failed to use his parliamentary right of reply to instantly dismiss the allegations, or offer an explanation. Instead, Nigel left it to his  spin doctors in an attempt to deflect the question. UKIP members are fantastic people. Unfortunately, they are lions led by a preening show pony . Yes, I have been on bail since 2012 over allegations of fraud. I strenuously deny the claims. I have audited accounts that show that I have ploughed more than £100,000 of my own post-tax salary since 2009 back into my work as an MEP. The truth will out. There have been smears aplenty from Farage’s office, including that I am a coward for using parliamentary privilege to make claims about Nigel, his wife and Annabelle. They forget that Nigel used this same privilege in 2004 when making accusations against European Commissioner Jacques Barrot. Others claim I’m an embittered ex-UKIP MEP. I’m hardly alone there! I did not become an MEP to make history. I sought election to stand up for the silent majority, those whose voices are ignored by the arrogant political class. UKIP does not do this. UKIP members are fantastic people. Unfortunately, they are lions led by a preening show pony. It is a shame that a party set up on principles has allowed itself to become one man’s ego trip. The future of our country is more important than that. Representing the We Demand A Referendum Now Party, I am hopeful of re-election. It is my list of political achievements, not my personal struggles, for which I hope to be recognised and remembered.","Nikki Sinclaire was a UKIP activist for 15 years before becoming an MEP .

"Sportsmail's panel of experts Nasser Hussain, Paul Newman, Lawrence Booth and David Lloyd discuss the lessons to be learnt from this summer . What more must Alastair Cook do to challenge Michael Clarke as a captain? Nasser Hussain: Still quite a lot. Cook has to learn both from the 10 Tests England failed to win and the three they did. He has to keep focusing on his batting – he has made technical changes that have worked against India but will they work against Mitchell Johnson? David Lloyd: Not a lot. Michael Clarke had a fantastic attack in the last Ashes and when you’ve got that everything else becomes pretty easy. If Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad continue to bowl as well as they have done the captain can deal with any situation. A lot of this ‘funky’ captaincy business is for effect. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Taste of success: England celebrate impressive series win against India at The Oval . Lawrence Booth: . He’ll never match Clarke for funkiness but he can watch how Clarke . always tries to stay ahead of the game. England’s worst moments this . summer came when Cook let things drift. Paul Newman: . Nothing. He must do things his way. Cook’s strengths are leading by . example and creating a healthy environment that earns the respect of his . team. They are all behind him. Once he scored runs at Southampton . everything else fell into place and he grew as a captain. How did England turn it around against India? Newman: . The senior players in Cook, Bell, Anderson and Broad were all back to . their best from Southampton onwards which allowed the less experienced . ones to grow without the pressure of delivering in every match. India . helped by becoming obsessed with getting Anderson banned and losing . focus. Booth: . A bit of luck, some resolve, and the realisation that something had to . change. They were in denial until they got to Southampton. They were . also helped by India’s ineptitude. Inspired: England's Gary Ballance has gone from strength to strength since taking the No 3 slot . Lloyd: . Cook being back in the runs was the key. Once he scored them in the . third Test he became a better captain and England immediately looked . like a much better team. He hasn’t totally cracked it yet and he still . hasn’t got that hundred but he’s getting there. Hussain: Through . the senior players, mainly the fabulous bowling of Jimmy Anderson and . Stuart Broad and the mental strength and steely determination of . Alastair Cook. They found rock bottom and discovered that the only way . is up. Cook must take a lot of the credit for the way the series was . transformed. Who have been the star performers among the Test new boys? Booth: . Gary Ballance has allowed us to quietly forget Jonathan Trott and, . unlike Trott, he has a fifth gear. Jos Buttler is incredibly exciting. It was a huge moment when England accepted that Matt Prior’s time was . up. Lloyd: Gary . Ballance first and foremost and Moeen Ali has gone from strength to . strength with the ball but they have all done well. The only remaining . question is what must they do with Sam Robson? I’ve said it before but . Robson must lighten up. He can’t be staring at the pitch after every . ball. Key man: Joe Root played a pivotal role in England's series triumph . VIDEO Root and Anderson thrilled with win . Newman: . Peter Moores decision to give Gary Ballance the No 3 slot proved . inspired and I am delighted that Moeen Ali has shown that he really can . replace Graeme Swann as England’s spinner. They have all been successes . with the possible exception of Sam Robson and all have the potential to . grow more. Hussain: . It has to be Gary Ballance. To come in and fill the massive hole left . by Jonathan Trott while being able to ease the pressure on Alastair Cook . by increasing the tempo of his batting has been phenomenal. He can play . in different ways and notably goes up through the gears. How do we become less reliant on Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad? Lloyd: . Get Steven Finn fit and firing. If he can get back to bowling anything . like he was at his best then that will ease the pressure on Anderson and . Broad. What England are doing is getting a good battery of fast bowlers . together in time for 17 Tests in nine months from next April. Finn and . Stokes should be equally as effective as Jordan and Woakes. Hussain: . Provide emerging bowlers with proper chances, like batsmen get. Chris . Jordan has improved the more he has bowled. The key is to look after . Anderson and Broad so that they can go on as long as possible. I don’t . think either of them should play any more limited-overs cricket after . the World Cup. Pair of aces: James Anderson and Stuart Broad are a formidable new-ball partnership . Booth: . England already are. Chris Woakes was unlucky all series and Chris . Jordan got better after a shaky start. Waiting in the seam bowling wings . are Steven Finn, Ben Stokes and Liam Plunkett. Things look healthy. Newman: . It’s all about this ‘over-supply’ of players that Paul Downton talks . about. England have to create as big a pool as possible to cope with the . ridiculous demands that the schedule for 2015 and 2016 represents. Anderson and Broad will have to miss one-day cricket to be available for . all the Tests. Is Moeen Ali the answer as a spinner? Newman: . One hundred per cent yes. Derek Pringle put it perfectly when he said . ‘Moeen may not be a Swann but he’s no ugly duckling either.’ I always . thought he was better than Alastair Cook and Peter Moores seemed to . think and he has proved it. He has the potential to be better than . Nathan Lyon next summer. Booth: . He’s not in Graeme Swann’s class but these comparisons are unhelpful. What mattered is that he improved quickly. It’s hard to say if he’s . frontline yet – India were too poor for us to tell – but he’s way better . than part time. Positive spin: Moeen Ali is emerging as a frontline slow bowling option for England . Hussain: . In the short term, yes. He has been the answer to balancing the side . and there is no point in replacing him with a ‘specialist’ who can bowl . just a little bit better, if there is anyone like that out there. England still need to find a left-arm spinner to compliment Moeen while . the structure needs to be looked at so we produce more spinners. Lloyd: . Yes I think he is. You don’t take 19 wickets against India by accident! He must have something. He has grown in confidence and got more shape . in his action. Moeen can be for this side what Ashley Giles was for the . 2005 side. A key component of the team with ball and bat. What are our chances of regaining the Ashes and what do we need to improve? Hussain: . England’s chances are good. Home advantage is the key in modern Test . cricket. Only Zimbabwe lost any Tests at home throughout the whole of . 2013. How we play Mitchell Johnson and Ryan Harris will be the key. Australia are an ageing side while England have potential to grow, both . in and out of the side. Lloyd: . England have every chance of regaining the Ashes. The likes of Mitchell . Johnson, Ryan Harris, Chris Rogers and Brad Haddin are no spring . chickens. Will they all be here? Will Johnson be as good again as he was . last time? One thing England can improve is the pitches. They wanted . slow low ones last year against Australia but I think they will go the . other way next year. Follow the leader: Cook’s strengths are leading by example and creating healthy environment . Booth: . It depends if Mitchell Johnson is fit and firing. If he’s not England . will win. They need a reliable opening partner for Alastair Cook and Ian . Bell must rediscover the form that helped beat Australia 3-0 a year . ago. Newman: . I’m confident England will win the Ashes next year as long as Jimmy . Anderson and Stuart Broad have not been finished off by all the cricket . before then. We must keep our fingers crossed the operation on Broad’s . knee goes well while I think England need to find a new opener. Not sure . about Sam Robson. Name two players who could force their way into the side for the Ashes . Booth: . Nottinghamshire’s opener Alex Hales could be England’s answer to slam . bang Aussie opener David Warner. And I hope Steven Finn spends five . Tests against West Indies and New Zealand before then remembering what . it’s like to take Test wickets. Lloyd: . Alex Hales could do it and here’s a bit of a long shot for you, Simon . Kerrigan. I’ve got everything crossed when I say that but a lot of . people I respect have told me Kerrigan can bowl. I haven’t seen it . myself yet but I’m taking their word for it. One to watch: Alex Hales could force his way into Test team if he impresses in one-day format . Hussain: . If Alex Hales has a good six months of ODI cricket then he could be a . candidate but it would be a gamble. Other than opening it’s hard to see . where England need new players for next year which is a good sign but . I’d say Steven Finn if he concentrates on sheer pace. But both would . have to improve to get into next year’s side. Newman: I . can see where everybody is coming from when they say Alex Hales and it . may just work but we might have to accept a few failures from him in . exchange for the odd occasion when he would spectacularly come off. A . second player? Keep an eye on Alex Lees of Yorkshire. England rate him . very highly.","Cook must keep leading the side his own way .

"Soldiers could soon be equipped with Iron Man-style helmets that help them pinpoint targets quickly and easily on the battlefield. The Q-Warrior helmet-mounted display, designed by defence contractor BAE Systems, uses similar technology to that used by jet pilots in fighter planes and mimics the display used in the Iron Man films. It’s currently undergoing tests in the U.S., but military researchers have said the tech is ‘already exceeding expectations.' Soldiers could soon be equipped with Iron Man-style helmets that help them pinpoint targets quickly and easily on the battlefield. The Q-Warrior helmet-mounted display, pictured, uses similar technology to that used by jet pilots in fighter planes to track the landscape ahead . The helmet-mounted display is fitted with an optical screen that sits in front of the soldier's left eye. This display creates 3D images, that are positioned in such a way that they appear to sit in the real world. Images from CCTV cameras and other surveillance sensors, as well as data from nearby vehicles, is beamed directly onto the display. Additionally, the display will highlight compass directions and targets, as well as colleagues, to prevent friendly fire attacks. The battery-powered HUD is fitted with an infrared camera, a video recorder and GPS unit. A head-up display, or HUD, is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer’s line of sight. The technology was originally developed for military pilots but is now used in commercial planes, gaming, and cars. For example, the Garmin HUD beams directions onto a person’s windscreen and can track their eye movements to make sure the driver spends minimal time looking away from the road. Created by engineers at BAE Systems' Electronic Systems business in Kent, it is hoped the Q-Warrior technology will give soldiers and members of the special forces more real-time visual data than ever before. The Q-Warrior’s high-resolution, see-through display allows waypoints, points of interest, and targets to be displayed over what a soldier can see in front of them. Q-Warrior helmet . The principle behind the Q-Warrior technology is similar to what Robert Downey Jr, pictured, used in the film Iron Man. The Q-Warrior display creates 3D holographic images, uses images and data from surveillance sensors and highlights compass directions, as well as colleagues to prevent friendly fire attacks . The battery-powered HUD, pictured, is fitted with an infrared camera, a video recorder and GPS unit . It is expected to be used by section commanders, but could one day become a standard piece of kit for soldiers. Paul Wright, Soldier Systems’ Business Development Lead at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems in Rochester, said: ‘Q-Warrior increases the user’s situational awareness by providing the potential to display ‘eyes-out’ information to the user, including textual information, warnings and threats. 'Other key features include enhanced night vision, waypoints and routing information, and the ability to track both personnel and assets. 'The biggest demand, in the short term at least, will be in roles where the early adoption of situational awareness technology offers a defined advantage. 'This is likely to be within non-traditional military units with reconnaissance roles, such as Forward Air Controllers/Joint Tactical Aircraft Controllers (JTACS) or with special forces during counter terrorist tasks. 'The next level of adoption could be light role troops such as airborne forces or marines, where technical systems and aggression help to overcome their lighter equipment.' Many have compared the new helmets to the high-tech equipment used in films such as Iron Man. Wright added: ‘Iron Man presented an unachievable, invincible warrior capability but modern technology such as Q-Warrior is starting to bring some of that capability to the next generation of specialist soldiers.’ A head-up display, or HUD, is a transparent display that presents data within the wearer's line of sight. The technology was originally developed for military pilots, seen here on the co-pilot display of a C-130J Super Hercules plane, but is now used in commercial planes, cars, and gaming .","Q-Warrior helmet mounted display system was developed by BAE Systems .
