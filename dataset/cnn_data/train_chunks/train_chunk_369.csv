"(CNN) -- Rihanna's presence at Monday's CFDA Fashion Awards nearly eclipsed the ceremony itself, and she did it while wearing almost nothing at all. The 26-year-old singer arrived at the stylish event, held by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, in a floor-length sparkling gown that recalled the era of Josephine Baker. Custom-made by designer Adam Selman, the mostly backless number shone from more than 230,000 Swarovski crystals and was accented with a baby pink feather boa, gloves and a glittering turban. But it wasn't just Rihanna's effortless 1920s glamour that turned heads. As Selman described to Style.com, ""the dress is just fishnet and crystals and a couple of fingers crossed."" That left everything that wasn't covered by a flesh-colored thong on full display. ""It's so naked,"" Rihanna's stylist, Mel Ottenberg, added to Style.com. ""I don't know if it's shocking -- I'm with her all the time, so my shock gauge is off -- but I told her that I thought she was ready for this dress a while ago, and that I wasn't. I'm the prude, and I'm just catching up."" Ottenberg may still be getting used to the revealing look, but some observers -- like fashion magazine Vogue -- have heartily approved. ""Rihanna has become the rare celebrity who does not follow fashion -- she affects it,"" the magazine tweeted on Monday. Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour was at the ceremony to present Rihanna with the CFDA's 2014 Fashion Icon award. ""Fashion should never be frustrating,"" Rihanna said during her acceptance speech. ""It should be fun.""","Rihanna attended the CFDA Awards in a sparkling, sheer dress .

"Kung fu movie star Jackie Chan says he ""takes responsibility"" for the drug charges laid against his son, 32-year-old Jaycee Chan, in Beijing. Police detained the junior Chan, who is originally from Hong Kong and also an actor, as well as Kai Ko, a 23-year-old Taiwanese actor, during a raid on August 14 in Dongcheng district, Beijing, state media said. Both men tested positive for marijuana. Jackie Chan publicly addressed the incident for the first time on Wednesday evening, through messages posted on his account on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging platform. The star of ""Rush Hour"" wrote that he felt ""extremely furious"" and ""extremely shocked"" at the news of his son's drug woes, adding that Jaycee's mother is ""heartbroken."" ""I hope that young people will see Jaycee as a cautionary tale and stay away from drugs,"" wrote Chan, who once campaigned against drug use and was named an anti-drugs ambassador in China in 2009. ""I failed to teach my son and I should also bear responsibility. Jaycee and I deeply bow in apology to society,"" concluded Chan on his Weibo, which has more than 23 million followers. 'Really sorry' After detaining the young actors, police searched Jaycee Chan's apartment and found more than 100 grams of marijuana. He was also accused of ""hosting others to take drugs,"" the state-run China Daily said. He could face three years in jail under Chinese law. State broadcaster CCTV aired footage of Chan, his face blurred, showing police where the drugs were hidden at his home, while Ko was shown making a tearful apology. ""I very much regret what happened. I'm very sorry to those who support me, like me or even know me personally,"" he said. ""I just want to tell them I'm really sorry. I've set the worst example, which had the most terrible influence. And this is a huge mistake."" Celebrity targets . The two actors are being seen as the targets of the capital's latest anti-drugs campaign, which has snared more than 7,000 people for using drugs since January, a 72% year-on-year increase, according to China Daily. Celebrities are increasingly in the spotlight, with a number of high-profile arrests over drug-related incidents in recent months, including popular movie actor Zhang Mo and singer Li Daimo, who was sentenced to nine months in jail for hosting a crystal meth party at his home, according to the China Daily. Earlier this month, dozens of management agencies representing performers in the entertainment industry signed an agreement with Beijing authorities banning drug use from the industry and pledging to sack artists who break the law.","Jackie Chan publicly addresses son's drug bust for the first time .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities say that ISIS leaders ordered followers to behead someone on Australian soil as a ""demonstration killing."" Prosecutors say they uncovered a plot that was ""clearly designed to shock and horrify"" the public. Now that President Barack Obama has announced the United States will seek to degrade and destroy ISIS, should Americans worry they will become targets for similar plots from this ruthless terrorist group? ISIS has worked diligently to taunt the U.S. and its allies. The alleged plot in Australia, which triggered that country's largest ever anti-terrorist dragnet, is only the most recent example. Even before ISIS became well-known, British soldier Lee Rigby was butchered in a London street last year. There is a real possibility that Americans, too, will face the threat of such ""demonstration killings"" on U.S. soil. The news from Australia comes on the heels of recent videotaped decapitations of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The ISIS killer mocks the American President and addresses him personally in the Sotloff video: ""I'm back, Obama. ... I remember a time you could not win an election without promising to bring out troops back home from Iraq and Afghanistan."" The militant claims to want an end to American missile strikes against the group. But everything ISIS does seems to indicate the opposite. It's hard not to escape the impression that ISIS wants to be attacked by the United States, by its Western allies and by the rest of the world. Killing Americans and broadcasting their beheadings; slaying a British citizen the same way; calling for the deaths of Australians in the streets of Sidney -- these all seem designed to stoke fury in the West against the Islamist extremists. Is ISIS on a suicide mission? Not really. ISIS wants the United States to join in the fight. But that does not mean the U.S. should ignore the threat. Obama should deal with ISIS carefully. The group is extremely dangerous and allowing it to continue scoring victories would be disastrous. Still, ISIS efforts to draw America into its vortex are telling. ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi believes he has much to gain by turning this into a war between his forces -- whom he perceives as representatives of Islam -- and the United States, the most powerful military force in the world. Washington is trying to enlist a wide-ranging coalition to fight against ISIS, and it is enlisting other Muslim-majority Arab states to participate. It is crucial that ISIS not be allowed to portray this battle as a war pitting Muslims against non-Muslims. It is a fight between a blood-thirsty extremist organization that embraces a brutal interpretation of Islam against those who disagree with ISIS' goals, methods and ideology. The United States is the country with the power to tip the scales, but it is hardly ISIS' main enemy. As a former ISIS fighter told CNN, ""The main and principal goal of the Islamic State that they tell their new members is to establish an Islamic state that will encompass the Arab world,"" he said. ""And after that, we go to other countries."" For al-Baghdadi, fighting America and its coalition of 40 countries is a badge of honor, a powerful recruiting tool. It is proof that he and his organization have become the leaders of global jihad, toppling al Qaeda, their rival in that contest. ISIS was once part of al Qaeda (it was once called al Qaeda in Iraq), but its tactics proved too extreme even for the perpetrators of 9/11, which predicted public beheadings of Muslims would turn other Muslims against the group. Now ISIS has become more powerful than al Qaeda. Al-Baghdadi has conquered more than Osama bin Laden dared to dream he might do in his lifetime. But that does not mean al-Baghdadi did not learn from his former leader. As bin Laden explained, ""When people see a strong horse, by nature they will like the strong horse."" Nothing makes for a stronger horse, a more powerful draw in the world of jihad, than fighting America. Until now, ISIS has achieved enormous victories, adding to its allure, but these are likely inebriating the group with the poisonous brew of hubris. ISIS has scored battlefield victories against Syrian government forces, rival Syrian opposition fighters, the Iraqi military and even the storied Kurdish Peshmerga militias. By now, al-Baghdadi and his men may be feeling invincible. They may believe they have all the power of God on their side. This is where hubris comes in. This is where they risk overplaying their hand. The killings of Foley and Sotloff already jolted the American public and their war-weary president out of the all-pervasive post-Iraq War opposition to entering a new conflict in the Middle East. ISIS is a threat that cannot be ignored. ISIS' atrocities in Syria, along with all the killing in that country, were receiving little attention until the Syrian civil war boiled over into Iraq, and ISIS swept across the border it says does not exist. Now that al-Baghdadi and his men have started challenging and defying the West, they have finally captured attention beyond the Middle East. With every step they have taken beyond Syria, with every move closer to American, British, Australian or European interests, they have given new impetus to international involvement. Even Obama, the most reluctant of commanders in chief, has decided to act. For three years, Obama had resisted calls to arm Syrian rebels despite some 200,000 killed in that country's civil war. ISIS has suddenly changed that equation with its sweep in Iraq, endangering America's friends, the Kurds, threatening genocide against the Yazidis and then ostentatiously killing American citizens. According to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, officials had firm evidence that an attack on a ""random"" Australian citizen was in the works. ""This is not just suspicion,"" he said. The Australian people ""are at serious risk from a terrorist attack."" In al-Baghdadi's calculus, an attack on Australians -- or any Westerners -- would produce propaganda and recruiting gains. ISIS is gambling that drawing America and the West into the fight will make it stronger, but if the West is strategic and smart, this move will prove to be ISIS' worst mistake.","Authorities uncover suspected ISIS plot to behead someone in Australia to shock the public .

"The State Department voiced concern Friday about the case of an American citizen in prison in Bahrain, whom a United Nations report alleges was tortured. Tagi al-Maidan was arrested in October 2012 on charges related to Shiite protests against the Sunni-led government for greater rights. He was sentenced a year later by a Bahraini court to 10 years in jail on charges of unlawful assembly, intent to kill police, destruction of police vehicles and possession of Molotov cocktails. The United States has said little about the case of al-Maidan, born in Connecticut to a Saudi father and a Bahraini mother, citing privacy laws. After his family produced a Privacy Act waiver, authorizing the United States government to talk about the case, the State Department finally said this week it had concerns about the fairness of al-Maidan's trial, as well as his ""safety and welfare, his treatment in prison, including his medical and nutritional needs."" ""This a case that we've taken very seriously,"" said Jeff Rathke, a State Department spokesman, indicating the government has raised this ""at the highest levels of the government of Bahrain."" The Bahraini government has denied the charges, insisting it has a ""zero tolerance"" policy on torture. A report by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention documents sources saying that al-Maidan was forced to make a false confession under torture that he assaulted a police officer by throwing a stone at him. With no physical evidence, the conviction was based on that confession, the report said, adding that ""Mr. al-Maidan and his mother were able to credibly testify that he was at home the time that the crime was allegedly committed."" The group called for al-Maidan's release. A representative of al-Maidan's family confirmed to CNN details in the U.N. report, including that al-Maidan says his confession was extracted by acts of torture, including beatings in the chest and head, forcing him to stand for long periods despite a spinal condition and denying him access to a bathroom. Since his conviction, al-Maidan has endured ""further abuse and mistreatment,"" according to the report and representatives of the al-Maidan family. The U.N. report said the government ""did not provide any explanation or justification for these serious violations. Rathke said U.S. consular officers have visited al-Maidan five times during his two-year detention and that in response to concerns, he has been given access to medical care. The case presents a dilemma for the United States, which insists there is no greater priority than the protection of American citizens. The tiny Gulf kingdom is a key American ally in an unstable region and home to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet. Most recently, Bahrain has taken part in airstrikes against ISIS as part of the U.S.-led coalition. Washington has tempered its concerns about Bahrain's human rights record and its heavy-handed crackdown on a popular uprising. Local and human rights groups charge many Shiite Bahraini youths have been arbitrarily arrested and jailed for alleged crimes against security forces. Calling al-Maidan's arrest and continued detention ""arbitrary,"" the U.N. working group referred the allegations of his alleged abuse to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and called on the Bahraini government to immediately release him and grant him compensation for the ""harm he has suffered."" The Bahraini court upheld the verdict on appeal, but al-Maidan's lawyers say they have filed for another appeal and are waiting for a hearing date. Rathke said the State Department expected the case to go to appeal, and in its discussions with the Bahraini government continues to address its concern over judicial proceedings in the case and ""emphasize the importance of Bahrain's commitment to fair trial guarantees required by international law."" ""This is a matter of ongoing concern,"" Rathke said.","Tagi al-Maidan has been jailed in Bahrain for more than two years .

"The International Olympic Committee has suspended India's Olympic Association over an election for planning to stage an election that was to be contested by just one official who had been accused of corruption. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) was due to hold elections on Wednesday in which Lalit Bhanot, who spent 11 months in custody on corruption charges linked to the 2010 Commonwealth Games, but has since been released on bail, had been set to be appointed. Until the suspension is lifted, Indian athletes will not be able to participate in Game events, with the IOA also losing its IOC funding. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) took the decision because of the IOA's ""failure to comply with the Olympic Charter and its statures, failure to inform the IOC in a timely matter, and as a protective measure against government interference in the IOA's election process,"" said the Olympic governing body in a statement. ""With this decision, the IOA is no longer entitled to exercise any activity or right, including financial support, conferred upon it by the Olympic Charter or the IOC until the suspension is lifted by the IOC executive board. ""In particular, the executive board confirms that the IOA is not entitled to hold any elections until all pending issues are resolved and the EB decides to lift the suspension."" The IOA was due to hold elections on Wednesday in which an official accused of corruption relating to the 2010 Commonwealth Games had been set to be appointed. Root and branch reform . Indian shooter Abhinav Bindra, who won the country's only individual Olympic gold medalist after his success in the 10m air rifle in Beijing four years ago, called on the IOA to get its ""act together"". ""I think we should take it as an opportunity to try and clean up the system and build an Olympics association that we all can be proud of,"" Bindra told CNN. ""So far the association has not done anything for the development of Olympic sports in India."" And sports lawyer Rahul Mehra, who has been campaigning to improve governance within the IOA, welcomed the IOC's action. ""I am glad what our government could not do, the IOC has done,"" said Mehra. ""It should have been done two and half years when the Commonwealth Games happened which was the biggest scam this country has ever seen. That was the first wake up call."" Mehra also called for root and branch reform of the IOA. ""Yes its embarrassing for India, but we need a shakeup, we need a revolution of sorts. Its about transformation in Indian sports, we need new blood, we need new vigor in Indian sports.""","International Olympic Committee (IOC) suspends India for violating the Olympic charter .

"An American couple that went missing on a bike trek through Peru has been spotted ""safe and sound,"" the South American country's top tourism official said Tuesday. Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand are heading upstream in a small boat on a jungle river, said Jose Luis Silva, Peru's minister of tourism and commerce. ""They're currently in a remote, paradise-like region of the Peruvian Amazon, which is difficult to access,"" he told CNN. But even as authorities trumpeted the news, Hand's mother said in a statement that she won't believe it until she hears directly from her son. ""We have not heard from them since January 25, nor have they accessed bank accounts since that time,"" mother Francine Fitzgerald said. ""We have only the worst to consider as to why."" The couple, who hail from the San Francisco area, left last November and began a series of social media posts chronicling the trip of their dreams -- a four-month bike adventure through South America. ""Will be riding my bike in other countries and out of contact for 4 months!"" Neal wrote in a November Facebook post before flying with Hand to Buenos Aires, Argentina. But for weeks, the couple shared photos online from their trek through Argentina, Chile and Peru, showing themselves posing beside their bikes on remote mountain roads, camping out in tents and smiling at the beach. In late January, however, their Internet postings stopped and calls to their cell phones went unanswered. Family members say no one has been able to get in touch with them since then. Fitzgerald said both the U.S. Embassy in Peru and the country's interior ministry have called to say that Neal and Hand were spotted. But that's not enough, she said. ""Let me reiterate, until we have PROOF OF LIFE, we cannot celebrate these rumors and sightings,"" she wrote on a Facebook page set up to facilitate a search for the couple. ""Proof of life is my son's voice on the phone and a picture of him holding the missing poster."" Silva told CNN that the tourism ministry learned of the couple's location from police, who received a report from a clinic in the town of Angoteros after sending out a nationwide alert about the missing couple. The ministry will send a hydroplane tomorrow to shoot video of the couple and provide proof they're doing OK, he said. ""They have no idea of the commotion they have caused in the media,"" he said, ""because they simply can't communicate with family from where they currently are."" Neal and Hand, both 25, according to a family flyer, were last seen in Lima, the Peruvian capital. But some of the areas they planned to visit are out of cell phone and Internet reach. The Peruvian National Police earlier told CNN that the manager of a hostel in Pucallpa, where the couple stayed, confirmed to a police investigator they reached the jungle city in early February. The manager of Arco Iris Amazonica, a small hotel in the rain forest city of Iquitos, told police the couple stayed there on February 16 and told him they planned to travel to the town of Naplo, a 15-day trek. Peru is known for the Inca ruins of Machu Picchu, located in the Cusco region, which attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers each year. Two weeks ago, the U.S. Embassy in Lima issued a security message warning Americans of ""a potential kidnapping threat in the Cusco area."" ""The Embassy has received information that members of a criminal organization may be planning to kidnap U.S. citizen tourists in the Cusco and Machu Picchu area,"" the message said. But it also clarified that ""thousands of U.S. citizens routinely travel to the Cusco region without undue incident. The U.S. Embassy remains confident of the Peruvian government's efforts to ensure the safety of all tourists in the region."" Peru's tourism minister said Tuesday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about the negative impact of reports of the missing American couple. The reason the couple has been out of touch for so long has nothing to do with any crime, he said. ""These two young people have fallen in love with Peru,"" Silva said. ""They have visited off-the-beaten-path places and it seems like they're having a blast -- so much so that they have forgotten to communicate with their families.""","Peru's tourism minister say Jamie Neal and Garrett Hand were found in the Amazon .

"Prince Harry has arrived in the southern African nation of Angola to visit mine clearance projects run by the same charity backed by his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. Diana visited Angola in support of the Halo Trust in 1997, not long before her death in a car crash in Paris. Images of her wearing protective gear as she witnessed mine-clearing efforts in the towns of Huambo and Kuito helped draw the world's attention to the suffering caused by landmines. Her son's private visit to Angola comes three years after he traveled to Mozambique to see Halo's work there. ""Prince Harry is visiting a number of demining teams across the region and will be touring minefields and meeting with beneficiaries of Halo's work,"" said the charity's chief executive, Guy Willoughby. The trip will include a stop in the southern Angolan town of Cuito Cuanavale -- which according to Halo is believed to be the most heavily mined town in Africa. The remote town, population 43,000, was heavily mined and attacked during Angola's long-running civil war -- and work to make it safe for its residents continues today. Halo has removed and destroyed 21,300 anti-personnel and anti-tank mines from the area so far, with its efforts steadily moving out from the town center to areas farther afield. Halo, which began its work in the country in 1994, employs more than 650 Angolan staff. Its demining activities are focused in four of Angola's eighteen provinces -- Benguela, Bie, Huambo and Kuando Kubango. Its mine clearance work is increasingly focused on more rural areas, away from provincial centers, Halo says. As such areas are cleared, they can instead be used for growing crops, grazing animals or building houses. According to the charity, on average each hectare of land cleared benefits 11 families directly and 59  families indirectly. Halo is also involved in the country's national disarmament program. Angola's protracted civil war, which broke out after it gained independence from Portugal in 1975 and finally ended in 2002, killed up to 1.5 million people, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 4 million people were internally displaced, more than half of them children, the United Nations said. After peace was established, the country faced the challenge of reestablishing civil institutions, rebuilding damaged infrastructure, demobilizing large numbers of former fighters and clearing land mines.","Prince Harry's visit to Angola echoes one made by his mother shortly before her 1997 death .

"(CNN) -- The snowfall largely subsided in the Buffalo area Friday after nearly 7 feet in three days, but the deadly weather emergency is far from over: An expected warmup and weekend rains mean likely flooding -- and that's just the start of the problems. The heavy snow still threatens to collapse more roofs before it melts, and officials are urging stir-crazy residents not to even think about driving unless absolutely necessary, even as some major roads began to reopen Friday. Rain starting Saturday, and a warmup to 60 degrees on Monday, means more misery is ahead after the snowstorms that officials say have contributed to at least 13 deaths. ""Warming will bring melting. Melting will bring water. Water will bring floods,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters Friday. ""(Likely) more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time."" Some roofs already have crumbled, but rain may collapse more, in part because the already heavy snow perched atop buildings will soak up this weekend's rain before it melts, Erie County officials have said. About 30 roofs collapsed from Thursday night into Friday morning, Erie County Deputy Executive Richard Tobe told reporters Friday morning. With the rain and melting, some communities will be at risk of flooding through Tuesday . ""(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time,"" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. Some major roads, such as parts of the New York State Thruway, will reopen Friday afternoon, and some local driving bans are being lifted -- but largely so that trucks can deliver food to stores and crews can remove abandoned vehicles, Cuomo said. He added that no one should drive unless necessary. ""If you have a nonessential purpose, now is not the time to be driving around,"" Cuomo said. ""The roads are still dangerous."" Snow and vehicle removals still are major tasks ahead. Erie County crews have had to deal with clearing 1,800 lane-miles of county roads before getting to residential streets, Poloncarz said Friday. Cities and towns may have had more success with residential areas; 93% of hard-hit south Buffalo's residential streets had been plowed at least once by Friday, Mayor Bryon Brown said. Man found dead in vehicle; senior dies after evacuation . The latest of the 13 deaths to be counted is a 68-year-old man who died of a heart attack while snowplowing his driveway in Cheektowaga, according to Erie County Spokesman Benjamin Swanekamp. The death toll also includes one senior citizen who died of natural causes after or while the person was evacuated Thursday from a nursing home in Cheektowaga, officials said. Earlier, authorities said two people had died, but they corrected themselves at an afternoon news conference. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will take place at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. But even leaving the Buffalo area had its complications. Before meeting at the Bills' stadium Friday morning to get on a bus to the airport, some of the players had to be picked up by snowmobile because of driving bans in certain areas, team spokesman Scott Berchtold said. Seeking shelter . At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped onto a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped onto ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. ""I'm ready for it to end,"" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. ""I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this."" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. ""We've been eating like kings for a while, but now we're running out of food,"" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a 5-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. Nearly a year's snowfall in three days . Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said Thursday. ""The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,"" she said. ""We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow."" The 86 inches that fell in some areas in three days come close to a year's worth of snow. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Extreme conditions lead to tragedy . The 10 other people who died included four who suffered cardiac issues while they shoveled snow and one who died in a car accident, Erie County officials reported. A man in his 60s had a heart attack while he tried to move a snowplow or a snowblower, said Tobe, the Erie County deputy executive. Two residents, from Niagara and Erie counties, died of apparent exposure Wednesday night or Thursday morning, Dr. Gale R. Burstein, Erie County health commissioner, said Thursday. ""They both had chronic illnesses,"" she said. ""They both had mental health issues, and were found outside either their home or a close friend's home. They had probably been there overnight."" Brown, the Buffalo mayor, and other city officials recounted stories of rescuers trudging around snowdrifts as high as houses to get people to hospitals, and police officers delivering special baby formula to a pair of infants. CNN's Alexandra Field, Leigh Remizowski, Ashley Fantz, Ed Payne, Marcus Hooper, Martin Savidge, Catherine E. Shoichet and Jill Martin contributed to this report.","Officials up death toll to 13 .

"I'm a quitter and proud of it. November 20 -- the 37th anniversary of the Great American Smokeout -- marks my 28th anniversary without a ""cancer stick."" It was 1986; I was 28 at the time and had smoked a pack a day since I was 15. That's about 95,000 cigarettes! All these years later, writing that figure still makes me feel sick to my stomach. (Or should I say, lungs?) The last cigarette: Nine ex-smokers who quit the habit for good . Like a lot of teenagers in my day, I started smoking in high school. At the time, 1973, it was the cool thing to do and if there was anything I aspired to, cool was it. Sucked into the rip tide of popular culture, my juvenile-delinquent brain gravitated toward anything that questioned authority or was anti-establishmentarian, just like my heroes. Too young to go to Woodstock, I could still bang out a Joan Baez tune on my guitar, recite enough lines of Allen Ginsberg's ""Howl"" to prove I was cooler than cool and buy cigarettes. Nobody stopped me. A cigarette dangling from these radical lips was part of the image I had carefully crafted for myself. Cancer? Didn't give it a thought. And nobody at home mentioned it either. This, despite the fact that neither my mother nor my grandmother, with whom we lived, smoked. The war in Vietnam, the protests against it, the music, Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, the psychedelic drug scene, feminism and the whole counter-culture movement was way more intriguing than President Nixon's war on cancer. Only old people got cancer. Like my dear Uncle Frank, who died at 48 -- an astonishingly young age, I later realized -- of throat cancer, when I was in eighth grade. He started smoking at an even younger age than me. My high school in the suburbs of Baltimore had a smoking lounge my junior year, 1975. It was outside the cafeteria, so students could smoke before school and during lunch break. Regardless, smoking didn't stop in the bathrooms, and I have plenty of suspensions on my record to prove it. I was addicted. Still, I had a responsible side. I worked like a dog at a pizza joint in town and felt I had earned the right to spend my money the way I saw fit. Heck, I was bringing home $52 a week and spending less than $3 on my nicotine habit, with cigarettes costing 35 cents a pack. You know you're hooked when, despite being bedridden with a terrible case of strep throat at 17, you're craving a cigarette. Or when it's 2 in the morning and you're too tired to drive to 7-11, so you scrounge through all your ashtrays, fishing for a butt with a modicum of tobacco left. Or you're with friends and they light up, so you light up because that's just good social courtesy, right? It was pathetic. I started coughing my junior year of college, especially in the morning. I was an English major spending all my free time writing poetry and song lyrics. Those Marlboros got me through many all-nighters, typing papers on Sylvia Plath, John Berryman, Edgar Allen Poe. The drinking age at the time was 18 and the college bar scene was hopping. Hell, we were just having fun, were young and invincible and had plenty of time to do ""the adult thing"" after graduation. I'd quit then. But I didn't. It was 1982 and I had moved to Vermont. I netted about $100 a week working at a department store, as the demand for poetry and song writers wasn't what I had hoped. Depression and cigarettes made comfortable bedfellows. Compared to a lot of things I could be spending my money on, cigarettes were tame and cheaper, I kept telling myself. But a major change was taking place. When I heard that secondhand smoke could harm the people around me, it was hard to swallow. More than two-thirds of nonsmokers and half of all smokers believed smoking was hazardous to the health of nonsmokers, according to a 1978 Tobacco Institute report. I was hurting myself and innocent bystanders. Sadly, it didn't matter enough. By 26, I was waking up regularly in a cold sweat, my pulse racing so fast I thought I was having a heart attack. Subsequent medical attention ruled out cardiac issues, but a chest X-ray revealed some significant ""shadows"" for a person my age. The doctor clicked his tongue annoyed, ""You should give up smoking. It's just not cool."" For two years, I lived with the horrible burden of panic attacks, not knowing what caused them or how to stop them. Then one day, in a brilliant moment of clarity, I realized that I was scared to die. I was scared to die from the effects of smoking cigarettes. It was all so clear -- I had to quit smoking. I had read about the Great American Smokeout in the local newspaper. It was the following Thursday, November 20, 1986. My mother's birthday. It was the nicest present I could give her -- she didn't think smoking was very ladylike -- and the present I had to give myself. I quit cold turkey and never looked back. Sometimes that first year I would wake up with nightmares that I had started smoking again. I had to shake myself until I realized that I hadn't and embrace, once again, my victory over dependence. Twenty eight years later, I've lived a second life with a wonderful marriage, two beautiful daughters, and many incredible adventures. I've never once craved another cigarette or had a panic attack. At 56, I'm still finding out just how cool life really is. Did you grow up when cigarettes were ""cool""? Share your story in the comments.

"(CNN) -- A German citizen of Afghan descent was the source of much of the information on a potential ""Mumbai-style"" terror plot in Europe, a German counterterrorism official said Wednesday. The man, Ahmed Sidiqi, was detained in Kabul in July and transferred to U.S. custody where he has ""revealed details about the terror plot,"" said the official, who did not want to be named because he is not authorized to talk to the media. The man and several other Germans traveled from Hamburg to the Afghan-Pakistan border area in 2009, where he joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, an extremist group allied with al Qaeda, German intelligence officials said. Sidiqi, once captured, ""started to talk a lot,"" and detailed a ""Mumbai-style"" attack in Europe, the German official said. Eiffel Tower evacuated after bomb threat . Ten men launched a carefully planned attack on buildings in Mumbai, India, on November 26, 2008. The attack on such prominent sites -- such as the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel, the Oberoi-Trident hotels, the historic Victoria Terminus train station and a Jewish cultural center -- lasted three days and killed 164 people. Sidiqi is from Hamburg where he worked for a cleaning company at the Hamburg international airport, the German official said. He attended the Masjid Taiba mosque, formerly known as the Al-Quds mosque, in Hamburg, which became known as the meeting place of those behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Among those who prayed there was Mohammad Atta, one of the hijackers who commandeered the first plane that crashed into New York's World Trade Center. Sidiqi was part of Atta's circle, the official said. Hamburg shut down the mosque this year, not long after Sidiqi's capture. National Intelligence Director James Clapper would not talk about a plot Tuesday evening. ""We are not going to comment on specific intelligence, as doing so threatens to undermine intelligence operations that are critical to protecting the U.S. and our allies,"" he said. ""As we have repeatedly said, we know al Qaeda wants to attack Europe and the United States."" Meanwhile, a federal law enforcement official in the United States, said ""the volume seems to be turned up"" on the threat information coming out of Europe. The intelligence indicates there is interest in using people with Western passports in an attack, that official said. This source says the potential operatives may be a mix of Europeans and others possibly including North Africans, Pakistanis, Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks. There is concern about an ""active shooter"" scenario that would create as many casualties and as much chaos as possible in a short period of time. The Mumbai attacks showed how effective this kind of an attack can be in drawing attention. According to this source, economic targets in Europe could be possible targets, including institutions such as banks and stock exchanges. A separate law enforcement source said ""the belief is"" that Osama bin Laden signed off on a European attack plan, and that source confirmed the intelligence related to a Mumbai-style attack. The German government is increasingly concerned about the number of Germans becoming jihadists. According to a senior German counterterrorism source, some 200 individuals have traveled to train with Jihadist groups in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region since the 9/11 attacks. The potential plot against Europe was one factor contributing to the uptick this month in missile strikes by unmanned drones against terrorist targets in Pakistan, according to a U.S. official. ""We would be remiss not to try to take action to thwart what might be underway in Europe,"" said the official. The official emphasized that the potential plot was not the sole factor. U.S. officials say they are taking advantage of what they call ""precise intelligence."" Most of the drone attacks this year have been focused on North Waziristan, a mountainous area bordering Afghanistan where Pakistani security forces have little control. That has continued to be the pattern this month. Based on information from Pakistani officials, CNN estimates there have been 20 drone attacks in the area in September alone, a higher number than in any previous month, and more than twice the monthly average. Acknowledging the spike, one U.S. official told CNN: ""Our operational tempo has been up for a while now, we have good information driving it, and given the stakes involved, we hope to keep the pressure on as long as we can."" According to the official, the mix of threats remains the same. It comes from groups like the Haqqani network, al Qaeda, the Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban. The threats they pose are ""all deadly,"" said the official. Pakistani officials say many recent strikes have been aimed at compounds in or around the town of Miramshah, a stronghold of the Haqqani network. Western intelligence officials have long regarded the Haqqanis as one of the most dangerous terror groups and have linked them to several attacks in Kabul. Intelligence analysts point to other reasons for the escalated drone attacks. They include better information from sources in the border area and better surveillance technology -- including the growing use of spy balloons fitted with high-powered cameras. In addition, the rising number of drone strikes is designed to deprive the Afghan Taliban of ""strategic depth"" as the Obama administration's campaign to defeat the insurgency enters a crucial phase and tighten the noose on the senior al Qaeda leadership. Pakistani officials say one strike last weekend killed Sheikh Mohammad Fateh al Masri, described as the group's senior operational commander. CNN's Pam Benson, Paul Cruickshank, Tim Lister and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Man talks about a ""Mumbai-style"" attack in Europe, official says .

"In an odd way, I sense calm as cars and buses whiz by at rush hour. It is a sign of normalcy. The snow has stopped falling and more people are out and about on this afternoon. West Florissant Avenue almost looks like it did before that August day when Michael Brown was shot and killed. Except the reminders that are hard to miss. The burned and looted QuikTrip gas station. The boarded up businesses. And on Canfield Drive, a block away, a memorial to Brown. Businesss owners covered up windows and doors with plywood after protesters clashed with police on West Florissant. Some had taken the plywood down but have put the boards back up, ahead of a grand jury decision on whether to indict police Officer Darren Wilson. It is as if they are readying for a storm. They scribbled the word ""Open"" on the plywood. And neighborhood kids wasted no time making their mark with spray-painted graffiti. But on Thursday, artist Damon Davis was out covering up some of the scars, creating beauty amid the ugliness. I watch as he picks up a roller and applies a layer of glue on the plywood covering up a window to Red's Barbecue. He positions one of his photographs and sticks it on. ""The plywood is so ugly,"" he says. Davis was among those who took to the streets to demand accountability for Brown's death. What happened in Ferguson, he says, should never again happen anywhere in America. It is personal for him. He is a 29-year-old black man who was born and raised in impoverished East St. Louis. Racial inequities have always been big in his artistic expressions. He took photos of the hands of the people around him at the Ferguson protests. Black hands. White hands. Old ones and young ones. And he made them into posters to display in public. ""We have a lot of people from a lot of backgrounds coming together,"" he says. ""People look at the hands and kind of get it instantly."" Hands have become a big symbol for Ferguson protesters who allege that Wilson shot Brown even though he was unarmed and, they say, had his hands up in the air. Some Wilson supporters, however, say Brown was a thief and a thug who scuffled with the officer and provoked him into shooting. Davis' art caught my eye instantly as I drove down West Florissant, past fast food shops, beauty stores, laundromats and convenience stores, all made ugly by the plywood. Martez Davis and Anthony Gatling help Davis put up his work. Davis is only 14 and in the eighth grade. But he says he wants to be out here, helping the cause. A local store donated a cooler full of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk. It is the only food the crew had eaten since morning. Damon Davis is grateful that local businesses are supportive, especially since they paid a heavy price in lost revenues after the protests erupted. As a young artist, Davis hoped to retain a fascination and wonder for the process of storytelling. That's what his Web page statement says. But never did he expect to find himself walking West Florissant Avenue, plastering his art over boarded-up shops. Now his hands stand as memorial. And, he says, as hope amid despair. He has many more sheets of plywood to cover as I leave him for the justice center in Clayton where the grand jury decision is expected to be announced at any moment. In the rear view mirror, West Florissant Avenue fades, just for a minute, and I see only the prints of hands on paper.","Damon Davis saw the hands of fellow protesters as a symbol of unity .

"For years Venice has battled the effects of rising waters on its historic architecture, but now it's facing a new threat -- wheeled suitcases. City officials have become so tired with the cacophony of rumbling luggage they're introducing fines of up to 500 euros ($620) for anyone caught using one. The move, due to come into effect in May 2015, is likely to create a headache for many of 22 million who annually visit the city and need to cart bags to hotels in car-free streets. For locals, long tired of plastic or hard rubber wheels rattling past their windows as they try to sleep, it will come as a welcome relief. The new rules, which will require luggage to be transported on quieter air-filled tires, are the idea of City Commissioner Victor Zappalorto, according to the Il Messaggero newspaper. 'Serious discomfort' City officials have reportedly said the noise from hard-wheeled suitcases and traders using trolleys was causing ""serious discomfort."" There were also concerns about the ""progressive deterioration"" of historic marble steps, stone pathways and footbridges around Venice's old canals. The local Il Gazzettino newspaper says the new rule will be legally binding as it'll be written into local building code . Zappalorto has suggested the legislation will be an opportunity for an entrepreneurial luggage to cash in in by creating a Venice-friendly suitcase that runs on soft tires. Whether or not the idea takes off could depend on how loud the rumblings of complaint from visitors are. Do you think Venice is right to ban wheeled suitcases? Let us know in the comments below.","Venice authorities say wheeled suitcases are a noise nuisance and cause damage to historic streets .

"Obamacare might be a big talking point for politicians on Capitol Hill, but a new survey shows President Barack Obama's health care law wasn't at the top of the agenda for midterm voters earlier this month. Party preferences and individual candidate platforms -- not the Affordable Care Act -- were the main factors that drove Americans to their polling places, according to a survey about health care released Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation. When asked in their own words to name what influenced their vote for a member of Congress, just over one quarter of voters surveyed said that the most important factor was making sure their party had control. Twenty one percent of Democratic voters said that a candidate's platform was important, while the same percentage of Republican voters said that jobs and the economy factored heavily into their decision. Only 13 percent of Democrats and 8 percent of Republicans listed health care in the top two factors that mattered most to them. RELATED: Boehner: House GOP files Obamacare suit . The survey also showed that 5 percent of Republican voters specifically mentioned their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. On the other end of the spectrum, 3 percent of Democratic voters voiced their support for the ACA as the reason they cast a ballot. When asked about the specifics of the law, 16 percent of those surveyed said the law has helped them and their families, compared to 24 percent who said the opposite. The majority -- 59 percent -- said that so far, the ACA has had no direct impact. Overall, Obama's health care law maintains a 46 percent unfavorability rating according to the poll, a number that has remained relatively steady since its implementation in March 2010. Thirty-seven percent have a favorable view of the law. The Kaiser Foundation conducted the survey of about 1,500 American adults Nov. 5-13 via telephone. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.","A new poll shows little interest in Obamacare from midterm voters .

"(CNN)After landing a probe on an icy comet and possibly shedding new light on the origins of life on Earth, the European Space Agency (ESA) is now looking at scorching-hot Mercury for its next mission. The innermost planet of our solar system orbits so close to the Sun that, in some instances, surface temperature surpasses 400 °C. Areas of the planet without sunlight, on the other hand, can become as cold as -170 °C. No other planet has variations in temperature so severe. The reason for this is the absence of any significant atmosphere, which Mercury is too hot and too small to retain. With a diameter of just over 3,000 miles, it's just a third larger than the Moon, and smaller than two other moons in the solar system -- Saturn's Titan and Jupiter's Ganymede. ESA's mission to Mercury will tentatively launch on 21 July 2016, to reach Mercury's orbit seven and a half years later, in 2024. The spacecraft is called BepiColombo -- in honor of Italian space pioneer Giuseppe ""Bepi"" Colombo. Mercury is the least studied of the inner planets, but it has many peculiarities. ""Mercury is special,"" said Johannes Benkhoff, the project scientist in charge of the BepiColombo mission, ""It's the densest planet in our solar system, even denser than Earth - if we consider uncompressed density - and has a magnetic field, like Earth, that no one expected before, so I guess it's a cool planet to go to."" There are many challenging aspects to a mission to Mercury, most prominently its proximity to the Sun, with its mighty gravitational pull and intense radiation. The planet's high orbital velocity of 48 kilometers per second -- compared to Earth's 30 kilometers per second -- is also an issue. Any probe en route to Mercury must not only cover an average linear distance of 48 million miles, but carefully gauge its velocity so that it can catch the fast planet's orbit without getting sucked into the Sun's gravitational well. As a result, only two missions have visited Mercury so far. The first was NASA's Mariner 10, launched in 1973. This was  the first spacecraft to use the ""gravitational slingshot"" technique, which uses a planet's gravity to affect the trajectory and the speed of a spacecraft, saving on fuel and time. Bepi Colombo's calculations were used to plot Mariner 10's trip to Mercury, in a maneuver that has been widely used in space exploration ever since. The second mission is still underway: it's called Messenger and it was launched -- again by NASA -- in 2004. It is currently orbiting the planet and will continue to study it well into 2015. Nevertheless, ESA feels that there is enough mystery about Mercury to warrant a third mission. ""Messenger found so many surprising, unexpected results that we have a lot of good reasons to follow-up on what they did,"" Benkhoff told CNN, ""It's a huge benefit that we have this mission in that stage, because only ten years later we will be at Mercury, follow-up on what Messenger did and get a huge, wonderful exploration of this planet."" The mission will, once again, use gravity assists to reach its destination: it will first complete a fly-by of Earth, essentially returning to our planet two years after launch. Then it will perform two fly-bys of Venus, before finally heading toward Mercury. Upon arrival, a module called Mercury Planet Orbiter (MPO) will separate from the rest of the spacecraft and perform a detailed study of the Mercury system. This module is designed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, which jointly conducts the mission along with ESA. BepiColombo will help us understand how planets can form so close to their parent star, and will analyze Mercury's geology and magnetic field. It will also provide further confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Mercury's strange orbital pattern first puzzled physicists in 1845, when it was discovered that it did not conform to Newton's theory of gravity. This was later explained by relativity, which revealed that Mercury's warped orbit was due to curved space and not some unseen object. BepiColombo will be in an optimal position to gather extremely precise data about the planet's dance around the Sun, offering the ultimate validation to Einstein's idea.

"Days ahead of a deadline to strike a deal, Iran's foreign minister engaged Friday in what Britain's top diplomat deemed ""complex"" but ""useful discussions"" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program that -- despite positive vibes on both sides -- have yet to produce a breakthrough. ""There are still significant gaps,"" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said from Vienna. ""... We are going away for technical discussions."" One person who wasn't going away -- or at least leaving Vienna -- was Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Zarif met for a second time in recent days with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and the European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. His next meetings were with Hammond and French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. The Iranian minister once planned to return to Tehran on Friday night to consult with leaders there. But a member of his delegation said that, for the moment, the Iranian minister had no plans to leave Austria. There's a lot at stake ahead of a November 24 deadline for the U.S. and five other world powers to reach an agreement with Iran over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. Iran and the group known as the P5+1 -- consisting of Germany, the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain, the latter five being permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- agreed last February on a framework for comprehensive negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program. P5+1 and Iran agree on nuclear negotiation framework . In July, they agreed to a four-month extension of those negotiations -- another positive step, but still anything but a long-term agreement to put the issue to rest. A deal could mean an end to significant sanctions against Tehran and an opening up of the country to the West, a transition that would have begun with the June 2013 election of Hassan Rouhani as Iran's president. The lack of a deal could further inflame tensions and could lead to more punitive measures -- perhaps more sanctions or even military strikes or a confrontation of some sort. Iran has insisted that like other countries, it has a right to develop nuclear power. Western powers have accused Iran of not being forthright enough and trying to develop not just nuclear power, but nuclear weapons as well. To this point, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, who is not part of Vienna talks, said Thursday that Iranian authorities are continuing to deny his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities. ""Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency,"" Yukiya Amano said from Austria. Kerry, America's top diplomat, talked by phone with Sergey Lavrov, his Russian counterpart, about the Iran negotiations, Russia's Foreign Ministry said. He had been scheduled to leave Vienna on Friday night but delayed his exit until at least Saturday ""in order to continue consultations"" with Zarif, Ashton and others, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. The same day, U.S. President Barack Obama made an announcement that seems to signal that, at the least, Washington hasn't given up hope on a deal by announcing a ""pause (to) efforts to further further reduce Iran's crude oil sales during the"" ongoing talks. ""In return for this and other limited relief measures, Iran has taken steps that have halted -- and in key respects rolled back -- progress on its nuclear program,"" the White House said in a statement. ""The International Atomic Energy Agency has verified that Iran is meeting these commitments."" As to the talks, Hammond in a statement described them as ""positive discussions"" conducted in ""a very cordial atmosphere."" ""It is clear that both sides want to try to get a deal done but none of us want a bad deal, and we are very clear that we have to get more flexibility from the Iranians,"" he said. ""In return, we are prepared to show some flexibility on our side. But time is short."" Ali Larijani, the head of Iran's parliament, sounded an optimistic note in remarks reported by IRNA. He said that when you look at the talks as a whole, there are grounds for a deal. ""As far as I'm informed, the two sides have had serious talks,"" he said.","U.S. won't push to reduce Iran's oil sales; thinks Iran has halted nuclear progress .

"Jerusalem woke up on Tuesday to horrific images of slain Jewish worshipers, and scores injured in a terror attack on a synagogue. The assault which took place in the western Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof, shocked Israel to the core, as well as many others around the world. This is not surprising considering both the brutality of the attack and the fact it was carried out in a holy place, where innocent religious people were worshiping. The two assailants, cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, were shot dead by the Israeli security forces. The incident in addition to the ongoing violence since the beginning of summer, left the city of Jerusalem more divided than for a long time. The attack this week should have also sent a clear message to both leaderships that if they will not take measures to calm the situation down, further escalation and worse violence is around the corner. Regrettably, the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the ""Battle for Jerusalem."" He also accused the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas of involvement despite the latter's condemnation of the killing. Both sides are employing inflammable language, although it is hard to blame the Palestinian president for feeling angry considering Israeli behavior since the collapse of the peace process in April. To make things worse, it emerged in recent days that Israel has also decided to return to a policy of demolishing houses of terrorists' families, even if they were killed during the attack. The Israeli security establishment argues that this form of punishment serves as a deterrence for any other would-be assailants. Regardless of the fate they face, their families are going to pay a heavy price and will be left homeless. In a society where three generations of one family might live under the same roof, one act harms quite a few people, from babies to the elderly.  To prove the seriousness of their intentions, the Israeli security forces already demolished a home on Wednesday. The home in Silwan was that of the Palestinian who drove his car into a crowd last month, killing two people. He was killed in the attack. The Army also moved to demolish the houses of the two who carried out the killing at the synagogue in Jerusalem. Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army.  A report produced, following an investigation by the Israeli security establishment, found this action counter-productive. There is actually evidence that house demolition led to a rise in the number of attacks. House demolition of Palestinian militants' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge, concealed behind a claim of deterrence. A similar ""standard"" was never applied to a Jewish terrorist. For instance when a  Jewish settler, Baruch Goldstein, slayed 29 Muslim worshipers in the Cave of Patriarchs, no one suggested to demolish his home as a deterrence. According to the Israeli human rights organization B'tselem, in the height of the Second Intifada, between 2001-2005, 664 Palestinian homes were demolished in the occupied Palestinian territories as an apparent deterrence. There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security. It is worth remembering that the demolition of Palestinian houses in the West Bank also takes place for the purpose of expanding settlements, something which aggravates an already hostile population. Arbitrary house demolitions represent not only a bad policy, but are also illegal and immoral. This is a clear violation of international law, more specifically the Fourth Geneva Convention, clearly prohibits forcing individuals and groups out of their homes within an occupied territory. Any demolition of houses when there are no overwhelming military reasons is regarded as a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and could potentially lead to a war crime charge. And there is also, of course, a moral aspect. As deplorable as some of the acts committed by a few individuals, their punishment should not extend beyond their death or what the court decides. Their families, as a result, suffered a loss too, for no fault of their own. To condemn them to destitution for an act that they did not commit is a moral travesty. The decision by the Israelis to resume Palestinian house demolition following an attack on Jews in Israel is not a security decision but a political one, aimed to satisfy an angry public and extreme right-wing members of the current coalition. The Israeli coalition depends on satisfying their demands. However, the lack of credibility of the deterrence argument, combined with the immorality and illegality of house demolitions should serve as an overwhelming reason not to resume this abysmal practice.","Two Palestinians carried out a deadly attack on a Jerusalem synagogue this week .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of people marched in protest through Djibouti on Friday, rallying against the ruling elite as well as economic stagnation within the small African nation. ""The march was peaceful and diverse,"" said Aly Verjee, director of the international election observation mission to Djibouti, who witnessed the event. But riot police charged the crowd after the call to evening prayers, shooting canisters of tear gas at the demonstrators, he said. Protests in Djibouti, located along the Horn of Africa, began in late January and echo many of the same sentiments brewing among demonstrators protesting governments across North Africa and the Middle East. Protesters have called for President Ismail Omar Guelleh -- whose family has ruled the country since its independence from France in 1977 -- to step down ahead of the elections scheduled in April. On Friday, protesters marched to the main stadium in the city-state. Guelleh has held the post since 1999 and is seeking a third term. 'It was much larger than previous protests,"" Verjee said. Djibouti is a tiny country, but important to Western interests as it houses a U.S. Navy and French Navy base vital for the fight against Somali piracy and for monitoring neighboring Somalia. Djibouti's strategic importance to the United States is substantial. It's home to Camp Lemonnier, the only U.S. military base on the continent. The 88-acre former French military barracks is used as a staging ground for U.S. counterterrorism efforts including, reportedly, CIA drone attacks on al Qaeda terrorists. The facility is the headquarters for the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa. More than 2,000 military personnel are stationed at Camp Lemonnier. They include members of the U.S. Army 218th Field Artillery Regiment and the Marine 9th Provisional Security Force. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this report.","Riot police responded with tear gas, witness says .

"(CNN) -- Joseph Mathenge hadn't planned to be at Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2013, when gunmen -- now associated with Islamist terror group Al Shabaab -- infiltrated the shopping center and started shooting en masse in a blitz that resulted in 67 deaths. The Kenyan photojournalist, who last month won African Journalist of the Year at the 2014 CNN MultiChoice African Journalist Awards, was with his son, Geoff Kihote, en route to take photos at a wedding. Geoff had been diagnosed with bone cancer, and the assignment was to help pay for his treatment in India. It was at that moment that Mathenge got a call from a friend inside the mall. ""I happened to be in a dilemma, because a friend of mine just called,"" he recalls. ""She was trapped in Westgate, held hostage by terrorists, and here is my son. I had to actually think about it. "" It was his son who told him they had to go. When they arrived, they found chaos. People were streaming out of the mall, ducking for cover, at a time when they were trying to find a way in. ""There were gun shots being fired all over as we tried to look for access into the building,"" recalls Mathenge. Once inside, Mathenge and his son took turns taking photos and helping injured hostages. They also communicated with security and police forces to direct them around the mall. ""I told (my son) to be cautious and to be focused, because any minute we could be shot,"" says Mathenge. With security, they located the friend who'd originally called, and moved them out of the mall. At that point, they left the scene. The father and son pair spent about eight hours in the mall. ""We went to the car, transmitted our pictures to newsrooms, and then we went to a restaurant where we sat down and had coffee without talking to anybody. That was our way of actually settling down our minds,"" says Mathenge. ""It was important for me to take pictures, to show the world exactly what was happening, to document the moment so that future generations could know exactly what happened."" The series, entitled ""Images of Terror"", first appeared in the Kenyan daily newspaper The Standard. Exposing corruption . Mathenge was one of several African journalists honored at the awards, held in Dar el Salaam, Tanzania last month. Other winners included South African journalists Susan Comrie and Joy Summers, for TV network Carte Blanche, who uncovered corruption in a solar geyser installment scheme in South Africa's townships. Their undercover reporting won them the G-E Energy and Infrastructure Award. ""It's a story of big money, and promises to the poor that they were going to get hot water,"" says Summers. ""(The solar geysers) were going to save the city a huge amount of electricity. They were supposed to be locally manufactured, they were supposed to create jobs. I don't think they did any of what was supposed to happen."" 'Voice to the voiceless' Rashid Ibrahim, a cameraman for Kenyan network Citizen TV, won the News Impact Award for ""Veiled Justice"", about the rapes of very young girls within a secretive Somali clan in northern Kenya. ""As cameramen, we like to hide ourselves behind the lens. Sometimes, you just put on your headsets, you focus and then you let the story flow,"" says Ibrahim.

"(CNN) -- Analysts say the slaying of one of Latin America's best-known folk singers over the weekend shines a spotlight on problems with deep roots in Guatemala: violence, impunity and the pervasive presence of organized crime . ""It shows how far these groups have infiltrated. ... It's a very large blow first of all to the country's image, and secondly to its government,"" said Miguel Castillo, a professor of political science at the University of Francisco Marroquin in Guatemala City. Gunmen ambushed Argentinian folk singer Facundo Cabral when he was on his way to the airport in the nation's capital Saturday, authorities said. As investigators continued searching for suspects Monday, the high-profile shooting drew increasing attention throughout Latin America, where Cabral gained fame as a protest singer who pushed for peace. ""The Guatemalan people are quite shocked and outraged, and we have to face the situation like others we have faced in a country that is fighting to get out of this state of violence that has hit us so hard,"" Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said in an interview Monday with Mexico's MVS Radio. Corruption and violence are high in Guatemala, according to the United Nations, which created a committee in 2006 to investigate those issues there. More than 200,000 people have been killed in Guatemala since 1970, mostly as a result of organized crime, drug-trade violence and a 36-year civil war that ended in 1996. Violence in Guatemala drew international attention in May after investigators found the bodies of 27 dismembered and decapitated workers on a farm in a northern border province -- brutal evidence of what officials and analysts said is a dramatic spike in violence across the region as Mexican drug cartels expand their reach. Colom Monday attributed Cabral's killing to ""organized crime,"" telling MVS Radio that evidence indicated the Nicaraguan businessman driving him to the airport was the attackers' intended target. But analyst Samuel Logan cautioned that in the run-up to Guatemala's September elections, government officials may have different motives in describing the situation. ""To say that this famous Argentine musician wasn't a target lends credence to the idea that Guatemala's a safe place to travel for musicians or just in general,"" said Logan, the managing director of Southern Pulse, an online information network focused on Latin America. It's possible that hit-men targeted Cabral, Logan said. ""Groups like Los Zetas have killed people simply for the songs that they sung publicly. My question was, what did he sing? What was his playlist? ... It could have been just that simple,"" he added. In recent weeks, Guatemalan officials have touted arrests of members of Los Zetas as a sign that they're cracking down on crime. Cabral's killing is one of many indications that the government's efforts have seen limited results, Castillo said. ""The (criminal) organizations' structures have not been damaged. Yes, there are a few accomplishments, but the long-term impact isn't so large,"" he said. Henry Brands, an assistant professor of public policy at Duke University who published an analysis of violence and politics in the Central American country last year, said Cabral's killing is ""very striking."" ""It makes people sit up and take note, but the fact is that this is really not a new phenomenon in Guatemala,"" he said. Drug-fueled organized crime has had a strong presence in the Central American country for decades, he said. ""This is probably a depressingly familiar story for most Guatemalans. ...The single dominant theme of Guatemalan politics is citizen insecurity,"" Brands said. ""The basic problem in Guatemala is that the crime is so deeply rooted in the social and institutional structures of the country that it's going to take a sort of exorcism to solve the problem."" Journalist Patzy Vasquez contributed to this report.","Gunmen ambushed Facundo Cabral in Guatemala City on Saturday .

"Evangelical leaders are taking a step back from their decades-long fight against gay marriage, softening their tone and recalibrating their goals. In recent interviews with about a half-dozen prominent evangelicals, no one listed opposition to gay marriage as their top priority. The leaders said they're more focused on protecting religious liberties as same-sex marriage becomes legal in a growing number of states. ""Is it time to differentiate between religious ceremony and civil ceremony?"" Jim Daly, the president of Focus on the Family, said in an interview with CNN. ""Civil ceremony to the Christian community is no different than getting your car registered."" The shifting attitude comes as the Supreme Court could take up gay marriage as early as next year. Meanwhile, Republicans, who will take full control of Congress in January, are largely ignoring the issue -- just like most of the leading potential GOP contenders for the 2016 presidential nomination. ""There is a recognition that while the fight should not be given up on upholding the several thousand-year-old definition of marriage, the courts are probably very quickly going to undo that,"" said Erick Erickson, a conservative pundit and editor of RedState.com. ""Behind the scenes, a lot of evangelical leaders inside and outside of politics are laying the groundwork for religious liberty and conscience protections."" Implications for GOP . The new stance could have big implications for Republicans heading into the 2016 presidential election. Evangelicals are an influential bloc of the party and if the community eases its opposition to same-sex marriage, that could make it easier for candidates to do the same. The party is under pressure to expand its appeal to young people and minorities and an openness to gay marriage could help that effort. Hambycast: Rand Paul's campus challenge . Of course, there's still plenty of opposition to same-sex marriage among Republicans. And the issue is a big fundraising motivator for the party and its allies. Vincent Harris, a 26-year-old digital strategist who's worked for evangelical favorites like Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee said social issues including gay marriage ""remain very potent to the Republican electorate."" 'Joke notion' Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, dismissed talk of an evangelical shift as a ""joke notion."" ""People are still charged up about this,"" Brown said. ""There's not been enough standing up for marriage especially in the wake of what is essentially a constitutional crisis."" Daly, whose daily Focus on the Family radio broadcast reach more than 2.9 million listeners weekly, is nowhere close to endorsing same-sex unions and insists that the legalization of gay marriage in the U.S. isn't a ""fait accompli."" But his vision for the evangelical movement is focused on reaching out to, rather than attacking or rejecting, other segments of society—what he calls taking a ""gracious attitude."" He frequently mentioned his ""friends in the gay rights community."" One of those friends is Ted Trimpa, a prominent gay activist and Democratic strategist. The two struck up an unlikely friendship after Daly reached out to Trimpa's office about two years ago to team up and fight child trafficking in their home state of Colorado. They see their bond as an example of where the dialogue is heading, through Trimpa said ""people faint when they see us together."" 'Common ground' ""With Jim, it's a new day,"" Trimpa said. ""The reality of it is gays aren't going away and evangelicals aren't going away so we're figuring out common ground."" Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, is also advocating for a more open approach and has called for Christians to ""love your gay and lesbian neighbors."" ""If we don't recognize (the culture shift), we're clueless as to what is happening,"" Moore said in an interview. How Supreme Court's non-decision helps gay marriage . Matthew Vines, meanwhile, is an openly gay evangelical who recently published a book attempting to debunk Biblical interpretations that define homosexuality as a sin. He went to a conference sponsored by Moore's group in October and was surprised that even his staunchest critics constructively interacted with him. He said he would have been ""completely ignored"" at the convention five years ago. ""There's definitely a coming divide between evangelicals, but it's not public yet,"" Vines said. ""Over the next year in particular, people will start to show their true colors."" Generational divide . About 43% of white evangelical millennials support same-sex marriage, according to a 2014 Public Religion Research Institute poll, while 7 in 10 white evangelicals overall oppose same-sex marriage. The generational split is even more pronounced among the GOP: nearly two-thirds of Republicans under 30 favor same sex marriage compared to 39% of all Republicans, according to the Pew Research Center survey. GOP leaders are eyeing those polls closely and in the last two years, four Republican senators have announced their support for same-sex marriage. This year, the GOP fielded two openly gay Republican candidates for Congress -- though neither won. Some, like Republican strategist and LGBT activist Margaret Hoover, say the party is changing too slowly and needs to put its opposition to gay marriage to rest. ""I think the fact that the majority of Republicans don't support same sex marriage or LGBT freedom is detrimental to reaching out and connecting to a new generation of voters,"" said Hoover, who is also a CNN political commentator. Hoover runs the American Unity PAC, which spent more than $4 million in the 2014 cycle to support pro-gay marriage and LGBT rights Republican candidates, according to the group's pre-election Federal Elections Commission filing. The GOP could see at least one pro-gay marriage presidential candidate in the 2016 elections if Sen. Rob Portman -- who has a gay son and endorsed same-sex marriage in 2013 --  decides to seek the party's nomination. ""When Mitt Romney was the nominee of the party, could you have imagined that there could be a Republican nominee the next time around who is in favor of same-sex marriage? Even I couldn't have imagined that,"" Hoover said. Same-sex marriage: Fast facts .

"(CNN) -- More than 200 indigenous people who refused to vacate their land in eastern Paraguay were sprayed late last week with what some believe was pesticide, sending seven to the hospital, a government cabinet member said this week. The 217 members of the Ava Guarani community in the Itakyry district suffered vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and nausea, said Esperanza Martinez, Paraguay's minister of health. Although one person was in serious condition, she said Monday, the rest are improving. ""For us, it's very clear that this is an acute community-wide intoxication caused in a premeditated manner by an unknown substance,"" Martinez said on her ministry's Web site. ""But it is very clear because all of the similar symptoms occurred after this incident."" The Amnesty International human rights organization said Tuesday it ""condemned the use of apparently toxic pesticides to intimidate an indigenous community after they resisted being forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands."" The tension in Paraguay is identical to that found in other parts of Latin America, where the rights of indigenous communities collide with the business interests upon which nations' economies depend. The traditional ancestral homes of indigenous communities are sought for use by mining, oil, logging, agricultural and ranching businesses. Some in Paraguay say that legal protections often are not enough. ""A new constitution recognizes indigenous rights, but political reality is proving to be quite different from the constitutional ideal; the problems facing Paraguay's indigenous people are not likely to go away anytime soon,"" the University of Maryland's Center for International Development and Conflict Management said in a 2006 study. ""The economics and politics of Paraguay make sustained improvement unlikely."" Government critics say not much has changed in three years. ""Indigenous peoples' lives are being put in jeopardy by those who should protect them,"" said Louise Finer, Paraguay researcher at Amnesty International. ""The risk faced by the Itakyry communities was predictable. Insufficient action was taken to protect them from the threats they faced from this renewed attempt to evict them from their ancestral lands."" The latest incident occurred Friday near the border with Brazil, when more than 200 Ava Guarani community members refused to leave land local soy growers say belongs to them. An eviction order against the indigenous people was supposed to be carried out Friday, but a district prosecutor canceled the mandate right before it was to be executed. ""And, according to what the indigenous said, that apparently angered the soy growers, who went there to try to remove them,"" Paraguayan Health Minister Martinez said. ""They went in trucks to try to forcefully remove them."" Amnesty International said the Ava Guarani fought back against the 50 men who tried to evict them. ""The indigenous peoples resisted using bows and arrows,"" the rights group said in a release Tuesday. Police were present, which limited the fight, Martinez said. ""Afterward,"" she said, ""came a low-level flight by airplanes where the people were working in their fields, in their community orchards, with the spraying of a liquid over the people who were there, who later presented with massive symptoms."" Officials are investigating who may have been responsible, she said. Amnesty International urged Paraguayan officials to step up their efforts to protect the indigenous communities. ""The Paraguayan authorities -- the executive, congress and the judiciary -- must work together to address the immediate needs of the communities after this attack, but also to ensure that it does not happen again."" Finer said. The native populations have been losing ground since the 1700s. ""As agriculture and grazing came to occupy larger and larger tracts of land, the traditional subsistence foraging and hunting of most of the groups could not support their numbers, and they were forced to take extremely low-wage jobs,"" the University of Maryland's conflict and development group says. ""Indigenous peoples throughout Paraguay are among the very poorest of society."" Indigenous communities also were legally disenfranchised, the study said. ""Until the 1960s, only one law addressed the future of indigenous groups in Paraguay, and well into the 1970s it was not a crime to kill 'Indians,' "" the university study said. Some recent government efforts to help indigenous communities have been tied up in courts. ""In 1996 and 1997 the Paraguayan Indigenous Institute, the state body that advises on protecting indigenous peoples' rights and processing land claims, acquired 2,638 hectares (6,518 acres) of the indigenous communities' ancestral land on their behalf,"" Amnesty International said in a recent release. ""However, landowners have taken legal action against the five communities."" More recently, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered Paraguay in 2005 and 2006 to return ancestral lands to two indigenous communities. It was not clear Tuesday whether that order had been carried out. The University of Maryland study points out that the indigenous population of Paraguay consists of 17 ethnic communities divided into five linguistic groups: the Mascoi, Mataco, Zamuco, Guarani and the Guaykuru. These communities live on either side of the Paraguayan River, in the sparsely populated Chaco region to the west, and along the Brazilian border to the east. Less than half of the indigenous population remaining in Paraguay lives in the Chaco; fewer groups, related to the Guarani, remain in the east. About 95 percent of Paraguayans are mestizo, of mixed Spanish and Amerindian ancestry, the CIA World Factbook says. The official language of Paraguay is Spanish. However, the university report said, the majority of Paraguay's 7 million residents speak Guarani better than they speak Spanish. Spanish is used mainly in public speech, while Guarani is used in everyday speech. The 1992 constitution stipulated that all government documents be published in Spanish and Guarani. But despite the general population's fluency with Guarani, the study said, Paraguayans do not consider themselves of Indian descent and their culture is thoroughly Hispanicized.","Seven indigenous Paraguayans hospitalized after land dispute .

"The offensive against Islamist militants in northern Mali gained further ground Monday as French and Malian forces reportedly took control of the airport in the ancient city of Timbuktu. The Islamists, who have controlled northern Mali for months, were reported to be fleeing Timbuktu, Mali's traditional cultural center, to the city of Kidal, more than 500 kilometers (300 miles) to the northeast. Timbuktu is a UNESCO World Heritage site of huge historical significance, but in recent times its carefully preserved heritage has come under severe threat amid ongoing conflict. In mid-January, following France's intervention to halt the advance of Islamist fighters in the West African country, UNESCO issued calls for the protection of the fabled city, urging armed forces to safeguard the nation's historic and religious landmarks. See also: 'Why Africa backs French in Mali' ""I ask all armed forces to make every effort to protect the cultural heritage of the country, which has already been severely damaged,"" said Irina Bokova, the U.N. agency's director-general. To the distant Western traveler, Timbuktu has for centuries conjured images of mystery and wonder, a remote Shangri-La whose tantalizing riches and intellectual wealth lured the brave and adventurous. The city partly owes its near-mythical status to its forbidding location; sitting on the southern edge of the Sahara, Timbuktu became synonymous in the West with the farthest place someone can travel. Founded by nomads around the 12th century, the desert city's golden era came during the medieval years when it became a flourishing commercial town in the lucrative trans-Saharan gold and salt trade, as well as a major educational and spiritual center. Although Timbuktu's wealth has declined sharply since then, its rich cultural legacy has stood the test of time. The city boasts an impressive array of ancient monuments and priceless artefacts, including its striking earthen mosques -- made from mud and wood -- and a vast trove of scholarly manuscripts held in public and private collections. Historically, Timbuktu has been a major hub for the diffusion of Islam in West Africa. Scholars from around the Islamic world traveled to the oasis city to study at the prestigious University of Sankore, which had some 25,000 students and 180 Koranic schools in its heyday. Mali was often hailed as one of the most successful democracies in West Africa until a coup toppled the president last year, leading al Qaeda-linked Islamists to capitalize on the chaos and establish themselves in the northern part of the country. In these areas, they applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law by banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on TV. See also: Broken limbs, torn lives in northern Mali . Amid international outrage, they also repeatedly targeted Timbuktu's ancient burial sites. Islamist militants regard such shrines as idolatrous and thus prohibited by their religion. Last June, UNESCO placed the iconic city on its list of endangered world heritage sites after the Islamist militants controlling the area destroyed many of its treasured tombs and shrines. In October 2012, Timbuktu residents told CNN that Islamist fighters had attacked more mausoleums. ""After the attack, the Islamists told the people that worshiping saints is not right, according to their form of Islam, and the destruction was necessary,"" said Ibrahim Ag Mohamed, a local guide. See also: 'Timbuktu tomb attack is an attack on our humanity' Earlier this month Bokova sent a letter to French and Malian authorities calling on them to respect the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property that prohibits ""exposing (cultural) property to destruction or damage,"" and calls for ""refraining from any act of hostility, directed against such property."" She added: ""Mali's cultural heritage is a jewel whose protection is important for the whole of humanity. This is our common heritage, nothing can justify damaging it. It carries the identity and values of a people. ""The destruction of World Heritage sites in Mali in 2012, especially the mausoleums in Timbuktu, sparked a wave of indignation across the world, helping to raise awareness of the critical situation facing the Malian people. The current military intervention must protect people and secure the cultural heritage of Mali."" In an opinion piece written for CNN in July, Bokova said the destruction of Timbuktu's ancient shrines added a moral and cultural crisis to a desperate humanitarian situation. ""The International Criminal Court calls this a war crime. We call it an attack against humanity. This is an attempt to isolate and exclude, to sever the ties that bind peoples together,"" she added.","French forces are fighting the remaining Islamists in Timbuktu, Mali .

"The United Nations' top nuclear watchdog said Iranian authorities are continuing to deny his agency access to a sensitive military complex suspected of being a site of nuclear activities. Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, urged Iran on Thursday to be more cooperative with the agency and ""provide timely access to all relevant information, documentation, sites, material and personnel."" The agency has been trying to get access to Iran's Parchin military site for years. ""Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency,"" Amano told the agency's board of governors in Vienna on Thursday. The IAEA chief's comments come just days before a Nov. 24 deadline for the U.S. and five world powers to reach an agreement with Iran over its nuclear program. Amano, whose agency is not a direct party in the closed-door negotiations, said he hopes the talks will have a ""positive outcome"" but would not speculate on whether an agreement can be reached by the Monday deadline. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the U.S. would not accept just ""any agreement with Iran."" ""It has to be an agreement that works,"" he said, adding that an accord would need to ensure that Iran has no pathways to a nuclear bomb. Kerry met Thursday with negotiators from Iran and EU to help further the ongoing negotiations with Iran, known as the P5+1 talks that have the U.S., U.K., France, China, Russia and Germany working with Iran to achieve an accord.

"How can architecture help a nation cope with traumatic history? A Cambodian institute designed by Zaha Hadid attempts to find a new answer to the question. Due for construction in 2015, the Sleuk Rith Institute, designed by Pritzker-winning Hadid, will be a landmark genocide memorial for Cambodia, breaking away from stereotypes of commemorative architecture. It has been nearly 35 years since the fall of the Khmer Rouge, a regime that slaughtered two million Cambodians, but the scars are yet to fade. ""We believe that this project is one step in moving beyond memorial, to reconciliation and healing, it will be truly transformative, "" Hadid tells CNN Style. Uplifting architecture . From renderings of Hadid's design, we can see five majestic towers rising out of the surrounding forest like beautiful mutant trees. Raised on stilts for protection from floods, the floating buildings evoke a serenity associated with religious sanctuaries. The design is a far cry from the dark designs of other famed genocide memorials such as Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum of Berlin, a stark and imposing display of concrete and steel. ""The building design seeks to commemorate the past with moments of somberness, reflection and tranquility, but it was extremely important that the institute also evoke hope and optimism for the future, and the design includes moments of warmth, light and inspiration,"" says Hadid. The choice of Zaha Hadid was crucial for the institute's visionary founder Youk Chhang. Himself a survivor of the Khmer Rouge-led genocide, Chhang hopes that the institute can move away from the ""heavily angular, quasi-industrial, and distress-invoking architecture"" of the many other memorial models. His vision for the institute — and for Cambodia's future — is one that honors the past while directing the audience towards a positive, future-oriented experience. Building the future . Situated in Phnom Penh, the institute will become the permanent home of the largest collection of genocide-related material in Southeast Asia — up to a million documents archived by the Documentation Centre of Cambodia, an NGO run by Chhang. The institute's name is also inspired by the act of documentation. ""Sleuk Rith"" means ""the power of leaves"" referring to the dried leaves that Cambodian intellectuals used to discreetly document and disseminate knowledge and culture during periods of oppression. But the institute's more significant role will be in educating future generations through its graduate school program, to prevent repeating the tragedies of the past. ""People will learn about what happened so that they can liberate themselves from being a victim and get ready to compete for success in the future,"" says Chhang. Local inspiration . Sleuk Rith is also notable as one of Hadid's first major projects that uses wood as a prominent material. ""Wood receives and transfers light in a particularly warm way. This quality of light and shadow within a wood-structured building is something that we felt appropriate and akin to the very qualities we strove to achieve in the design,"" says Hadid. The first female architect to win the coveted Pritzker Prize, Hadid is known for her dramatic, futuristic monuments of fragmented geometry and curvilinear form. Sleuk Rith brings forth a softer, warmer, and perhaps more feminine side of the architect's imagination, taking inspiration from a lesser known Cambodian temple, the Banteay Srei, also known as the ""Citadel of Women,"" some 30 kilometers north of Angkor Wat. ""One of the remarkable things about Cambodia's traditional temples is the way that intricate and beautiful forms are built up from simple geometric elements. We have taken a parallel approach in the design to define a progression of interconnected spaces within the institute,"" says Hadid. Femininity is an important factor for this commemorative structure as women constitute a major portion of the survivors of the Khmer Rouge period. According to Chhang, women struggled to raise the next generation on their own and have been instrumental in rebuilding Cambodian society, ""but they have had too little voice"" throughout the country's tragic past.

"If there was a musician who transcended the difficult boundaries between East and West, it was sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. Panditji, as he was known to his fans, did it by remaining true to his craft.""He was an amazingly pure artist,"" says Kartik Seshadri, one of Shankar's pupils and a sitar master in his own right. Though he's often thought of in the West as an experimenter and collaborator -- with guitarist George Harrison, violinist Yehudi Menuhin, saxophonist John Coltrane, composer Phillip Glass and conductor Andre Previn -- Shankar was a traditionalist. Indian classical music, as ancient as the scriptures of Hinduism, flowed from his fingers with ease. His music transfixed even those who knew not one iota about the complexities of it. ""That is the beauty of his approach to music and how he was able to transfer that and translate that to an audience in the West,"" Seshadri says. Shankar's music moved from introspective to playful. ""There's a whole gamut of emotions that finds a place with people,"" Seshadri says. Shankar died Tuesday in San Diego, his home for many years. He was 92 and led a life rich with accomplishments and accolades. I was one of those people who was transfixed the first time I listened to Shankar. I was still in high school in Tallahassee, Florida, when Shankar and his troupe came to town for a performance at Florida State University's music school in December, 1978. There were only a handful of Indian families in Tallahassee then, and not much was available to us in the way of homeland culture. It was a rare treat for us to be able to see Shankar in concert. My mother was especially excited. She was trained in voice and sang the songs of another talented Indian, Rabindranath Tagore, India's sole Nobel laureate in literature. She played harmonium with her songs and sometimes, a tanpura, a string instrument that resembles a sitar but has no frets. It was a moment of pride, as well -- in a time when India was known to many of my American friends as a land of human misery. When we wanted to boast of the greatness of our land, we uttered Shankar's name. A few days before the concert, organizers called my mother with a special request: Could she possibly cook dinner for the musicians? Shankar was craving a home-cooked Bengali meal. Of course, yes, my mother said. Who would not be honored to cook for the maestro?Then came days of cooking -- spiced rice pilau with raisins and pistachios, chicken curry, lentils and sandesh, a special milk sweet for which Bengalis are famous. On the night of the performance, Opperman Music Hall was packed. The lights dimmed and Shankar's music filled the air, mellifluous and luscious like the rich silk of a Benarasi sari. Opinion: Ravi Shankar, emissary for world beat . I didn't understand the melodic forms and rhythms of the music that was played that night. I knew that he had written the music for director Satyajit Ray's acclaimed ""Apu Trilogy."" But I was not unlike millions of others who connected Ravi Shankar's name to the Beatles and to the concert for Bangladesh. I had expected to react in typical teenage fashion with boredom. Instead, I was transported to another sphere. Shankar's sitar was magical. The rhythms of the performance fell and rose with the improvisation of each melody framework known as a raga. His sitar told of joy and sorrow, of lives led and dreams dashed. The intensity on stage rose as Shankar challenged tabla virtuoso Alla Rakha to match each one of his sitar riffs. I did not just hear a performance that night. I felt it. Later that evening Shankar and Rakha arrived at our house. I sat in awe through every course of my mother's dinner. It was my introduction to the classical music of my homeland. I realized then that I didn't need to understand the nuances of the notes. Shankar spoke to me in a language that was universal. ""He created an aura of spirituality,"" says journalist and musician Partha Banerjee. ""His music transcends the boundaries of race and religion. It is what humanity is all about.""Harrison dubbed Shankar the ""godfather of world music."" Many Indians like to think of him as their cultural ambassador to the world. Had he been born a Westerner, he might have been a household name like Beethoven or Mozart, Banerjee believes. In later years, Shankar said he was happy to have contributed to bringing the music of India to the West, though he regretted his name forever linked to a 1960s culture of drugs, sex and rock 'n' roll. The music he played, he said, was sacred. Hallowed, even. Not many ordinary Indians I know would eject their Bollywood CDs to listen to Shankar's sitar. He's not on top-40 lists. But Ravi Shankar's gift went beyond his skills on the strings. He possessed an uncommon ability to reach across cultures. He introduced the traditions of my homeland to my friends in America. And he did it by touching their souls. Photos: People we lost in 2012 .","Ravi Shankar transcended difficult boundaries between East and West .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's speech Thursday night was technically a fine speech. It sounded good. It was rhetorically impressive. Its problem -- or perhaps to the President its virtue -- is that very little of it was true. President Obama described what sounded like a reasonable plan to prioritize the deportation of felons, criminals and gang members over the deportation of other people in the United States illegally. ""We'll prioritize,"" he said, ""just like law enforcement does every day."" The whole proposal was entirely within his authority, he argued, because it amounted to a kind of prosecutorial discretion: ""All we're saying is we're not going to deport you."" But the policy the White House actually announced, as opposed to the policy the President described in his speech, was not merely a directive to emphasize enforcement against those who have committed crimes, or even a simple pause on deportations for millions of Americans here illegally. The policy the White House actually announced, in a memo from its Office of Legislative Affairs hours before the President's speech, was a 17-point plan including several new programs without congressional approval, budget appropriation or spending authorization, and many of which the President either didn't mention or which bore only a faint resemblance to what he described in his speech. The President, according to the White House, has directed the Department of Homeland Security to ""create"" a ""new deferred action program"" that will give millions of people here illegally ""work authorizations"" for at least three years. It establishes extensive new criteria by which people can register to be exempt from deportation. DHS will likely have to employ thousands of bureaucrats to process those who ""come forward and register, submit biometric data, pass background checks, pay fees, and show that their child was born before the date of this announcement."" Applicants supposedly will also have to prove they have been in the United States for at least five years and will have to pay taxes. Well, a brand new program that hands out three-year work authorizations and processes more paperwork than many state Departments of Motor Vehicles is not merely saying, as the President put it in his speech, that ""we're not going to deport you,"" and it is certainly not simple ""prioritization"" or ""prosecutorial discretion,"" as many administration officials have been calling it before and after the announcement. It is new law, created by the executive without constitutional authority. The President said in his speech that the new program will allow people here illegally to ""come out of the shadows and get right with the law."" Meanwhile administration officials explained on the record that he wasn't really legalizing anyone, since he couldn't technically do that. The President also said in his speech that his actions would offer relief only to people who met certain criteria he described, including having child dependents in the United States. But the actual policy memo makes clear that ""DHS will direct all of its enforcement resources at pursuing"" people who are ""national security threats, serious criminals, and recent border crossers."" In other words, there will be one group, estimated at 4 million or so, who are eligible for the new work authorization program. But at the same time, there will be no resources directed at enforcing immigration law against the other 7 million people here illegally as long as they do not fall into a few narrow categories, according to the President's Office of Legislative Affairs. And indeed, a ""senior administration official"" told Roll Call that the administration ""will order immigration agents to prioritize deportations of criminals and recent arrivals â€” and let people who are not on that priority list go free."" This is not at all the program the President described in his speech. The President assured us his actions ""are not only lawful, they're the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century."" Except the primary examples his administration cites are cases of presidents implementing congressionally approved amnesties, narrowly expanding them to include cases Congress didn't anticipate, with no objection from Congress. The President has no such congressional sanction, and his actions are an order of magnitude larger. President Obama said his plan would ""stem the flow of illegal crossings"" in the future. Yet every time the government has pledged to stop deporting certain classes of people in the past, there has been a huge surge in the number of illegal border crossings, including most recently the humanitarian crisis of unaccompanied minors on our southern border, which President Obama created with DACA, his last unauthorized executive action on immigration. This was a Gruber speech. It was designed to sound acceptable to the American people, even if it was largely a lie. For those not familiar with Jonathan Gruber, a now infamous co-architect of Obamacare who described how Obamacare was written ""in a tortured way to make sure"" the Congressional Budget Office did not ""score the mandate as taxes,"" even though the administration knew it was a tax. He described how the administration won support for the tax on ""Cadillac"" health plans ""by mislabeling it, calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people, when we know it's a tax on people who hold these insurance plans."" With Obamacare, Gruber concluded, ""the lack of transparency"" was ""a huge political advantage"" and ""the stupidity of the American voter"" was ""really, really critical for the thing to pass."" Listening to a speech in which the President lied about what he was proposing and lied about his authority to implement it, it was hard not to think of the Gruber model -- which is really the Obama model, after all. He said what he needed to say to do what he wants to do. Immigrants will ""get right with the law,"" but not be ""legalized,"" just as Obamacare's taxes weren't taxes, until they were taxes before the Supreme Court, but after which they weren't taxes again. Only immigrants who meet certain specific criteria will be eligible for relief, except for the millions of other people he doesn't mention for whom he will also stop enforcing the law. In the past few years, the President has described 22 times on video how he doesn't have the legal and constitutional authority to take many of the actions he announced Thursday night. ""With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed,"" he said in 2011. ""...[W]e've got three branches of government. Congress passes the law. The executive branch's job is to enforce and implement those laws. ...There are enough laws on the books by Congress that are very clear in terms of how we have to enforce our immigration system that for me to simply through executive order ignore those congressional mandates would not conform with my appropriate role as President."" President Obama made a good case back then. It's a shame he apparently thinks, like Gruber, that Americans are all so stupid we won't figure out he's not telling us the truth today.

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- President Evo Morales sought Wednesday to drum up support for his move over the weekend to end subsidies on the price of gasoline, a decision that resulted in the largest gas price increase in 30 years and led to protests in some cities. ""Of course it's difficult -- for the national economy, for the family,"" he said in a nationally televised address. But, he added, the decision will lead to a stronger country and cut down on contraband. ""We're taking care of the national economy with this."" This year, the government will spend $660 million to import gasoline, of which the government will have subsidized $380 million, he said. Of that, $150 million worth of gasoline will have been sold for higher prices in neighboring countries, he said. For example, under the old system, $27 worth of gasoline in Bolivia was worth $90 on the international market, he said. In response, owners of private cars, taxis and trucks equipped their vehicles with double tanks, filled them up in Bolivia and drove them across the border to sell the gasoline in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Peru, he said. ""It's a loss,"" Morales said. ""This is the economic lifeblood of the Bolivian people."" Supreme Decree 748 is intended to stop that and to give oil producers an incentive to invest in Bolivian petroleum production ""so that Bolivia is not continuing to import either diesel or gasoline,"" he said. Morales said he would add 10 percent to the national price for staples like rice, corn and wheat to incentivize domestic food producers to grow more and would invest in water projects, too. He added that he will increase by 20 percent the salaries of police, the armed forces and the health and education sectors. The local media have dubbed the new policy as the ""Gasolinazo,"" or ""The Big Gasoline Hit."" A strike by bus and other public transportation drivers went as planned, though some remained on the job. Those who remained, however, raised their prices, too. Journalists Martin Aristegui and Gloria Carrasco and CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Of course it's difficult -- for the national economy, for the family,"" Morales tells Bolivians .

"(CNN)Romance. Suspense. Good versus evil. On the surface, Rwandan radio soap opera ""Musekeweya,"" or ""New Dawn,"" feels familiar. Like a Rwandan ""Romeo and Juliet,"" it tells the story of lovers from two different villages at odds with each other. But listen closely. Burrowed in the narrative of ""Musekeweya"" is a metaphor for the genocide that took place in Rwanda over the course of 100 days in 1994, when Hutu extremists massacred over 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. ""Musekeweya"" conveys a message of healing and reconciliation. Dutch photographer Anoek Steketee and filmmaker Eefje Blankevoort were in Rwanda in 2008 when they first heard ""Musekeweya."" ""We were intrigued by this radio soap, its background and its popularity in Rwanda,"" Steketee said. ""Almost everyone we spoke to on the streets knows the program and can name at least five characters."" Launched in 2004 by Radio La Benevolencija, a Dutch nongovernmental organization, ""Musekeweya"" is broadcast on the same frequency that was used in 1994 to incite murder. When they heard the show, Steketee and Blankevoort were immediately interested in its effect on Rwandan society. ""It shows people how to resist manipulation by charismatic leaders, how to prevent outbursts of group violence and how to deal with trauma,"" Steketee said. The radio drama raised important questions for Steketee and Blankevoort, and they wanted to explore the way this fiction could contribute to real reconciliation. ""Is this positive programming simply a veneer in a country still grappling with deep trauma?"" Steketee asked. Steketee and Blankevoort began exploring this issue first through photography. The story, however, proved to be more complex. ""We came to the conclusion that we needed to provide a context, use the audio of the soap and find a form to tell a layered, nuanced story of the relation between the fictional story of the radio soap and the daily reality of contemporary Rwanda,"" Steketee said. ""A Web documentary was for us the ultimate way to tell this story."" Steketee and Blankevoort's documentary, ""Love Radio,"" combines the story from ""Musekeweya"" with behind-the-scenes insights from everyday Rwandans and people involved in the making of the radio drama. ""This is where we ask critical questions about the positive image portrayed and reveal what is not said on air,"" Steketee said. ""Actors and audience have their say, thereby painting a picture of contemporary Rwanda."" Just as ""Musekeweya"" balances between fact and fiction, Steketee's photographs are not pure documentary. They serve, rather, as ""a tool for the imagination,"" Steketee said. They are moody and evocative and reflect the struggle Rwandans face as they come to terms with the horror of two decades past. ""I photographed listeners in their homes, on the streets, during the broadcast of ""Musekeweya,' "" Steketee wrote in an e-mail. ""These photographs are combined with poetic, gloomy photographs of (guilty) landscapes and well-paved empty streets. I have tried to capture the veneer that covers the complex and tense social fabric of Rwanda today."" The popularity of ""Musekeweya"" is evident in the amount of fan mail its makers receive each week. Listeners identify with the characters and have opinions about their actions. ""Rutaganira and Zaninka, stop spoiling Rwandan society,"" one listener wrote. ""Enough is enough with your divisive thoughts."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Steketee says it is difficult to understand what Rwandans really feel because of an authoritarian political system. ""There is rather a climate of control than dialogue,"" she said. ""Resentments and distrust persist. Inequality and hardships are still there."" Underneath the tension, however, lies the desire to heal. ""Rwanda is doing remarkably well,"" Steketee said. ""There is a lot of goodwill from everybody to restore the community. There have been good examples of restoration of trust and reconciliation."" Anoek Steketee is a Dutch photographer.

"Are the odds still ever in our favor? 'Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1"" has hit theaters, and critics seem divided on whether it's a strong offering. Politics is a star, as much as Jennifer Lawrence's rebel Katniss Everdeen, in the latest installment of the popular franchise. Adapted from the the third novel in the young adult series by  Suzanne Collins, the film finds Katniss stepping firmly into her role as leader in the fight against the authoritarian-totalitarian regime of Panem. Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal notes the controversy that has surrounded the decision to make two movies out of the third book and writes ""but this latest film, which Francis Lawrence directed from a screenplay by Peter Craig and Danny Strong, proves to be much more than scene-setting."" ""It's about the power of political symbols, and the danger of becoming one -- about Katniss staying true to herself, and to those she loves, while her handlers seek to reshape her into some sort of sci-fi Joan of Arc,"" he writes. The Wrap's Alonso Duralde finds that the new film ""calls to mind smart political comedies like 'Wag the Dog' and 'Tanner '88.' "" ""Returning director Francis Lawrence finds interesting visual moments, even in the underground bunker,"" Duralde writes. ""At one point, Katniss looks down on rows and rows of rebels climbing down, down, down a metallic triangular staircase, and it's like something out of ""Metropolis."" That's a pretty bold quotation to make for a film that's also about a proletariat revolution, but even if ""Mockingjay"" isn't on the level of that silent classic, it's not an altogether inappropriate reference point."" But Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter pins Part 1 as ""an overgrown and bloated trailer for a film yet to come."" ""Unfortunately, 'Mockingjay - Part 1' has all the personality of an industrial film,"" he says. ""There's not a drop of insolence, insubordination or insurrection running through its veins; it feels like a manufactured product through and through, ironic and sad given its revolutionary theme."" Slate's movie critic, Dana Stevens, writes of the parallel themes of teen romance and revolution in the film. Katniss is torn between feelings for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who is now in the custody of the Capitol, and fellow freedom fighter Gale (Liam Hemsworth). ""War and teenage angst make for uncomfortable narrative bedfellows, but at least the political violence that rips through the fictional country of Panem is neither glossed over nor trivialized,"" Stevens writes, noting the film's PG-13 rating for scenes that include executions and mass slaughter. ""And Jennifer Lawrence is actress enough to invest even Katniss' comparatively low-stakes struggle with some dramatic heft."" Indeed, it appears that the acting may be part of the saving grace for the film according to some.  Claudia Puig of USA Today praises Lawrence and her fellow cast members, including Julianne Moore and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. ""Jennifer Lawrence reveals greater depth and emotional layers as rebel leader Katniss and is bolstered by powerhouse supporting performances,"" Puig writes. ""New to the dystopian franchise, Julianne Moore plays District 13 President Alma Coin with just the right blend of stern authority and humanity. Her right-hand man is the once-sinister, now-wearied Plutarch Heavensbee, played perfectly by Philip Seymour Hoffman."" Do you plan on seeing the film?

"(CNN) -- An Arizona state lawmaker's push to end the guarantee of birthright citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants on Saturday set off a protest hundreds of miles away in Pacoima, a Los Angeles suburb. More than 1,500 people in this predominantly Latino community took part in the protest, many of them chanting ""Si, se puede,"" the Spanish version of President Obama's 2008 campaign slogan. The protesters fear that if Arizona passes the measure, other states will follow. Arizona state Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican, has proposed that birthright citizenship, a guarantee provided by the U.S. Constitution, be taken away from children of illegal immigrants. The guarantee, courts have ruled, was established by the 14th Amendment, which extended birthright citizenship to former slaves after the Civil War. Other state legislatures are considering similar measures. Kavanagh told CNN Friday, ""Dispensing citizenship like a door prize is poor policy and greatly increases the costs of education, medicating and giving other benefits to the children of illegal aliens born here."" CNN's Jacqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","1,500 protest effort to end birthright citizenship for children of illegal immigrants .

"As Republicans raise the idea of a court challenge against President Barack Obama's immigration action, White House spokesman Josh Earnest argued Friday that the President's executive orders stand on solid legal ground. ""What the president announced last night is legally unassailable,"" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day."" The legal battle over Obama's immigration plan . Obama announced his plans Thursday night to legally permit up to 5 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States temporarily, bypassing Congress after lawmakers failed to pass comprehensive reform. Earnest reiterated a point the White House has fervently tried to make in recent days, that previous presidents have used executive authority on the issue of immigration. But critics argue that Obama's action amounts to overreach, saying his latest decision goes beyond what former presidents have done. Republican lawmakers vowed to aggressively pursue pushback against the new orders, with some proposing efforts to defund Obama's plan through spending legislation, while others called for lawsuits. Republicans hammer legal case against Obama on immigration . Earnest, however, said that if the Republican-led House of Representatives would approve the Senate's reform bill that was passed last year with bipartisan support, then ""the president would sign it right away."" ""He'd tear up his own executive actions,"" Earnest continued, before recapping a line Obama made in his speech Thursday night. ""The truth is the closest thing we have to amnesty right now is doing nothing and that's exactly what House Republicans are doing,"" he said.","President Barack Obama announced his immigration plans on Thursday night .

"A woman who was arrested with a handgun outside of the White House Thursday night has been charged with a felony, accused of carrying a pistol without a license. April Debois, 23, of Mount Morris, Michigan, faces up to five years in prison after the Secret Service arrested her just minutes after President Barack Obama delivered his immigration speech. Debois, who was initially identified by authorities as April Lenhart, made her first court appearance on Friday in Superior Court. She will spend the weekend in jail and will be back in front of a judge on Monday morning. Her brother told CNN's Pamela Brown that he is stunned by her arrest. His sister is a caring person and an Obama supporter, he told CNN. He has no idea why she went to the White House, allegedly carrying a gun. Secret Service agents searched her home in Michigan on Friday. CNN affiliate WJRT said reporters saw agents remove a long gun from the house and another item that was wrapped in plastic. Debois was arrested at about 8:30 p.m. on Thursday on Pennsylvania Avenue near the North Lawn of the White House after she was spotted with a gun holstered under her shirt, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said. A court document described the weapon as a purple and silver 9mm pistol. The incident occurred as dozens of people were demonstrating outside the White House after the President delivered his immigration speech at 8 p.m. The people rallying outside the White House were moved off of Pennsylvania Avenue as the arrest was made, Donovan said.

"Big Business isn't embracing President Barack Obama's decision to reform the immigration system by executive order, but the community's top lobbyists aren't joining Republicans in slamming Obama's announcement, either. They just want the President and Congress to move forward on a permanent solution to fix a broken immigration system -- which they say can only happen through legislation. Three top groups, which have descended on Capitol Hill to argue the economic benefits of an immigration overhaul, said arguments on the President's authority to shield millions from deportation should take a back seat to passing legislation in the next Congress. Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said that while Obama's executive actions ""raise important legal and constitutional questions,"" Congress and the President should press ahead toward the goal of achieving bipartisan legislation. ""The debate over the president's announcement must not be allowed to forestall progress on critical priorities,"" Donohue said in a statement. ""We call upon the president and lawmakers of both parties to enact common sense measures to provide the American economy with the workers it needs at all skill levels, while better securing our borders and dealing with undocumented immigrants."" The Chamber of Commerce and other business groups joined in an unlikely coalition last year with labor groups to urge Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform -- a partnership that has helped immigration advocates make headway in Congress. Business Roundtable Senior Director Matt Sonnesyn, who leads the group's work to achieve immigration reform, said he was hopeful congressional Republicans could move past Obama's executive action and toward bipartisan legislation by the spring. But Sonnesyn said Obama's decision to act unilaterally ""certainly doesn't help us get to a solution"" and said even after Obama's executive orders kick in, ""our immigration system will still be broken."" ""Certainly what the President did last night isn't going to make it easier for everyone to come together to fix immigration,"" Sonnesyn said. ""After some of the initial emotion dials down from what's happened here, we'll all be able to look at this constructively."" That emotion is resounding among GOP congressional leaders and potential Republican candidates. House Speaker John Boehner said Obama ""cemented his legacy of lawlessness,"" Sen. Rand Paul said he ""will not sit idly by and let the President bypass Congress and our Constitution"" and Sen. Ted Cruz called Obama's actions unconstitutional. Boehner said Friday the House ""will in fact act"" on immigration, but did not give specifics as to how the body would respond to Obama's executive action. Republicans hammer legal case against Obama on immigration . Business Roundtable, which among other groups, lobbied Congress last year alongside the Chamber of Commerce and the Partnership for a New American Economy to pass the Senate's bipartisan reform bill, supports most of the policies Obama announced Thursday, but would like to see them in the form of legislation. Sonnesyn said he is hopeful the Republican-led House, which did not take up the Senate's immigration bill, will work to pass immigration legislation or a series of smaller bills that address some of the key problems. On immigration, a tale of two presidents . One of the key players in that effort will be Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida who has worked to push an immigration bill through the House. Diaz-Balart said he questions the legal authority of Obama's actions, but said Friday on CNN that he supports ""a lot of the specific things in the President's executive order."" And Diaz-Balart appeared ready to move past that question in favor of working toward legislation, arguing that voters' message in the midterms was a call to end dysfunction and work together. ""I'm going to try to work with the President or anybody else, whether it's immigration reform or other important issues,"" Diaz-Balart said. ""I hope we can work through this."" John Feinblatt, chairman of the Partnership for a New American Economy, said the benefits of the policies Obama announced Thursday will ultimately outweigh how those policies came to be. ""You're going to here a lot of people take issue with the process but in the end I think you have to distinguish between the process and the substance,"" Feinblatt said. But Feinblatt, a close adviser to former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who founded the group, said he is just glad ""everybody in Washington is talking about immigration."" ""We're no longer arguing about whether to do immigration,"" Feinblatt said. ""We might be arguing about which branch should lead, we might be arguing about the process, we might be arguing about how you do it -- but we're not actually arguing about whether this country needs to reform its immigration policies. That's progress."" The economic and political imperatives to reform the immigration system will ultimately prompt Republicans to work toward legislation before the 2016 presidential election, Feinblatt said, pointing to the growth of Hispanics and Asians as a share of the voting population. ""Congress Is going to have to get to work,"" he said.","Three top pro-immigration business groups said Congress needs to pass legislation .
The top lobbyists said they were hopeful Congress could work on legislation next year .
While not necessarily thrilled about executive action, they emphasize working together ."
"Qassim Shesho stands on Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, overlooking a vast mountain range that rises from the desert. The calm is deceptive. He worries about the village behind him. Sheref ad-Din holds one of the holiest shrines for the Yazidis. ISIS militants are only two miles away. ""ISIS wants to exterminate us and they want to establish an Islamic caliphate, but Islam is not like what they are doing to us,"" Shesho says. He says he commands about 2,000 Yazidi fighters. Just months ago, he lived a peaceful life in Germany. ""I came back because my people are here. ISIS are terrorists. I came to defend my land, my family and my religion,"" he tells CNN by phone, speaking in Arabic. He didn't come alone. Shesho's 26-year-old son, Yassir Qassim Khalaf, is with him.  Yassir arrived in September, shortly after ISIS's initial attack on Yazidis left thousands stranded on the mountain without food, water or medical care. Their plight captured the world's attention. The Iraqi air force and fighters with the Kurdish fighting force -- the peshmerga --  rescued some families in a dramatic helicopter mission. U.S. airstrikes helped clear a path for thousands of Yazidis to escape the mountain into neighboring Syria and to Iraqi Kurdish territory. Yet the nightmare continues for thousands who remain on the mountain, surrounded by ISIS forces intent on eradicating anyone in their path. ""You can't just stay in Germany, live in luxury and leave your family and your people alone while you are watching it all on TV, thinking, 'It'll work itself out,'"" Yassir says in German. Shesho's troops, in many ways, are fighting an existential fight. Yazidis are one of the oldest religious communities in the world, with a population estimated at only 700,000. They have suffered persecution through the ages. Many Muslims consider them devil worshipers. Yazidis captured by ISIS have been forced to convert to Islam. Gruesome reports have emerged of Yazidi women being enslaved, raped and sold off by ISIS members while men and boys are executed. The United Nations concluded that the actions of ISIS ""may amount to an attempt to commit genocide."" Who are the Yazidis and why does ISIS want to kill them? He came to 'defend,' not to 'fight' ""I decided to defend Sinjar, not to fight. They decided to fight,"" Shesho says of ISIS. ""We defend our land and our holy places. I have lived in Germany for 24 years and have always abhorred killing and fighting."" Shesho's troops receive weapons and humanitarian aid from the Kurdish regional government. Kurdish forces airdrop food and weapons. U.S. airstrikes on ISIS also have helped, but Shesho says it's not enough. ""ISIS wants to ruin the whole world. We want more American airstrikes between Sinjar and Dahouk so we can go back to our lands and live in peace."" At one point, Shesho's five sons fought ISIS alongside him in the mountains. Three have returned to Germany. Yassir and an older brother, Haydar Qassim Shesho, remain. They keep in touch with friends and family in Germany as much as fighting and bad cellular reception allow. Yassir says his mother worries. They try to console her. ""Three times a week, we try to send her pictures and messages to say that everything is OK here and that she doesn't need to worry,"" Yassir says. His mother and brothers are in a German town of 50,000 called Bad Oeynhausen, in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia. 'I just couldn't bear to witness the suffering' The family fled Iraq in 1990, when Saddam Hussein ruled the country. They went to Germany and eventually became citizens. Yassir was 2. ""When I'm in Germany, I'm grateful that I'm able to be there. But if it comes to it, then I'm ready to die here,"" he says. Before coming to Iraq, Yassir worked part time in crafts services for companies and hotels around his hometown. ""I actually wanted to be here from the beginning because I just couldn't bear to witness the suffering of the Yazidis. ... How our honor is tainted, how our families and wives are being captured,"" Yassir says. ""To go from luxury to war is not pleasant, but you gotta do what you gotta do.""","Qassim Shesho commands about 2,000 Yazidi fighters on Mount Sinjar in Iraq .

"August Reiger was supposed to reunite with his family at the top of a scenic mountain trail in Ecuador. But when his father, mother and younger brother arrived Sunday at the meeting point overlooking the town of Baños, the 18-year-old was nowhere to be found. Authorities in the South American country have been searching for the Oklahoma high school valedictorian for days. Family members say it appears he vanished without a trace after they split up during a hike in the mountainous area 100 miles south of the capital, Quito. ""Nothing makes sense to me. ... Everyone's baffled, because it's not a dangerous place,"" his father, Chris Reiger, told CNN. ""There's no rebels or something like that that who kidnap people. I can't come up with a scenario that could make sense."" Teams of firefighters, police, army troops and village volunteers have combed the area, Chris Reiger said, rappelling over steep mountain slopes and using search dogs in their hunt. ""They're still searching in the mountain, but not with that kind of force. They're confident he's not up there stuck somewhere,"" Chris Reiger said. ""I could see. I was up there. I knew what they were doing, and I don't know, they didn't find him."" Lira de la Paz Villalva, governor of Ecuador's Tungurahua province, said local authorities don't have any leads about what could have caused the teen's disappearance. A new search operation is planned for Friday. August, an avid Spanish speaker with a deep interest in indigenous cultures, had been looking forward to the Ecuador trip. The family had been scheduled to leave for a three-day tour in remote jungle areas on Monday. But instead, they've been traveling to local villages with police, posting pictures of their son and asking for help finding him. It's out of the question that August would have wandered off or could be trying not to be found, the teen's father says. ""I feel that he's particularly mature for his age. He's not the kind of kid that does crazy stuff,"" Chris Reiger said. August had just graduated from the Classen School of Advanced Studies in Oklahoma City, said Shannon Schmoyer, Reiger's father's cousin. The 18-year-old had asked his parents for a trip to a Spanish-speaking country as a graduation present, she said. According to CNN affiliate KOKH, about 150 volunteers have joined the search, with helicopters assisting the effort. Local authorities have been cooperative but don't have many leads, Schmoyer said. In Washington, the U.S. State Department said its embassy in Quito was in touch with the Reiger family and ""is monitoring the situation closely."" ""Protecting the well-being of U.S. citizens is one of the department's highest priorities, and we take all such reports seriously,"" it said. The family arrived in Ecuador on June 11, Schmoyer said. She described the missing teen as ""caring, sensitive, family-oriented, soft-spoken, compassionate, social, inquisitive and wicked smart."" August plays piano and guitar, was a state science fair winner and had a full scholarship to the University of Oklahoma, she said. In Oklahoma City, word of his disappearance has has shaken those who know the teen. ""I'm not sure what to do. I feel very helpless,"" neighbor Tim Smith said. ""Everyone here who knows him, it's all over Facebook. We're all e-mailing each other, trying to keep each other apprised. I'm knocking on whatever doors I can think of to knock on."" Smith, who used to drive August to school in a car pool, said he's been reaching out to local lawmakers to draw attention to the case. ""We really need people to let the governor's office and congressmen know,"" he said. ""We need somebody to really step up and try to push this through, so that it gets some more exposure."" August's father said he hopes publicity about the case will help authorities locate his son. ""He's not gone yet in my mind,"" he said. ""They're going to find him.""","In Ecuador, a province governor says investigators have no leads .

"(CNN)A little over five centuries ago, the unassuming district of Ocoa Bay in the Dominican Republic became the first wine-producing region of the Americas. Legend has it that Spanish explorers cultivated grapes here for six years before setting sail for Central America in search of the great Aztecan Empire. But when they left, the Conquistadors took their quaint interest in viticulture with them. Local farmers swiftly returned to growing the tropical fruits and vegetables natural to the Caribbean island. Now, a new vineyard and real estate development is looking to tap into this wine-making history by providing the Caribbean's 21st-century own take on enotourism. The Ocoa Bay development lies 90-minutes drive from the capital, Santo Domingo and offers newly built homes with specially designed vineyard plots that allow residents to produce their own wine. Spectacular ocean views and a climate similar to the Mediterranean in summer ensure the 2 million square meter site is a popular spot. Yet according to architect, Gabriel Acevedo, convincing colleagues and other stakeholders of the area's potential as a property development come vineyard was initially a tough sell. ""We were labeled as crazy -- probably because I wasn't an agronomist but an architect -- that we even dared to plant 10,000 square meters of grapevines,"" Acevedo said. Sustainability is a key factor in Ocoa Bay's business portfolio -- one Acevedo believes to be a game changer for the Dominican Republic. Project leaders say they spent time with ecology, land management and wildlife consultants before commencing building work in an effort to minimize any negative environmental impacts. ""Ocoa Bay has three pillars, one is the production of high quality wine and fruit cultivation, the others are the hotels and the real estate sector,"" Acevedo said. Developers are relying on the lands' unique dry climate which receives on average of 600 millimeters of rainfall per year to sustain the vineyard. The construction of the first 30 ecological and vineyard villas are scheduled to begin in December with 33% pre-sold. High-end realn estate companies like Christie's, meanwhile, are already adding Ocoa Bay to their exclusive listings. The vineyard's real estate adviser, Cesar Herrera insists that enabling investors to snap up a private property where they can produce their own wine is a unique selling point. ""You don't have anywhere in the world (that has) the possibility to live inside a vineyard and to own,"" Herrera said. ""You have several options (of growing grapes) ... (and) you will be able to rent your home when you are not there,"" Herrera added. In just over two years, Ocoa Bay has had five successful harvests. Volumes produced remain low, but quality is high. The price per bottle starts at $15 dollars, setting the bar high for a still young wine producing market. The Ocoa Bay executive team say they're optimistic about the overall success of this venture . ""It's the new, Napa Valley of the Caribbean,"" Acevedo said. ""The new Bordeaux or Rioja. A unique and new destination in the Caribbean.""","Ocoa Bay is a new real estate and vineyard development in the Dominican Republic .

"In China it's known as gaokao -- the college entrance exams -- and for most young people it dictates the course of a life. A good score in the gaokao will open the doors to the country's most prestigious universities, granting access not only to the best education and the chance to work overseas but  also to an elite Rolodex of upper-echelon contacts. Chinese society, more than any other, is predicated on its networks, or guanxi, and grooming them is a lifetime's work. For those that miss out on their gaokao, the years of tutoring and months of cramming could mean relegation to a provincial university and the oblivion of a major city ""ant colony"" -- the shared dormitory accommodation that awaits graduates trying to find work in China's urban centers. For others hoping to escape the ineluctable cycle of the gaokao, overseas study is only possible through a limited number of scholarships or rich parents. Increasingly, however, Chinese private schools -- with British A-level exams and the International Baccalaureate -- are geared towards giving the children of the middle  class the edge when it comes to gaining a place at a foreign university. ""What we are talking about here really are the upper middle class and above -- people who are aware of what education systems are like in other parts of the world,"" said  Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London. Heading abroad . It'd be hard to find another country over the past 10 years that has spent as much, and as furiously, as China on giving its next generation the kind of head start that an expensive international education provides. The number of Chinese studying in the United States has increased more than fourfold from about 60,000 in 2004 to more than 274,000 in 2014, according to figures from the Institution for International Education. China now accounts for almost a third of international students in the U.S., marking an historic high. While the Chinese government assists students that want to study abroad, the majority of students are privately funded and education, in particular recently online education, is now part of a billion dollar industry. Many education companies are publicly-listed companies and a new boom in online education is expected over the next three years, according to a report by Deloitte. For the move towards private education in China not only reflects the aspirations of China's growing middle class but also a growing dissatisfaction with China's often tradition-bound curriculum. ""People who are aware of what education systems are like in other parts of the world are becoming increasingly impatient with the Chinese education system,"" Hockx said. ""It has an enormous emphasis on rote learning, classes can spend ludicrous amounts of time repeating the same things again and again, it often doesn't value creativity. ""The elite are looking at other options and that includes sending their children to private schools in China and also sending them to English-speaking schools, in particular boarding schools in Britain which have a very good reputation in China."" He said Chinese teenagers who must sit the gaokao are required to put in very long hours of study. ""I personally know 13 and 14-year-olds in China who do not get more than four or five hours of sleep a day because of all the work that they need to do. I think many parents are worried because they're not seeing it as a way of moving up in the world,"" Hockx said. English skills . While the Chinese system, with its emphasis on rote-learning, is good for certain subjects such as maths and the sciences, Hockx said that the weighting on English in the gaokao -- and a shot at working and studying internationally -- still remained strong. Last year, an attempt by the government to level the playing field by reducing the English-language section of the gaokao (seen as a way of favoring students in provincial areas with fewer opportunities of gaining exposure to English) has done little to dent China's RMB30 billion ($5 billion) English language industry. English language sections of the gaokao were reduced from 150 to 100 points while Chinese sections were increased from 150 points to 180. Even with some leading teaching companies charging as much as RMB16,000 a year for extra-curricular tuition, in a country where the average wage can be as low RMB13,000 a year,  the English-teaching industry has only grown stronger, especially since the Beijing Olympics in 2008. New Oriental, China's largest English-language tuition company, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of $4.4 billion. Chinese traditionally have a deep respect for education but increasingly the option of dropping out of the Chinese education system altogether is becoming attractive to some. Han Han, the rebel voice of China's post-1980s generation, is China's most famous high school drop out and has gone on to parlay fame as a blogger and social commentator. ""He became famous because when he was 18 he won a writing competition and won a free place at one of the best universities and he said no I'm not interested, I don't like this system and I just want to become an independent writer,"" Hockx said.""He became a celebrity overnight almost.""

The new ""50 Shades of Grey"" trailer premiered Thursday night during an episode of ABC's hit show ""Scandal,"" and wow. Fans got to see Christian Grey (Dornan) meet Anastasia (Johnson) and embark on quite the relationship. There's some sexy elevator action, Mr. Grey looking every inch the dapper millionaire he is and a sneak peak at the Red Room of Pain very familiar to fans of the wildly successful E.L. James novel on which the film is based. Beyonce's song ""Haunted"" serves as a soundtrack for the trailer. There have been teases of what's to come with the movie, which arrives on Valentine's Day.

"(CNN) -- There are plenty of country songs about how to be a man. One way is to face the music, and two country crooners did that on Thursday. Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman came out as being gay. Herdon went first, in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight. His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well. Gilman posted a message to YouTube, thanking Herndon for breaking the ice. He preferred telling his fans directly, from the comfort of home, to sitting down with the press, he said. But an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did. The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner. ""It was in that moment that I knew that I'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else,"" Gilman told fans. He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article. Country and LGBTQ . In the genre of country, Thursday's tune was a tough one to sing, Gilman said. ""Being a gay, male country artist is not the best thing."" At age 26, he's had a long career, having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky, pre-voice-change alto pipes, according to his biography on AllMusic.com. But currently, he's hitting snags. Rumors about his sexual orientation have been going around, he said, and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it. ""I knew something was wrong when no major label wanted to sit down and have a meeting and listen to the new stuff,"" he said. In his video, he turned directly to fans with his latest song, giving them a preview on his laptop of the music video to ""Say you Will,"" which is still in edit. Facing fans on Monday . ""Today, I get to tell the world that I'm an out, proud and happy gay man,"" he told ""People."" But he's worried how fans will take the news. He may find out in just three days, when he performs at the ""Mother Church of Country Music,"" the Ryman Auditorium. It's home to the Grand Ole Opry. Herndon is playing a Christmas charity bash for children in need along with Charlie Daniels, Phil Vassar, Andy Griggs and Jamie O'Neal. The Ryman has said the concert would be sold out. Herndon, 52, is hopeful he won't face outrage, because he thinks attitudes are changing in the country scene. Singer Chely Wright came out in 2010 and the open-minded Kacey Musgraves has a song titled ""Follow Your Arrow"" that was just named the Country Music Association song of the year. ""I felt so proud of my city,"" he said. ""I hope that trend continues; I pray it does."" Faith and fear . As a child, Herndon, a devout Christian, was stricken with fear over his sexual feelings. ""I was 10, sitting in church and horrified that I might be a homosexual. Whatever that word meant, I knew that I probably was one,"" Herndon told ""People."" ""And I know there's a lot of those kids still out there. Telling my story is an opportunity to help just one of them."" He started coming out to family members in his 20s. But the ""What Mattered Most"" singer, who had a number of hits in the 1990s, kept the news close to the vest. It wasn't until he attended a Tony Robbins seminar in 2009 that he decided to become more public, he told the magazine. ""I realized I had an incredible story that could possibly help someone's son or daughter or grandchild's life not be as difficult as mine has been,"" he said. ""Maybe they wouldn't have to go through as much pain and suffering. It's time to tell my truth."" Dropping hints? Some of the conflict between Herndon's sexuality and his faith bled through a song he published last year -- ""Lies I Told Myself."" A sign with the word ""Equality"" has the most prominent place in the music video. ""Yeah, praying's just a waste of time, so why even start,"" the last verse begins. ""The good Lord ain't got time for guys like me. Forgiven's something you won't ever be."" A handwritten sign appears in that verse. It reads, ""I'm a sinner."" Herndon has since reconciled who he is with God, he said. He loves God, and God loves him back. One of the lies he told himself, he said to ""Entertainment Tonight,"" was that he can't be gay and be in country music at the same time. Now, he thinks that's not true.","Herndon broke the news first with interviews with ""People"" and ""ET""

"The Justice Department Tuesday announced that it has launched an investigation of the Albuquerque, New Mexico, police department involving allegations of excessive force use and use of unreasonable deadly force. At a news conference, Assistant Attorney General Thomas Perez said investigators will try to determine whether the city's police officers engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive force in violation of federal laws and constitutional rights. Perez and other civil rights officials met with Albuquerque's mayor and police chief, who pledged their full cooperation with the probe Perez said. ""Let me be clear: this is a civil investigation not a criminal investigation,"" Perez said. A letter from the Justice Department to Albuquerque Mayor Richard Berry said the investigation was being headed by the department's civil rights division and by the U.S. attorney's office in New Mexico. Neither the Justice Department nor local officials offered specifics of any cases that were being investigated. Berry said in a statement that the Justice probe was ""an investigation concerning officer use of force and systems and policies that have been in place for decades in many cases."" Both Berry and Police Chief Ray Schultz issued statements in response to the Department of Justice announcement, and both local officials indicated their city and department had been cooperating with federal investigators for about a year in what Berry called ""an informal inquiry"" into the police department. Schultz in his statement praised his department but added, ""we know that we are not always perfect and that there is always room for improvement."" In 2010, Schultz said, ""when we first noticed an increased number of police/citizen interactions resulting in force it was the men and women of APD who immediately began identifying ways to improve the quality of police services that we deliver. Their recommendations, along with 39 additional ones from the Police Executive Research Forum, were adopted, and to date, over 92% have been implemented."" Schultz said he and his officers ""look forward to working with the DOJ investigative team and its panel of experts and identifying any additional steps that we can take to improve our department and our community.""

"After nearly 40 years, a militant group on the island of Corsica says it is abandoning its armed struggle for independence from France. The banned National Liberation Front of Corsica, also known an FLNC, said Wednesday in a statement obtained by CNN affiliate France 3 that it had made the decision with no preconditions and had started the process of demilitarization. The birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, Corsica is located in the Tyrrehenian Sea, part of the Mediterranean, between the coasts of France and Italy. It has been under French control since the 1700s. The island has been plagued by terrorism -- including bombings, robberies, and assaults -- since 1976, with the FLNC in the throes of a long, low-intensity military campaign against French targets on the island. In 1997, several banks and government offices were targeted in more than 50 bomb explosions in one day, for which FLNC claimed responsibility. France's government launched a ferocious crackdown in Corsica after a top French official there was gunned down in 1998 on the street of Ajaccio. This spurred a series of nationalist protests, followed by a string of FLNC attacks against French targets. A branch of the separatist group announced in 2003 that it would suspend its military actions. But attacks by FLNC continued, although with less frequency.","Militant group will accept its identity as a French territory, the group says .

Fans of the late singer were none too pleased with it, and it's little wonder that her family reportedly provided no support to it (none of her original songs were in the film either). Original star Zendaya Coleman backed out of the movie earlier this year, saying it all seemed ""a little rushed."" One of her producers, Timbaland, made no bones about his dissatisfaction with the movie as well. Aaliyah had a very successful recording career, singing many hits before her tragic death at age 22 in a 2001 plane crash.

"They sent money overseas for ""orphans"" and ""brothers in the mountains,"" or for ""camels,"" according to court records. The Justice Department alleges that three women arrested Wednesday actually directed the money labeled ""living expenses"" to Al-Shabaab, an Islamist group in Somalia designated by the United States as a terrorist organization. Arrested in their homes were Muna Osman Jama of Reston, Virginia; Hinda Osman Dhirane of Kent, Washington; and Farhia Hassan of the Netherlands, according to a Justice Department statement. Two other women named in the indictment are fugitives in Kenya and Somalia, the statement said. The three arrested were charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and 20 counts of providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization. If convicted, they could face up to 15 years in prison on each count. Court records said the operation used code words to disguise the money transfers to Somalia and Kenya. References to orphans and brothers in the mountains meant the Islamic insurgents, and camels referred to trucks. ""The money transfers often were broken down into small amounts as low as $50 or $100, and the funds were intended for use by al-Shabaab insurgents operating in Somalia,"" according to the court records.

"(CNN) -- Air raids in northern Yemen killed six operatives with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Yemen's Ministry of Defense said Friday. The main target was the group's military commander, Qassim al-Raimi, the Yemeni Embassy to the United States said in a written statement. The defense ministry said al-Raimi was killed. A Yemeni government official briefed in detail on the matter said the Yemeni government is ""almost certain"" that al-Raimi was killed. The official described al-Raimi as the third-highest-ranking figure in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen. The group has claimed responsibility for the attempted bombing of a U.S.-bound airliner on December 25. Investigators have said intelligence ties the bombing suspect, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to the group. Yemeni forces carried out an air raid at 2:30 p.m. near Alajasher in the country's far north, the Yemeni Embassy to the United States said in its statement. ""Security authorities suspect that three of al Qaeda's most dangerous operatives -- Ammar Ubadah al-Waeli, Ayeth Jaber al-Shebwani, Saleh al-Tayes -- may have been also eliminated,"" the embassy said. ""Furthermore, counterterrorism units backed by helicopters continue to hunt down two al Qaeda operatives that escaped the air raid."" The Yemeni government official briefed on the matter said al-Shebwani was killed. He was in charge of recruiting people into the group in the Ma'areb region and was a ""very important figure, the person who provided logistical support to all foreign nationals recruited in AQAP in Yemen,"" the official said. A Yemeni security official with knowledge of the case said colleagues said another operative killed was Abu Ayman al-Masri. The U.S. National Counterterrorism Center's Web site says that after al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula emerged in January 2009, its leadership was composed of al-Raimi and the group's emir, Nasir al-Wahishi, both of them ""veteran Yemeni extremist leaders,"" as well as two Saudis, one of whom surrendered to Saudi authorities last year.

"(CNN) -- It doesn't matter if your invitation to Kimye's wedding got lost in the mail: Instagram has got you. The social media site has turned into the unofficial wedding album of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. The happy couple tied the knot this past weekend in Florence, Italy, and fans got to feel like they were right there for the action, thanks to the photos. The pair even released some of the first images of their ceremony on Instagram and Twitter. There was Kardashian, dressed in her custom white Givenchy gown with lace, kissing her new husband (also in Givenchy). There is also a shot of the newlyweds walking down the aisle after the ceremony. But the real fun apparently happened at the reception, where a wedding booth captured various images, including the now-Mr. and Mrs. West sporting matching leather jackets with the words ""Just "" on his and ""Married"" on hers. Kardashian posed with the man who made her wedding gown, Givenchy creative designer Riccardo Tisci, and Tisci in turn posted a picture of the back of Kardashian's dress showing its detail. He also posted a shot of her massive veil. Guests like LaLa Anthony, wife of professional basketball player Carmelo Anthony, got in on the action, posing with the new couple. But the image from the reception that has caused the most head-scratching has been the photo of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's 15-year-old son, Jaden, dressed in a white Batman outfit.

"An American who had been imprisoned for nearly two years in Nicaragua left the country Friday, a day after he was set free, and was en route to a reunion with his family, a spokesman for his family told CNN. Jason Puracal, a 35-year-old native of Washington state, had been serving a 22-year sentence for drug-related crimes in one of the Latin American country's most notorious prisons. He was one of 12 people whose charges were vacated, according to his legal team and a judicial order signed Wednesday that the team gave to CNN. Since his arrest in 2011, Puracal had many defenders who said the charges were baseless. They included human rights activists, international attorneys, a U.N. body, a former FBI investigator and a U.S. congressman. Details about Puracal's two years in prison . In August, Puracal spoke by phone with CNN's Anderson Cooper, saying he was imprisoned in a ""hellhole"" and that he was ""100 percent innocent."" ""I don't know the reason that I'm here,"" Puracal said. ""That's been a mystery from the very beginning. What the motives behind the police and the prosecution have been."" Wednesday's court order resulted from an appeal hearing that concluded this summer, in which Puracal's legal team argued for his release.

"Robert Dole knew his share of Washington fights -- as the Republican vice presidential and presidential nominee and as both Senate majority and minority leader. But as he celebrates his 90th birthday on Monday, he told CNN he believes the tone in Washington is much more bitter -- and that is not helping the country. ""There were a lot of differences in the days I was in the Senate,"" he told CNN in a rare interview. ""But in every case we were able to work the out the differences."" Dole served in the Senate alongside several Democratic leaders who were known for their strong wills: Robert Byrd, George Mitchell and Tom Daschle. ""We disagreed, but we respected each other,"" he said. ""We never had an unkind word about each other."" Now as Dole looks at today's Congress he thinks the two parties are not doing enough to try to find a middle ground -- and that includes relying too much on the filibuster in the Senate. ""It is very frustrating. Sometimes it is just justified, don't misunderstand me. But most of the time you ought to be able to work out a compromise that is going to be voted on,"" Dole told CNN. ""Compromise has become a bad word, and I always thought in almost every case there is room for compromise."" Senate leaders should change how they use the filibuster, he said. ""There are things that should be stopped, but at least there ought to be a vote,"" he said. ""It can't continue, this constant holding up bills."" As for what else is causing some of the rancor today, he told CNN ""the biggest problem today is the lack of trust."" Asked who is to blame for that, he put responsibility on both parties -- ""Sometimes it is the Rs (Republicans). Sometimes it is the Ds (Democrats)."" Just last week Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, threatened a historic change regarding the rules of how presidential nominations are considered -- eliminate the ability to filibuster them if Republicans didn't allow votes on several of the president's picks.  If those changes would have gone into effect, the atmosphere in Washington would have deteriorated even more. But even the threat of the rules change created a war of words between Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. This week the Senate is expected to consider a bipartisan compromise to help cap student loan rates -- a politically popular idea. But senators were able to reach agreement only after weeks of partisan haggling, several failed attempts and the intervention of President Barack Obama. Dole also sees major problems in how far his party has shifted to the right, saying a moderate from a conservative state will face problems because of ""some who don't believe they are Republican enough."" He repeated a statement he originally made in May in a television interview as a sign of how rigid the party has become, saying, ""that is why I said that Ronald Reagan I doubt could be nominated today. And I was a conservative and supported Reagan."" Dole, who was the GOP's 1996 presidential nominee, losing to incumbent Bill Clinton, urged his party to do a better job of trying to be more inclusive. In 2012: Dole, Baker for embracing bipartisan politics . ""I believe we ought to be reaching out to the Hispanic community, the black community and of course the middle- and upper-class community across the board, and we haven't done that,"" he said, pointing to the last election as evidence. After having served eight years in the House of Representatives, he began his first term in the Senate in 1969 and served there until 1996, when he resigned to concentrate on his run for the presidency after capturing the Republican nomination. He was Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976 when Ford lost to Jimmy Carter. Since his time in Congress the Kansan native, the longest-serving Republican leader in the Senate,  has seen a dramatic change in those serving and their goals. ""A lot of the younger members -- they are very smart. They are very capable. They have their own ideas -- start a filibuster, rather than compromise."" He cited how food stamps was added to the farm bill in the past as key to attracting support for the measure in both parties. The House earlier this month passed a scaled-down farm bill without food stamps after a version including them was defeated because it could not attract a large enough coalition. Dole, who is disabled from a World War II injury, also was disappointed last December after some of some of his own personal lobbying failed. The Senate blocked ratification of a United Nations treaty to promote the rights of disabled people. Dole, in a wheelchair, came to the Senate floor in a last ditch effort to help the treaty gain support. As for his successes, he cited the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act as one of the bills he was most proud of because of its lasting impact and one that had bipartisan support. He was also a major fundraiser in helping get the World War II Memorial built on the National Mall. Dole, who is special counsel in the Washington law firm of Alston & Bird's legislative and public policy group, spends his time with his wife, former Sen. Elizabeth Dole, in Washington but is mostly out of public view. He is a co-founder of the Bipartisan Policy Center and works to support a political institute named in in his honor at the University of Kansas. Dole has suffered from several illnesses in recent years, and spent 11 months at Walter Reed Army Hospital in 2010 after a bout with pneumonia. President George W.

"Reports that Anders Behring Breivik, the man who killed 77 people in a bomb attack and gun rampage in 2011, has applied to study political science at the University of Oslo have prompted anger in Norway. The claim was first made by Norwegian broadcaster TV2 and was subsequently picked up by other media outlets. Ole Petter Ottersen, rector of the University of Oslo, told CNN the university does not provide information about individual applications or students for confidentiality reasons, so he was unable to confirm or deny the claim. But if Breivik was to apply, he said, the university has a clear set of guidelines governing the decision on admittance and that policy would apply. Breivik was sentenced to the maximum possible term of 21 years in prison last August for the horrifying attack, which targeted a government building in Oslo and a Labour Party summer youth camp on Utoya island. He is serving his sentence in a high security wing of Ila Prison, where he has space for physical exercise as well as study and reading. But the suggestion that he might also be able to follow a course at the prestigious university from his cell has angered some Norwegians. Per Anders Langerod, a survivor of the Utoya shooting who finished his Political Science degree last year, told TV2 he would not have wanted Breivik in his class. Norway PM: 'Honor dead by celebrating life' ""It would have been very uncomfortable. I also understand others who think it would have been very uncomfortable. I mean that we can't expect people to just accept it,"" he told the broadcaster. In the wake of the reports, Norway's Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen said Wednesday that the ministry was reviewing its rules on allowing inmates to study -- although that did not mean they would necessarily change. Her statement appeared to confirm that Breivik had applied to the university, and that his application had been turned down. ""As far as the Ministry of Education knows he has not been accepted to any studies and he has been rejected in the normal admission process to the University of Oslo,"" Halvorsen said of Breivik. Students who meet the admissions criteria will not normally be excluded unless they pose a danger to other students and staff, she said -- an assessment that is made by the correctional service. But in Breivik's case, even if he was admitted to the course he would not be taking part in the university's normal classes, studies or exams, she said. ""For an inmate of Anders Behring Breivik's security level, it would be a matter of self-study in the cell, exams in the cell and possibly oral exams in the prison,"" she said. When he was given a 21-year sentence last year, after being judged sane, Breivik was ordered to serve a minimum of 10 years in prison. The sentence could be extended, potentially indefinitely, in the future if he is considered still to pose a threat to society. Meanwhile, comments from his lawyers suggest that Breivik still seeks to voice and validate the extreme ultranationalist views he outlined in an online ""manifesto"" published before the July 22, 2011, attack and during his trial. A year ago, attorney Tord Jordet told the Norwegian press that Breivik wanted to study political science and write books. And in an interview broadcast Sunday by CNN affiliate TV4 Sweden, Breivik's chief trial lawyer, Geir Lippestad, confirmed that his client was still seeking to disseminate his racist, far-right views from behind bars. He is not allowed access to the Internet, Lippestad said, but Breivik writes letters and sends them to his supporters. ""They then post them on the Internet so that his opinions are still spread,"" he said. Breivik has even unsuccessfully tried to start a political party from his cell, said the lawyer, who has written a book about his experience defending Breivik. ""His political project is not finished,"" he said of Breivik. ""He has his extreme right-wing opinions, and is still working to convince others to take up the same opinions."" Lippestad told TV4 he is concerned that the kind of views espoused by Breivik are not being discussed in wider society, allowing them to remain unchallenged. ""In this, Norway hasn't made any progress from where we were two years ago, on July 22. And that worries me,"" he said.","Anders Behring Breivik has applied to study political science, Norwegian broadcaster says .

"Islamist militants ambushed a bus in Kenya on Saturday and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses, killing at least 28 people, authorities said. The bus, which had 60 people aboard, was heading from Mandera, near the Somali border, to the capital of Nairobi. About 20 miles into its dawn journey, militants stopped it at a hilly area and stormed in, local police Cmdr. Noah Mwivanda told the Daily Nation newspaper. Militants demanded those onboard recite Quran verses. As others watched, they opened fire on passengers who failed to do so, he said. Somali-based terror group  Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying it was retaliation for mosque raids this week. It described those killed as Christians. This is one of the busiest travel seasons in the nation. Throngs make their way to relatives' homes for the holidays, with buses and other public transportation packed this time of the year. ""Security agencies are in pursuit of the criminal gang,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It later said helicopters and jets have demolished the attackers' camp and operations were ongoing. In a phone call with CNN on Saturday, Kenyan Interior Minister Joseph Ole Lenku declined to comment on the incident. The bodies of the victims were taken to Nairobi, where the Kenya Red Cross will provide assistance to victims' relatives and survivors of the attack, said the organization's secretary general, Abbas Gullet. Days before the bus attack, police raided multiple mosques in the port city of Mombasa after they found explosives in one. The searches this week prompted clashes with Muslim youths in the city, Kenya's second-largest. Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda, has launched a series of attacks in Kenya since its forces went into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to battle the extremists. Kenyan soldiers have targeted militants' hideouts across Somalia, prompting retaliatory attacks from the terror group. Last year, Al-Shabaab raided a Nairobi mall in a brazen attack that killed 68 people and left shoppers under siege for days. In addition to Kenya and Somalia, the terror group has struck Uganda, where it killed more than 70 people gathered to watch a World Cup soccer match in Kampala in 2010. As the attacks get more daring, the international community has rallied to battle the militants. In September, a U.S. airstrike killed Al-Shabaab's leader, Ahmed Godane. The terror group later replaced him and vowed to avenge his death.","Gunmen asked passengers to recite Quran verses, official says .

"(CNN) -- Ousted ex-Honduran President Manuel Zelaya inked an accord Sunday with the country's current president that will allow him to return to Honduras after almost two years in exile, officials said. The deal, which was brokered by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments, was signed in Cartagena, Colombia, by Zelaya and Honduran President Porfirio Lobo. It allows Zelaya and his allies to return to Honduras and helps clear the way for the country to rejoin the Organization of American States. Zelaya and his supporters will also be permitted to participate in Honduran politics. Zelaya was overthrown in a military-led coup June 28, 2009, and flown into exile. He sneaked back into Honduras in September of that year and got refuge in the Brazilian Embassy, where he remained until Lobo arranged for Zelaya to get safe passage out of the country. ""This agreement is great news to Latin Americans because it normalizes the situation in the Inter-American system,"" Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a statement soon after the deal was signed. He said he expects the OAS to act soon to welcome Honduras back into the fold. Honduras has been excluded from the regional body since the coup, in part because Zelaya had not been allowed to return home without fear of prosecution. He faced corruption charges, which were dropped this month. The de facto government that replaced Zelaya was eventually replaced by the elected government of Lobo. But because the election happened under the rule of the de facto forces, some countries have not recognized the election results. Many countries, including the United States, have recognized the Lobo government, while others, such as Brazil, have not. Zelaya's expected return to Honduras should help further reintegrate Honduras into the international community. ""Now that the obstacles to former President Zelaya's return to Honduras have been removed, I am confident that we will soon welcome Honduras back as a full member of the inter-American system,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a speech this month. ""That is a step that is long overdue."" CNN's Claudia Dominguez contributed to this report.","The deal helps clear the way for Honduras to rejoin the Organization of American States .

"A powerful earthquake struck a remote Tibetan region of southwestern China, reportedly killing at least five people and causing a stampede at a primary school. It injured more than 50 people and damaged around 25,000 houses, state media reported. The magnitude-5.9 quake struck late Saturday afternoon in a mountainous area of Sichuan province at a depth of around 15 kilometers (9 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Measuring the magnitude of earthquakes . The China Earthquake Networks Center said it had measured the earthquake's strength at a higher magnitude of 6.3. The quake left 54 people injured, six of them in critical condition and five others with severe injuries, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported Sunday, citing local authorities. The earthquake prompted students to flee from a primary school in the town of Tagong, near the epicenter, and 42 of them were injured in the ensuing rush, Xinhua said in an earlier report. Video footage from the region showed panicked people dashing out of buildings as the quake struck. The area has experienced scores of smaller aftershocks. Authorities say they have sent response teams and relief supplies to the affected region. Seismic activity frequently affects Sichuan.

"(CNN) -- President Obama finally did it. Through an executive order, the President intends to grant up to 5 million undocumented immigrants relief from deportation. Will the angry bulls rise up? Has the well been poisoned? Will Republicans follow through on their threats of government shutdowns because they consider this an ""impeachable offense""? Republicans, who now have a responsibility to prove that they can govern, should take a step back and see what the President is trying to achieve and then decide whether it's worth expending political capital to battle over. The President's Executive Action on deferring deportations for noncriminal undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for many years and contributed to our society will achieve three major goals: . 1. Boost the American economy . Studies show that passing comprehensive immigration reform will increase our economic gain by more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years, decrease our deficit by almost a trillion dollars in the next 20 years, and boost GDP growth by more than 5 percentage points. While the President's action is not the permanent legislative reform we ultimately need to gain all these benefits, starting out by letting a large group of people legally work and holding them accountable by ensuring they pay their fair share of taxes will put us on a more prosperous path. 2. Strengthen our national security . Millions of undocumented immigrants will now be allowed to come out of the shadows, be identified, given background checks and legal work permits. This will help us understand who they are and if any are here to do us harm. 3. Help keep families together . America was built on the labor of generations of immigrants. Our strength as a country comes also from the strength of families. Instead of deporting grandmothers and fathers and children, the President will use our precious resources to deport gang members instead. This priority will reduce the tragic loss that occurs when families are torn apart by senseless deportations. For a political party that prides itself in standing for a strong economy, strong national security and strong family values, please tell me -- which of these values are Republicans so adamantly against? The President's detractors say he has no constitutional authority to give relief to so many people. While the courts may ultimately decide this, as someone who has worked in what was formerly known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service, I can tell you without question, the President indeed has prosecutorial discretion to decide which limited resources to dedicate to which undocumented immigrants he wants to deport. In fact, immigration officials, district attorneys and other law enforcement personnel exercise prosecutorial discretion every single day. Moreover, Presidents Reagan, Bush I, Clinton and Bush II, each in their own ways, used executive authorities derived from this notion of prosecutorial discretion to grant relief to whole populations of undocumented immigrants for many reasons. Conservatives who oppose the President might also say that an executive order on immigration will poison the well and that he should work with Congress to pass a legitimate and permanent reform the way it should be passed: in Congress. I would be the first one to advise President Obama to wait in favor of congressional action. And by the way, it is the preferred way to go. There is just one problem. We have already seen this movie and we know how it ends. The President has been trying for years to get Congress on the same page. But Republicans have looked for excuses, continued to move the goalposts and voted several times to deport DREAMers. Republicans must understand just how ridiculous they sound when they say President Obama should wait until the new Congress is sworn in and work with them to pass real reform. Who in their right minds -- no pun intended -- thinks that with both houses of Congress controlled by more conservative Republicans who ran on a platform to oppose anything President Obama does, we can get a bill out of Congress that the President can sign? Republicans will point out that the American people are not on the side of the President on the immigration issue by pointing to a recent USA Today poll indicating that 46% preferred waiting for a Republican Congress to take action, while 42% approved of the President taking unilateral action now. However, perhaps a better reflection is the Washington Post September 2014 poll that asked whether Americans would support presidential action in the absence of any congressional action. Support rose to 52%. The absence of congressional action is exactly what we have had for the past year and half. As such, the American people cannot now let Republicans off the hook to get comprehensive immigration reform done legislatively, no matter how upset the GOP may be that the President acted. Temper tantrums are not an excuse for no action. So, the President delivered on his executive action and he, the Democrats and the immigration advocacy community will now have to work diligently to explain to the American people that the well is not poisoned, and that this is the right thing to do for our economy, national security and above all, it is consistent with our American values. For Republicans, it is not too late. They can make what the President announced moot and irrelevant. How? House Speaker John Boehner could bring the current bipartisan Senate immigration bill to the House floor for a vote on Friday -- and it would pass. Done. So when the Republicans get it together, if they can get it together to pass something the President can sign, the President's unilateral action would be stopped, the angry bulls will calm down, and showdowns, shutdowns and impeachment hearings can be left for another day. Most importantly, the American people would finally see their elected leaders put politics aside and do what is best for the country.","President grants 5 million undocumented immigrants relief from deportation .

"(CNN) -- After insane amounts of snow and bitterly cold temperatures this week, the Buffalo area begins to thaw out Saturday. The good news: Warmer temperatures will begin to melt some 7 feet of snow across the region. The bad news: Warmer temperatures will begin to melt some 7 feet of snow across the region. Saturday's high should reach 40 degrees, but with it comes rain. The entire area is under a flood warning, which means flooding is imminent or has been reported. The National Weather Service says flood-prone areas will be inundated, but warns there will be general flooding, too. ""(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time,"" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said. The risk of flooding extends into Tuesday. Erie County officials aren't taking any chances. They've mobilized heavy pumps and diesel pumps to suck up water and deposit it elsewhere. Swift-water rescue teams are in place, along with helicopters, should anyone get caught in the deluge of runoff waters. ""Warming will bring melting. Melting will bring water. Water will bring floods,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told reporters Friday. ""(Likely) more flooding than we have seen in a long, long time."" According to the National Weather Service, temperatures will remain above freezing through Monday, rising steadily into the 50s on Sunday. Heavy snow threatens to collapse more roofs before it melts. Some roofs already have crumbled, but rain may collapse more, in part because the already heavy snow perched atop buildings will soak up this weekend's rain before it melts, Erie County officials have said. About 30 roofs collapsed from Thursday night into Friday morning, Erie County Deputy Executive Richard Tobe said. Some major roads opened on Friday, like the New York State Thruway, and some local driving bans were lifted . That allowed trucks to move so food could be delivered to stores and crews could remove abandoned vehicles, Cuomo said. He added that no one should drive unless necessary. ""If you have a nonessential purpose, now is not the time to be driving around,"" Cuomo said. ""The roads are still dangerous."" Snow and vehicle removals still are major tasks ahead. Erie County crews have had to deal with clearing 1,800 lane-miles of county roads before getting to residential streets, Poloncarz said Friday. Cities and towns may have had more success with residential areas; 93% of hard-hit south Buffalo's residential streets had been plowed at least once by Friday, Mayor Bryon Brown said. Man found dead in vehicle; senior dies after evacuation . The latest of the 13 deaths to be counted is a 68-year-old man who died of a heart attack while snowplowing his driveway in Cheektowaga, according to Erie County Spokesman Benjamin Swanekamp. The death toll also includes one senior citizen who died of natural causes after or while the person was evacuated Thursday from a nursing home in Cheektowaga, officials said. Earlier, authorities said two people had died, but they corrected themselves at an afternoon news conference. And the storm forced the NFL to announce that Sunday's game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets, scheduled to be played at the Bills' Ralph Wilson Stadium, will take place at Detroit's Ford Field on Monday night. But even leaving the Buffalo area had its complications. Before meeting at the Bills' stadium Friday morning to get on a bus to the airport, some of the players had to be picked up by snowmobile because of driving bans in certain areas, team spokesman Scott Berchtold said. Seeking shelter . At the Winchester Volunteer Fire Company station on Harlem Street, as many as 40 people stranded in the snow have sought shelter since Tuesday. More than 6 feet of snow cover the streets. Abandoned cars are barely visible under the drifts. Fire trucks can't leave the station. Attempts by firefighters to get out in an SUV were futile. One medic hopped onto a snowmobile to rush to a call. Other volunteers jumped onto ATVs to reach a home where the roof was buckling under the weight of the snow. Maria Odom's two cats and a dog were rescued from the house. ""I'm ready for it to end,"" Odom, 38, said of the extreme weather. ""I've lived here my whole life and I've never seen anything like this."" At the fire station, driver Steve Randall's truckload of milk and eggs has served as the main source of provisions. Randall said he was stuck in his truck for nearly five hours before making his way to the firehouse, where people have been sleeping on tables to stay off the cold floor. ""We've been eating like kings for a while, but now we're running out of food,"" he said. Firehouse occupants have been making quiche, served with milk and bread from a store across the street. From the Tops grocery store nearby, people hauling bags of food headed out into the snow by foot. One man dragged groceries in a sled; another pulled his child through the snow in a laundry basket. Robert Mead embarked on a 5-mile trek to bring formula to his 9-month-old baby. Nearly a year's snowfall in three days . Residents just stared out their windows at the mounds of white stuff, if they could see out at all. In East Aurora, Lisa Gutekunst's home was capped with more than 4 feet of snow, she said Thursday. ""The snow is coming down so hard you can't see out the window,"" she said. ""We've cleared our driveway so many times that we've run out of places to put the snow."" The 86 inches that fell in some areas in three days is a year's worth of snow. In a typical year, Buffalo's snowfall totals about 7 feet, according to the National Weather Service. CNN's Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Buffalo area is now under a flood warning .

"Five detainees at Guantanamo Bay were transferred to the nations of Slovakia or Georgia as part of the U.S. plan to reduce the facility's population of detainees who were suspected of terrorism after the September 11, 2001, attacks, officials said Thursday. All five detainees ""were approved for transfer by consensus of"" a review task force that also looked at security issues, the U.S. Department of Defense said in a statement. As of Thursday, 143 detainees remain at the U.S. naval base in Cuba, the Pentagon said. That number compares to the facility's population height of more than 750 people after it began accepting post-9/11 prisoners. Three of the detainees -- Salah Mohammed Salih Al-Dhabi, Abdel Ghaib Ahmad Hakim, and Abdul Khaled Al-Baydani -- are slated to be sent to Georgia, in the Caucasus region at the border of Europe and Asia. The other two -- Hashim Bin Ali Bin Amor Sliti and Husayn Salim Muhammad Al-Mutari Yafai -- are scheduled to be transferred to Slovakia in Central Europe. Hakim was represented by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which identified him as Abd Al Hakim Ghalib Ahmad Alhag. Alhag (Hakim), who is from Yemen, had been detained for more than 10 years and been cleared for release ""for years,"" but his transfer was delayed ""as the U.S. inexplicably opposed his release in court,"" the center charged. ""The U.S. finally transferred him on the eve of new litigation by the Center for Constitutional Rights challenging his continued indefinite detention based on or because of his Yemeni citizenship. Such arbitrary detention violates U.S. and international law, including the Geneva Conventions, which the U.S. is obligated to uphold,"" the center said. Attorneys for the center praised Alhag's transfer out of Gitmo. ""We are grateful to the Republic of Georgia for offering our client a new home where he can begin to rebuild his life after more than a decade in Guantanamo without charge or trial,"" the center said in a statement. Of the 143 men in Guantanamo, 84 are from Yemen, and 54 of them have been approved for transfer, the center said. Alhag's transfer makes him the first Yemeni to be released since 2010, the center said. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that detainees have a constitutional right to challenge their detention, and the following year, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year, which has been delayed due to difficulties in relocating the prisoners. Last May, the U.S. government transferred five detainees to Qatar in exchange for the Taliban's release of U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive for five years.","Three of the detainees are sent to Georgia .

"Some things you just know for a fact. First U.S. president: George Washington. First human to walk on the moon: Neil Armstrong. First to achieve powered flight: Orville and Wilbur Wright. Wrong. At least that's what Connecticut says. State lawmakers passed a bill this week to honor Gustave Whitehead, who they claim beat the Wrights by two years. Gustave who? Whitehead. According to a 1901 Connecticut newspaper account, Whitehead -- a German immigrant -- flew his aircraft 150 feet in the air for about a half mile over the city of Bridgeport. The claim has been backed up by a respected aviation reference guide. The debate has got the Smithsonian's longtime aviation historian frustrated and worried. It also has triggered conspiratorial accusations about a ""secret agreement"" between the revered museum and the Wright brothers. Let's pause to remember that, hey, these guys are worldwide heroes. The image of their two-winged plane has appeared on U.S. money. On postage stamps, too. Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, where the Wrights flew, stands as a popular national landmark. It generates untold tourism dollars for a state that has labeled its car license tags with the words, ""First in Flight."" These are more than just bragging rights. A lot is at stake. This is a big deal. ""There is no legitimacy to the claim,"" says Tom Crouch, the Smithsonian's aviation historian. ""Justice is at risk. Credit should go where credit is deserved."" Not long after Whitehead's alleged flight, Crouch says, experts tried to find witnesses quoted in the Connecticut newspaper's account. Only one of two named witnesses could be found, says Crouch, and that witness said the flight never happened. If Whitehead really was first to fly, Crouch asks, ""why didn't he repeat it later? Did he forget the secret of flight? Then he started building machines based on other people's designs. Why would he do that if his own inventions were successful?"" Ever since Whitehead's flight, Crouch says ""absolutely everyone has rejected those claims. No one accepted them."" Until now. ""Jane's All the World's Aircraft,"" a respected aviation reference guide, has endorsed the claim. Also, Australian aviation historian John Brown says he found key photographic evidence. Last March, while rummaging through a museum attic in Germany, Brown says he found a lost photo that may depict the plane in flight. ""It was quite an emotional moment for me. I just jumped up in the air screaming,"" Brown says when experts confirmed that the photo was authentic. But does the photo show the plane in flight? ""It's just a blotch,"" says Crouch, describing the blurry image. ""It's not an airplane."" Brown agrees that the blurry image fails to offer definitive proof. But rather than trying to prove what the photograph shows or doesn't show, Brown has been focusing on establishing the credibility of journalists and witness reports from the 1901 flight. Journalists in the 1930s and afterward interviewed 17 witnesses who said they saw Whitehead flying, Brown says. The stories by 14 of those witnesses were notarized. Based on his research, Brown believes Whitehead did indeed fly before the Wrights. Are you a window seater or aisle flier? Then there's that so-called ""secret agreement."" ""In fact,"" Crouch says, ""it was never secret."" ""That's not true,"" Brown said later. ""It wasn't subject to the official secrets act, but it was kept from the public."" To hear Crouch tell it, when the Wright family signed a contract to give the Smithsonian the brothers' plane, the museum promised never to declare another aircraft the first to achieve powered flight. Crouch says the family ""stuck one clause into that contract that said if the Smithsonian ever says anybody flew before the Wright brothers, we have the right to take the airplane back. That clause is in fact still in the contract,"" Crouch says. ""As an honest historian, I never felt bound by that clause. If I found evidence that I think indicated somebody else had flown before the Wrights, I would say so."" ""What else would you say in his shoes?"" asks Brown. ""And if that's the case, why doesn't he examine the Whitehead claim?"" Brown says he recently worked with the Smithsonian on a project for the Smithsonian Channel. Aviation geeks take on terrorismPlane spotter destinations offer aviation thrills . For Connecticut state Rep. Charles Clemons Jr., one of the sponsors of the bill, acknowledging Whitehead's flight means money and prestige for his hometown. ""It will put Bridgeport on the map."" Clemons says, ""it will become synonymous with being first in flight, which would enable us to have a museum. With that, we would generate some tourist attractions."" With the economy being what it is these days, Clemons says the tourism dollars would be important to the region. Clemons mentions that Bridgeport is already known as the home of another flying object -- the Frisbee. But that claim also has been the subject of some debate. Does Clemons actually believe Whitehead was first? ""Yeah,"" he says confidently. He thinks history books should be re-written to say Whitehead beat the Wrights. No matter, says Crouch. The truth will win out. ""You can't legislate history,"" he says. Brown says, ""it's the Smithsonian that tried to negotiate history with this contract with the Wrights."" It's back, but will Dreamliner live up to its name? Meanwhile, the move puts Connecticut at odds with North Carolina and Ohio -- who've been fighting amongst themselves for decades for a share of the Wright brothers' tourism dollars. Most everybody knows about the brothers' aviation experiments on the North Carolina dunes. But Ohio reminds the world that the Wrights lived in Dayton. There, in their bicycle shop, they invented and developed much of their aviation machinery. There's a reason why the University of Dayton's teams are called The Flyers. But what about Jane's? Their reference guide endorsement has to mean something, right? As respected as Jane's is, says Crouch, ""it's not a historical publication. It's a reference book. It's damaging and that's why it kind of worries me."" The Whitehead story, which pops up in the media every few decades, is dangerous, Crouch says, because it plants the seeds of doubt in a story which should be seen as indisputable. However, this isn't the only dispute against the Wright brothers' legacy. Crouch says millions of Brazilians believe their pioneer aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont actually invented the airplane. ""Brazil claims Santos-Dumont was first because his aircraft had wheels, and the Wright's launched on rails,"" Crouch says. Whatever the case, Connecticut has started a brawl that could end up rewriting world history. Or it could all fade away in a blur of unproven claims. What do you think? Are Connecticut lawmakers acting prematurely by officially declaring Whitehead as the first to achieve powered flight? Let us know what you think in the comments section below.","Newly found photo questions whether Wright brothers made the first powered flight in 1903 .

"It has been some rather strange three weeks in France. Since footballer Nicolas Anelka dedicated a goal to his friend, the controversial French comedian Dieudonné, by doing the comedian's infamous trademark salute, the ""quenelle,"" what some believe is a reverse Nazi salute, during a match for West Bromwich Albion, France has been talking about little else. It is as if the entire public debate has been hijacked by a comedian who, over the last 15 years, has steadily drifted towards more and more extreme behavior and inflammatory speech. Anelka's gesture suddenly shone the light on a phenomenon that had so far been little known outside France. Now, the world knows that there is more to the ""quenelle"" than the exquisite dish, a creamy mixture of fish and egg, originated from Lyon, France's gastronomic capital. Dieudonné, 48, started his career as a comedian in the 1990s, in a duo with Jewish Franco-Moroccan Elie Semoun. They separated in 1997 when Semoun developed a career in cinema. Dieudonné struggled to exist solo and was said to be bitter about his ex-partner's success and fame. He then entered the realm of French politics, first of all fighting against the extreme right National Front before slowly getting closer to Marine Le Pen's xenophobic party, alongside extremist Islamists. His shows started focusing almost exclusively on his hatred of Israel and Jews. Condemned many times by the French courts for incitement to hatred, Dieudonné publically defended Iran's and the Hezbollah's anti-Semitic rhetoric. Dieudonne himself, who no longer gives interviews to the mainstream media, denies that his act, or la quenelle, is anti-Semitic. He claims through his legal team to be nothing more than a comedian and the victim of unjustified attacks because he stands up for those who are excluded from French society. Each time that the manager of a theater in France has refused to let him use their premises for one of his controversial shows, Dieudonné has threatened legal action. Anelka's public gesture has had the merit to prompt French Interior Minister Manuel Valls to action and to look into other aspects of the comedian's personality. It was revealed that Dieudonné has been quietly investigated for money laundering and tax fraud for more than a year. Valls, interviewed on French radio Europe 1, stated that Dieudonné was trying to declare himself bankrupt in order to avoid paying taxes and fines and that a possible case of money laundering between France and Cameroon was being closely looked at. However, what has divided France is the interior ministry's advice to the country's prefects to ban the comedian from performing if they deemed public order at risk. Dieudonné, at the beginning of a national tour, thus received his first ban on Thursday morning ahead of a planned performance in Nantes. His lawyer immediately appealed and an administrative court overturned the ban. The interior minister then appealed to France's highest jurisdiction which decided to uphold the ban on Thursday evening. A similar legal wrangling is expected to take place in every town where Dieudonné is supposed to perform. French President Francois Hollande weighed in the debate, giving all his support to his Interior minister. So far, France's public opinion and the media have been split over the issue of the ban. France may not have a First Amendment, but censorship is not considered lightly. There may be an understanding that freedom of speech stops where incitement to hatred begins and the French, in their majority, think that Dieudonné has gone much too far. However, is the ban in danger of giving publicity to Dieudonné? His shows are now selling fast. Others, such as French philosopher Bernard Henry Levy, argue that Dieudonné ceased long ago to be an artist and that his virulent anti-Semitism shouldn't be seen as artistic license: ""This is not humor anymore, this is political,"" he said. And why should Dieudonné be indeed treated differently than Marine Le Pen? The French government is walking a fine line between censorship and the respect of republican values; it looks however as if it has won the first round against racism.","The interior ministry adviced to ban a controversial comedian from performing if they deemed public order at risk .

"The Penn State football program, which had incurred severe sanctions after the Jerry Sandusky child molestation scandal, received good news Monday when the NCAA ended the Nittany Lions' postseason ban and scholarship limits. The NCAA said the reward was because of ""Penn State University's significant progress toward ensuring its Athletics Department functions with integrity,"" according to a statement from the executive committee of the collegiate sports ruling body. Former Sen. George Mitchell, the athletics integrity monitor for the university, made the recommendations in his most recent annual report on the program to the NCAA. ""Senator Mitchell's report and recommendations, along with the actions taken by the NCAA today, are a recognition of the hard work of many over the past two years to make Penn State a stronger institution,"" Penn State President Eric Barron said in a university statement. A $60 million fine and 13 years of vacated wins of renowned coach Joe Paterno will remain in place. Sandusky, 70, a former defensive coordinator, was convicted in 2012 of sexually abusing 10 boys he met through his charity. He is serving a 30- to 60-year prison term. But the sanctions against Penn State mostly revolved around an alleged cover-up by the university's former president, vice president and athletic director. The NCAA said Monday the team would be eligible for a bowl game this season and next year can grant the full number of scholarships (85).","Penn State received harsh sanctions from the NCAA after an alleged cover-up by officials .

"A top local police official in Mexico was arrested in connection with the disappearance of 43 college students, authorities said. Investigators apprehended Cesar Nava Gonzalez, the former deputy director of the Cocula police department who had been on the run since the September disappearance of the students, the federal prosecutor's office said. Nava allegedly was called to the neighboring town of Iguala, in Guerrero state, and allegedly helped round up the 43 students and hand them over to a drug gang to be massacred, authorities said. The police chief of Iguala still has not been apprehended, authorities said. The Prosecutor General's office informed families of the missing students about Nava's arrest on Friday, a day after massive protests to denounce political corruption and impunity in the case. The 43 missing students went missing September 26 after they and others traveled in buses about 77 miles from their rural teachers college in Tixtla to Iguala. They went there to protest a speech by the mayor's wife. But a violent clash with police left six people dead, including three other students. Authorities believe the 43 students were captured by Iguala police and turned over to a gang in cartel territory and then executed in Cocula, 14 miles away. The gang burned the bodies and dumped them in a river, but their corpses have yet to be found, authorities say. A mayor arrested, too . So far, authorities have also charged Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca as the ""probable mastermind"" in the 43 students' disappearance, and he has been charged with six counts of aggravated homicide and one count of attempted homicide, authorities said. In all, at least 75 people have been arrested in connection with the disappearances and the deaths, and the governor of Guerrero has taken a leave of absence amid scorching criticism that he responded too slowly to what's been called one of the most serious human rights abuses in recent Latin American history. Federal authorities say they heard confessions from drug traffickers indicating that the college students were rounded up on the orders of the Iguala mayor and then delivered to the drug gang to be murdered. Families don't accept the official version and demand proof of what happened. Mexicans have rallied to support the families, and on Thursday, tens of thousands of people converged on Mexico City to vent their anger and frustration in a protest that ended in violent clashes with police. The 43 missing students attended la Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa, a small college devoted to training students to become teachers in Mexico's impoverished countryside. Leftist school . The school features Marxist murals in red and black that highlight Communist revolutionary Vladimir Lenin of Russia and Marxist revolutionary Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara of Argentina. The rural teachers' colleges, sometimes labeled normal schools, are called ""devil schools"" by critics, according to Luis Hernandez Navarro, editor of La Jornada, one of Mexico's major newspapers. ""These are schools that are poor, and for the poor, to teach the poor,"" Hernandez told CNN. ""These schools are the gateway to move socially for the poor, rural students,"" Hernandez added, ""and they are one of the few escape routes that farmers have for their children to become teachers and prosper."" The school has been in the government's cross hairs, and business groups have requested they be closed, he added.","Officials tell families of missing students about the arrest after a day of protests .

"The home of Ghassan Abu Jamal has a beautiful view of Jabel Mukaber. It looks over a small valley with olive trees and grazing sheep. It also stinks here, the distinctive raw sewage smell of what's known locally as ""skunk water,"" sprayed by Israeli police as a riot-control measure. And when you walk down the road to the Abu Jamal family's East Jerusalem home, you tread on the metal remains of tear gas canisters. On Tuesday Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Uday walked into a synagogue in the West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. Armed with meat cleavers, they attacked the worshipers inside, hacking at them with the knives. They killed four rabbis and a police officer before they were shot dead at the scene. Today Ghassan and Uday stare out at mourners from posters and flyers on the walls of the family home. Here they are considered ""shaheed,"" or martyrs, of Israel's occupation. His 70-year old father, Mohamed, was recovering from a heart operation when he saw the news of the synagogue attack on television. He immediately collapsed. ""I never thought my son would do something like this,"" he tells us. He sits with us at the mourners' tent erected near the family home. His eyes are red from crying and he can't stand for long stretches. We ask Mohamed what he believes triggered the gruesome attack. ""Maybe it was everything,"" he says. ""We want peace. We want coexistence. But we don't accept being pushed into a corner and treated like slaves."" In the hours that followed the attack, the Abu Jamal family says 15 relatives were arrested, some badly beaten in the process. They show us photos of the family's ransacked homes and Ghassan's younger brother with a purple, swollen eye, blood streaming down his face. Now, Ghassan's home will be demolished. The family show us the demolition order. His wife is distraught and unable to talk to anyone. Her three children are being cared for by relatives. But perhaps the hardest part: their bodies may never be returned to the family. Israel says no decision has been made, but authorities here fear a family funeral could become a flashpoint, drawing hundreds to hold the cousins up as heroes. Instead, police are considering burying the bodies in a municipal grave. ""It's impossible. It's madness. The situation will not calm down unless they deliver the bodies home and allow us to bury them here"" Mohamed says. ""When they kill Arabs the never demolish the house of Jew. We never hear of a Jewish home destroyed when they kill one of us."" House demolitions, the possibility of denied family burials: Israel is reviving policies it used during the intifada in the hopes of deterring future attacks. Between 2000 and 2005 more than 650 Palestinian homes were demolished, displacing roughly 4,000 people, according to Israeli rights organization B'Tselem. Critics say these policies are ineffective, even counter-productive. But Israel's government insists that destroying homes may save lives. ""It is an extraordinary step, one of the tools in our tool box,"" Mark Regev, the spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN. ""A Palestinian terrorist, any terrorist, may not care about themselves. But maybe they care about their immediate loved ones and where they live. I've been in security discussions and our experts believe this policy could save lives."" In the Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan, Enas Shalodi is one of those loved ones. Her son rammed his car into a crowd at a tram station, killing a woman and a 3-week-old baby. He was shot dead at the scene. Now Shalodi picks through the rubble of what's left of her home. ""It is just for punishing us. That's what it is,"" she tells us. ""How can destroying this house stop an attack?"" On the day we visit, Israel's public security minister, Yitzhak Aharonovitch, makes an unannounced visit to survey the destruction of Shalodi's home. Shalodi leans out over the remains of her son's apartment wall to see Aharonovitch arrive. She watches without expression as riot police point up at the blown-out walls of the home. The neighborhood bristles with tension. Riot police have blocked off the road and are checking residents' IDs and bags. Police with rifles, stationed on rooftops, keep a watchful eye. Aharonovitch won't answer any of our questions and bodyguards block our approach. But he lets us film as he shakes hands with riot police and chats with them. For a moment, he seems to veer towards some nearby residents. One of his entourage offers a ""Salaamalaikum"" as if to start a conversation with an older Palestinian resident leaning against a car. But the man turns his head and snubs the greeting. Aharonovitch and his staff quickly turn and drive away to another part of the neighborhood. Throughout the visit, Aharonovitch never speaks to Enas Shalodi. If he did, this is what he would hear: ""Violence only creates more violence. Adding more pressure only creates a bigger explosion.""","In the wake of several terror attacks, Israel revives policy of demolishing perpetrators' homes .

"(Mental Floss) -- Most people know that condoms prevent the spread of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Unusual campaigns to promote condom use are being launched in places where condoms are less popular. But in many parts of the world, condoms aren't very popular. Here are five novel campaigns launched by nonprofit organizations and condom companies to encourage wider use. 1. A ring tone to remember . In India, people stigmatize condoms and refuse to wear them because they believe only prostitutes must use prophylactics. Leave it to one of the world's richest men to find a solution -- the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation donated money for a national condom ring tone. An a cappella group sings ""Condom, Condom"" -- in the style of doo-wop like the contagious pop song ""Barbara Ann"" -- when one receives a phone call. Despite its bubblegum sound, officials hope that the people who have the condom ring tone appear smart and responsible. Since the ring tone's August launch, more than 60,000 people downloaded it. Yvonne MacPherson, country director of the BBC World Service Trust (which the Gates foundation funded), sums it up best when she said to The Associated Press: ""A ring tone is a very public thing. It's a way to show you are a condom user and you don't have any issues with it."" Right, nothing attracts the amorous attention like announcing loudly that you have a condom. 2. Perks you right up . Ethiopians claim they hate condoms because the smell of latex sickens them. To combat the odor, DKT International, a United Sates nonprofit, created coffee condoms. These dark brown condoms allegedly (I'm not testing the products) taste and smell like the favorite coffee of Ethiopia -- the macchiato, an espresso with cream and sugar. One college student claimed the smell reminded him of the beauty of Ethiopian women (it's not clear if that's a compliment). These condoms bolster national identity because Ethiopians claim to have invented coffee. DKT International also created flavored and scented condoms for Indonesia (durian fruit) and China (sweet corn). Mental Floss: 4 fruits we're dying to try . 3. Condom trees . In western Australia, the rate of HIV infection is the highest in the nation. When public health nurses were looking for an effective way to distribute condoms, someone suggested trees. Young people in the countryside hang out under trees, so the shady spots are the perfect places for nurses to hang condom-filled canisters. Over 3,000 condoms are taken each month. Residents said grabbing condoms from trees was convenient and private. Additionally, officials in Australia piloted programs where Aboriginal teens sold packets of condoms and kept half of the proceeds. Officials tout these programs as a success because STD rates have fallen, yet nurses wonder how they will convince people that they shouldn't have multiple partners. Maybe a monogamy tree is in the Outback's future. Mental Floss: 8 smooches that (sort of) shook the world . 4. Scare tactics . Perhaps some safe sex programs skirt the issue -- unprotected sex causes HIV, which leads to AIDS and often death. It's not surprising that a condom company would resort to scare tactics. The Tulipan Company launched its ""Be Careful"" ads in Argentina. Showing skeletons positioned in flagrante delicto, these ads make no bones about how important it is to wear a condom while engaging in coitus. No word if the skeleton ads have had the desired impact, though the graphic skeletons appear more popular than recent Trojan ads, which depict men as swine. Mental Floss: Strange gravestones . 5. Spray-on protection . Since his teens, Jan Vinzenz Krause struggled to find a condom that fit correctly. He thought the pursuit of the perfect prophylactic was hopeless -- until he went to the carwash. Inspired by the spray-on soap and wax, the German Krause developed a spray-on latex condom, which he claims always fits perfectly and feels natural. However, many men find the design off-putting; the spray-on condom comes in a hard phallic case. Men slide themselves into the cylinder and layer on the latex, providing full coverage. The Jolly Joe, as Krause dubbed it, frightened many men during the testing phase -- they only put the case on their fingers. (Spray on gloves anyone?) Others felt the loud hissing wasn't sexy and the latex takes too long to dry -- three minutes. Krause explains to Time, ""It needs to be ready in five to ten seconds."" So for now, Krause is waiting for a quicker-drying latex. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com . Entire contents of this article copyright, Mental Floss LLC.

"Embattled Republican Sen. Pat Roberts added to his cavalry of endorsements Monday, receiving the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Roberts, a conservative three-term senator, is in an unusually tough race in deep-red Kansas with independent businessman Greg Orman, whom Roberts attacked hard about what he's calling questionable business dealings with Rajat Gupta, a former Wall Street executive convicted of insider trading. ""He isn't honest about his liberal ideology, and he isn't coming clear about his business record,"" Roberts said. ""Mr. Orman is using his business record as a sole qualification for his candidacy, but the truth is Mr. Orman built his business career working with one of Wall Street's biggest criminals, avoiding taxes, and laying off hard-working Americans."" Roberts' low poll numbers have garnered national attention in a year Republicans could win a Senate majority. It's been over 80 years since Kansas elected a non-Republican senator, and party members don't want the Sunflower state to be the reason they remain in the minority during the next Congress. The Chamber of Commerce endorsement is critical for Republicans who represent themselves as business allies. The organization typically shows support for Republican candidates, which could include ads and other financial support. ""We're all in for Senator Roberts. Period,"" Rob Engstrom, a senior vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, told CNN. ""We're going to clearly point out where Mr. Orman and his liberal record with his liberal allies stands on the issues. And once Kansas voters hear that and believe that and know that, Senator Roberts will win."" Republican Party members from all spectrums concerned about winning a majority have also come to Kansas to campaign with the senator. Bob Dole, a former GOP presidential candidate, Senate majority leader, and member of the Kansas congressional delegation, campaigned for Roberts last month, as did other establishment party members including former former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Former presidential candidate Mitt Romney will be in Kansas later this month, Roberts said. Tea party supporters also have given Roberts the support he'll need to win in November, even after their preferred candidate, Dr. Milton Wolf, lost to him in the primary earlier this year. Sarah Palin has already stumped for Roberts, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas will kick off a statewide bus tour campaign this Friday. Asked why Orman's business experience and position in favor of immigration reform like the Chamber's didn't qualify him for the endorsement, Engstorm said, ""I would argue there are very few positions where we share a common view. Dodd-Frank, American energy exploration, cap-and-trade, Obamacare. He's either on the wrong side or won't say where he stands."" Engstrom didn't mince words to show his support for Roberts' business record. ""This is the senator -- this is the man -- who is pushing back against Obama and Harry Reid, and Mr. Orman is not. He's absent,"" he said. Orman didn't return the candidate questionnaire used to decide endorsements within the organization that represents over 300,000 members, Engstrom noted. Roberts isn't the only Republican having trouble in the polls this year in Kansas. Gov. Sam Brownback's re-election is also in question. Asked by CNN whether Brownback is dragging down his campaign, Roberts replied, ""I will let Governor Brownback speak for himself, but I think -- I think he's coming back.""","The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is endorsing Kansas Sen.

"The father of a 15-month-old boy who died after being left in a hot car in July has pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminally negligent homicide. Kyle Seitz, 36, entered the plea in Danbury Superior Court on Friday. The death of Benjamin Seitz was ruled a homicide in August. On July 7, the elder Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz  said. Seitz drove to work and at the end of the day he went to pick Benjamin up at day care, only to realize he was not there, authorities said. When Seitz realized his son was in the car, he rushed the child to the hospital, but Benjamin had died. The cause of the boy's death was hyperthermia due to environmental exposure, according to the state medical examiner. Grieving mother's mission to stop hot car deaths . The Connecticut death came a month after a similar incident in suburban Atlanta garnered national headlines. In the Georgia case, a grand jury ended up indicting Justin Ross Harris on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, over the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Through his attorneys, Harris has claimed that he forgot to drop off the boy at daycare and mistakenly left him in his 2011 Hyundai Tucson on a day when the temperature topped 92 degrees. At least 44 children died in 2013 from heatstroke caused by being left in cars in the United States, according to the national nonprofit organization KidsAndCars.org. At least 30 children have died this year for the same reason. Over the past decade, the group figures, there have been at least 388 children who have died of vehicular heatstroke.","Kyle Seitz pleads not guilty to criminally negligent homicide .

"The American Red Cross says power outages created by recent storms in the East and Midwest cut blood donations, which were already low this summer.  In June there was a nationwide shortfall, with donations down more than 10% across the country. ""We are asking people to please call 1-800-RED-CROSS or visit us at redcrossblood.org to find a way to donate if they can,"" said Stephanie Millian, Red Cross director of biomedical communications.  ""We need people's help."" One group that would like to help, but legally can't, may be moving one step closer to eligibility.  Since the 1980s, when the AIDS epidemic decimated their community, gay men -- or MSMs (men who have sex with men) as they are called by federal agencies -- have not been allowed to donate blood. In June, a group of 64 U.S. legislators led by Rep. Mike Quigley, D-Illinois, and Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services encouraging it to move forward with a study that may lead to the end of the decades-old ban. ""We remain concerned that a blanket deferral of MSM for any length of time both perpetuates the unwarranted discrimination against the bisexual and gay community and prevents healthy men from donating blood without a definitive finding of added benefit to the safety of the blood supply,"" the letter said. China lifts ban on lesbians giving blood . ""This is a matter of life and death and we are turning away over 50,000 healthy men who want to donate blood,"" Quigley told CNN. ""A straight person who has unsafe sex with multiple partners can give blood, and that creates a greater risk than a gay person in a monogamous relationship."" The policy started at a time when people didn't know how the deadly virus that causes AIDS spread. At the time, there wasn't a good test to detect whether HIV was present in donated blood, and HIV was getting into the nation's blood supply.  They knew this because hemophiliacs who were getting blood transfusions started showing symptoms of AIDS.  What scientists also knew was that a disproportionate number of gay men were affected by the virus. To eliminate risk, the Food and Drug Administration added a screening question to the federal guidelines. Blood banks were instructed to ask male donors if they had had sex with a man, even once, since 1977. The FDA regards 1977 as the beginning of the AIDS epidemic in the United States. If the potential donor responded ""yes,"" he would automatically be removed from the donor pool for life. No similar questions were asked to screen out donors who engaged in other potentially risky sexual behavior. Donors weren't asked about the number of partners they had, nor were they asked if their sexual partners had engaged in unprotected sex with other HIV positive partners. ""While the Red Cross is obligated by law to follow the FDA guidelines, we continue to work with the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks)  to push through policies that would be much more fair and consistent among donors who engage in similar risk activities,"" Millian said. Scientists can now screen for most instances of HIV within days of infection, and the nation's blood banks have called a lifetime ban ""medically and scientifically unwarranted."" Men who have sex with men still are disproportionately affected by the virus and account for nearly half the approximately 1.2 million people living with HIV in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  But it is a person's behavior, not their sexual orientation, that puts them at risk say health experts. While he is a gay man, Adam Denney thinks he would be the perfect candidate to donate blood.  He doesn't use IV drugs. He practices safer sex. He even educates people on how to prevent new HIV infections as a regular volunteer educator with AIDS Volunteers Inc. in Lexington, Kentucky.  He thinks his exclusion is unfair. ""Yes, gay men are still a high-risk community, but so are minority women, and there are no standards prohibiting them from donating. There would be rightful outrage against that kind of blanket population ban,"" Denney said. ""I am banned based on one reason only, my sexual orientation. It's totally discriminatory."" When Denney went to donate at a blood drive on the Eastern Kentucky University Campus a few years ago, he said he knew what likely would happen when the nurses asked the sexual history question.  ""I did know what I was getting into, but I was shocked by how it felt to be rejected,"" he said. ""It was almost like they thought I wasn't important enough to give blood, like because I was gay I didn't count. It was a horrible feeling."" Parts of UK lift lifetime ban on gay men donating blood . Nathan Schaefer with GMHC, an AIDS service organization, said Denney normally would be the type of donor blood banks are hungry for.  Studies show those who give blood when they are young become regular lifetime donors, something most blood banks are struggling to find these days.  GMHC has been fighting to change the ban for years. In 2010 GMHC joined a coalition of other nonprofits to encourage Congress to send a letter to HHS to end the ban, which some members of congress did. In June of that year, HHS brought together an independent panel of experts. The Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability reviewed the policy and decided to keep it and concluded the ban was ""suboptimal,"" because it allows high-risk individuals to donate while keeping low-risk donors out. However, the expert committee also concluded ""available scientific data are inadequate to support change to a specific alternate policy.""  The panel suggested the policy not be changed and recommended further evaluation. HHS then promised to conduct feasibility studies to determine if there was a subset of the gay male population that would pose little or no threat to the blood supply.  ""We finally got them to stop defending the policy at the very least, which was pretty significant,"" Schaefer said. The HHS is still determining the criteria for which part of the population to study. GMHC suggested the population to consider should include gay men who have had only one sex partner in the past six months. Spain and Italy, two countries with more progressive donor policies, hold everyone to that standard regardless of sexual orientation. Schaefer takes the point one step further. ""A straight person could donate today after having unprotected sex with hundreds of partners, and in the United States they won't ask about that behavior,"" he said.  He added that four out of five gay men are HIV negative, which he estimated means 2 million additional people could be blood donors. A 2010 study by the Williams Institute at the University of California-Los Angeles estimated that if gay men who had not had sexual contact for the past 12 months were allowed to donate blood, more than 53,000 additional men would likely make more than 89,000 blood donations.  That number may seem small, but blood banks say it could help enormously, especially now, when blood supply shortages are common. After Denney was denied the chance to donate, he asked some of his friends to help him demonstrate outside the blood drive.  They produced signs to raise awareness about the ban and distributed educational material.  They also escorted people to the drive, because they wanted people to continue to donate.  ""A lot of people in the Bible Belt assume you have AIDS if you are a gay man,"" he said. ""We wanted them to understand that is not the case. We are banned based on an outdated policy.  When people questioned us, I told them about how I always heard that people who donate blood are heroes. Gay men want to be heroes, too."" Should people be allowed to sell their organs?","Gay men prohibited from donating blood .

"A single mom down on her luck was caught shoplifting at a Miami supermarket, but she didn't get hauled off to jail. Instead, the officer who responded to the call from the Publix supermarket last month did something that brought the suspect to tears. Jessica Robles told CNN affiliate WSVN she was desperate and had no money to pay for groceries for her daughter and two young sons. According to Miami-Dade Police, Robles walked out of the store in late September with a cart carrying $300 worth of groceries that she didn't pay for. When Officer Vicki Thomas asked Robles why she did it, the young mother said her children were hungry. Thomas looked at Robles' criminal history and didn't find any major charges, WSVN reported.  Instead of being taken into custody, Robles was issued a notice to appear in court and charged with a misdemeanor. When the officer asked if she had food at home, Robles said, ""I looked at her in her face, and I told her, 'Not at all.'"" Robles' 12-year-old daughter Anais described the family's dire situation to WSVN. Police officer goes above and beyond to rescue dog . It's ""not fun,"" she said, ""to see my brother in the dirt hungry, asking for food, and we have to tell him, 'There is nothing here.'"" Thomas decided -- in addition to telling Robles about food banks, churches and other places she could get food -- she was going to help Robles and her family. ""I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry,"" she said.

"Bhutan is mourning the loss of Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, a four-century-old architectural wonder that had dramatically stood on a ridge at the confluence of two rivers before it burned to the ground over the weekend. A gateway to eastern Bhutan, the dzong was built in 1638 by the nation's founder, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, and was among several fortress-monasteries constructed to help gain control of -- and unify -- the country. ""The entire society has solidarity for the loss of one of the most important and oldest fortresses in our country,"" said Home Minister Minjur Dorji, who has been on the site for the last three days, in a telephone call. King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck and the queen have been there since the fire ""trying to morally support the people,"" he added. ""It's not just a Bhutanese architectural loss but for the whole Himalayan region,"" Dasho Karma Ura, president of the Thimphu-based Center for Bhutan Studies, said by telephone on Tuesday before visiting the site. ""Something could not have been built like that anywhere else,"" he said. The fire started Sunday afternoon and burned through the night, consuming the dzong, which not only housed temples but served as the seat of administration for the district. Bhutan's Moving Gold: How water is powering the country . As news of the fire broke out, the king and queen rushed to the scene to oversee the firefighting effort. Most of the dzong's sacred relics -- hundreds of them -- were saved, many of them dating back to the 6th and 7th centuries, thanks to the Bhutan armed forces, said the home minister. Some of the relics were carried out, while others were thrown in iron boxes from three- to four-story heights into the cactus below, he said, adding that some of the relics received minor but not severe damage. Although an investigation is still under way, a short circuit in the wiring is believed to have caused the fire, according to the minister, adding that the dzong was 95% built of timber. Dzongs have had a history of fires, he explained, noting that butter lamps had been the culprit in the past. ""Today, it's modern facilities. We have electrified nearly all the dzongs, and short-circuits could come from poor quality of wiring. That's where we have our problems."" By Tuesday, only stones, which comprised the stairs before the dzong's entrance, remained of the dzong, according to the Bhutan newspaper, Kuensel, which reported that numerous administrative documents were lost. Bhutan had only just submitted Wangdue Phodrang for World Heritage List consideration in March. No one was killed in the blaze, and all people have been accounted for, the home minister said, noting that Sunday had been a holiday, and that monks' residences were constructed outside the dzong. In a message to fellow citizens published on Kuensel's website on Tuesday, Prime Minister Jigmi Y Thinley said that Wangdue Phodrong Dzong will be rebuilt just as the Paro Taktsang, nicknamed the Tiger's Nest, was after its own devastating fire in 1998. The Taktsang, he wrote, ""is in fact more cherished and revered today because the fire awakened all of us to the fragility and vulnerability of this most precious heritage."" Finding happiness in mystical Bhutan . With its contours built into the ridge 1,350 meters (4,430 feet) above sea level, Wangdue Phodrang is inaccessible on three sides save for a narrow path in the front, Dasho Karma of the Center for Bhutan Studies pointed out. Its hilltop location overlooking the Punatsangchu and Dangchu rivers offered a military advantage -- and the same inaccessibility that was intended to ward off enemy attacks on Sunday hampered efforts by firefighters to put the blaze out. Minjur Dorji said there was no financial estimate for the destruction of Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, which has been immortalized in art as well as in a Bhutanese ballad composed in the late 19th century. ""Dzongs are priceless,"" he said. ""It is a big loss. Bhutan is a very small, tiny country. To reconstruct the same old structure at this point is going to be very difficult for our internal revenues to support."" Only Simtokha Dzong and Punakha Dzong, both completed in 1631 and also by Zhabdrung, are older. Punakha's dzong has itself weathered numerous fires, quakes and floods over the centuries and has been rebuilt many times. This week's fire will prompt Bhutan to shift its policy to protect its centuries-old dzongs, the home minister said. Such policies would include ensuring a high quality in the electrification of the dzongs, adequate fire-extinguishing equipment, alternatives to timber which comprise most dzong construction -- and multiple exits. ""In fortified fortresses, there is only one exit. We need to have multiple exits so that lives are not lost,"" he said. To observe a national day of tragedy, the home ministry declared all offices and schools across the country closed on Monday. ""It was one of the most magnificent sites of Bhutan -- that dzong,"" said Dasho Karma. ""For me it was always an uplifting experience to come to view it. It was always a great esthetic experience to sit quietly at the point where you could see that dzong."" He hoped the king would rebuild the fortress, ""which will inspire future generations ... in the same way that the founder of Bhutan did,"" he added.

"(CNN)When nature calls for male members of the House of Representatives, they only have to walk steps to answer. But for the some 100 female members, it's not so easy. The women have to walk off the House floor, through what is usually a sea of tourists in Statuary Hall to reach the ladies' restroom. That gender inequality  among the nation's elected representatives, baffled  Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn, so much, that she wanted to show us as part of her exit interview before leaving Congress. ""You have to go not only through Statuary Hall, and you have to go through kind of an anteroom, then you get down to the House of Representatives. So it's quite a ways,"" said Bachmann, motioning all the way across Statuary Hall towards the House floor, which you can't even see from the ladies lounge. (Note: Another ladies room was placed closer to the House floor at the order of House Speaker John Boehner in 2011.) Bachmann is known as a hard charging polarizing conservative - not so much as a feminist wanting to shine a light on how far women still have to go for parity in politics. But she knew the whole story of how even the original women's restroom came to be - thanks to former female Rep Lindy Boggs, wife of famous former Rep Hale Boggs , for making it happen. Officially, it is called the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Reading Room. ""They said well, there's a broom closet over here off of Statuary Hall, "" she said, pointing to what is now the ladies lounge. The piece of history Bachmann says fascinates her is that the current ladies room room was where former President, Rep. John Quincy Adams died in February of 1848. He collapsed following one of his famous anti slavery speeches in Statuary Hall, which was then the House floor. ""He'd been president, and he was asked to run for Congress specifically to fight against slavery. And he was all worn out, as most presidents are, but he was so moved by slavery he came back,"" Bachmann said. ""And for over twenty years, he stood over here, and every single day he stood up with his petition to stop slavery. And every day he was booed down and hated, hated, hated by his fellow Congressmen. Until finally at the very end of his life, he stood up again with his petition, and collapsed."" She said the couch where Adams died is still in the ladies' restroom. ""He was laid on a couch that's still in here - that was the same couch, it's obviously been redone, and he laid here for three days. Well now the interesting story is, this was a broom closet that no one knew, but on the wall is a bust of John Quincy Adams. And it said that he was serving here and he collapsed, he came, and it told the whole story about how he died on this couch while he was in the midst of fighting for slavery. That whole story was lost until this room was recovered,"" Leave it to the women, Bachmann said, to figure it out.

"Editor's note: Dan Buettner is the author of ""The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer from the People Who've Lived the Longest."" He spoke at the TEDxTC Event at the Science Museum of Minnesota in September, 2009. His Web site is http://www.bluezones.com/ For more TED Talks, click here . In the same way organisms select for characteristics that favor the survival and well-being of its species over successive generations, so too do cultures. With organisms, we call this process evolution and it represents a sort of accumulated wisdom. There is no word for this process in cultures, but there is one for the result. And that word is tradition. For that past eight years, my team of scientists and National Geographic researchers have explored five parts of the world -- ""Blue Zones"" -- where people live measurably longer lives. Compared to American averages, we found a bronze-age culture in Sardinia's interior that produces about 10 times more male centenarians; a remote peninsula in Costa Rica where 50 year-olds have a three-fold better chance or reaching age 90; a Greek island completely free of Alzheimer's (about 50 percent of Americans over age 90 suffer from dementia); and islands in southern Japan where people suffer one-sixth the rate of heart disease. How do they do it? The Danish Twin Studies established that only about 20 percent of average lifespan (within certain biological limits) is dictated by genes. Lifestyle explains most of the rest of the longevity formula. We found that all five Blue Zones possessed the same nine lifestyle characteristics. Among them: a low-meat, plant-based diet (all of them ate a lot of beans) and a ritual of ""downshifting"" each day. They experience the same stresses we do -- kids, health, finances -- but they managed it through daily prayer, meditation, ancestor veneration or city-wide happy hours (like the Sardinians). The secret to longevity, as I see it, has less to do with diet, or even exercise, and more to do with the environment in which a person lives: social and physical. What do I mean by this? They live rewardingly inconvenient lives. They walk to the store and to their friends' homes and they live in houses set up with opportunities to move mindlessly. They do their own yard work, hand-knead their own bread dough, and, in the case of Okinawa, get up and down off the floor several dozen times a day. They live in strong families that keep them motivated to support loved ones. Centenarians are still living near their children and feel loved and the expectation to love. Instead of being mere recipients of care, they are contributors to the lives of their families. They grow gardens to contribute vegetables, they continue to cook and clean. This has a powerful two-fold effect: Children and grandchildren in these families benefit from their grandparents' wisdom and care while the centenarians feel the motivation to stay active, to get out of bed in the morning, and live for a purpose. They live in cities where it is easy to walk to their friends' houses, to the store or to church. So, we figured they get about 105 minutes of physical activity everyday -- and no health club membership! We know from the Framingham studies that happiness, smoking and obesity are all ""contagious."" If your three best friends are obese, there's a 70 percent better chance that you'll be overweight. People in the Blue Zones either proactively surround themselves with people who practice the right behaviors or are born into communities of people who do -- or people whose idea of fun is gardening, or bocce ball or swimming; people who eat meat sparingly, who have faith, who are trusting and trust-worthy. Why is this so important? No supplement, hormone, antioxidant or pill of any sort has been shown to reverse, stop or even slow aging. The problem is two-fold: to do the study properly, you'd need to follow two groups of people for life: one who takes the pill, the other that doesn't. Then you'd have to control for all other factors and compare the average age of death for each group. No such study has ever been done on a ""longevity"" supplement. The second problem is adherence. People in general just don't stick to doing anything for very long. Are you taking supplements? How long have you been taking them? I'll bet not more than a few years. Science (and hucksters) have offered us countless diets but research done by the University of Minnesota's Dr. Robert W. Jeffrey has shown that fewer than 2 percent of people adhere to diets for more than two years. For anything to really impact your life expectancy positively, you need to do it for most of your life. Friends, unlike pills or diets, are much more likely to be much longer-term undertakings. The secret to solving much of America's health care crisis and battle with chronic diseases lies in emulating the environment in Blue Zones. Is it possible? Last year, my partners and I made Blue Zones-inspired changes to the environment of an entire American town -- Albert Lea, Minnesota, (see AARP Magazine article). We made the town more walkable and bikeable, dug public gardens, made it easier for kids to walk to school and people to expand their face-to-face social networks to include more people motivated to change their health habits. The results were astounding. If the trends continue, life expectancy for the average participant would rise about three years and health care costs for city workers would decrease by 48 percent. The wisdom of the world's Blue Zones represents centuries or even millennia of observed human experience. As Democrats and Republicans argue over how to solve the health care crisis, perhaps they should take a moment to consider the wisdom of their grandmothers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dan Buettner.","Researchers looked at regions where people live long lives .

"Too bad Barack Obama isn't running for office in Brazil. The real one, that is. He's so popular here that at least 16 candidates for municipal elections have adopted the name ""Obama"" to try to get more votes on October 7. There are plenty of ""Baracks,"" as well as ""Ricardo Obama,"" ""Wilson Obama"" and even ""Barata Obama,"" which literally translates as ""Cockroach Obama."" And it doesn't stop with the U.S. president. As candidates try to stand out, ballots are filled with the names of characters like Batman, Robin, Superman and Rambo. And there are even some oddball characters like gyrating dancers, Santa Claus and a ""Bin Laden"" who says he'll ""blow up corruption."" The candidates dress in costumes during their short electoral spots, hoping to grab the attention of would-be voters. They were inspired after a popular TV clown became the most-voted-for contender in the last congressional elections. For some, the eccentric candidates are a sign of political immaturity; but for others, they're proof that Brazil's democracy is flourishing. Brazilians are surprisingly laid back when it comes to politics and questions of authority. Everyone from football players to presidents go by their first names or nicknames. The most popular leader in recent history, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, ran for office on his nickname ""Lula,"" which can be translated as ""Squid."" The current president, Dilma Rousseff, is simply called ""Dilma"" by most Brazilians. In fact, more than 140 candidates for municipal elections have adopted the name ""Dilma"" for the ballot. One of the Obama candidates has another explanation for many of the bizarre names adopted during elections. ""There is so much corruption in politics that people sometimes prefer to vote for a candidate who isn't a real person,"" said Gerson Januario de Almeida. He's running for councilman in the central Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte with the name ""Obama BH."" For the last couple of years, he has worked as a Barack Obama impersonator at parties and events. But he says he'll make a difference if he wins the election. ""I used this name because I think it can bring me votes,"" he told CNN. ""But I need to separate just being a body double from being a politician."" His platform, ironically, is health reform. He hands out pamphlets as he strolls around the center of the city with a big sash bearing the name ""Obama BH."" Most passers-by seem more interested in getting their picture taken with ""Obama"" than reading about his campaign promises. ""With that face and appearance, it'll be hard to go wrong,"" one man says. But others say looks aren't enough. ""I'll be open to his proposals, but politics aren't a joke,"" another man says. Obama BH says he's pretty sure no one has adopted the name of the Republican U.S. presidential candidate. But if the U.S. presidential elections don't go to the real Obama, a few Mitt Romneys may emerge the next time Brazilians go to the polls.

The poignant music video that accompanies it spans Campbell's career. It contrasts Campbell singing in the studio with home video and clips from throughout his career. There are even images of doctors discussing his brain scans with him. Because of the progression of the disease, the 78-year-old Campbell was admitted to a special care facility in Nashville in April.

"If you fall asleep in bed every night with the TV on, you're apparently a dying breed. More people now use their tablet or smartphone in the bedroom for late-night video viewing rather than switching on the tube, according to a new survey. Motorola Mobility surveyed 9,500 people in 17 countries and found that ""consumers are watching an enormous amount of video, in some surprising ways, in unexpected places."" Among respondents, 46% said they've watched video on their smartphones in the master bedroom, and 41% said they've done so on tablets. That's compared with 36% who said they watch TV while, or after, hitting the sack. Motorola's fourth annual Media Engagement Barometer doesn't delve deeply into what sort of content people are watching in the bedroom or elsewhere (though it could be noted that the section revealing the bedroom habits is called ""Multi-screen Romance""). But John Burke, a senior vice president and general manager of Motorola Mobility's ""Converged Solutions"" service, said consumers want more flexibility in how and where they watch movies and TV shows. ""They want to be firmly in control of the way they experience their videos, but they're frustrated,"" he said. ""Increasingly, they're using tablets and smartphones to view their content, and they expect this experience to transition seamlessly across their favorite programs, whenever and wherever they like."" For example, one in 10 respondents said they watch mobile video in the kitchen. Cooking shows, maybe? The study had some other interesting findings, not all of which were necessarily heartening, depending on your point of view. The number of hours people said they watch TV every week almost doubled in two years: from 10 hours in 2011 to 19 hours this year.  Add the five to six hours respondents said they watch movies each week, and we're looking at more than a full day every week spent with eyeballs glued to one screen or another. The United States led the pack, reporting 23 hours of TV and six hours of movies per week. And the DVR revolution -- a growing frustration for ratings-hungry TV networks whose ads often get skipped -- was obvious. Respondents said that almost one-third of the TV they watch (29%) is recorded. Among those who record shows, 77% said they do so because there's another show they'd rather watch at the same time, 72% said they do it so they'll have a digital box set of their favorite shows, and 68% said they do it so they can skip commercials -- a number that jumps to 74% in the United States and 75% in the U.K. That's been the source of a bunch of controversy. Last year, TV networks launched a flurry of lawsuits against Dish Network over its AdHop feature, which lets users automatically skip commercials while watching recorded shows. The networks, led by Fox, NBC and CBS, claim that such features will ruin the system that finances their shows, while Dish argued that people have been skipping ads, in one way or another, since the invention of TV.","Survey says people watch smartphones and tablets more than TV in the bedroom .

"(CNN)The comet Siding Spring whizzed within 87,000 miles of Mars on Sunday -- close enough to the Red Planet that the fleet of spacecraft orbiting Mars ""ducked"" for cover. But not before gathering some data. NASA took the precaution of having the spacecraft move behind the planet to avoid getting hit by Siding Spring's trail of dust and gas. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was the first of the spacecraft to report it was unharmed as the comet passed. It made observations of the comet before sheltering behind Mars, NASA said in a news release. ""The spacecraft performed flawlessly throughout the comet flyby,"" said Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Manager Dan Johnston of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""It maneuvered for the planned observations of the comet and emerged unscathed.""

Siding Spring sped by Mars at a speed of about 126,000 miles per hour. The comet does not pose a threat to Earth and was headed back out to the outer reaches of the solar system, according to NASA. Hours after the comet passed at its closest point to Mars, NASA was still awaiting confirmation on the status of the Mars Odyssey orbiter and the new Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN). Several Earth-based and space telescopes, including the Hubble Space Telescope, also took pictures.

"Joseph Wood was supposed to go quickly and painlessly, when the State of Arizona put him to death by lethal injection on Wednesday. It took nearly two hours for him to die. Journalists called to witness the execution said it was hard to watch, as Wood snorted and gasped. One described it like a ""fish on shore gulping for air."" Arizona officials defended the procedure, saying that the proper protocols were followed. Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of U.S. executions between 1982 and 2006, which it considers ""botched."" It's hard to spot an example on that list of an execution that drew out nearly as long as Wood's did. His lawyers call it a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights against ""cruel and unusual punishment."" They severely criticized the novel combination of two drugs used in the procedure. Wood's slow death on Wednesday is fueling a debate that has kicked up as states try out new drug alternatives for lethal injection, after the sole U.S. manufacturer stopped making a key drug previously used. Here are some answers to basic questions about the controversy surrounding the new drug combinations. 1. What drug combination did Arizona use? Midazolam, which is an anesthetic used sometimes in surgery, and hydromorphone, a narcotic pain killer, commonly known by its brand name Dilaudid. The anesthetic is thought to render the inmate unconscious for the execution. An overdose of hydromorphone causes death by shutting down breathing and stopping the heart from beating. Lethal injections usually proceed in stages, with one drug injected first, another second and, in some cases, a third drug last. All of them in high doses. A very common combination has traditionally involved three drugs: . -- An anesthetic to make the inmate unconscious. -- Then a paralyzing agent to keep him or her from flailing. -- Then a third drug, often potassium chloride, to stop the heart. Some states feel that overdoses of two drugs are enough, and there is a new movement afoot in some states to reduce it to a single drug, according to Fordham University School of Law. In Arizona, on Wednesday, Wood received the midazolam first, then the hydromorphone. 2. Why is the new combination controversial? The controversy surrounding the relatively new combination seems to center more on midazolam. Two other recent executions that appeared to turn ugly had it as an ingredient: . -- Dennis McGurie started wheezing after receiving both drugs in Ohio in January. He gasped, and his chest and stomach heaved, a journalist witness said. He made choking sounds and clenched his fists. McGurie had been convicted of rape and murder. -- Oklahoma injected Clayton Lockett with midazolam in April. But instead of becoming unconscious, he twitched, convulsed and spoke. The execution was halted, but Lockett died anyhow after 43 minutes. Officials blamed the botched execution on a burst vein. Lockett had been convicted of murder. Before McGurie received the combination, experts warned of the possible adverse reaction. And according to the National Institutes of Health, midazolam's side effects can include uncontrollable shaking, seizures and difficulty breathing. 3. Why the new drug combinations? For years -- in the three-drug method mentioned above -- sodium thiopental was injected first as the anesthetic, but its sole U.S. manufacturer, Illinois based Hospira, stopped producing it. In 2011, it entered into a production deal in Italy, where the death penalty is illegal, and the company had to promise its product would not be used in the United States for executions. Since it felt it couldn't guarantee that, it shut down the production. The European Union has banned its manufacturers from exporting sodium thiopental to the United States for the same reason. 4. Did executions work well with the previous drug? CNN has not been able to find cases, in which the administration of previous execution drug combinations led to such prolonged deaths, but the use of sodium thiopental has also found its critics. They have attacked the drug itself and also question the professionalism of its application. Scientists from the University of Miami have said that the anesthesia doesn't last long enough, and as a result, an inmate may become alert during the execution. But the paralyzing agent administered after the anesthetic may prevent him or her from letting anyone know that he or she is awake. The inmate may be silent and still but experience the administration of the third, deadly drug consciously. ""It would be a cruel way to die,"" they wrote, ""awake, paralyzed, unable to move, to breathe, while potassium burned through your veins."" The scientists also have complained that executioners had no training in anesthesia. The three-drug method was developed by an medical examiner in Oklahoma and passed on to prison personnel, they said. The result, the scientists fear, is inmates suffering through their executions eyes wide opened. Opinion: 5 ways to improve the U.S. death penalty . Death penalty facts that may surprise you .

"The headlines scream: ""Political tsunami,"" ""earthquake"" and ""big bang."" European elections may have taken place in 28 different countries, but the results in just one of them proved the big story of the night. Who and what are we talking about? Marine Le Pen's Front National extreme-right party came top in France's European elections, with 25.41% of the vote. This is a historic achievement for the 46-year-old daughter of Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party's founder. And if the newspaper headlines are to be believed, the consequences of that particular vote are going to be felt for a very long time, both nationally and internationally. Listening to French radio and television through the night, there was no doubt that France's whole political class and commentators had never thought such thing possible, at least not on that scale. Some even succumbed to slight hysteria, live on French airwaves, including Laurent Wauquiez, France's former minister for European affairs, who advocated, quite simply, a return to the EU made only of its founding member states -- France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium -- plus Spain.

A few days before the vote, in an open letter published both in German and French, in Die welt and Le Point, former president Nicolas Sarkozy proposed that Europe should be divided up into three zones, with an end to the Schengen Agreement, which allows freedom of movement without passports between member states. It felt like panic; it was panic. Le Pen's triumph reveals the collapse of national trust in the traditional Right and Left parties which have governed France for three generations since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958. Sarkozy's UMP party only managed to take 20.77% of the vote, while President Hollande's Socialist Party only attracted 13.97%. Centrists at 9.81% and Greens with 8.89% seem almost irrelevant. While President Hollande has convened a crisis cabinet meeting at the Elysées Palace in order to prepare the next EU Council meeting in Brussels, a lot of people are left asking why a quarter of the French electorate cast their ballot in favor of the extreme right. Exit polls carried out by Harris Interactive suggest that anti-European sentiment is actually not the main reason. Domestic concerns always loom large in European elections. Only 22% of Le Pen voters say that they want out of the EU, according to the polls. The two main reasons cited are: ""We need change"" (43%) and ""this is a protest against traditional parties of government"" (37%.) So, if this is not about Europe, after all, should President Hollande dissolve the National Assembly, as Marine Le Pen demanded? Should he resign? Two very unlikely scenarios but then, another question follows: What about the next presidential elections? A poll conducted immediately after the results on Sunday evening revealed that a majority of the French people wanted neither François Hollande nor Nicolas Sarkozy to run for presidency. A little like in Italy where Italians gave a vote of confidence to Matteo Renzi (a man who has never been in government, is still untainted, and therefore represents ""change"") France is in search of fresh and untarnished politicians whose names have never appeared in scandals of any sort. It is no surprise to see that Manuel Valls, the recently-appointed French prime minister, feeling still rather new in the job, is one the most popular politicians in France. Marine Le Pen, although belonging to a family dynasty and to France's political establishment, also benefits from popularity only enjoyed by politicians who haven't been tarnished by government. In other words, French voters want politics to be reinvented by a new generation. This, of course, may prove totally illusory, or the lightning bolt the French political class needs.

"HURUMA, Kenya (CNN)  -- We found Barack Obama's half-brother living in a Nairobi slum. George Obama says he is sure his half-brother will win the U.S. presidency in November. George Obama, whose birth certificate shows that he is Barack Obama's half-brother, lives in a small house in Huruma that he shares with his mother's extended family, far away from the presidential campaign circus. In his memoir, ""Dreams for my Father,"" the Democratic presidential candidate describes meeting George as a ""painful affair."" Barack Obama's trip to Kenya meant meeting family he had never known. In the book, which is popular in Nairobi and can be found in almost any supermarket, Obama looks back at his personal story and his struggles to reconcile with a Kenyan father who left him and his mother when he was just a child. Barack Obama Sr. died in a car accident when George was just 6 months old. And like his half-brother, George hardly knew his father. George was his father's last child and had not been aware of his famous half-brother. ""I think I wanted to learn about my father the same way he did,"" George Obama told me about why he read the book. ""He came here searching for his roots, and I was also trying to find my roots."" Watch George Obama talk about meeting his half-brother for the first time . Unlike his grandmother in Kogela, in Western Kenya, George Obama had received little attention from the media. But reports surfaced in the past few days, springing from an Italian Vanity Fair article saying George Obama is living in a shack and ""earning less than a dollar a day."" The reports left him angry. ""I was brought up well. I live well even now,"" he said. ""The magazines, they have exaggerated everything. ""I think I kind of like it here. There are some challenges, but maybe it is just like where you come from, there are the same challenges,"" Obama said. Obama, who is in his mid-20s, is learning to become a mechanic and is active in youth groups in Huruma. He said he tries to help the community as much as he can. At least one of his neighbors feels that perhaps the candidate should help the brother. ""I would like Obama to visit his brother to see how he is living, to improve his way of life,"" said Emelda Negei, who runs a small dispensary near Obama's house. But George Obama will have none of it. He draws inspiration from his famous half-brother. He acknowledges that he is biased but said he knows that his half-brother will be the next president. ""Because he wants to be [president],"" he said. ""I think in life, what you want is what you are supposed to get.""","Barack Obama and George Obama share a father, the late Barack Obama Sr.

"A winter storm is snarling travel across the East Coast on Wednesday, causing trouble on the nation's roadways and delays of up to six hours at airports in the Northeast on one of the busiest travel days of the year. About 30 million people from the mountains of North Carolina to Maine could be affected by the holiday storm. ""The storm in the Northeast continues to develop and is causing long delays and numerous cancellations at D.C., New York city and Philadelphia airports, along with trouble on the roadways, as snow increases in coverage,"" CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said. ""Most delays and cancellations will occur from late morning through Wednesday evening."" The silver lining for Thursday morning fliers? ""By Thanksgiving, the storm will be exiting, and conditions should return to normal,"" he said. Use CNN's weather tracker . Rain and snow . Travelers are already seeing significant snow accumulations as rain and snow target the Washington, New York and Boston metro areas. ""Roughly 30 miles west of Washington, Philadelphia, New York and Boston will see heavy snow while the cities themselves receive only light amounts,"" Hennen said. Up to 18 inches of snow has fallen in parts of West Virginia as of 2 pm ET, and parts of New England could see up to 20 inches of snow. Thundersnow has been reported around Baltimore, parts of New Jersey and the Hudson Valley in New York. Power outages . Mike Todd, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Safety, said power outages are a major concern. ""This is New England; this is just another winter storm here, and the complication is just that it's the holiday weekend,"" he said. ""We caution individuals to drive carefully and slowly. Consider staying put if you're concerned. Safety first, as always."" Pennsylvania said it'll have state police and the National Guard in the state emergency operations center. State officials urged residents to avoid the roads if they can. ""The bottom line is, the less cars the better, the less traffic the better,"" said Cory Angell of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. ""If you don't have to go, you don't need to go. You don't want to be stuck in a queue for hours and then run out of gas and whatnot. It's important people realize there are hazards involved with travel, and more often than not, they don't."" 10 ways to survive holiday travel . Flights canceled . Airlines had canceled 735 flights and had 4,647 delays ""within, into, or out of the United States"" as of 9 p.m. ET Wednesday, and that number is expected to increase, according to FlightAware.com. (That website does not distinguish whether flights are canceled or delayed for mechanical, weather or other reasons.) ""This is not a huge number of cancellations, but due to the holiday, flights will be more full, and there will be fewer available seats to accommodate displaced passengers from canceled flights,"" FlightAware.com's Daniel Baker wrote in an email. ""We expect thousands of delays that will cause moderate disruption to Thanksgiving travelers,"" he said. ""The delays will begin accumulating early afternoon as the worst of the weather impacts the Northeast and will continue to cascade through the evening."" The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates major airports in both states, estimates that 1% of flights will be canceled at New York's LaGuardia Airport today, 8% at New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport and hardly any cancellations at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Fliers should try to rebook their flights for Thursday, Baker said. United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, JetBlue and Southwest Airlines are waiving rebooking charges for holiday travelers in the Northeast. ""Customers ticketed on American Airlines, American Eagle or US Airways or US Airways Express flights on November 26 to, from, or through (18 affected airports) may change flights without penalty, have the ticket-reissue charge waived for one ticket change, and begin travel as early as November 25 or as late as November 27 under American's current travel waiver,"" according to an airline release. Midwest affected, too . The Northeast isn't the only region where bad weather is predicted. Light snow is forecast until Thursday in Minneapolis, Chicago and other parts of the upper Midwest. The Northwest is expecting rain, with snow in the mountains. Denver is expecting wind gusts of up to 30 mph on Tuesday and 15 mph on Wednesday. AAA is expecting 46 million Americans to travel 50 miles or more from home during the Thanksgiving weekend, and 90% of them are traveling by car. That would be the most travelers since 2007. Drivers should check weather forecasts before setting out on the road, and travelers should also check tire pressure, car batteries and windshield wipers. On the bright side, people traveling by car will probably pay less for gas than in recent years, AAA says. The current average price of gasoline in the United States is $2.85 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the average price at  the same time last year.","735 flights canceled, over 4,600 delayed, FlightAware.com reports .

"Money was no object when the time came for Joan Lunden to find a senior care facility for her 88-year-old mother. For years, the former host of ""Good Morning America"" had been a long-distance caregiver to her mother and brother in California, providing them with emotional and financial support from New York. After her brother's death in 2006 from complications from type II diabetes, Lunden needed to find a new home for her mother, who was suffering from the onset of dementia. Trying to create the best possible quality of life for an aging relative is ""the new normal"" for 43.5 million Americans caring for someone older than 50, according to the Family Caregiver Alliance. It's not just their parents: With about 10,000 baby boomers hitting age 65 each day, they're becoming caregivers and also those needing care. With people living longer than ever, this is the first generation that might care for its parents as long as it cared for its children, experts said. ""Now that more baby boomers are aging, the issue of family caregiving is becoming much more commonplace. We call it the 'new normal,'"" said Lynn Feinberg, senior policy adviser for AARP. Building relationships amid memory loss . Lunden flew from New York to Sacramento and drove around in search of a new home for her mom. She settled on an apartment in one of the fanciest senior communities in town, where her mother, Gladyce, would have the option of entertaining guests in her home or meeting other residents in a ballroom-style dining space. It didn't take long for Lunden to realize that she'd chosen a place for the mother she knew 15 years ago, not the one who had been depending on her brother for the last decade. Her mother didn't want to spend time with other residents, nor was she capable of living on her own. ""On paper, it was spectacular, but it didn't serve her needs at all,"" Lunden said. ""She was completely stressed out and her emotional situation was deteriorating because she didn't feel safe... she couldn't operate on her own on a daily basis."" It took several falls, a few broken bones and three more moves to find the right place. She now shares a ranch-style home with four others in a small residential care facility. There's a health care aide on site at all times to help her get dressed or take care of daily needs. ""She needed more hands-on, day-to-day care,"" Lunden said. ""I didn't understand that because I wasn't living with her."" Caregiving responsibilities vary with each family. It could mean driving an aunt to physician appointments, managing medication for a spouse or keeping tabs on mom from afar using the latest technology. The average caregiver in 2009 was a 49-year-old woman who had a job outside the home and spent nearly 20 hours per week providing unpaid care to her mother, according to a 2011 AARP Public Policy Institute study. The report estimated the overall economic value of family caregiving at $450 billion, based on 42.1 million caregivers 18 or older providing an average of 18.4 hours of care per week. Many don't see themselves as caregivers but simply spouses, children or siblings doing what's expected. For that reason, they often fail to use resources that might help their relative or themselves, Lunden said. The first step is acknowledging the need and seeking help, ideally, before entering crisis mode, she and other experts said. ""This is the nation's next big health crisis,"" Lunden said. ""We have to get focused and tuned in because if we're clueless, we're going to get hit upside the head when it happens in the middle of a family emergency."" Caregiving is also much more complicated than it was in previous generations because of fragmentation within the health care system, with several doctors often required to treat one person, said AARP's Feinberg. Cutbacks in long-term and community-based services have also put a strain on families to do more individually. ""There is a greater awareness about these issues and the joys and struggles of family caregivers,"" Feinberg said. ""But we have a long way to go to develop policy solutions to make life better for families."" Lunden's experience inspired her to share the trials, tribulations and rewards of family caregiving. She wrote a ""Chicken Soup for Soul"" on caregiving and tours the country giving talks on the topic. It starts with a conversation, ideally, before a health crisis occurs, to get everyone on the same page, she said. ""Nobody wants to talk about their mortality or think about themselves getting old,"" Lunden said. ""There's the thought that you go straight to the nursing home to die and that's not the case."" There are questions everyone should ask, she said. Does your loved one have advanced health care insurance? How much does it cover and how long does it last? What about an advanced health care directive or a will? Where's the mortgage, the title to the car, stocks and bonds? Who in the family should have power of attorney, legal and medical, to keep track of end of life wishes and ensure they're carried out? AARP's 35 questions for an aging parent . Lunden didn't have the answers when she found herself urgently searching for a new residence for her mother. She realized later she spent time digging through piles of books and magazines looking for her mother's license when she should have been talking to her about what she wanted in a new home. The situation took a turn for the better when she connected with a senior advocate. They talked about her mother's medical condition, level of independence, behavioral tics, nutritional needs and hobbies. They also talked about location and financial resources to narrow the options. ""It's a process and you need to become educated about what the options are [because] the first step is not likely to be the last step,"" said Carol Kalmanoff, an adviser with the referral service, ""A Place for Mom,"" which helps families find the best senior living options for their needs and budget. Options range from independent living communities to personal care homes to facilities for memory and dementia care, she said. The facility Lunden chose for her mother is an affiliate of ""A Place for Mom,"" and Lunden is a spokeswoman for the company. Many people only make the call during a medical emergency, and often, they don't know the extent of what they're dealing with. ""We talk about need to be persistent because the whole thought of change and moving is very scary and stressful for family members, too,"" she said. ""We try to help them approach it one step at a time and keep a sense of humor. It's important to be able to do that."" And, with people living longer, healthier lives, retirement takes many forms, she said. ""What today's seniors associate a nursing home with is what they saw parents growing up with,"" she said. ""But in reality, it could mean so many things."" When moving is not necessary or financially feasible, a variety of home-based options exist, said Lisa Winstel with the National Family Caregivers Association. Simple home modifications, like grab guards in the bathroom, can make a big contribution toward independent living. Virtual monitoring systems can also be used to transmit information such as blood pressure to caregivers living in other states or health care providers. ""People are living active lives longer and engaging in society,"" she said. ""Family caregivers can make that possible even from a distance."" The National Family Caregivers Association is one of several groups designed to help caregivers find resources for loved ones and themselves. It also provides tips on how to communicate effectively with health care professionals and doctors, the best starting point for determining if assisted living might be necessary, she said. Other resources, such as AARP and Local Area Agencies on Aging, part of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, also provide community-based services and advice, she said. Finding the right place not only improved her mother's quality of life, but Lunden's also. Symptoms associated with her mother's dementia have abated and she seems happy, Lunden said. ""When it's a parent or husband or wife, you just want to know they're going to go to sleep at night and feel safe,"" she said. ""I know that every moment of the day and night she's safeguarded... it's the best gift a parent can give a caregiver.""","Experts: Boomers might spend as many years caring for parents as they did their children .

"ISIS militants are fighting Iraqi military and tribal forces close to the main government complex of Anbar province in the center of Ramadi, according to a local official there. The fighting started Friday after ISIS militants launched a coordinated assault from different direction around the city, according to Faleh al-Issawi, deputy head of the provincial council. The battle is taking place about 1,000 feet from the complex that houses the local government and security headquarters. ""If the government complex falls, it would mean the fall of the whole province,"" Al-Issawi told CNN. The bodies of 23 tribesmen and 12 ISIS militants were found after Friday's fighting, Al-Issawi said. The police chief of al-Habaniya, outside Ramadi, and three of his guards were killed during Friday's fighting, according to Al-Issawi. Most of the Sunni-dominated province and some parts of Ramadi have been under the control of ISIS, and the militants have been making recent advances despite coalition airstrikes targeting them. The United States conducted two airstrikes near Ramadi on Friday, according to U.S. Central Command. Three weeks ago, Pentagon officials said they plan to deploy U.S. military advisers to Anbar to advise and assist Iraqi security forces there.

"French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday night put the country's southwest region on the highest possible security alert level, hours after a teacher and three children were gunned down at a Jewish school in Toulouse. The incident at the Ozar Hatorah school marked the third time in the past 10 days that a gunman on a motorcycle has fired on minorities in the region. On Monday, the teacher was shot dead with his two children, while the school's director saw his daughter shot and killed in front of him, Sarkozy said in a somber speech at the school. The president then returned to Paris and addressed the violence again in an evening speech from the Elysee Palace. French troops were present on streets, at train stations and at other highly trafficked locales in parts of southwestern France before Monday's  shooting, as that region had been on a high alert level for years. Sarkozy made a point in his Monday night speech to note that France's security measures for the area will remain high. He also said that he'll suspend his re-election campaign until at least Wednesday, in the wake of the shooting. Representatives from France's Jewish and Muslim communities will meet with the president Tuesday, when a moment of silence is being planned to remember the victims, according to Sarkozy. One of the guns used Monday was also used in killings of French soldiers of north African origin who were shot and killed on March 11 and March 15, said Elisabeth Allannic, a spokeswoman for judicial authorities in Paris. A court in Paris on Monday opened an investigation into all three killings, under anti-terrorism powers. The gunman pulled up in front of the Jewish school just before 8 a.m. and started shooting, authorities said. The dead included a 3-year-old child, and a 17-year-old was wounded, according to local prosecutor Michael Valet. The gunman got close enough to his victims to shoot them in the head, local journalist Gil Bousquet said. In the shooting's aftermath, families hugged and wept in front of police cars around the school. Ambulances and police vans lined the narrow streets of the city, and a helicopter circled overhead as police on foot made their way through the small crowd of shocked locals to get to the building. Speaking from the school, Sarkozy declared that ""everything must be done so the killer is arrested."" ""And of course our thoughts are with these families that are shattered -- a mother who has lost her husband and her two children the same day; the director of the school saw his little girl die before his eyes,"" Sarkozy said. The gunman wore a motorcycle helmet and fled on a motor scooter after the shootings, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said -- the same method used in the earlier soldiers' shootings. ""It's a horrible tragedy,"" he said of Monday's shootings. The Interior Ministry has ordered police across the country to contact Jewish organizations to arrange increased vigilance, Brandet said. France, which has one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe, had 389 reported acts of anti-Semitism in 2011, according to Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, known by the French acronym CRIF. Its head, Richard Prasquier, and Minister of Education Luc Chatel accompanied Sarkozy to Toulouse. The group later issued a statement saying that, while it is too early to determine definitively the motive for the ""horrible"" crime, it appears it's a case of anti-Semitism. It called for increased security at places of worship and study as the investigation continues. Gilles Bernheim, the chief rabbi of France, said he was ""horrified"" and ""upset."" And French presidential candidate Francois Hollande said he felt ""horror"" over the killing. It comes directly on the heels of two other shootings. The first was March 11, when Toulouse police Capt. David Delattre said a soldier was on his motorbike when a helmeted man on another motorcycle shot and killed him. The soldier was not in uniform, and his motorbike did not have any military identification, Delattre said. 2 French soldiers killed in shooting . On Thursday, two other soldiers were shot dead and another injured by a black-clad man wearing a motorcycle helmet in the southwestern French city of Montauban, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Toulouse. French authorities link soldiers' fatal shooting . The more recent shooting caught the world's attention, soliciting immediate and strong reaction from Jewish and other leaders -- many of them thousands of miles away from the French crime scene. ""Today, Jews everywhere in the world are weeping in sorrow and disgust in the face of this despicable terrorist attack,"" said Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress. ""Targeting children is a particularly sick and vile act, and nothing can justify it."" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ""savage crime"" and said anti-Semitism could not be ruled out as a motive. ""We follow with shock the news coming from France, and we trust the French authorities to shed full light on this crime and to bring those responsible to justice,"" said Yigal Palmor, the spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry. Security heightened in U.S. synagogues . Police in New York, Washington and San Francisco all said they plan to increase patrols of synagogues and Jewish institutions, with New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly citing fears someone might stage a ""copy-cat"" attack. But he and the city's mayor stressed there is no ""specific"" intelligence indicating an active threat there. ""Just because there's something that happens there, doesn't mean there are more threats here. But we take everything very seriously,"" said Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Abraham Foxman, national director of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League, said that Jewish people had just as much reason to be vigilant before Monday's attack as after, given some people's anti-Semitism. He said he was ""shocked, saddened but unfortunately not surprised"" by the Toulouse shooting, which he felt was ""targeted to express hatred against Jews."" ""You hope and pray that it doesn't happen more often,"" Foxman told CNN on Monday night. ""Unfortunately, you know that it's part of the reality. (Some) people will act out their hatred in a violent manner.""","Chief of ADL says he's ""shocked, saddened but ... not surprised"" by the attack .

"At least 45 people were killed and 60 others wounded Sunday when a suicide bomber attacked a crowd watching a volleyball match in the Yahyakhil district of Afghanistan's southeastern Paktika province, according to a spokesman for the provincial governor. In 2010, a suicide car bomb exploded in the middle of a group of men playing volleyball, a popular sport in the region, in northwest Pakistan. That attack left 30 people dead and 52 wounded. Sunday's attack comes the same day the nation's parliament agreed to allow U.S. and NATO forces to remain in Afghanistan after 2014. It's unusual for an attack in Afghanistan to kill so many people. Only a few comparable incidents come up in the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database, which tracks acts of terror from 1970 to 2013. In October 2012, a suicide bomber dressed in a police uniform attacked a mosque in the city of Maymana in Faryab province, according to the database. At least 42 people, including 19 members of the Afghan security forces, were killed and another 50 people injured in that blast. No group claimed responsibility for the incident, but sources attributed it to the Taliban. In April 2013, nine attackers dressed as soldiers killed 53 people at a courthouse complex where several Taliban members were standing trial in the city of Farah. At least one suicide bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the entrance to the complex, while the other attackers entered other buildings and began shooting and throwing grenades. About 93 additional people were wounded. All of the attackers died, Global Terrorism Database reports. The Taliban said it was behind the carnage.","Suicide bomber sets off explosives at a volleyball match, killing at least 45 people .

"(CNN) -- Even back in the days when you could still use the term ""peace process"" with a straight face, the odds of solving the Jerusalem issue were already pretty long. Then, I would have put those odds a bit north of impossible and a little south of hopeless. Things are even worse now. I remember day eight of the Camp David summit in July 2000, when discussion turned to Jerusalem. That day, it was clear to me that as far Camp David was concerned, it was game over. There were some intriguing moves on Israel's part, but nothing that could have settled the issue. Indeed, Ehud Barak, Yasser Arafat and Bill Clinton could have fallen into the yawning gaps that separated Israelis and Palestinians on this issue and never have been heard from again. Fast forward a decade and a half, and not much has changed. Jerusalem is still insoluble and it now seems more explosive then ever. So what is it about Jerusalem/Yerushalayim/al-Quds that makes it so potentially contentious and deadly? Three things stand out: . It's a perfect storm of complexity. Jerusalem is a microcosm of almost all the issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict packed into one small place that is marked by a big history. It combines territory (who will control land in the east and west, not to mention the four quarters -- Jewish, Muslim, Armenian, Christian -- of the old city). It involves political identity (conflicting claims to the city as a capital); it is driven by religion (see below) involving not just Jews, Muslims and Christians in the Middle East, but globally, too; and as the last few months suggest, it is also a matter of security fraught and framed now by an intimacy of killing reflected in the slayings of Israeli and Palestinian teens this past summer and last week's savage Palestinian attack on a synagogue in west Jerusalem. Proximity can be deadly. Ben Franklin quipped that proximity breeds children, and contempt, too. In this regard, Jerusalem is unique in that it is one of the only places where Israelis and Palestinians (the vast majority who aren't Arab citizens of Israel) mix every day and have almost unrestricted access to one another. It is a stunning testament to the pragmatism and self-interest of Israelis and Palestinians -- as well as the imbalance of power -- that the city has remained as quiet and functional as it has these many years given such passions and politics. But it should be no surprise that given those politics and passions that Jerusalem has often become a bloody flash point, often but not always a result of the perception among Palestinians that Israel is trying to change the status of some aspect of Jerusalem. The reason for this latest round of tensions, violence and bloodletting is a perfect storm of factors that include the sense of isolation and frustration on the part of the Palestinians of East Jerusalem who don't have the benefit of the social services and economic advantages of Israelis in the west; Israel's effort to expand their communities and presence in East Jerusalem; Hamas' efforts to incite and fan the flames; and the grim realization that the future seems almost certain to be more of the same. With the Israel-Gaza war over until the next round, and the West Bank relatively quiet, it's Jerusalem that has emerged as the epicenter of unrest. Overlapping sacred space. Things in Jerusalem would be bad enough if the perfect storm were driven only by proximity as well as nationalist and political conflict. But that was not to be. Jerusalem is above all a matter of faith, of belief and of religion. The notion that the three Abrahamic faiths -- Islam, Christianity and Judaism -- share common values concerning peace, social justice and humanity may well be true. But that has never been the case when it comes to this city. History is filled with claims, conquests, crusades, occupations, massacres and violence in the name of possessing Jerusalem, not sharing it. And nowhere has the religious complexity of the Jerusalem issue been clearer than on the question of who controls and what will happen to the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Enclosure) and Har Habayit (Temple Mount). That platform, situated within the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, is in essence a physical manifestation of overlapping sacred space. Atop sits the goldened Dome of the Rock, a seventh century Islamic shrine built by the Caliph Abd al-Malik that houses the foundation stone, a massive rock that figures prominently in Jewish and Islamic tradition. And nearby there's a site of even greater significance -- the al-Aqsa mosque started by Caliph Abd al-Malik in the seventh century. According to the Quran, it is reputed to be the ascension point where the Prophet Mohammed rose to heaven on his Night Journey. Below the platform are the remains of both Jewish temples, which housed the Ark of the Covenant and the Holy of Holies. The area is so sensitive to Jews that they were enjoined not to set foot on the Mount out of fear that they could be treading on that sacred ground. It is quite extraordinary that despite incidents of violence -- October 1990, September 1996, September 2000 and of course what's transpired in recent weeks -- that the area has not been a scene of continuous struggle. Part of the answer may lie in the fact that the Israeli government has been the single greatest factor in preventing Jewish prayer there and in trying to preserve the status quo. And if there's any hope of avoiding a catastrophe, it will depend on a continued effort by the government to make clear that it won't tolerate an effort by its own ministers, members of the parliament, and a variety of hard-line groups to do precisely that. That, combined with efforts by the Palestinian Authority to cool its own rhetoric and avoid anything that could be interpreted as inciting to violence, will help minimize the chances of a blowup and buy time and space. But buy time and space for what? Is there a solution? Keep in mind that the sacred space issue is only one dimension of the Jerusalem problem. You also have the challenge of what to do with the Old City, how to deal with the problem of a city that will be the capitals of two states, and the more mundane but still contentious issues of how to run a city as special and complex as this one. In July 2000, at the Camp David summit, we didn't come close to resolving any of these issues. On the sacred space issue we tried creative ideas, including sovereignty above ground for the Palestinians and below for the Israelis and (my favorite) taking sovereignty away from both and placing it with God. No deal, even though we were dealing with Israelis (Barak) and Palestinians (Arafat) who were far more willing and able to do something if the terms were right. Those are not the leaders we have today. There were nights in Jerusalem after the negotiations had ended that I'd sit with my friend Gamal Helal, adviser and Arabic interpreter to half a dozen presidents. We'd look at the walls of Jerusalem and wonder about what the Muslim leader Saladin and the Christian crusader Richard the Lionheart would have made of American efforts. Not much, we concluded sadly. But we knew what they must have sensed, too. History teaches that Jerusalem isn't to be shared. Jerusalem is to be possessed and contested in the name of the tribe, the nation -- and above all in the name of God. And whether that past will remain prologue remains to be seen.","Aaron David Miller: Jerusalem is a perfect storm of complexity .

"(CNN)With tensions simmering over the deadly crisis in Ukraine, Russia has accused the West of seeking regime change in Moscow, prompting renewed comparisons with the Cold War era. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov of Russia made the comments at an event Saturday as he attacked Western sanctions on Russian interests. ""As for the concept behind the use of coercive measures, the West is making it clear it does not want to try to change the policy of the Russian Federation ... they want to change the regime -- practically no one denies this,"" Lavrov said at a meeting of a foreign and domestic policy council in Moscow. His words reflect the deterioration of his government's relations with the United States and many European nations over the conflict in Ukraine. Western powers accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment to help separatists in eastern Ukraine in their fight against Ukrainian government forces. Moscow has voiced moral support for the rebels and sent aid convoys into the region, but it has repeatedly denied military involvement. 'A new low in relations' To pressure Russia over the situation Ukraine, the United States and Europe have imposed sanctions targeting Russian citizens, officials and industries. Lavrov's comments Saturday represent ""a new low in relations,"" according to Russia expert Ben Judah. ""Not since 1984 has a Russian foreign minister described ties with the West and its plans for ""regime change"" in such dark terms,"" Judah, the author of a book on Russia under President Vladimir Putin, wrote on Twitter. Putin has been in power in Russia, as either prime minister or president, for the past 15 years. Lavrov's words appear to follow on from comments by Putin earlier in the week that the West, in particular the United States, still strives to ""subjugate"" Russia. Biden slams 'Russian aggression' Western officials, meanwhile, have kept up criticism of Russia's interference in Ukraine. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who was visiting Kiev on Friday, said he discussed ""the threat to Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity posed by Russian aggression"" in his conversations with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. ""Russian behavior represents a flagrant violation of the bedrock principles of our international system,"" Biden said. Tensions were also apparent at the G20 summit in Australia last weekend, where several Western leaders had strong words for Putin. As well as the conflict in eastern Ukraine -- which has killed more than 4,000 people since April, according to the United Nations -- Russia and the West are also in dispute over Moscow's seizure of the Crimea Peninsula from Ukraine. Biden made clear Friday that the Crimea takeover remains a thorn in U.S. relations with Russia. ""Let me say as clearly and categorically as I can, America does not and will not recognize Russian occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea,"" Biden said. ""We do not, will not, and insist others do not accept this illegal annexation."" Why Putin still thinks its 1985 .

"President Obama has traded GOP rancor and late-fall temperatures in Washington for a golf outing with Derek Jeter at the nicest golf resort in Las Vegas. Obama, the retired New York Yankees shortstop and two Las Vegas businessmen were playing golf at Shadow Creek, which describes itself as a ""masterpiece"" course ""sculpted from the Nevada desert by renowned architect Tom Fazio."" ""Once the domain of only a privileged few, the natural splendor of this monument to the imagination and classic golf course design stands today ready to be shared,"" the website says. Obama is spending the weekend near Las Vegas after delivering a speech at a school here on Friday. He returned to Del Sol High School, where in 2013 he called on Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The speech was Obama's only public event scheduled for his weekend in the Nevada desert; but the mid-60s forecast and the area's preponderance of golf resorts left little question what the president would occupy himself with over the two days. Aides have maintained that Obama's vacations aren't truly respites from work -- he brings along staff and communications equipment that ensures his job is never far away.","President and retired Yankees shortstop play in foursome at lush Shadow Creek .

"Shrimp crawling around rock chimneys spewing hot water deep in the Caribbean Sea may hold clues to the kinds of life that can thrive in extreme environments on other planets, NASA says. The shrimp are called Rimicaris hybisae (no, we can't pronounce it either). They live in clumps on hydrothermal vents 7,500 feet underwater, where temperatures reach 750 degrees Fahrenheit and it's very, very dark. The water near the vents is cool enough for the shrimp to live in. The very hot water spewing from the vents is where their dinner is cooked. The shrimp dine on carbohydrates produced by bacteria living inside the vents. So what does that have to with space aliens? If these bacteria can survive in these extreme conditions of Earth, maybe it can happen on other worlds, such as Jupiter's icy moon Europa, which has a subsurface ocean. ""For two-thirds of the Earth's history, life has existed only as microbial life,"" said Max Coleman, senior research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ""On Europa, the best chance for life would be microbial."" ""Whether an animal like this could exist on Europa heavily depends on the actual amount of energy that's released there, through hydrothermal vents,"" said Emma Versteegh, a postdoctoral fellow at JPL. The elusive Black Seadevil is finally ready for its closeup . So the shrimp eat stuff cranked out by the bacteria -- but what do the bacteria eat? Scientist say they get their energy by using chemical reactions; since hydrogen sulfide is abundant in the vents, they use it to make organic matter. What happens to the shrimp when they can't find any bacteria to produce carbs for them? They turn into carnivores, maybe even cannibals. Researchers say they found bits of crustaceans in the shrimps' guts and guess which crustacean is in big supply in the area? Rimicaris hybisae. .","Shrimp dine on carbohydrates produced by bacteria living inside underwater volcanic vents .

"(CNN) -- If you're among the companies vying for one of the nearly 2,000 new generic top-level domains, or gTLDs, you've got big pockets. The application alone costs about $185,000. But if you're just an average Joe building your own website or blog, there are much cheaper options out there. One of the most popular is .tk. It's a country code top-level domain, similar to .ca for Canada or .fr for France. But .tk stands for a country you've probably never heard of. It's called Tokelau. Places don''t get much more remote than Tokelau. It would make a great backdrop for a desert-island television series. The only problem would be getting the crew there. What appears on a map as three tiny pinpoints in the midst of the Pacific Ocean are the country's tiny atolls, bringing the total size of Tokelau to a whopping 4 square miles. If you want to get there, you will start in Los Angeles and fly to Hawaii. From Hawaii, you'll fly to American Samoa. From American Samoa, you'll take a small plane to Samoa, where you might wait two weeks for a boat. The boat ride is 48 hours, and there's no cabin, so you'll sleep on the deck. The boat will get you close to Tokelau, but the sea is too rough and the coral too dangerous to approach, so you'll hop in a canoe and paddle to shore. Now, you're ready to start your island holiday. Tokelau is home to only about 1,300 people. But a recent report (PDF) released by Verisign, the global registry operator for .com and .net, found that .tk is the third-most popular country code top-level domain (or ccTLD) behind only Germany (.de) and the United Kingdom (.uk). It's all thanks to a man who literally lives on the other side of the planet from Tokelau: Joost Zuurbier of Amsterdam. Around 2000, Zuurbier says, he and a friend looked at Hotmail as inspiration for a business model of their own. If Hotmail could make money providing free e-mail, couldn't money be made offering free domains? ""At that moment, there were no free domain names yet,"" Zuurbier said. ""So we were shopping around for a registry that wanted to play along, and in the end, we founded .tk, which didn't exist at the time."" Zuurbier says it wasn't easy. The Tokelauans were not only unaware of their entitlement to their own country code domain, no one on the island had ever seen a webpage before. ""We had to explain to them what they had and what the Internet was in order to get things going,"" Zuurbier said. There was also another small problem. ICANN, the group responsible for doling out ccTLDs, didn't believe that Tokelau really existed. Luckily for Zuurbier, an ICANN board member informed the rest of the group that he had installed the island's first shortwave radio equipment there in the late 1970s. So the two sides agreed to the deal. After some handshakes in New Zealand, Zuurbier took the long, faithful journey to Tokelau with satellite equipment in tow. It took more than two weeks to get there, and he had to keep the equipment dry. Otherwise he risked having to repeat the long, expensive and exhausting journey. After six years of hurdles and complicated setup, Freedom Registry launched its .tk domain in 2006. Now, more than 9 million websites have .tk domains, and Zuurbier says there's been a recent explosion of popularity, with about a million added each month. ""We have never seen such enormous growth,"" Zuurbier said. ""The growth is coming especially from emerging economies like China, Brazil, Russia, Peru, Vietnam. These countries also have local ccTLD's like .pe or .vn or .cn, but these are very hard to register for the local communities there, so they go to .tk."" Freedom Registry makes money through ads on expired domains. Zuurbier says registration and renewal are free for users, but when they abandon the site or don't meet the minimum requirements of 25 unique visitors every 90 days, the domain gets ""parked."" That means the URL still exists, but the content is replaced with ads tailored to the original site. ""If your website was about your trip to Mexico, we have spiders that go through all of the live websites, and the moment the live website expires, we take the domain name back,"" Zuurbier said. ""We then put ads on there that are relevant to the content that was there before. In this case, your trip to Mexico."" Freedom Registry gives a cut of the money it earns to the people of Tokelau. In fact, one-sixth of their economy comes from the sale of .tk domains. Tokelau, however, has the smallest GDP in the world: about $1.2 million a year. Through Freedom Registry, Zuurbier didn't just bring hard cash to the people of Tokelau, he brought connectivity. ""They had four phone lines, and that was basically it,"" he said. ""They had dial-up, but there was such a slow bandwidth, they could only use it for e-mails without any attachments. If there was any attachment, they had to actually make a call to New Zealand to remove the attachment, because otherwise, the e-mail wouldn't get through."" Besides the annual license fees, Freedom Registry provides Internet service to Tokelau with that satellite equipment Zuurbier brought with him. He says it costs about $2,000 a month for the same connection that would cost about $10 in the U.S. ""We brought them the connectivity, and now there are 120 computers on the island, mostly laptops, because the power goes off at 10 p.m.,"" he said. Though it still may be almost impossible to find, Tokelau's profile has been raised, thanks to Freedom Registry. And now with new investment in his company, Zuurbier hopes to do the same in Africa. He spoke from a train bound for Paris, where he was to meet with representatives of seven countries. Zuurbier won't say which ones, but he says that in the next two months, the first one will go live. That means that not only will there be a few new top-level domains, there will probably be more than a few people in those countries seeing a website for the first time.","Tokelau is only 4 square miles, but 9 million websites have the country's domain .

"Taipei (CNN)It's midnight in the capital of Taiwan. While some people are slowly walking home through the neon-lit streets, or getting ready to hit the club scene, others are on their way to a more unusual nocturnal hangout -- a bookstore. The Eslite store in central Taipei opens 24 hours and has more night owl visitors than most Western bookstores could dream of during their daytime hours. Here, young and old sit side-by-side on small steps or around reading tables, deeply engrossed in literary worlds. Others stand and some sit on the floor, all reading in hushed silence as soft classical music seeps out from the speakers. ""People in Taipei do many things by night,"" says Wan Hsuan Chang, a teacher who sits on a step in the middle of the store, skimming through the children's classic ""When Marnie Was There"" by Joan G Robinson. ""You can go to the night market, shopping or nightclubbing. I read,"" she adds, before telling me to keep my voice down. ""There are people trying to concentrate on their books here."" Trend dodger . The Eslite Group, that runs the five-story store, opened its first branch in Taipei in 1989. Today, 25 years on, the company runs 42 stores in Taiwan, one in Hong Kong and has ambitious plans to expand in China. The chain's rise comes at a time when bookstores in the United States and Europe are struggling to survive, with some forced to shut down due to growing pressure from online competitors like Amazon. In the United Kingdom, a third of all independent bookstores have closed down in the last decade, according to the Booksellers Association. And the last major book retailer in the U.S. --  Barnes & Noble --  is shutting stores as its management struggles to meet the challenges from its digital rivals. Eslite has hit upon a concept to dodge this trend -- making the store as much a place for books as it is for design, fashion and home styling, small cafes and restaurants. It reported revenue of around $425 million in 2013, with books accounting for some 40 percent of sales, according to company spokesman Timothy Wang. Sales are expected to increase by almost eight percent this year. Hipsters and bookworms . The mix of literature and design has made the store a hangout for hipsters as well as bookworms, allowing the company to shrug off the challenges of the digital age. ""It is our belief that the more digital the society (becomes), the more we treasure the warmth of the interconnection,"" Wang says. ""This core idea makes Eslite barely impacted by the changes of the industry."" In some stores, books and products are displayed next to each other at the same table. The 24-hour store at Dunhua Road has five floors, each dedicated to different categories, like fashion, music, food or events. The top floor is all books. Chia Hsiang and Huang Yu Han, two friends from Taipei, are typical customers. They sit in the bookstore café sipping hot chocolate and coffee and plan to spend the night gossiping. But why here and not just a bar or restaurant? ""It's a cool place, a bit like Soho in New York,"" Huang  says. ""Many cool people hang out here. Some come here to read, others just to kill time and meet friends. It's like a place for modern culture and it's close to some of the best nightclubs and bars."" Online, many reviewers say the bookstore is a great place to pick up girls or guys, although none of the people I spoke to confessed to that. Censorship? It has also become a magnet for tourists visiting the island, some from the mainland China in search for literature banned under the Communist Party's strict censorship. One of every four visitors to Taiwan visits an Eslite Bookstore, according to the firm. However, Eslite has come under fire over allegations of self-censorship as it gears up to tap the Chinese market. Earlier this year, the company reportedly stopped selling sensitive books about Tibet and human rights issues, possibly in an attempt to appease Chinese authorities becoming uncomfortable ahead of the planned new stores in Shanghai and Suzhou. The company denied the allegations and I found books by both Wang Lixiong and Tsering Woeser, the supposedly banned dissident writers. It's also not clear whether the company will be able to replicate its 24-hour model outside Taiwan where the bookstores have become a cultural phenomenon. The chain's Hong Kong store revised its round-the-clock schedule after a month-long trial, although it still opens until 11pm on weekdays and midnight on Friday and Saturday. Counter-intuitive? Eslite's success may seem counter-intuitive especially when it seems most late-night visitors treat it like a library, leaving empty handed after hours of free reading. Eslite's Timothy Wang claims that the business is successful because it creates ""a friendly environment"" and treats ""books as well as the visitors with great hospitality."" That's good news for Tom Chen, a 30-year-old police officer reading about global manufacturing trends on a recent Friday night. Going out to drink alcohol is too expensive, while reading books at the store is free, he explains. ""I love this place. I come here every weekend.""","Bookstore chain in Taiwan thrives while stores elsewhere fold .

"A Louisiana family is fighting to protect its beloved pit bull from a ""vicious dogs"" ordinance. Joanna Armand started an online petition to protect pit bull Zeus from an uncertain fate. The petition, which asks the village of Moreauville to reverse a ""vicious dog"" ban against pit bulls and rottweilers, has drawn nearly 40,000 signatures. Zeus is far from a vicious dog, Armand told CNN. He provides love and support for her children, especially daughter O'Hara, who suffers from severe neck problems and uses a Halo brace and a wheelchair. ""If anything ever happened to him, I would just shut down,"" O'Hara told KALB. Zeus acts as a sort of therapy dog for O'Hara, Armand told CNN. He sleeps by O'Hara's side every night; if O'Hara wakes up with seizures, he rouses her mother. The family has asked local officials to consider the special circumstances, only to be told there's nothing they can do, Armand told CNN. The village of Moreauville passed an ordinance in October banning pit bulls and rottweilers as of December 1. Owners of the animals received a letter saying that pets found within the corporate limits of Moreauville after that date will be ""impounded and transported to a veterinary clinic for further disposition,"" according to a letter posted on the family's Facebook page. The mayor and alderman of Moreauville did not respond to CNN's repeated requests for comment. Alderman Penn Lemoine told KALB that the ordinance was created to placate residents in the small village. ""We had several residents that were complaining about not being able to walk along the neighborhoods because these dogs were basically running along town,"" Lemoine said, according to KALB. Moreauville is not the first to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls, rottweilers or other so-called ""vicious dogs."" But the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends breed neutral laws ""that focus, not on breed, but on people's responsibility for their dogs' behavior, including measures that hold owners of all breeds accountable for properly housing, supervising and controlling their dogs."" The White House also signaled its opposition to breed-specific legislation in 2013, saying ""research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources."" Several states have passed legislation banning local governments from introducing breed-specific laws or ordinances. Besides, pit bulls are not a breed of dog. Several breeds of dogs, mainly the Bull Terrier, the Bull dog and the American Staffordshire Terrier are commonly referred to as ""pit bulls."" These dogs descended from an English bull-baiting dog bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head, according to the ASPCA. They were later bred with terriers to produce a more agile, athletic type dog. ""It is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding -- two dogs being mated without  regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring. The result of random breeding is a population of dogs with a wide range of behavioral predispositions. For this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog, no matter its breed, as an individual.""","Family starts petition asking village to reverse ban against pit bulls and rottweilers .

"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told residents in the Buffalo area to be ready to evacuate if they think floodwater caused by melting snow could reach their residences. ""It's not enough that your home has never flooded before,"" Cuomo said Sunday morning at a news conference. ""There's always a first time, and this may be the first time."" He said people living in places that might flood should have a bag packed and clean out valuables from their basements. He urged them not to wait until the last minute to leave. ""Please err on the side of caution,"" he said. Cuomo said dealing with flooding is worse than the snow. ""It's not water,"" he said Sunday. ""It's a toxic brew. It has sewage in it; it has runoff in it."" Warming temperatures forecast for Sunday will start to melt 7 feet of snow that fell last week. Rain will add to the menace. State officials aren't taking any chances. They've beefed up stockpiles of emergency supplies including generators and pumps and prepared nearly 180,000 sandbags. Swift-water rescue teams also are in place, along with helicopters, in case anyone gets caught in a deluge of runoff waters. The New York Fire Department sent about 40 members of its incident management team and about 500 National Guardsmen arrived the area. Temperatures should reach the high 40s on Sunday and go as high as 60 on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Freezing temperatures are not expected again until Tuesday night. The snow is melting fast in Depew, New York, said CNN iReporter Dawn Buck. A few days ago, it reached the railing of her backyard gazebo, she said, but on Sunday the snow was down to the floor. ""At least 3 feet of snow has melted so far,"" she said Sunday afternoon. There's also the threat of more structure collapses as all the rain saturates the snow on the tops of buildings, making the load even heavier. Several dozen roofs have already collapsed from just the weight of the snow, according to Erie County officials. Cuomo said structural engineers will examine schools and other government buildings that might be in danger of roof collapses. He said most state government offices will reopen Monday. 'City of Good Neighbors' One Buffalo man has a memorable souvenir of the storm. Anthony Marchioli was so bored he rented a small snow tractor to clear driveways on his street, CNN affiliate WKBW reported. On the way back from the rental business, he saw his wife standing in the street outside their house. She was pregnant and her water had unexpectedly broken, so Marchioli put her on the tractor and pushed through whiteout snow to Mercy Hospital, WKBW reported. Eleven hours later, the couple's third daughter was born. Her name: Loxley Storm Marchioli. Erica Bartoe, a CNN iReporter from Hamburg, New York, said that people had come to her town from other areas to help shovel snow and drop off donations. ""Buffalo is called the City of Good Neighbors for a reason,"" she said. ""There were people everywhere helping out."" Flooding threat extends to Tuesday . The area is under a flood warning. The National Weather Service says flood-prone areas will be inundated but warns there will be more widespread flooding, too. ""(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time,"" Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday. The risk of flooding extends into Tuesday. Commissioner Daniel Neaverth Jr. of the county Civil Defense/Disaster Preparedness Division told affiliate WGRZ that officials are ""hoping for best, but we're also preparing for the worst."" It's a notion the governor echoed. ""Hopefully, we need none of this, and hopefully this was just an elaborate exercise in logistics that we will have done and then we will deconstruct, and everything will go back and people will say, 'Boy, the governor really made us waste our time bringing everything out there just to bring it back,'"" Cuomo said Saturday. ""I hope that happens."" Cuomo also said individuals have a responsibility to help deal with the storm. He urged people to clean out storm drains in front of their houses ""so the water has some place to go."" A year's worth of snow in a week . The 86 inches that fell in some areas in three days last week is a typical year's worth of snow for Buffalo, according to the National Weather Service. The deadly storm claimed 13 lives -- many because of heart attacks while clearing snow. The death toll also includes one senior citizen who died of natural causes after or while being evacuated Thursday from a nursing home in Cheektowaga, officials said. The storm also forced the NFL to reschedule Sunday's football game between the Buffalo Bills and the New York Jets. Instead of being played in Buffalo, it's now scheduled for Monday in Detroit. For the Bills, even getting out of the Buffalo area had its complications. Before meeting at the stadium Friday morning to get on a bus to the airport, some of the players had to be picked up by snowmobile because of driving bans in certain areas, team spokesman Scott Berchtold said.","Buffalo man rented snow tractor, ended up taking pregnant wife to hospital .

"(CNN)The supermodel's new super yacht couldn't quite keep up with an established vessel in the annual Rolex Sydney-Hobart race. Comanche -- owned by Netscape co-founder Jim Clark and his wife, Australian model Kristy Hinze-Clark -- had to settle for second behind history maker Wild Oats XI in the 70th running of the 'Bluewater Classic.' Wild Oats XI became the first boat to achieve eight line honors, surpassing the seven line honors of Morna -- later called Kurrewa IV -- in the 1950s and 60s when it crossed the finish line in two days, two hours, three minutes and 26 seconds Sunday. Comanche had been closing the gap in the 628-nautical mile race but ultimately was 49 minutes slower than Wild Oats XI, which is owned by wine magnate Robert Oatley. ""To rewrite a bit of sailing history doesn't come along every day,"" Wild Oats XI's skipper, Mark Richards, was quoted as saying by the race's official website. ""To win a Hobart is a great honor but to win an eighth, I can't believe I am here. ""Comanche was unbelievably impressive down Sydney Harbour and the whole first night she had the legs on us. We thought, 'How are we going to handle this thing?' ""It was definitely our toughest race -- to have a boat so close for so much of the race, especially when she's faster than you. I said to the guys 'We've got to hang in there, hang tough, minimize our losses and wait for the first opportunity we get to attack.'"" That opportunity came in the Bass Strait. The lighter conditions suited Wild Oats XI, which opened up a big lead. ""We were about a quarter of the way into Bass Strait and expecting a westerly breeze, and all of a sudden Stan (navigator Stan Honey) came up from down below and said, 'I just got a new weather file, this is not looking good,'"" Comanche skipper Ken Read was quoted as saying by the race's official website. ""We were two miles ahead of them, in bumpy seas, and they literally went by us, probably going a knot or two faster at the time, and they just sailed into more pressure and just kept extending on the whole fleet. ""Both boats sailed a flawless race but they had their day. They had 12 hours where they had Wild Oats' weather, but that's racing."" While it wasn't known whether Comanche would return next year, Oatley said Wild Oats XI would be back. ""We will be back next year, yes, we'll definitely be back next year,"" Oatley was quoted as saying by the race's website. ""She is the best boat in the world. She's proved that.""","Wild Oats XI achieves a record eighth line honor in the annual Rolex Sydney-Hobart boat race .

"(CNN) -- On Sunday, ISIS released a new audio recording calling for Muslims to kill Americans and Europeans. In it, an ISIS spokesman states, ""If you can kill a disbelieving American or European, especially the spiteful and filthy French, or an Australian, or a Canadian or any other disbeliever, then rely upon Allah, and kill him in any manner or way however it may be."" Last week's federal indictment against Mufid Elfgeeh provides a reminder of the potential for acts of violence by Americans inspired by al Qaeda's ideology that the new recording by ISIS seeks to exploit. Elfgeeh, a 30-year-old American citizen of Yemeni heritage who owns a pizza parlor in Rochester, New York, is accused of attempting to provide support to ISIS and planning to attack American soldiers. In a new report which we helped co-author, the Bipartisan Policy Center's Homeland Security Project, a successor to the 9/11 Commission, assessed the current threat posed by such ""homegrown"" militants. Since 9/11, jihadist terrorists have killed 25 people in the United States. Each one of those deaths is a tragedy, but none of these attacks were national catastrophes as 9/11 was. While al Qaeda and its affiliates have failed to conduct any successful attacks in the United States since 9/11, they have sought to encourage action from militant American citizens, who might be more capable of carrying out terrorist operations in the States than foreign operatives given the stringent security measures now in place. Unfortunately, this strategy of promoting homegrown extremism has demonstrated some successes, such as Maj. Nidal Hasan's killing of 13 people at the Fort Hood, Texas, military base in 2009 and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings, which authorities have said were carried out by Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. All of these were inspired by the propaganda of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American cleric killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen after he took up an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. According to the New America Foundation's research, an astonishing quarter of the 247 jihadist extremists charged since 9/11 either possessed copies of al-Awlaki's propaganda materials, cited him as an influence or were in communication with him. The influence of al-Awlaki and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language magazine Inspire has persisted even after al-Awlaki's death. Worrisomely, around 100 Americans have traveled to fight in Syria with opposition groups, including with ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front. So far, nine Americans have been charged with attempting to support or supporting ISIS or Nusra, according to a count by New America. In addition, at least two Americans have died fighting with these groups: Moner Mohammad Abu-Salha, who committed a suicide bombing in Syria for Nusra Front, and Douglas McCain, who died fighting with ISIS. The difficulty al Qaeda and similar groups have had in inspiring Americans to conduct attacks at home is due to the strength of systemic security checks, such as the willingness of Muslim communities to report potential terrorist activity. A third of the extremists charged since 2001 were implicated by tips from family or local community members, according to an analysis by New America. Of the 51 plots to conduct an attack inside the United States since 9/11, nearly half were initiated while the suspects were under surveillance by informants, according to a count by New America. The role that the Muslim community has played as well as aggressive law enforcement efforts using informants have both helped to make the United States a hard target for militants. Add to these factors other measures taken since 9/11; the day that al Qaeda's hijackers attacked the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, there were only 16 people on the U.S. no-fly list. Today, there are more than 40,000. In 2001, there were 32 Joint Terrorism Task Force ""fusion centers,"" where multiple law enforcement agencies work together to chase down leads and build terrorism cases. Now there are 103. Before 9/11, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Counterterrorism Center, Transportation Security Administration, Northern Command and Cyber Command didn't exist. In 2014, all of these new institutions make it much harder for terrorists to operate in the United States. The U.S. intelligence budget also grew dramatically after 9/11, with Congress giving the government substantial resources with which to improve its counterterrorism capabilities. In 2013, the United States allocated $72 billion to intelligence collection and other covert activities. Before 9/11, the budget was around a third of that figure: $26 billion. In addition, greater public awareness of the danger posed by terrorism has also made the United States a much harder target. It was his fellow passengers who tackled Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the ""underwear bomber,"" on Christmas Day 2009 as he tried to detonate a bomb on Northwest Flight 253 as it flew over Detroit.","New report seeks to assess threat of terrorist attacks in the U.S.

"(CNN)  -- Roger Federer has been hit with a $1,500 fine for swearing at the umpire during his shock U.S. Open final defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro. Federer argues with umpire Jake Garner during his five-set defeat to Del Potro. The world number one became embroiled in an argument with Jake Garner at the end of the second set after complaining Del Potro was taking too long to decide whether or not to make challenges. The Argentine successfully overturned an ""out"" call shortly before Federer's outburst, a point that led to him breaking serve and eventually taking the set. During the exchange Federer was picked up on microphones telling Garner: ""Don't tell me when to be quiet, okay? When I want to talk, I'll talk."" Del Potro went on to claim his first grand slam, ending Federer's five-year unbeaten run at Flushing Meadows and denying the Swiss maestro a 16th grand slam title. Federer's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to Serena Williams, who was docked $10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner Kim Clijsters. Williams reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault, and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official, who reported the exchange to umpire Louise Engzell. The resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to Clijsters. Williams later apologized for the incident. She was also fined $500 for racket abuse in the same encounter. Over $31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with Daniel Nestor, from Canada, forced to pay $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted. Vera Zvonareva of Russia and Austria's Daniel Koellerer were also fined $1,500 for audible obscenities. Federer will get an early chance to put his U.S. Open disappointment behind him when he plays for Switzerland  in a World Group playoff tie against Italy this weekend in Genoa.","Roger Federer fined $1,500 for his argument with umpire in U.S. Open final .

"The Democratic National Committee announced Monday that Columbus, Ohio, Philadelphia and New York are the finalists to host the 2016 presidential nominating convention. Phoenix, Arizona and Birmingham, Alabama did not make the latest cut. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz informed Democrats of the decision to winnow the list to these three cities in an email. In a press release, the committee said that several weeks are under consideration to hold the convention: July 18, July 25 and August 22. ""We're thrilled to move to the next step of the selection process to determine where Democrats will come together to nominate the 45th President of the United States,"" said Wasserman Schultz said in a statement. The DNC also noted that it would name the host city in the new year. In April, the DNC asked 15 cities to submit bids to host the convention, which is estimated to cost around $60 million. But the payout could be triple the investment or more. The Republican National Committee, in July, chose Cleveland, Ohio, to host its 2016 convention, which is likely to take place in late June or July.","The Democratic National Committee has narrowed its list of 2016 convention sites .

"It may not have the allure of Paris or New York but Dakar in Senegal is quickly making a name for itself as a force to be reckoned with in the fashion stakes. The 10th annual Dakar Fashion Week wrapped on Sunday, attracting an international audience to its showcase of African collections. A decade after Senegalese designer Adama Ndiaye launched the first show, Dakar has now earned itself the unique title of being the capital of Franco-African fashion. It's an important milestone for a country few would associate with high-end fashion. Fashion analyst Helen Jennings says this year's event, attended by the ""godfather of African fashion"" Alphadi, cemented Dakar's reputation. Jennings, the editor of Arise, a London-based African fashion magazine, pointed to the important differences between English and French-inspired fashion on the continent. ""Anglophone Africa is much more westernized on the whole and therefore gets more international attention. While Francophone designers, although still very contemporary, do veer toward more traditional styles, especially the Senegalese boubou and north African kaftan. ""It made for a refreshing change to see these influences on the catwalk."" However, she added that Dakar was by no means the capital of African fashion: ""Without a doubt those capitals are Nigeria (host of Arise Magazine Fashion week) and South Africa (which runs Africa Fashion Week)."" Watch: African street fashion . The African fashion industry's growth in recent years is part of a wider economic boom on the continent, says Jennings. ""Whereas previously Africa was only seen as a source of anthropological inspiration for international brands, now its homegrown talents are standing up and being counted too and riding the wave of interest in Africa's broader cultural and economic ascension,"" she said. ""Established names such as Duro Olowu in London, Xuly Bët in Paris, Kofi Ansah in Ghana, Jewel By Lisa in Lagos and Marianne Fassler in Johannesburg are inspiring younger talents while more and more African fashion weeks, magazines, websites, boutiques and schools are blossoming."" Web boutiques bring African fashion to global market . While the global economic downturn has hit Europe hard, African countries have remained fairly resilient since the 2008 financial crisis, according to a recent joint report from researchers McKinsey & Company and advertising agency TBWA. The report - The Changing Face of the African consumer - surveyed 15,000 people across 10 countries. It claims the growth of Africa's population, expansion of the middle class and rising optimism about the continent's future will play a crucial role in the development of its retail industry. ""Africa's economic growth is creating substantial new business opportunities that are often overlooked by global companies,"" it said. The boom is good news for Dakar Fashion Week founder Ndiaye, who hopes the show will one day reach the heights of Paris and New York -- yet with a distinctly African style. Watch: Traditional dress of Senegal . Bright colors, bold traditional African prints and a touch of old Hollywood glamor dominated the catwalks throughout the week, held from June 12 to 17. Designers hailed from across the continent, such as Lebanese-Ivorian Elien Kuame, whose elegant cocktail dresses blended both western and African traditional styles.Senegalese designer Maguette Gueye utilized traditional African prints, while compatriot Mamta Lopy concentrated on a more sultry, western style.","Dakar's annual fashion week carving name as international draw .

"(CNN) -- Is there a new President Obama? Since the devastating defeat of his party in the midterm elections, Obama has seemed to be more determined than ever to move forward with his unfulfilled goals. Within a week, the President announced that the United States and China had agreed to a historic climate change treaty. He made it relatively clear that if the Senate passed the bill authorizing him to make a decision on the Keystone pipeline, he would veto it. He won't have to make the decision, for now, since the Senate voted it down. Then, the President announced he would use his executive power to provide protection to 4-5 million undocumented immigrants. All this offered hope to Democrats who had become disillusioned with Obama for seeming too eager to seek compromise with a Republican Party they feel is hell-bent on obstruction. For too long, many of Obama's supporters believe, he has pushed aside the big issues and adhered to a pragmatic centrism that has damaged his presidency and White House, as well as his party. Now, President Obama has one last chance to get it right. This would not be the first time a president remade himself as the clock ran down on his time in Washington. In his final year, Ronald Reagan transformed himself from being the most hawkish of the Cold War Republicans into the person who brokered a major arms agreement with the Soviet Union. Can President Obama transform his presidency at this stage? The opportunity is before him. On immigration, the executive order will go a long way to meeting some of the pent-up demand from activists who have been advocating that Washington do something about the uncertainty that so many immigrants and their families have been facing for years. While the order will surely incite anti-immigration hard-liners, this will simultaneously energize the immigration rights community and mark a clear commitment from this president toward their plight. It could become the first step toward a more rational, efficient and humane policy toward the millions living without full rights within our borders. Climate change is an issue that President Obama has always cared about very much, but something that he has not felt he had the political strength to make progress on. But now, even without congressional support, he is using the power that he does have to try to move this front and center. The treaty with China would mark a huge breakthrough in the effort to diminish use of fossil fuels. If he makes a firm decision that he will not authorize the Keystone pipeline, that, too, would be an action that means a great deal to environmental activists who have been fighting the project for years. Even with a Republican Congress that just says no, President Obama can use the power of the bully pulpit in the coming years to push back against the conservative rhetoric that has emerged against the science of climate change. Of course, all this is just a start. It will take much more to provide evidence that Obama is serious about remaking his presidency. Too often the President has talked a big game but then backed down in the face of political pressure. In the coming year, he will have to fight for the middle class, taking seriously the kinds of arguments that have been put forth by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts. He can focus on increasing support for public universities and pushing for higher infrastructure funding. He will have to take a stronger stand to protect the right of workers to organize. As Warren has argued, ""Unions have been critical to building a strong middle class in America."" He needs to deal with issues like campaign and lobbying reform, which are the only ways to weaken the disproportionate influence of wealthier Americans on political decision making. Though the administration has continually boasted about the economic recovery, he has to do more to respond to the underlying economic anxiety in the electorate as too many Americans struggle with low wage and insecure jobs. Next summer, the President will also have the opportunity to make good on some of his promises from 2008, when he attacked President Bush's approach to counterterrorism. Until now most of the homeland security program has remained intact and the President has not done much to restore the balance between security and civil liberties. The lame duck Congress failed to pass a big reform. Next summer when Section 215 of the Patriot Act expires, there will be another chance for change. There have been members of both parties calling on Obama to institute reforms that will curtail the levels of surveillance that are permissible. Most important would be to end the bulk collection of phone records and allow for more transparency in what the government forces telecommunications providers to give them. President Obama should come down of the side of reform if he wants to show he is serious. To re-energize his supporters, he would need to continue to accelerate the transfer of prisoners from Guantanamo to make progress on the unfulfilled promise of his campaign to shut down this facility. Will we have a new President Obama, someone willing to use all his political power to achieve progress on so many of the promises that have been left behind? Right now a definitive verdict is out. But the President has shown some signs that he is now responding to critics who argue that he must be true to the values of his party and more willing to take a strong, even if controversial stand, for the policies that he once promised would define his presidency.","Julian Zelizer: Since midterms, President Obama has moved to fulfill some long-held goals .

"A mob, wielding baseball bats, broken bottles and knives, swarms a Paris synagogue. Violence erupts at a pro-Israel rally in Los Angeles after a demonstrator reportedly stomps on a Palestinian flag. Phone calls and text messages threaten a Palestinian-American who organized a protest in Atlanta. A trending Twitter hashtag says Hitler was right. As missiles and rockets fly in the Middle East, tensions are boiling over around the world between activists at demonstrations on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Plenty of protests have been peaceful, but not all of them. On Monday, the Anti-Defamation League warned Jewish institutions to step up security in light of violence and anti-Semitic expressions at what it described as anti-Israel rallies across the United States and around the world. An ADL website tracking recent protests listed events in New York; Washington; Dallas; Portland; and Tempe, Arizona. ""The tenor at some of the anti-Israel rallies has been extreme,"" the ADL said, ""with protesters chanting 'Death to Israel' and other hateful messages and slogans."" In France, where anti-Semitism has flared up in recent years, some warn that hostilities have entered a different realm. ""The level of danger is very new,"" said Serge Benhaim, who was trapped for hours inside a Paris synagogue on Sunday. ""Today and tomorrow for the Jewish people in France is fully different from what it was yesterday."" In the United States, too, Aysha Abdullatif says she's sensed something is changing. After organizing a pro-Palestinian protest in Atlanta this month, Abdullatif said she started getting threatening phone calls, text messages and social media posts accusing her of supporting terrorism. It's the first time she's felt personally targeted after years of activism. ""People are getting really fanatical. ... I've never seen it get this ugly,"" Abdullatif said. How did this happen? Iraq, Syria, Gaza and Libya all in flames . 'It looked like a war' A 17-year-old Jewish girl reported that she was grabbed by the jaw and pepper-sprayed in the face on a Paris street the day Israel launched its latest operation in Gaza. She told police her attacker called her a ""Dirty Jew,"" and said, ""Insha'Allah, you will die,"" according to the National Bureau of Vigilance against Anti-Semitism, a French watchdog organization. A local chapter of the Jewish Defense League, a far-right Jewish group, bragged on social media the next day about fighting with anti-Israel demonstrators. ""We were 30 facing 200 supporters of Hamas. And yet all will remember our visit ... especially the 6 wounded on their side,"" the group posted on Twitter. A French watchdog organization, meantime, has since reported telephone death threats against Jewish merchants. Synagogue-goers in the Belleville neighborhood of Paris were recently greeted by demonstrators who screamed ""Death to the Jews,"" and a firebomb was tossed at the entrance of another synagogue in the northeastern suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois, the National Bureau of Vigilance against Anti-Semitism reported. And then, on Sunday evening, a perfect storm brewed. Just as a community gathered in Paris' Don Isaac Abravanel Synagogue to pray for peace, thousands of demonstrators marching in support of Palestinians finished up nearby, Benhaim, the synagogue's president, said. A fraction of those demonstrators broke off with other plans. Aline Le Bail-Kremer, 36, lives across the street from the synagogue and said she saw -- and heard -- them coming. ""From my windows, I saw two groups (around 100 persons), from the two sides of the street, converging [at] the synagogue,"" she wrote in an e-mail to CNN late Monday. They carried baseball bats, she said. They threw chairs and tables, taken from nearby cafes, and headed toward the entrance gate. And then, she said she heard them scream, ""Death to the Jews."" From inside, where he'd gathered with about 400 others, Benhaim said he saw men outside brandishing broken bottles and knives. The synagogue president, who CNN spoke to Monday night, also said he heard cries of ""Jews to the oven"" and ""Allahu akbar!"" A small band of security guards managed to block entry, Benhaim said. Young Jews, some affiliated with the Jewish Defense League, also stepped into the fray -- spewing their own vitriol, Le Bail-Kremer said. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency, a wire service for global Jewish news, reported that ""at least three Jews were taken to the hospital as a result of the clashes."" This chaos went on for about 40 minutes, Le Bail-Kremer said, before police arrived in droves. ""The scene was very violent, with terrifying and anti-Semitic slogans,"" said Le Bail-Kremer, who happens to be involved with SOS Racisme, a French anti-racism organization. ""I was very, very anxious and shocked. It looked like a war."" Trying to 'turn the other cheek' As she stepped forward to make closing remarks at a pro-Gaza demonstration she organized over the weekend in Atlanta, Abdullatif said she saw the crowd turn the other way. Across the street, she said, there were two men with Israeli flags who discharged pepper spray toward the crowd. ""I kept telling everybody, just keep your backs facing them, don't give them any attention,"" said Abdullatif, a Palestinian-American who helped found the Atlanta-based Movement to End Israeli Apartheid-Georgia. But on the fringes of the crowd, she said, pro-Palestinian demonstrators started shouting back. ""I said, 'Stop talking to them. This is only fueling a lot of this. Ignore them. Turn the other cheek,' "" she said. ""But easier said than done."" Eventually, things simmered down, but hours after the protest, Abdullatif said her phone rang with a surprising message. A man on the other end, she said, threatened to report her to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, accusing her of aiding terrorism. He said he was happy about recent bombings in Gaza, ""that everybody deserves to be killed, and that I should be careful, my name is out there,"" Abdullatif said. Abdullatif told him that she did nothing wrong. But she said the conversation, which was followed by days of text messages and Facebook posts in the same vein, rattled her. ""I've never seen an opposing side go to that extreme,"" she said. What if they found where she lived or targeted her family? ""My biggest concern is if we have another demonstration, I don't want anything like this to happen,"" Abdullatif said. ""This is the exact stuff we're protesting against. I don't want to be connected to people fighting people over anything."" But that doesn't mean she'll stop speaking out. She sent photos of the weekend protest to her uncle in Gaza City, whose neighborhood was recently destroyed in a bombing. She hopes the photos will let him know that the world is watching. ""It's just such a sad situation. It's 2014. We should have figured out by now that barbaric acts of violence don't accomplish anything from any side of it,"" she said. ""We live in a modern society. We know that this is never a way to create a solution."" 'I saw my flag on the ground' On Sunday, a peaceful pro-Israel rally in Los Angeles turned ugly after demonstrators came face-to-face with counterprotesters in a pickup who were waving Palestinian flags. What exactly happened, however, depends on who you ask. Four people were arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, accused of driving up to the protest in a truck and hitting pro-Israel demonstrators with handheld flagpoles, CNN affiliate KTLA reported, citing police. This, however, came after a demonstrator reportedly snatched one of the Palestinian flags from the truck and stomped on it. ""I saw my flag on the ground,"" Hany Reai, a Palestinian supporter, told CNN affiliate KCAL, ""and I saw a man step on it. I'm not here to fight. I just need my flag, and I ran to take it."" But one witness told the Los Angeles Times the clashes were deliberately provoked by the men in the truck with Palestinian flags. ""They were looking for a fight,"" Judy Friedman told the newspaper. They were ""taunting and threatening"" people, thrusting their sticks toward demonstrators on the sidewalk. A video purportedly recorded by a student at the protest and published on the website of the Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles shows insults flying in both directions. The Federal Protective Service called for an ambulance to treat a woman allegedly hurt by the men, who were later picked up and booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. They've since been released on bail, deny the charges and say they were ""falsely arrested,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. And as if this ruckus wasn't already heated enough, as the pickup drove off, an officer with FPS -- who was trying to stop the men from leaving -- fired his weapon. No one was hurt. That officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated, officials said. From clicks to clashes . As the rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes show no signs of slowing, hostilities are flaring online as much as they are in the streets. Over the weekend, #HitlerWasRight trended on Twitter, part of what the ADL described as an ""online outpouring of anti-Semitism."" The group said Wednesday that a surge in Hitler-related hashtags might be fueling hatred at rallies as well. Anti-Arab statements have also run rampant online. A now-discontinued Facebook page called ""The People of Israel Demand Vengance,"" racked up thousands of likes earlier this month, the Times of Israel reported. On the page, according to the newspaper, users posted photos with captions like ""death to the whole Arab nation"" and ""Hating Arabs is not racism; it's morality.""","While missiles fly in Mideast, tensions soar outside the region .

"A Democratic group says it will file a formal complaint with federal regulators against three Republican organizations after a CNN investigation revealed that they shared internal polling data before the midterm elections by posting the information on anonymous Twitter accounts. The liberal advocacy group American Democracy Legal Fund alleged in a complaint meant to be filed Monday to the Federal Election Commission that the National Republican Congressional Committee, the American Action Network and American Crossroads broke federal rules that prohibit coordination between campaign committees and outside groups. ""The NRCC and outside groups appear to have engaged in illegal coordination through sharing internal polling data,"" according to the complaint, which was provided to CNN by American Democracy Legal Fund. ""By hiding their communications on a public website, Respondents intentionally tried to create a loophole in the coordination rules. Such an intentional effort to knowingly flout campaign finance laws cannot be condoned."" The complaint is based on a CNN report that detailed how the groups provided valuable polling data by posting it on Twitter accounts in a secret code. Even though the posts were gibberish without the code, posting the information on a public website could have provided a work-around to FEC anti-coordination rules and regulations that require outside polling data shared with campaign committees to be reported as a donation. Coordination could allow campaigns, which cannot accept unlimited donations, to unfairly use the resources of outside groups, which can accept unlimited and anonymous donations. But the American Democracy Legal Defense Funda complaint argues that since the Twitter accounts could only be found and understood by those with prior knowledge of their existence, the activities don't meet the threshold of being considered ""public."" Further, according to the complaint, allowing the tactic would ""send a dangerous message to candidates"" that they can skirt election rules by encrypting the information shared. ""If the Commission were to find that Respondents did not engage in illegal coordination, then it would be sending the dangerous message to candidates, party committees, and outside organizations that they can coordinate their efforts so long as they nest their communications—no matter how cryptic or hidden—in a publicly available forum,"" the complaint reads. ""This is the wrong outcome."" Spokespeople for the NRCC, American Action Network and American Crossroads did not respond to a request for comment. Republicans aren't the only ones using Twitter to communicate between groups that technically shouldn't be coordinating. Last week the Huffington Post revealed that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had used a Twitter account to aggregate details about where they would place ad buys. The Democratic account differed from the Republican ones in that it clearly labeled the intent of the profile and provided the code for how to decipher the tweets. A DCCC spokesman confirmed that they had used the account during the 2012 election, but that the information posted was already publicly available anyway. Republicans used at least two Twitter accounts to transmit polling data. One account used the name Bruno Gianelli, a character from the TV show The West Wing who advocated the use of soft money to influence elections. Campaign finance law experts told CNN that even the posts disguised with a secret code could be legal because of the public nature of the communications. ""It may bend common sense, but not necessarily the law,"" said Daniel Tokaji, a professor of Constitutional Law at Ohio State University, told CNN. ""A lot of things you and I would consider coordination are not coordination under the law. I don't think sharing polling data is going to be enough to establish that the campaign was materially involved in decisions about content, target audience or timing."" It is unclear whether the FEC, which will hold a hearing to determine whether to issue new campaign finance rules in February, will respond to the complaint. Officials from the commission said they could not comment on specific cases, but one commissioner told CNN that past lack of action from the agency has emboldened groups to stretch the boundaries of the law. ""The reality is I think there are a lot of people out there who have a fair degree of confidence that there isn't going to be any serious enforcement at the FEC so they can pretty much get away with whatever they want,"" FEC Commissioner Ellen Weintraub told CNN. ""It's a very sad state of affairs.""","A Democratic group filed a complaint against the GOP for using Twitter to secretly communicate .

"The sights at the Gaza zoo couldn't be sadder. In a tiny cage, a baboon sits, picking seeds off the floor, desperately eating whatever he can find. Next to the baboon, the carcass of his mate and five offspring lay in the pen, decomposing in the August heat. ""Eight to 10 monkeys were killed,"" says Abu Sameer, the zoo's chief veterinarian. ""Also a peacock, a gazelle, a lion, and a fox."" The carcasses of dead animals, mostly monkeys, lay scattered across the scorched grass between the pens. In one of the cages, a dead peacock lays in front of two hungry lions. In another, a crocodile lounges in the hot sun; there is almost no water in the enclosure, which also holds a pelican and a duck. The zoo, part of the Al-Bisan recreational park in Jabalya, northern Gaza, was hit multiple times during the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas militants. Many of the animals seem weak and traumatized. Staff members say that on top of the injuries some of the animals sustained during the violence, many also have not eaten in days because the zoo lacks funds to buy food, and they're getting virtually no assistance. ""The situation is very bad,"" said Sameer. ""We can't get the animals out to clean the cages. Many of them are getting sick because they are weak and it is dirty. But we don't have any alternative places."" The situation is most dire for the lions, according to Sameer. One was killed during the conflict and three remain in the zoo. Sameer says he does not have the funds to buy them the meat they need. ""They have not eaten for 10 to 15 days,"" he said. ""We could not reach them during the fighting. When it got calmer at least we could bring them some water."" To help, at least a little, the CNN crew bought six chickens at the local market for the zoo's staff to feed to the lions. It was clear to see how hungry the lions were. They ran toward the edge of the cage and began roaring the moment they saw us approaching with the dead chickens. Once we handed them over, they would take turns -- one lion would eat while the other kept an eye on us. When we got too close to the cage, the lions would charge and roar again, warning us to back off. Al-Bisan Park is run by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group that governs Gaza and is considered a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union and Israel. Built in 2008, it was supposed to be a tourist attraction for Gazans. It includes a soccer field, an amusement park with carousels, and several buildings, most of which were flattened by airstrikes during the recent conflict. An Israeli military spokesman told CNN that there is an investigation under way into allegations the zoo had been hit by airstrikes, and said he could not go into more detail due to legal reasons. But CNN understands from Israeli sources that the military believes there may have been a number of Hamas rocket launchers in the area of the zoo, and that the zoo might have suffered collateral damage in strikes targeting those rocket launchers. Hamas says the park is in a civilian area, but our crew did see several charred and mangled metal cases that looked like destroyed rocket batteries. The zoo staff says its main task for now is saving the lives of the animals. ""The first step has to be providing food,"" says vet Abu Sameer. ""Then we must rebuild the place and make it suitable for them to live in again."" But with more than 2,000 people killed and many homes destroyed in the recent fighting, most people in Gaza and the international community have more pressing problems than the plight of zoo animals. In the meantime, the lions, crocodiles, monkeys and birds who survived the hostilities at the zoo now face the danger of succumbing to hunger and disease in the aftermath of this man-made war.","Zoo in Gaza nearly destroyed during recent Israel-Hamas conflict .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of students walked out of their Oklahoma high school Monday to protest the school's response to the alleged bullying of three classmates who say they were raped by the same person. The students were greeted outside Norman High School by parents and other members of the community who had gathered to support them, junior Sophia Babb told CNN. Together, the crowd waved signs and chanted ""No justice, no class"" and ""No more bullying."" Their message to the world: it could be your daughter. The protest stemmed from allegations by three female Norman High School students who say classmates bullied them mercilessly after they were raped in separate instances by the same person. The teens and their families say school administrators failed to take adequate action after they reported the rapes and bullying. Their story spread across social media after Jezebel published a detailed account Friday. No one has been arrested or charged yet, Norman Police Department Captain Tom Easley told CNN. An investigation began a month ago, and no details will be released until it concludes. A Norman High School spokesperson had not returned CNN's request for comment by publication time. In a letter to the school community, Norman Public Schools Superintendent Joe Siano encouraged parents to talk to their children about alternatives to the walkout, such as wearing stickers and ribbons provided by the school ""in symbolic support."" He also said the school was enlarging a task force to study the implementation of a ""targeted, research-based sexual assault curriculum for students,"" and that the school will continue to respond quickly to reports of sexual assault and bullying. The three teens told Jezebel that they stopped attending classes and left school voluntarily after the teasing became unbearable. Friends of the teens started a Facebook page, YES ALL Daughters, two weeks ago to show support for them, Babb said. They were fed up with classmates blaming the teens for the attacks, she said. ""You could see it all over social media, the victim blaming,"" Babb said in a phone call after the protest. The page drew nearly 10,000 likes in two weeks. With the help of their mothers and relatives, they organized Monday's protest. ""After hearing the story we felt compelled to help the kids do something,"" said Stacie Wright, whose niece started the Facebook page. The group posted a long list of ""Protest Do(s) and Don't(s)"" on its Facebook page to make the event a peaceful one: DO Be Peaceful, Law-Abiding Citizens that do not disturb local businesses, DO Be a Good Neighbor; Do NOT Respond to any negativity, Do NOT Use profanity. The Daily Oklahoman reported the crowd of protesters Monday was in the hundreds. But organizers estimated that 1,500 attended the protest outside the school, which has an enrollment of about 1,800 students. ""It shows that students won't put up with this harassment and bullying,"" Babb said. ""We stand in solidarity with all victims and we want to show that we support them.""","Oklahoma teens walk out of class Monday to protest victim-blaming .

"(CNN) -- At the American Music Awards on Sunday, there was plenty of love for international artists. British boy band One Direction was a big winner at the 2014 ceremony, taking home both the artist of the year award and the trophy for favorite pop/rock band, duo or group. Australian rapper Iggy Azalea, who walked into the ceremony as the lead nominee with six nods, also won two awards on Sunday, including the favorite rap/hip-hop album honor. ""This award is the first award I've ever won in my entire life, and it means so much to me that it is for best hip-hop because that's what inspired me to move to America and pursue my dreams, and it's what helped me when I was a teenager to escape and to get through my life and to better times,"" Azalea told the audience while accepting her trophy. Meanwhile, soulful British singer Sam Smith, who showcased his pipes during Sunday's ceremony, was awarded the favorite pop/rock male artist trophy. That's not to say that homegrown artists were left out in the cold: Katy Perry, Beyonce and country stars like Luke Bryan also got their due. But some stars shone brighter than others during what wound up being a rather tame affair. Once the AMAs were all said and done, here's who left everyone talking: . 1. Taylor Swift . Talk about star power. On Sunday, music's reigning pop princess, Taylor Swift, received the Dick Clark Award of Excellence from none other than Diana Ross. Swift, being the smart young woman she is, recognized the importance of having the trailblazer there, and honored Ross in her acceptance speech. ""I'm just so blown away to have just received an award from Diana Ross, who over the course of her career stood up for herself so many times in a time when it was not popular for a woman to stand up for herself,"" she said. ""I'm so honored."" Swift, who performed her single ""Blank Space"" on Sunday, also thanked her fans for pushing sales of her new album ""1989"" well past one million. The album is not available on the streaming service Spotify, and during her speech for her Dick Clark award, Swift appeared to be sticking to her guns. ""What you did by going out and investing in music and albums is you're saying that you believe in the same thing that I believe in, that music is valuable and should be consumed in albums, and albums should be consumed as art and appreciated,"" Swift said. 2. Jennifer Lopez . Jennifer Lopez promised to perform her single ""Booty"" at the AMAs, and the singer/actress gave a set for the ages. Iggy Azalea was there, too, but even she admitted that J. Lo (and her flexibility) stole the show.","The 2014 American Music Awards were held Sunday .

"A Saudi diplomat and his Yemeni aide were killed Wednesday in the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, according to a senior official at the Saudi Embassy there. The diplomat, named as Khaled al-Onizi, and his assistant were shot dead in an attack on their vehicle near the Saudi official's residence in Bait Zabatan district, a suburb of the capital near Hadda district. Saudi Arabia is not yet accusing anyone over the attack, ""but this was planned and a group of gunmen were involved in the killing of the Saudi official,"" according to the senior Saudi official, who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. Saudi diplomat kidnapped in Yemen . The diplomat was an official in the Saudi military section of the Sanaa embassy, he said. At least five gunmen in a 4x4 truck chased the victims' vehicle for about five minutes, the Saudi official said. More than 20 shots were fired in the victims' direction. The Saudi official's vehicle flipped as the driver tried to escape, he said. The attack is the latest in a series of violent incidents to shake Yemen. Saudi diplomat shot dead in Bangladesh . In October, a security official with the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was shot dead in his car on his way to work in Sanaa. Yemeni security officials said that killing, which was carried out by men on a motorcycle, bore the hallmarks of al Qaeda. Yemen's security forces have been battling al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which has been blamed for numerous attacks in the country. Al Qaeda gained strength last year after taking control of several towns in south Yemen. The militant group benefited from political unrest sparked by the Arab Spring uprisings that led to longtime Yemeni ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh stepping down from power in exchange for immunity from prosecution.","A Saudi diplomat has been shot dead in Sanaa, a senior Saudi official says .

"If you're heading to the Northeast for Thanksgiving, you might want to get an early start. A nor'easter is expected to pour heavy rain or snow on that part of the United States late Tuesday and cause problems on Wednesday, traditionally the busiest travel day of the year, CNN meteorologists say. ""All of the major metro areas in the Northeast will be impacted by either heavy rain or heavy snow, along with high winds,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. He said it's too early to predict which metro areas will be hit hardest, but airport delays are predicted Wednesday in New York City, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, D.C. ""The I-95 corridor may end up being the dividing line between heavy snow and heavy rain,"" Hennen said. ""Either way travel in the Northeast will become dangerous, especially interior sections of the Northeast with heavy snow."" Buffalo braves for 'toxic brew' of flooding . American Airlines is waiving rebooking charges for holiday travelers using 18 airports in the Northeast. In a press release, the airline said: . ""Customers ticketed on American Airlines, American Eagle or US Airways or US Airways Express flights on November 26 to, from, or through (the 18 airports) may change flights without penalty, have the ticket-reissue charge waived for one ticket change, and begin travel as early as November 25 or as late as November 27 under American's current travel waiver.""

The current average price of gasoline in the United States is $2.85 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the average price for Thanksgiving in 2013. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said a European computer model calls for a foot of snow in Connecticut and Massachusetts, whereas an American computer model doesn't predict as much snow. ""This is going to be a rainmaker more than a snowmaker,"" he said. ""It isn't quite cold enough to make that big snow event.

"On their own, they're simple household items. Pressure cookers. Nails. Nylon bags. But combine them with explosives, and you can get the kind of bombs that investigators now suspect were used to turn the finish line of the Boston Marathon into a bloody nightmare. Scraps of them found at the scene of the twin bombings are being sent to the FBI's national laboratory, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices, the federal agent leading the investigation said Tuesday. Meanwhile, investigators combed through a digital mountain of photos and video clips and asked the public for help finding who planted them at two points on Boylston Street. ""Someone knows who did this,"" said Rick DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office. ""Cooperation from the community will play a crucial role in this investigation."" DesLauriers asked people to report anyone who talked about targeting Monday's race or showed interest in explosives. He urged anyone who might have heard the sounds of explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or saw someone carrying ""an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag"" around Monday to come forward. 'Boston will overcome,' mayor vows . There has been no claim of responsibility, DesLauriers said. ""The range of suspects and motives remains wide open,"" he said. The U.S. government has warned federal agencies in the past that pressure cookers -- airtight pots used to quickly cook or preserve foods -- have been packed with explosives and shrapnel and detonated with blasting camps. A law enforcement official said Monday's bombs were likely detonated by timers. Photos obtained by CNN showed the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings. A federal law enforcement source told CNN the photos were included in a bulletin sent to federal law enforcement agencies. The pieces recovered so far suggest the devices, which were identical, could carry 6 liters (1.5 gallons) of liquid apiece, a Boston law enforcement source said. The parts found include a partial circuit board, which would be used to detonate a device. 'Very effective' bombs . Pressure cooker bombs can be ""very effective,"" terrorism expert Jeff Beatty told CNN.  Taliban and al Qaeda militants ""use them to make their IEDs,"" he said. ""That doesn't mean it was the Taliban -- other people can read about this,"" said Beatty, who served in the FBI, CIA and the military's Delta Force. But so far, investigators have found no foreign or al Qaeda connection to the bombings, a U.S. official told CNN. And Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told reporters in Washington that some of the facts suggest the carnage had its roots in American soil. ""There are a lot of things that are surrounding this that would give an indication that it may have been a domestic terrorist, but that just can't be assumed,"" Chambliss said. We've been hit before on home soil . Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the bombings don't appear to be harbingers of ""a broader plot."" But she urged Americans ""to remain vigilant and immediately report any signs of suspicious activity to local law enforcement officials."" And members of Congress who were briefed by Obama administration officials on told reporters that the field of possible suspects remains wide open. ""We really don't know if it's a foreign or domestic threat,"" said Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Commitee. ""We don't know whether this was a homegrown terrorist or part of a wider conspiracy."" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper held closed-door talks with the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday. Chambliss,R-Georgia, told reporters afterward that ""there's not a whole lot of update to give."" What we know about the bombings so far . ""This is a very fluid investigation. The FBI's in the lead, and I personally know the special agent in charge. He's one of the best,"" Chambliss said. Late Monday, authorities searched the apartment of a young Saudi man who was among the wounded at the race.  He was found to have no connection to the attack. ""He was just at the wrong place at the wrong time,"" the U.S. official said. A Saudi woman, a medical student who was also injured in the blast, has also been interviewed by investigators, according to a law enforcement source. Boston's 'most complex crime scene' ever . Investigators are combing what Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis called ""the most complex crime scene that we've dealt with in the history of our department."" The cordoned off area has been reduced from 15 blocks to 12 and will be reduced further in coming days, he said. Even the smallest bits of debris could help indicate the bombs' ""signature,"" said a federal law enforcement official who works in the intelligence community. The explosives themselves were small, and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material -- suggesting the packages used in the attack were crude devices. How you can help . Based on the bombs' effects, the devices could have been small enough to be concealed in small bags or boxes, a law enforcement official said.  The smoke was consistent with a ""low-velocity improvised explosive mixture, perhaps flash powder or sugar chlorate mixture,"" the official said. Two photos obtained by CNN affiliate WHDH might raise more questions. The first shows a light-colored bag sitting on the ground next to a mailbox. The second -- of the same spot -- shows a blast seemingly where that bag sat, with the mailbox still upright. Investigators have not commented on these photos, which WHDH reports it has shared with authorities. When the pieces that have been recovered are sent to the FBI laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, investigators will try to better understand how they worked and look for clues like fingerprints, DNA or serial numbers to help track who planted them, the Boston law enforcement source said. Authorities haven't given any timetable as to when they expect significantly new details. But DesLauriers vowed Tuesday that the more than 1,000 law enforcement officers from more than 30 agencies will get results, even if they have to go ""to the ends of the Earth"" to get them. ""Our mission is clear: to bring to justice those responsible,"" he said. ""The American public wants answers. The citizens of the city of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts want and deserve answers."" Boston heroes: Running to help . Authorities have begun to search through huge amounts of video and images from surveillance cameras in the area near the attack.  So far, no footage has been spotted showing someone placing the bombs, a law enforcement source said. Authorities have asked anyone with images from any part of the marathon to share them with police. ""People don't know that they were witnesses -- that they might actually have evidence in their phones or in their cameras,"" Juliette Kayyem, President Obama's former assistant secretary for homeland security, said on CNN's ""Starting Point."" Davis vowed authorities will sift ""through every frame of every video."" The FBI is likely issuing subpoenas for records from cell towers in the area to isolate and trace calls from around Copley Square at the time of the blasts, according to a federal law enforcement official. Doctors believe bombs contained sharp objects . Two doctors overseeing treatment of the injured believe the explosive devices contained nails or similar objects. Many patients have severe wounds ""related to the blast effect of the bomb as well as small metallic fragments that entered their body,"" including ""pellets"" and ""nail-like objects,"" said Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital. A variety of sharp objects were found inside the patients' bodies, he said, adding that the bombs probably contained multiple metallic fragments. Asked whether what was found in the patients' bodies could have come from nearby objects that exploded in the blast, Velmahos said he believes the materials were likely part of the explosive devices. Map of the explosion sites . Ron Walls, chair of emergency medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital, said most patients there were wounded by ""ordinary debris.""  But three were injured by ""perfectly round objects"" that were ""very uniform, consistent, metallic,"" he said.  And another patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails. ""There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,"" Wall said. No unexploded bombs . Suspicious packages that were detonated out of precaution after the bombings turned out not to be explosive devices after all. After the blasts Monday, some officials reported that explosive devices that failed to go off were found. But investigators said Tuesday the only bombs were the two that exploded at the marathon. The intelligence community is poring through all threat reporting for any clues, U.S. counterterrorism officials told CNN. That includes any claims made on jihadist websites. Nothing is being dismissed this early on, the officials said. Bombing is the latest Patriots Day tragedy .","Remains of a pressure cooker found at scene, official says .

"Europeans are worried about a possible continent-wide bird flu epidemic after a wild duck tested positive for the H5N8 virus in northeast Germany, authorities said. The virus was first discovered earlier this month in domesticated birds at a turkey farm in Germany with subsequent outbreaks on poultry farms in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Authorities say that the first wild bird case strengthens the suspicion that the source of the European outbreak lies in the wild bird population. ""We must now talk about a Europe-wide epidemic,"" said Till Backhaus, the agriculture minister of the German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, where the wild bird was found. He ordered all poultry farmers in his state to keep their animals inside enclosures and away from wild birds. This month over 200,000 ducks, turkeys and chickens were killed in Europe to control the outbreak, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. Once the virus is discovered in select birds, the entire flock must be destroyed, according to health officials. There have been no human cases of H5N8 reported, according to the World Health Organization, but the agency said other avian flu strains have infected humans in the past. The H5N8 strain in Europe ""appears to be highly pathogenic,"" meaning that it is highly likely to cause disease and death in poultry. It's not known how the virus reached Europe, but the WHO said surveillance zones have been put in place around affected farms to prevent the spread of the disease.

"Egyptians head to the polls to vote for their next president on Monday and Tuesday. There will be just two candidates, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahi. Egypt had an election recently. So why are they having another one? Egyptians are voting again because Mohamed Morsy -- Egypt's first freely elected president -- was removed from power last year in a popular military coup. Morsy's ouster last July was the culmination of a months-long petition campaign to remove him from office and days of mass demonstrations against the former Muslim Brotherhood leader. Critics accused Morsy of hijacking the 2011 revolution, pushing aside moderate and liberal voices, and botching Egypt's already ailing economy. Morsy rejected the allegations and accused Egypt's military backed establishment and Mubarak-era loyalist of undermining his presidency. In a remarkable reversal of fortune the man who removed Morsy from power - then army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi - is now heavily favored to win the presidential election. Morsy and scores of fellow members of the Muslim Brotherhood are in prison facing a variety of charges. How will Muslim Brotherhood supporters vote? The Muslim Brotherhood is not represented in the election, which is due in large part to an aggressive campaign by Egyptian authorities to eliminate the movement from Egypt's political landscape. Despite initial promises of an inclusive transition to a democratically elected government, Egypt's military backed interim government banned the Muslim Brotherhood last year and declared it a terrorist organization. Today most of the group's leadership is either in jail, in hiding, or taking refuge outside Egypt. Both candidates - Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahi - have promised to keep the Brotherhood out of Egyptian politics if elected president. The Strong Egypt Party - led by former Muslim Brotherhood leader Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh - has decided to boycott the vote. The ultra-conservative Salafist Nour Party supported the 2012 election of Mohamed Morsy but is now drawing criticism from Islamist groups for supporting candidate el-Sisi. What are the policies of each candidate? Both candidates have generally remained vague on policy details, choosing instead to make populist promises that play well in television interviews. And, both promise to fix Egypt's failing economy, though neither has detailed how they plan to create jobs, generate revenue, and cut costly food and fuel subsidies -- a move many fear will anger Egypt's poor. El-Sisi vows to keep Egypt safe by continuing the ""war on terrorism,"" a reference to the recent rise in low-level insurgent attacks against security forces. Critics fear el-Sisi will exploit that narrative to stifle free speech and continue a crackdown against dissent that has been sharply criticized by international rights groups. Sabahi promises to release what rights groups describe as thousands of political prisoners and ban a controversial protest law, which says groups of ten or more cannot gather in public without prior government permission. Who is likely to win? And will the winner finally bring stability to the country? El-Sisi is heavily favored to win due in large part to widespread support from Egypt's powerful establishment, which includes the military, the private and state media apparatus, and Egypt's political and financial elite. El-Sisi also has popular support from Egyptians who see him as the man who saved Egypt from a Morsy presidency that was perceived by many to be pursing an Islamist agenda. Less certain, however, is whether the next president can bring stability to Egypt, and lure back millions of tourists who have stayed away due to more than three years of political unrest. To establish stability Egypt's next president must make tangible improvements to the economy, improve security, and address mounting criticism from rights groups and pro-democracy activists who fear a return to a Mubarak-era style police state. How will the election result affect the region and the rest of the world? The outcome of the vote will likely bolster Egypt's relations with key allies Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates -- Gulf states that poured in billions of dollars in funding to support the Egyptian government after the ouster of former President Morsy. Relations with Qatar and Turkey -- staunch supporters of Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood --- will remain tense. The United States and Western powers will likely continue to voice concern about Egypt's alleged human rights violations but will continue relations as long as Egypt honors its peace treaty with Israel and isn't viewed as a disruptive force in an already volatile region. An el-Sisi presidency would be a potential blow to pro-democracy movements in other Arab states who hoped the 2011 Arab Spring would mark the end of regimes led military strongmen.","There are just two candidates in Egypt's presidential election, with polling due on May 26, 27 .

"A few months after Apple gave away a U2 album, angering some of the grumpiest folks on iTunes, the company is teaming up with frontman Bono again -- this time for charity. To mark World AIDS Day on December 1, a special section of the company's App Store is offering special content for 25 apps, for which all proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Apps for (Red) is a partnership with Bono's Project (RED), which works with major brands to help combat the deadly disease worldwide. ""Apple isn't just in the fight to end AIDS. They are setting a new bar for business, giving $75 million and counting to the Global Fund as part of their partnership with (RED),"" Bono said in a statement. ""I couldn't be prouder to work with them."" The campaign starts Monday and runs through December 7. In that span, the App Store project will feature apps including Mighty Feathers (an Angry Birds spinoff), a special edition of Clash of Clans, a FIFA '15 (RED) tournament and a special Sims FreePlay event. Apple will also release 300 new sounds for GarageBand and make available recipes from the likes of Mario Batali, Martha Stewart and Luke Holden in Kitchen Stories Cookbook.

"Now that a Missouri grand jury has decided not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, what will happen to the man who killed an unarmed teen in the line of duty? Technically, the 28-year-old officer could have returned to his job at the Ferguson Police Department. But many believe he will never work as a cop again. On Saturday, Wilson resigned from the force, his attorney confirmed to CNN. The eight-year police veteran wrote in his resignation letter he was leaving to help protect his fellow officers and Ferguson residents. ""It is my hope that my resignation will allow the community to heal,"" he wrote in the letter, provided by his attorney. What Wilson told the grand jury . ""It would be senseless for him to go back to Ferguson,"" CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said. ""And I don't even think he can go back to law enforcement, for the same reason. He is still now going to carry with him this mantle that he was the cop who killed the young black kid that sparked the controversy nationwide."" Most people believe Wilson will never again wear a badge. ""If I'm the mayor of Ferguson, believe me, you would want that cop out because you know that he will be controversial,"" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. ""He will be distrusted by the citizenry and maybe subjected to abuse when he's out on the street. It's just going to be nothing but trouble."" How prosecutor defended grand jury's decision . More investigations . Wilson is still the subject of an internal investigation by the Ferguson Police Department over what happened on August 9, the day he fatally shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown. And the U.S. Justice Department is conducting two civil rights investigations: one into whether Wilson, who is white, violated Brown's civil rights, and the other into the police department's overall track record with minorities. O'Mara says he believes the federal investigation into Wilson's actions will lose steam. ""A federal investigation for civil rights violation is very difficult to accomplish,"" he said. ""You really have to show that the person acted with the intent to take away your civil rights, meaning I did what I did because you're black. That's a protected class."" The decision to open a federal probe of the Ferguson shooting was largely political, he said. Since the grand jury declined to indict Wilson, one could conclude that the shooting was justified based upon Wilson's and Brown's actions. ""That's more evidence that he acted in self-defense,"" O'Mara said. 'More stringent' federal probe possible . Callan said the lack of an indictment could push the federal government to ""open a much more stringent and powerful investigation"" of Brown's shooting. ""Now they know he's not going to be prosecuted on a state level, and the feds have a right to do a completely independent investigation, and they're not bound in any way by grand jury determination,"" he said. Whether the Justice Department brings charges, however, is another story. ""As a general rule, the feds really only get involved when they have a really strong case."" Callan said. ""I wouldn't imagine they're going to swoop in on this one too quickly."" Wrongful death lawsuit possible . Brown's family will probably file a wrongful death lawsuit against Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department, Callan and O'Mara said. The Browns recently hired famed pathologist Michael Baden to conduct a second autopsy of Brown's body, which Callan says is a move presumably ""to support a civil lawsuit for money damages later."" ""They're going to sue a lot of people, and there's no reason not to,"" O'Mara added. Callan said Brown's family could file a lawsuit against Wilson and the police department under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the U.S. Code -- a federal statute that permits damages against state officials for violations of legal or constitutional rights. But, O'Mara points out, law enforcement officers are afforded certain legal protections. ""We strap guns on them and say, 'Go out there and put yourself in danger,' "" he said. ""So they even have an extra level of immunity of sorts. ... Overall, Wilson probably acted within the confines of what he's supposed to do."" But Wilson will forever be connected to this divisive case that sparked weeks of unrest in the St. Louis suburb. ""Darren Wilson is going to have a tough time because even if the presumption was he did nothing wrong, that doesn't matter. He is now the focus point for all the anger and animosity that exist in the black community."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .","Darren Wilson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department on Saturday .
It's not clear whether Wilson will continue being an officer somewhere else, but experts doubt it .
""It would be senseless for him to go back to Ferguson,"" lawyer and analyst O'Mara said .
The grand jury had considered charges ranging from manslaughter to murder ."
"It might all have remained a dark secret, if a young man who was an alleged victim of sexual abuse hadn't written a letter to the Vatican. And then gotten a surprise phone call from Pope Francis, according to a Spanish digital newspaper. On Monday, Spanish police arrested three Catholic priests and a religion teacher on suspicion of abusing a minor, Spain's interior minister announced. A court statement from Granada confirmed the arrests of four people ""for a case of sexual abuse,"" and said it would hear initial charges before a judge within three days. The investigation is under seal. The arrests came a day after the Archbishop of Granada and other clerics took the unusual step of prostrating themselves in the cathedral during Sunday Mass, ""asking forgiveness for the sins of Church, for all of the scandals that have, or might have, occurred among us,"" the Granada Archdiocese website reported. The archbishop usually does that once a year, on Good Friday, but he lay on the floor of the cathedral Sunday due to the seriousness of the allegations, a Granada Archdiocese spokeswoman said. The archbishop earlier had removed an unspecified number of priests from their duties, pending an investigation, she said. The arrests of three priests in a single day over sexual abuse allegations is the biggest case of its kind in Spain, said a spokesman in Madrid for the Spanish church leadership, known as the Episcopal Conference. Since 1997, 10 priests have been convicted of sexual abuse, in individual cases, most recently in 2010, the spokesman said. But this latest case caught the attention of the Vatican and the Pope, thanks to a man, reportedly now 24, who wrote to the Vatican to say he was sexually abused when he was underage by church figures in Granada. The Spanish online journal Religion Digital published what it said was a conversation between Pope Francis and the alleged victim from August 10, with the Pope asking for forgiveness in the name of the church. The alleged victim was cited with a fictitious name, Daniel, Religion Digital reported, adding that 12 people, 10 of them priests, were under investigation. The Pope has called for ""zero tolerance"" of sexual abuse by clerics and has said Catholic bishops ""will be held accountable"" for failing to protect children from such abuse.","Police arrest Catholic priests and teacher in Granada, Spain, on suspicion of sex abuse .

"New Hampshire remains Clinton country. Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that if the primary were held today, Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' 2016 presidential nomination, would be their top choice, according to a Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm College poll released Monday. The number is a whopping 49 percentage points higher than second-place finisher Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont finishes in third with 6% and Vice President Joe Biden finishes in fourth with 5%. Although Clinton has not declared her second run at the presidency, the former secretary of state has admitted she is considering a run and many close aides see a campaign as all-but-certain at this point. New Hampshire has always been welcome ground for the Clinton family. Bill Clinton's surprising second place finish in the 1992 primary provided his campaign with a symbolic victory and re-energized the Arkansas governor as ""The Comeback Kid."" Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign. Despite her huge lead, even Clinton's most ardent New Hampshire supporters have cautioned her to not take the Granite State as already in the bag. ""Inevitability is not a message, it is not something you can run on. And in New Hampshire, we have a long history of (frontrunner) train wrecks,"" Terry Shumaker, a longtime Clinton aide in New Hampshire, said last week during a meeting of pro-Clinton Democrats. Shumaker, who was with Bill Clinton when he filed his presidential bid papers in 1991, added: ""As I caution all presidential candidates in New Hampshire, taking New Hampshire for granted is very dangerous. Last time I believe Hillary Clinton had an almost 30-point lead in the polls in our state in the summer and that lead melted like an ice sculpture on the mall in Washington in July."" Monday's poll, however, is not all good news for Clinton. In a 2016 general election matchup between Clinton and Mitt Romney, the failed 2012 Republican nominee, Clinton's one point lead is within the polls margin of error. When matched up against Jeb Bush, the former Republican governor, or Rand Paul, the senator from Kentucky, Clinton enjoyed a 8 and 7 point lead, respectively. For Clinton Democrats, the end of the pre-campaign comes with concerns . The poll also has good news for Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. In a 10-person field that includes 2012 GOP Romney, Paul's the only other potential candidate to break double-digits, taking 11 percent support and coming in second to Romney's 30 percent support among GOP primary voters. With Romney out of the picture — though the former Massachusetts governor has left the door open, a third bid seems unlikely for him — Paul ties for first place with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Both take 16 percent support among GOP primary voters, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush comes in a close third, with 14 percent. The rest of the field takes single-digit support. Paul's strength in the state comes as no surprise, as its libertarian-leaning population drove his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, to a second-place finish in the 2012 GOP presidential primary there. Indeed, the results may be more heartening for Christie, who's considered Paul's main challenger in the state but has suffered significant damage over the past year due to the scandal surrounding the George Washington Bridge lane closures that cast a pall over his administration. The Bloomberg poll suggests, however, Christie remains competitive in his home region, and that the two will have a fierce fight for the all-important early primary state if they both decide to run, as expected.","Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire support Clinton .

"What's worse than 7 feet of snow piled up in front of your house? How about the flooding that comes once those 7 feet of snow melt? That's exactly what some Buffalonians will grapple with when temperatures Monday warm up to around 60 degrees. Swift-water rescue teams and helicopters are already on standby in western New York in case anyone gets caught in a deluge. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said residents shouldn't wait until the last minute to evacuate if they think their homes will get inundated.  He advised such homeowners to clear their basements of valuables. The governor said dealing with flooding is worse than the snow. ""It's not water,"" Cuomo said. ""It's a toxic brew. It has sewage in it; it has runoff in it."" State officials have beefed up stockpiles of generators and pumps and prepared almost 180,000 sandbags. After last week's nationwide bout with frigid weather, Buffalo temperatures could reach as 60 on Monday, according to the National Weather Service. Freezing temperatures are not expected again until Tuesday night. ""At least 3 feet of snow has melted so far,"" Dawn Buck of Depew, New York, told CNN's iReport on Sunday afternoon. But Erie County spokesman Benjamin Swanekamp said so far, the snow has been melting at a ""relatively even pace."" ""The pace of the melting and the lack of additional rain has kept it manageable,"" Swanekamp said late Sunday night. About 700,000 people are under a flood warning until Wednesday, CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. Officials have been moving pumps into neighborhoods and sandbags near creeks. So far, the county hasn't received reports of major flooding. But Cuomo has asked residents to clean out storm drains in front of their houses ""so the water has some place to go."" Collapsing roofs . There's also the threat of more building collapses as all the rain saturates the snow on the tops of buildings, making the load even heavier. Several dozen roofs have already collapsed from just the weight of the snow, Erie County officials said. While most of the fallen buildings were unoccupied, Swanekamp said, a roof collapse at a dairy barn roof killed 25 cattle . Cuomo said structural engineers will examine schools and other government buildings that might be in danger of roof collapses. He said most state government offices will reopen Monday. Nasty winds too . The National Weather Service in Buffalo issued a high wind warning from Monday afternoon until early Tuesday morning. High wind warnings are issued when sustained winds of at least 40 miles per hour are expected for at least an hour, with gusts of at least 58 mph at any time. The winds could topple trees and power lines, officials said. And with ongoing snow melt, the saturated ground will make it easier for some trees to come down. 'City of Good Neighbors' Anthony Marchioli of Buffalo was so bored that he rented a small snow tractor to clear driveways on his street, CNN affiliate WKBW reported. On the way back from the rental company, he saw his pregnant wife standing in the street outside their house. Her water had broken. So Marchioli put her on the tractor and pushed through whiteout snow to Mercy Hospital, WKBW said. Eleven hours later, the couple's third daughter was born. Her name: Loxley Storm Marchioli. And despite the intimidating heaps of snow, strangers came to help any way they could. Erica Bartoe of Hamburg, New York, told CNN's iReport from Hamburg, New York that people had come to her town from other areas to help shovel snow and drop off donations. ""Buffalo is called the City of Good Neighbors for a reason,"" she said. ""There were people everywhere helping out.""","The Buffalo area braces for flooding and brutal winds that could knock down power lines .

"Kenyan security forces have killed 100 militants, an official said Sunday, one day after a deadly attack on a bus. Forces crossed into Somalia to launch two ""successful operations on the hideouts of the perpetrators,"" said Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto. The camp where the attack was planned was destroyed, he said. On Saturday, Islamist militants ambushed a bus in Kenya and sprayed bullets on those who failed to recite Quran verses, killing at least 28 people, according to authorities. The bus, which had 60 people aboard, was heading from Mandera, near the border with Somalia and Ethiopia, to the capital of Nairobi. About 20 miles into its dawn journey, militants stopped it at a hilly area and stormed in, local police Cmdr. Noah Mwivanda told the Daily Nation newspaper. Militants demanded those onboard recite Quran verses. As others watched, they opened fire on passengers who failed to do so, he said. Somali-based terror group Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, saying it was retaliation for mosque raids this week. It described those killed as Christians. Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda, has launched a series of attacks in Kenya since its forces went into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to battle the extremists. This is one of the busiest travel seasons in the nation. Throngs make their way to relatives' homes for the holidays, with buses and other public transportation packed this time of the year.

"The day after Michael Brown was killed by a police officer, Syreeta Myers drove from her South City home to the northwest suburb of Ferguson. She marched on the street demanding justice for Brown's death. She wanted to stand by his parents. Two months later, Brown's father was calling her. This time, it was Myers who was receiving support. Like the Browns, she had lost a son. VonDerrit Myers Jr. was 18, just like Michael Brown. He was a young black man killed by a white police officer. ""My issue is with crooked cops who won't hesitate to kill a black man,"" Syreeta Myers tells me on this dreary Sunday afternoon. Brown was unarmed, and the grand jury investigating his killing is expected to make a decision any day now on whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson. Myers hopes her son's case will also be investigated to sort out opposing sides of the story. ""Picture if this was your kid. What would you want?"" she would like to tell the grand jurors. ""Base your decision on the facts."" Just as in Brown's case, the facts in Myers' killing are disputed. And Myers' case is far more complicated. At issue is whether or not a teenager who had a history with guns tried to shoot a police officer. Police say that the October 8 confrontation in the city's Shaw neighborhood began when Myers and two others ran from an off-duty police officer working for a private security firm. Police have not released the officer's name, but Jermaine Wooten, an attorney for the Myers family, identified him. Wooten says the name was included in an evidence sheet inadvertently left with VonDerrit Myers' body when it was brought to the funeral home. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch said it had independently verified the officer as Jason H. Flanery. Police would not confirm the name for CNN. The officer is on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. The officer was in his car and chased Myers and the two others because he thought one of them had a handgun, police said. He tussled with Myers, police said, and then Myers fired three shots at the officer. The officer fired back with 17 rounds and killed him. Police said they found Myers with a stolen gun that matched three bullets that were recovered near the officer's location. They also said tests confirmed gunshot residue on Myers' hand, T-shirt and jeans. The residue, police said, could mean a person fired a gun, or was near a gun when it was fired. Family disputes police account . But Syreeta Myers tells a different version of what happened on the night that she lost her only child. She refers to witness accounts of Myers running away and begging for his life when the officer shot him. She says her son was holding a sandwich, which he was seen buying on a shop surveillance video, and not a gun. Wooten says VonDerrit Myers pleaded with the officer. ""Stop, stop. Don't shoot."" That's what witnesses heard him say, Wooten tells me. A private autopsy done for the family showed that Myers had seven leg wounds, and one bullet struck him in the face. Myers had been wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet since a June arrest for unlawful use of a weapon and resisting arrest. Police said those charges resulted from him tossing a loaded .380-caliber pistol into a sewage drain. Shortly after his death, photos of him posing with guns went viral online. The shooting immediately drew a comparison to Brown's, except media reports described Myers as an armed criminal. But her son's troubles with the law did not justify his death, Syreeta Myers says. Why is it, she asks, that everything bad about the victim is made public and not the man who killed him? ""If you believe a person is guilty of a crime, lock him up. Don't shoot him,"" she says. ""This is senseless. I was cheated. I only got 18 years with my son. He should still be here."" VonDerrit Myers' past does not matter to many who are protesting Brown's death. Myers may not be a Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown or any of the others on the list of slain, unarmed black men in America. But his shooting in St. Louis, so soon after Brown's, has fed a cry for racial justice. The voices of Ferguson . Myers was another case of a black teen killed by a white police officer, another case that demonstrated, they say, that black lives do not matter. Ferguson church turns to faith as uncertainty looms . 'Mama, I'm going to make you proud' I meet Syreeta Myers at her attorney's St. Louis office on Sunday afternoon. Outside, the skies are dark with thick clouds. The rain is blowing sideways. Ferguson is just a few miles from here. These neighborhoods in St. Louis are on edge ahead of the grand jury announcement in the Brown case. Sunday evening, protesters marched for two hours on the streets near where VonDerrit Myers was shot. In the shadow of the storm called Ferguson, a quiet grave . Myers and I sit at a conference table and begin our conversation. She tells me her son was not the animal the media portrayed. ""How can you make a decision about a person you don't know?"" she asks. I learn that when she was close to eight months' pregnant, doctors said her baby would probably not survive. She had preeclampsia, a complication characterized by high blood pressure that can prove fatal for both mother and child. The only cure is an immediate delivery of the baby. Myers, a certified pharmacy technician, and her husband braced for the worst. But the baby came out screaming and weighed almost 5 pounds, 3 ounces. They named him after his father. He grew to become a good student who loved basketball and softball, although his asthma hampered him at times. When he entered high school, he began to hang out with friends his mother disapproved of. Some were dropouts, losers. ""When you are around negativity, it rubs off on you,"" she says. VonDerrit was living with his grandmother when he was killed. Her place was closer to his school and to the assembly line job he had at a plastic company. But Myers often went out with him on mother-son dates. They'd go eat at Chili's and catch a movie -- the last one they saw together was ""The Equalizer."" And all he talked about was getting off the box, meaning the ankle bracelet. That's why, Myers says, she finds it preposterous that he would shoot anyone. On October 7, Myers spoke to her son for the last time. He told her he was job hunting after getting laid off and had turned in applications. He was looking forward to graduation from Gateway High School in January. Myers says he had to attend an extra semester because he had failed some classes. He had dreams of being an athletic scout or a construction engineer, she says. ""Mama,"" he told her in that two-hour phone call, ""I'm going to make you proud."" 'Families should not have to bear this pain' The next evening, Myers and her husband were at a grocery store when her cell phone rang. She learned her son had been shot. They rushed to the scene on Shaw Boulevard. Her phone rang again. She learned her son was dead. Police did not let her into the taped-off area. She could see what she knew was her son's body under black sheeting. Her husband went to the morgue later to identify him. She did not want his bloodied body to be the last image of him in her mind. The next night, dozens of protesters turned up at the corner of Shaw and Grand boulevards. Some burned American flags that night. For Myers, the hours and days since her son's shooting are a blur. She stopped watching the news. It was too painful to see her son's face, to hear others call him a thug and to listen to countless discussions about racial hatred and police brutality. Instead, she reached for her Bible. She says that as a Christian, she knows she will have to forgive the officer who shot her son. But she cannot just yet. The call from Michael Brown Sr. was comforting, she says. ""He knew what I was experiencing,"" she says. ""Families should not have to bear this pain. I am breathing, but I feel like my life just stopped."" It's difficult for Myers to talk about her son, especially with Thanksgiving just a few days away. She wipes away tears and gets up and leaves the room when her attorney talks about her son's gunshot wounds. She never got a condolence call from the St. Louis Police Department. But she never expected one. She says she doesn't despise all police. She recognizes they put their lives on the line for the safety of others. But she believes that in this case -- and in the case of Michael Brown -- a police officer committed a crime, and he should be punished.

"La Paz, Bolivia (CNN) -- Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday defended his decision to end fuel subsidies, a move that caused gasoline and diesel prices to spike and has led to protests in major cities since it was announced over the weekend. The country's subsidies led to an artificially low price for diesel and gasoline, which resulted in widespread smuggling of those products to neighboring countries, where smugglers sold it for a profit, Morales told CNN en Español. ""There's a tremendous amount of smuggling (to Peru and Brazil) and the state loses."" For example, Bolivia will spend $660 million this year importing fuel, of which $380 million will have been subsidized by the government, he said. Of that, he said, $150 million will have been siphoned out of the country through contraband sales of the gasoline and diesel in neighboring countries, where the price is higher. ""For a small country like Bolivia, that's a lot of change,"" he said. Morales' remarks came a day after he attempted to explain the move in a nationally televised address. Though the initial price shock may seem high, the average Bolivian will benefit from the move, he said. Money saved under the new policy will be plowed back into the economy, with 20 percent increases in the minimum wage and spending in education, health, and security, he said. ""Our policies are always to favor the poor people,"" said Morales, the nation's first indigenous president. For those people who will not be helped by the salary increases, he said, ""the only way (to help them) is to create new jobs."" He acknowledged that transportation costs in some areas have doubled since Sunday, when his government announced he was ending the subsidies, but blamed unscrupulous Bolivians for the increases. ""Evidently, there are some people in transportation who take advantage of this situation and increase their fares by 100 percent,"" said the president. Government studies indicate that public transportation fares should have increased by no more than 30 percent, he said. In El Alto, hundreds of people -- most of them young -- gathered outside government buildings, breaking windows and dismantling a protective fence in front of one. In the afternoon, demonstrators broke windows at the mayor's office, pelted cars whose drivers dared drive in the area, and set parked cars afire. In Santa Cruz, hundreds of demonstrators broke into one government building and hauled files from the offices to the street, where they set them ablaze. In some areas, demonstrators blocked traffic for brief periods until they were dispersed by police. Once the police had left, they would do it again, according to a reporter for ATB Bolivia. Asked about protests in the streets of major cities like La Paz, the capital, Morales questioned the use of the word ""massive"" to describe them. ""The information I have is some 5,000 Bolivians"" have demonstrated. He suggested that his opposition was mobilizing the protests for political gain. ""This will stabilize,"" he said. ""I have a lot of faith."" Morales also said his government will seek to counter the impact of the price increases by investing $300,000 per rural municipality across Bolivia to spur economic growth through the creation of infrastructure projects with an emphasis on irrigation. Gasoline prices rose by as much as 73 percent and diesel by 83 percent Monday. Subsidies had kept the price of gasoline at about 50 cents per liter ($1.88 per gallon). By comparison, neighboring Peru sells gasoline at $1 per liter and Brazil at $1.58 per liter. The president of the Confederation of Private Business People, Daniel Sanchez Solis, disputed Morales' assertion that the business sector had orchestrated the demonstrations. ""He's badly informed,"" Sanchez told CNNE. ""He is attacking the private sector, which is the sector that has shown responsibility."" For example, he said, the Association of Banks, which is a member of his organization, calmed rumors Wednesday of an imminent financial crisis that could have led to a run on the nation's banks. Sanchez added that the vast majority of employees in the country will not be affected by Morales' 20 percent wage increase, and he worried aloud that the move would result instead in higher inflation. ""The invisible hand of the market has returned to the country,"" he said. ""The free market."" Sanchez said he was not opposed to raising the price of petroleum products, but he criticized what he said was Morales' failure to consult with other sectors prior to acting. ""Why not build among all of us a productive policy?"" he asked. ""We want to build a country. We want to participate.""

With a low credit rating of junk and a political class stained by accusations of endemic corruption, the Balkan state of Croatia is soon to become the EU's latest addition. Brussels is embracing recession-marred Croatia, three years into a debt crisis that is plaguing countries across southern Europe. Leading economies such as Spain and Italy are struggling to cope with high borrowing costs and many EU nations are suffering from chronic unemployment. But for Croatia, joining Europe's elite club will mark the end a 10-year campaign to enter the region's single market. As one of the Balkan countries to emerge from the ruins of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Croatia will be only the second country to join the EU after Slovenia in 2004. James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow in South East European politics at the London School of Economics, says to some extent Croatia ""got lucky"" and its imminent membership is down to having ""friends in the right places."" He told CNN: ""There's always been this sense that Croatia has had a strong champion in Germany and Austria. They have always taken a very strong position on Croatian membership."" Read more: The eurozone's reluctant leader . Ker-Lindsay said he believes some EU member states are turning a ""blind eye"" to a number of Croatia's problems in favour of the political symbolism that enlargement in the Western Balkans represents. He added: ""It's mission accomplished... The time for conditionality has gone."" Economy . One of the challenges facing Croatia is its growth prospects. The financial crash of 2008 brought about a harsh double-dip recession that left the country's economy lingering in the doldrums. Forecasts for 2012 project the economy contracted 1.9%. Unemployment peaked at 17.3% which is behind only Greece and Spain, according to Eurostat - the European Commission's data archive. Croatia relies heavily on its sun-kissed Adriatic coast to draw tourism and its state-run shipyards for revenue -- which will either face privatization or bankruptcy under the EU's accession treaty.

A high budget deficit, rising national debt and a lack of competitiveness has resulted in stagnating growth. Will Bartlett, a senior research fellow in the political economy of South East Europe at the London School of Economics, told CNN: ""The EU will not be a panacea for Croatia's economy."" Bartlett says that at the turn of the century, Croatia's banking industry became largely foreign-owned by European banks. Despite not being in the single currency, many small businesses in Croatia have debts denominated in euros rather than in kuna - the country's domestic currency - exposing them to exchange rate risk. Bartlett added: ""It's very similar to Greece because it's a highly euro-ized economy... Unlike Greece they don't have access to any of the eurozone bailout funds. They're very much on their own."" Read more: Greece: When anger goes beyond despair . In December, Standard & Poor's - one of the three big credit rating agencies - downgraded Croatia to the lowest investment status known as ""junk."" This led to the Prime Minister Zoran MilanoviÄ‡ rebuffing suggestions that Croatia would need a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Political corruption . Croatia is also in the midst of cleaning up a political class that is rife with corruption. Since the country's inception in the early 1990s, it has struggled to choke off profiteering from those in positions of power. Transparency International - an organization tackling corruption -- ranked Croatia below Rwanda, Jordan and Cuba in its Corruption Perceptions Index for 2012. But the country still came in above Italy - Europe's third largest economy. Zorislav Petrovic, head of Transparency Internernational in Croatia said: ""The country's evolution has been very slow since 1990."" But the current government - led by Milanovic - is taking steps to clean up the country's act under close supervision from the European Union. In November last year, the country's former Prime Minister, Ivo Sanader, was jailed for 10 years after being found guilty of taking pay-offs from foreign companies. Sanader - who was premier from 2004 to 2009 - had fled the country but was arrested in Austria. Kristof Bender, deputy chairman of the policy institute, European Stability Initiative, says Croatia's progress to the ""doorstep of the European Union"" is quite remarkable. He told CNN: ""We mustn't forget how bad it [Croatia] was in the 1990s. The darkest moments of war, occupation, mass killings, ethnic cleansing, and autocratic leadership and crony capitalism were all there."" Bender recalls a conversation he had two years ago with Vesna PusiÄ‡, now Croatia's foreign minister. She told him that ""no one dares to engage in corruption because everyone is so scared now... no one is immune."" Croatia joining the EU will be ""highly beneficial"" for the accession process, according to Bender, as it will inspire other ""young democracies"" in the Balkans and beyond to join the European movement.","Croatia will be only the second ex-Yugoslav country to join the EU after Slovenia in 2004 .

"(CNN)The 2015 Dakar rally suffered tragedy on only its third day of competition when motorbike rider Michal Hernik was found dead. But mystery surrounds how the 39-year-old Pole lost his life. No damage was found to either his body or bike, said race director Etienne Lavigne. Hernik, who was located just a few hundred meters from the race track, had removed his helmet prior to his death. ""The circumstances surrounding his death have yet to be determined, as the competitor did not show any external signs of an accident,"" said a rally statement. Hernik -- who was competing in his first Dakar -- was found at kilometer 206 on the stage between San Juan and Chilecito, in northern Argentina. Shortly after the rider, wearing bib number 82, failed to appear at the finish line, organizers tried to find him. The search was complicated by the absence of a signal from his satellite tracker. ""When the race management detected the loss of his Irritrack signal and was informed that he had not completed the special stage at 15:16, it decided to start a search for the rider at 15:23,"" said a statement. ""An ambulance helicopter found the rider 300 meters off the route at 16:03. ""Unfortunately, the on-board doctor could only confirm the rider's death."" Hernik's death means five competitors have died since the rally moved from West Africa to South America in 2009 because of security concerns in the Sahara region. All those five have been competing in the motorbike section. Since the Dakar began on December 26, 1978, a total of 24 competitors have died but there have been over 50 fatalities when including the deaths of spectators and officials. Speaking after the stage, the overall leader of the motorbike race -- Joan Barreda Bort -- said it had been a challenging section. ""It was really dangerous because we were on river beds with a lot of stones and broken up tracks all day,"" the Spaniard told reporters. Race organizers said Hernik had previously competed -- and completed -- both the 2013 Morocco Rally and the 2014 Abu Dhabi Desert Challenge. ""The whole Dakar family offers its condolences to Michal's family, close friends and team,"" added the Dakar statement.","Motorbike rider Michal Hernik was found dead by Dakar organizers on Tuesday .

"President Barack Obama arrived in Japan on Wednesday for the first part of his Asia trip that started with reassuring Tokyo of U.S. support in its bitter territorial dispute with China. Obama made his first stop in Tokyo on a weeklong tour that will also take him to South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met over what's been described as the ""world's best sushi"" at Sukiyabashi Jiro, a top-rated restaurant in the Ginza district. The dinner also brought out the new U.S. ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy. On Thursday, Obama will start a formal state visit to the nation -- the highest designation for a foreign leader. Obama's appearances in Japan will be tinged with formality — meetings with the royal family, a stop at the Meiji shrine and a protocol-bound state dinner. Japan's first state visit by an American president in almost two decades comes as the United States works to reassure Abe and other Asian leaders that the United States remains committed to turning foreign policy focus on them. The ""pivot to Asia"" that began almost three years ago meant to put a greater emphasis on diplomatic and economic efforts toward Pacific nations to counterbalance China's influence in the region. Obama begins Asia trip with 'the best sushi I've ever had' But Middle East uprisings, the Syrian civil war and new diplomacy with Iran have made some Asian leaders wonder when the ""pivot"" would take shape. At the start of his long-awaited visit, Obama waded into a fraught territorial dispute between Japan and China. He told a Japanese newspaper that a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing ""fall within the scope"" of a U.S.-Japanese security treaty, implying the United States could step in militarily in the event of a clash over the territory. It's the first time an incumbent U.S. President has made such a statement on the bitterly disputed islands, and comes as Asian nations nervously watch the U.S. response to Russia's incursion into Ukraine. Japan has eyed the Ukraine situation closely. Obama's comments Wednesday should dispel at least some of its worry. ""We oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands,"" Obama said in answers to questions submitted by the Yomiuri Shimbun. Both Tokyo and Beijing say the islands, known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, are an inherent part of their territory. Taiwan, which lies 120 miles (about 190 kilometers) southwest of the islands, also stakes a claim to them. Obama's words, reiterating statements made in previous years by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, drew a swift rebuke from Beijing. ""The United States should respect the truth, not take any sides, be careful about its words and behavior, and uphold peace and stability,"" said Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. But Obama's comments are likely to provide some reassurance to Japan. The Chinese government has stepped up efforts in recent years to challenge Japan's control of the small, rocky islands and the waters and airspace around them. Obama's efforts to reassure Asian allies also extend to his push for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade deal the White House hopes will open economic channels in the region. In the works for years, the Japan portion of the trade deal is not expected to be finalized this week -- due to disagreements between the United States and Japan, and a delay in Congress from members of Obama's party. The resistance to approving the trade deal, along with another trade pact being negotiated with Europe, stems from Democrats' worry the agreements would kill jobs. They're not likely to come on board at least until November's midterm elections. ""The President has developed credibility problems in terms of delivering on the congressional support,"" said Kenneth Lieberthal, who handled Asia policy in Bill Clinton's White House and now acts as a senior fellow at Brookings Institution. ""My own sense is ... that there's less confidence that the President has (been) effective in dealing with the Congress and that may really be a major issue in finalizing (the trade deal)."" Despite the stalemate, U.S. officials have remained bullish the deal would be good for the U.S. economy. ""This remains a very important aspect of our rebalance to the Asia-Pacific region, one that holds great promise for the countries in the region as well as for the United States,""  Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said last week. ""We'll continue to work toward that given its significance to all concerned.""

"London (CNN)It flew for 10 years, crossed millions of miles of space, bounced over the surface of a comet and returned heaps of data ... and then quietly faded away. The little spacecraft Philae that has captured the imagination of thousands with endearing tweets to the comet-chasing mother ship Rosetta stopped transmitting when its batteries drained. ""@ESA_Rosetta I'm feeling a bit tired did you get all my data? I might take a nap ..."" The forlorn message was picked up by followers of @Philae2014 shortly before it fell silent. Rosetta and Philae's love affair . The Rosetta orbiter mission will continue to track Comet 67P on its journey around the sun in the coming months but after the final transmission from Philae, the lander mission appeared to be over. But is it? Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun, say there's still a good chance that Philae will revive. And the malfunction that caused the probe to bounce in the very weak gravity might actually turn out to be a blessing. ""It's good luck through bad luck,"" said lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke. ""Yep, we're stuck against a wall. But when you look at the original location of where we were supposed to land -- it's a beautifully flat area -- we would never have seen the images and the structures of the comet wall unless we landed where we did. We'd have been in a dust field,"" he told CNN. ""We've had a number of happy accidents. It's bad luck that we bounced but the good luck is that all the instruments were on ... so what you have is a major scientific benefit -- results from two different locations when we were only expecting one."" Lander problems started when a thruster and harpoons designed to anchor the small probe to the comet failed. Philae bounced away from the original target touchdown area and appears to have settled under the face of a cliff. Project scientists are still not exactly sure where, even though the lander performed its experiments and sent back data. Philae falls silent . O'Rourke said the team are still searching for it and that the location will be key to estimating when a new signal might come from the spacecraft. He explained that the final resting place of Philae did not allow enough sunlight to fall on the solar panels so the probe ran out of power. It was able to complete its original mission, operating on the comet from the initial battery charge. But before Philae closed down, engineers managed to rotate the probe so a larger solar panel would be exposed to sunlight and they believe this will be enough to automatically restart the spacecraft when the comet's orbit takes it closer to the sun. Again, scientists think this shadowy spot on the comet might be another stroke of luck. The original landing zone would have exposed Philae to temperatures that would have burned out the electronics -- probably after about three months. ""The lander has the ability of keeping itself warm but doesn't have the capability to cool itself down,"" O'Rourke told CNN. ""The current environment benefits the lander because we're not worried about it overheating any more. We can keep it warm if we get enough power,"" he said. O'Rourke believes that if the lander comes back online there's a high chance it will survive until the comet's closest approach to the sun in August next year. So how does Philae come back from the dead? O'Rourke explains the sequence: . - If enough sunlight falls on the solar panel, Philae will reboot- It then needs more energy to warm the batteries- Once warmed, the batteries will start recharging- When it has enough power Philae will try to contact the orbiting Rosetta -- for two minutes every 30 minutes. - If it fails to make contact, Philae will power down the transmitter and try again 30 minutes later . The power it needs is tiny -- roughly equivalent to the output of two or three domestic AA batteries -- but it will be enough to restart the lander mission. When the Rosetta team find Philae they will then be able to estimate the point at which enough sunlight falls on the solar panel to expect a transmission from the probe, announcing that it's still alive. As long as it doesn't get too cold there's still hope. In a statement, lander project manager Stephan Ulamec said he was confident that contact could be resumed -- probably in the spring of 2015. In the meantime, scientists are sifting through the data from Philae's 10 instruments to see what they may have already discovered. ""When you look at what Philae's done -- it's been quite extraordinary,"" said O'Rourke. ""A little satellite placed on a comet so far away -- you're always rooting for it. To give it that extra chance to have more power felt really good,"" he said. Watch Rosetta's 10-year chase across the solar system .

"Northwestern University football coach Pat Fitzgerald said Saturday he does not believe his players should unionize, even though the players won that right in court last month. Players will vote on April 25 whether to form a union. Fitzgerald spoke to his team Saturday, outlining the reasons why he thinks they should vote against the measure. ""I believe it's in their best interests to vote no,"" Fitzgerald said Saturday, speaking to reporters after a team practice. ""With the research that I've done, I'm going to stick to the facts and I'm going to do everything in my power to educate our guys. Our university is going to do that, to give them all the resources that they need to get the facts."" Two of the team's most visible players, quarterback Trevor Siemian and running back Venric Mark, backed their coach. ""I think at this university I'm really fortunate to be in the position I'm in. I don't think union is the answer for my team, or my university,"" Siemian said. ""I've been treated unbelievably, far exceeding my expectations."" Siemian thinks a push to unionize may hurt their No. 1 goal, which is to win a Big Ten championship. ""I just hope the NCAA does understand some things do need to change,"" Mark said. ""But we do not need a third party to come in between us and the coaches,"" he said. Last month, the National Labor Relations Board office in Chicago ruled that players are employees of the school and have the right to unionize after former quarterback Kain Colter testified about the rigorous demands of being a Division I football player. Read the board's ruling (PDF) The board's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships, working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions. The athletes have said they're seeking better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships and the possibility of being paid. Northwestern is appealing the ruling to the national NLRB office. The university is sticking to the century-old collegiate athletics stance: that student-athletes are not university employees but ""students, first and foremost."" ""Northwestern considers its students who participate in NCAA Division I sports, including those who receive athletic scholarships, to be students, first and foremost,"" Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations, said in a statement last month. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity."" Richard Epstein, a labor law professor at New York University, said the ruling has ""vast implications for the structure of the sport, if upheld."" But he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve. The NCAA said that while it wasn't party to the proceeding, it was ""disappointed"" with the board's ruling and disagreed ""with the notion that student-athletes are employees."" NCAA President Mark Emmert criticized the idea of unionization in a news conference Sunday. ""To be perfectly frank, the notion of using a union employee model to address the challenges that do exist in intercollegiate athletics is something that strikes most people as a grossly inappropriate solution to the problems,"" Emmert said. ""It would blow up everything about the collegiate model of athletics."" On Saturday, Fitzgerald spoke about his experience at Northwestern, covering 18 years, to make his case. ""Right now, we have great protocols in place, and we haven't been forced to do that by any third party,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I know our guys trust me."" He said he had always been an advocate of change for student-athletes, if it had a positive impact. ""We have to educate them to help them understand  the whole aspect of what this decision is... that's what their parents entrusted us to do... and we'll continue to work with them to do that,"" Fitzgerald said. Thursday, while speaking at the Aspen Institute about his efforts to unionize, Colter addressed the dissent on the team. ""I think it's tough when you have some criticism that they've got. Some people came down, hollered on, and even people within the Northwestern alumni base. That's obviously tough, but I think they are strong and they still believe in the issue,"" Colter said. Ramogi Huma, who as head of the College Athletes Players Association is a driving force behind the move to unionize, couldn't be reached for comment. He has said the Chicago NLRB ruling would have national implications, but he wouldn't talk about whether teams at other schools were planning to hold union votes as well.","Quarterback and a running back are also opposed to unionization .

"(CNN) -- Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards admitted Friday to having an extramarital affair in 2006 with a woman who worked on his campaign. National Enquirer editor-in-chief David Perel says the tabloid broke news of John Edwards' affair in 2007. Edwards has denied being the father of the woman's child, as had been alleged in tabloid reports, and it is willing to take a paternity test. Wolf Blitzer, filling in for Larry King, spoke with David Perel, editor-in-chief of the National Enquirer, who originally broke the story in October 2007. Blitzer also spoke with Alan Butterfield, a senior reporter for the National Enquirer who confronted John Edwards at a hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday. Some highlights: . Wolf Blitzer: What got you guys going in this direction to begin with? David Perel: We received what we thought was a credible tip, Wolf, and we started investigating it. A lot of times when we go down this road and the story turns out not to be true, we abandon it. But the more we dug in, the more information The Enquirer uncovered that was standing up, we were able to prove that, indeed, John Edwards had a sexual affair with Rielle Hunter. We first did the story in October without naming her and then we came back with a much tougher story in December 2007, where we not only named her, but we photographed her pregnant. Blitzer: And at that time, you didn't report that -- what you reported subsequently, that you thought that he was the father. Perel: That's true. We know that Rielle believes that he is the father. And Mr. Edwards today, in his own statement, said he did not take a paternity test. He's now saying that he will take one. We've asked him for months if he would take one and he's ignored that request. However, we do know the man that has claimed to be the father, Andrew Young, who worked for Mr. Edwards, our sources -- the same sources that led us to uncover this affair -- say that Rielle says she never had a sexual relationship with him.  Watch Perel discuss Edwards' ""character issue"" » . Blitzer: (Edwards) said in his statement today, ""I only know that the apparent father has said publicly that he is the father of the baby. I also have not been engaged in any kind of activity of any description that requested, agreed to or supported payments of any kind to the woman or to the apparent father of the baby."" He does say he would be more than happy to go ahead and have this paternity test, which he says would clear him. Allen, he argues that he had this affair back in 2006. The baby was born just a few weeks ago. He said the affair lasted in 2006, but there was no more affair in 2007. And, as a result, he says he couldn't be the father of this baby. Butterfield: Right. But why is he -- the question we should all ask him, then, why was he visiting her at 3 in the morning at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on July 21, then if he's not the father? He is the father. I mean at least he believes he's the father. Like David Perel said, that Rielle is telling everyone he's the father and he is -- you know, why isn't there a name on the birth certificate? There are still a lot of questions that Mr. Edwards needs to answer. Blitzer: And this other Andrew Young, who says he's the father, you don't believe him. Butterfield: No. Not at all. Andrew Young and his wife, Shari, moved out to the Santa Barbara area with Rielle soon after our December story. I guess they're all living, then, as one big happy family.  Watch Butterfield says he thinks Edwards fathered a love child » . Blitzer: What happens, David, if he does take the paternity test and it doesn't match and it shows he is not the father? Perel: We'll publish that. I've made the offer to him repeatedly: take a paternity test, whatever the results are, we'll publish it. He has refused to do that, as he's been calling this story lies and tabloid trash and lying to the American public. Unfortunately, I think the only reason he came forward and admitted the affair is because we did catch him at the hotel meeting on July 21 and we did publish a photograph this week in the National Enquirer showing him holding the baby. We can also reveal that in addition to that meeting, he met at the same hotel a month before with Rielle Hunter and the baby, so his actions are what counts. His words have proven not to be credible. Blitzer: I guess a lot of people question the reporting of the ""National Enquirer,"" in part, David, because you pay sources for information, is that right? Perel: Wolf, we do pay sources for information after it checks out as credible and accurate. I think, in retrospect, nobody can deny the accuracy of these stories. We've been reporting on the affair for about 10 months now. He says his statements were 99 percent truthful and yet he told the American public while running for the highest office in the land that he did not have an affair, that these were lies, lies? This is a character issue, and he still insists he's 99 percent truthful? I think the truest thing that he said today in his statement was when he admitted that he's narcissistic. Blitzer: Did you pay any sources in connection with this particular story involving John Edwards? Perel: Wolf, we pay for photographs. We pay for information when it's accurate. We have no problem doing that. And in this story, you know, whether we did or we didn't, I'm not going to say. It doesn't matter. You can assume we did. The thing that counts is the story has proven to be true and there is more to come.","National Enquirer reporter confronted John Edwards at hotel about extramarital affair .

"(CNN) -- When plans were announced to build a giant new transoceanic canal across Nicaragua, the young Hong Kong businessman leading the project acknowledged the widespread skepticism. ""We don't want it to become an international joke,"" said Wang Jing, a 40-year-old with no significant engineering experience and a background he described as ""very normal."" That was in June 2013, when the Nicaraguan legislature, controlled by President Daniel Ortega, had just allowed Wang to move forward with his five-year project . It is not certain that the canal, which would be one of the most ambitious and expensive engineering projects on Earth, will ever get built. But it looks set to move forward, and even some of the most determined doubters are starting to reconsider. Last Thursday, the government and Wang's company, Nicaragua Canal Development Investment, announced that construction will start on Dec. 22. The development's estimated price tag -- $50 billion -- is four times the size of the entire Nicaraguan economy. The canal itself would be deeper, wider and longer than the Panama Canal, just a few hundred miles to the south. The Panama Canal's expansion is almost ready, which raises the question of why another costly canal is needed. The Nicaraguan opposition has called the project the biggest scam in the country's history, and engineering experts are divided over whether the project is feasible. Pedro Alvarez, chairman of civil engineering at Rice University, has expressed doubts that it will ever be completed. He worries that it will be abandoned. His greatest concern is severe damage to Lake Nicaragua, the largest freshwater reservoir in Latin America. Other engineers say the quick turnaround between contract signing and construction leaves room for doubt that the plans are solid. And David Ashley, an engineering professor at the University of Nevada who was a consultant to the Panama Canal Authority, said the Panamanians examined the Nicaraguan idea and concluded that it did not pose a threat to their own expansion plans. Mystery and suspicion have surrounded the proposal from the beginning. To this day, nobody understands who will pay. When Vladimir Putin made a surprise visit to Managua last July -- the first by a Russian president -- Nicaraguans wondered whether the canal figured in Russia's new geopolitical calculations. But it is the Chinese government's role that has most people talking. The country is abuzz with rumors that Wang is a front for Beijing, which is looking for strategic security for its vital imports. Wang, who was born in Beijing, has repeatedly denied the accusations. Nicaraguan officials also deny Russian involvement. Wang was also in town last July, startling many Nicaraguans by revealing the exact route of the canal. The announcement made the project seem real, threatening the potential displacement of people living on its path and fueling concerns from environmental groups. Chinese workers have started arriving for construction that will run from the Rio Punta Gorda on the Caribbean Coast to Brito on the Pacific. By some estimates, 30,000 people will have to be relocated to carve a path 172 miles long, up to 1,700 feet wide and 90 feet deep. The prospect is nothing short of alarming for those living in the area. Demonstrators have launched at least a dozen protest marches, and an environmental lawyer has filed suit against the project at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, charging ""The government has sold us to the Chinese."" The president says the project will mark a turning point in the country's development, creating tens of thousands of jobs and giving a long-term boost to economic growth. But critics see something different. The idea of building a canal linking the Pacific and the Atlantic across Nicaragua dates back hundreds of years. This new, enigmatic venture, however, began almost as an Ortega family project. In 2012, the president sent his son Laureano to China. That's when Wang first made contact with the Ortegas. Not long after that, Wang was in Managua and by June of 2013, the president and the Chinese businessman signed the agreement to build the canal. The legislature quickly rubber-stamped it. At home, critics say Ortega is relinquishing national sovereignty in order to help those close to him enrich themselves. Small farmers living along the planned path worry about displacement and environmental degradation. Environmentalists say the proposed route, which includes a large tract across Nicaragua's largest lake and its main water supply, will put the country at risk. Whether or not Wang is a straw man for China's government, there is no question that a new Chinese-built waterway across Central America and a project of this magnitude would expand China's influence in the region. A transcontinental canal, of course, is an important strategic asset. China's influence in Latin America is nothing new. Beijing has a voracious appetite for natural resources and very deep pockets. It is steadily supplanting the United States as the main trading partner in the region. There is a difference between trade with China and trade with the United States. Commercial exchanges with American firms are, for the most part, conducted with the private sector of the United States, which has much weaker ties to the government in Washington than Chinese firms do with their central government. Already China has become the top trading partner for major Latin American economies, notably Brazil and Chile. Beijing is lending  money to Latin America, developing multiple projects and making more business inroads. Economic ties tend to translate into political links. The skeptics still doubt the canal will be built, but the ambitious time line signals the parties are serious. The biggest mystery surrounding the project, whether it would ever get off the ground, is about to be resolved.","Frida Ghitis: Chinese man leads plan to build transoceanic canal through Nicaragua .

"For many people, any interest in the resurgence in Icelandic volcanic activity this year is now a distant memory. However, an eruption from Bardarbunga that began on August 31 continues to this day and has now emitted the most lava of any volcano in Iceland since 1947 and shows no sign of stopping. To give some sense of the scale, the volcano has now spewed so much lava to the surface that it would fill Wembley stadium to the brim more than 500 times over. And the total area of impact is over 28 square miles. Unlike a lava flow that is currently destroying homes in Hawaii, however, the lava in Iceland is flowing in an uninhabited area and has only provided stunning visual effects that have been captured by many photographers. However, toxic gas released is causing respiratory discomfort to people in nearby towns, and has even triggered pollution warnings in other countries, including Ireland, and measurable pollution peaks in the United Kingdom. So far, however, the eruption has not caused any problems from ash clouds because it is erupting beyond the ice cap. However, this could change at any time. The caldera at the top of the volcano is dropping every day, as magma flows out from below. This is being monitored by a high-precision GPS instrument placed there by gutsy scientists of the Icelandic Met Office. The subsidence is not smooth, but lurches down in jumps coinciding with earthquakes occurring beneath the surface. This subsidence marks a slow collapse of the caldera, a process that often ends with an eruption. There are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera, so any eruption would lead to the production of ash, once it melts its way through the ice cap; melting ice interacts with the magma, turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash. If this occurs, the eruption may well affect some flights. It would also cause destructive flooding from melting of the ice. However, we should not see any repeat of the massive airspace closure in Europe in 2010, the biggest since World War II, following the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano. That eruption stranded millions of travellers and cost the industry a massive sum. One key difference between then and now is that there is no longer an aviation ""zero tolerance"" policy to ash. This means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations, and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 European institutes called FUTUREVOLC, mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010. Moreover, the ash produced in 2010 was especially fine, allowing it to stay aloft for a long time. The weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers, with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into Europe. To be sure, there is a small chance of a much more significant eruption. Bardarbunga has had huge eruptions in the past, bigger even than the 1783-84 Laki eruption that led to a long-lived fog over much of Europe, which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths. However, the frequency of such large eruptions is low -- separated by hundreds of years on average. That said, the timing of the next big one may have been brought forward by the shrinking of the ice caps due to climate change. The associated reduction of pressure in the mantle beneath the crust has caused magma generation rates to approximately double over the last century. But the picture here is not 100% clear cut as the altered stress state of the crust may mean that more magma freezes beneath the ground, rather than erupting. Even without a huge eruption, threats remain from the continued possibility of large floods from meltwater, with potential risk to human life. The highlands north of the Vatnajökull glacier therefore remain closed to the general public. Taken overall, there remains a possibility of a significant ash eruption in Iceland that may well impact some flights. However, despite all the risks, it is still unlikely we will witness a repeat of the travel chaos that brought European airspace to a standstill in 2010.","An eruption from Bardarbunga began on August 31 and continues to this day .

"A criminal defamation case against two journalists in Thailand is set to proceed this week, despite calls from the United Nations and prominent rights groups for the charges to be dropped amid concerns over press freedom there. The charges relate to an article published July 17 last year that included information from a Reuters investigative piece that alleged some Thai naval forces have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic Rohingya people fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. Reuters won a Pulitzer Prize in international reporting for its series on the persecution of the Rohingya on Monday. The Phuketwan journalists are accused of knowingly publishing false information and committing slander, according to the charge sheet. In December, the Thai navy filed criminal defamation and computer crimes charges against the reporters from Phuketwan, a small news website in the province of Phuket, over a report connecting military personnel to human trafficking. Veteran Australian journalist and editor of Phuketwan, Alan Morison, and reporter Chutima Sidasathian, a Thai citizen, have been advised that the case will proceed at Phuket's Provincial Court on April 17, according to a Phuketwan report. Phuket's public prosecutor, Wiwat Kijjaruk told CNN Friday there was enough evidence to proceed with the case.""Even though the two said that they just republished an article from Reuters ... they should have checked the facts before doing so,"" he said. If convicted, Morison and Chutima could face up to seven years in jail. 'Chilling effect' A United Nations human rights official has called on the Thai government to drop the case. ""Criminal prosecution for defamation has a chilling effect on freedom of the press,"" said Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. ""International standards are clear that imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty for defamation."" Human Rights Watch, which condemned the lawsuit along with other NGOs, said the Thai navy should allow authorities to look into the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of Rohingya migrants. ""Prosecutors should be investigating the poor treatment of Rohingya boat people instead of targeting journalists,"" said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch in a statement. CNN could not reach the Thai navy for comment for this story. After the charges were filed in December, an official from the Royal Thai Navy, who asked not to be named, told CNN the navy ""does not intend to obstruct any media from, or threaten any media for performing their duties. What we are trying to do is to protect our organization from false allegations."" The navy has not released an official statement about the case. Reuters has not been notified of any legal action over its report, which a spokesperson for the company said ""was the product of extensive reporting, is fair, balanced and contextualized."" ""We wish to emphasize that Reuters' story does not single out the Thai Royal Navy, but explores the responsibility of all involved in patrolling the Thai seas and provides their perspectives."" According to Phuketwan, other Thai news organizations that also published the text at the center of the case have not been charged. If found guilty, Morison and Chutima could face jail time of up to two years on the criminal defamation charges and five years for breaching the Computer Crimes Act, as well as a fine of around $3,000. 'In defense of media freedom' Thailand's Computer Crimes Act aims to stop the spread of content believed to threaten national security or create panic, but it has attracted criticism from freedom of speech advocates and internet providers for making online users liable for reproducing material originally published by others. Denying the charges, Morison, 66, said that he will not apply for bail if a court seeks it, ""in defense of media freedom in Thailand."" Originally from Melbourne, Morison has been in Phuket for 11 years, where he produces Phuketwan and also freelances for international media, including CNN, The Sydney Morning Herald and the South China Morning Post. He worked for CNN as CNN.com Asia Deputy Editor in 2001-2002. Phuketwan has become known for its investigations into the alleged mistreatment of Rohingya, many of whom arrive in Thailand by boat after fleeing ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Reports of Rohingya ending up in camps where they are held at ransom, beaten, killed or sold as laborers have been documented by NGOs and media organizations. The Thai government says it is committed to combating human trafficking in Thailand but denies that the Rohingya are victims of trafficking. It says that the Rohingya are migrants who consent to being smuggled. In a 2013 human trafficking report submitted to the U.S. State Department in March, Thailand does not include any Rohingya in its trafficked persons statistics, a spokesperson for the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sek Suwannamethee told CNN Friday. The State Department is due to release its latest ranking of countries' efforts to combat human trafficking in June. Thailand will be downgraded to Tier 3, the lowest rank, unless it makes ""significant efforts"" to tackle the issue, according to the State Department.","A defamation case against two journalists is proceeding in Thailand .

"Prosecutors began a criminal investigation Wednesday into the Vatican's former ambassador to the Dominican Republic, a day after a local church representative said the pope had recalled the envoy because of child abuse allegations. ""We have formally opened an investigation,"" Dominican Attorney General Francisco Dominguez Brito told reporters. ""Here we have to work with two legal aspects, first national laws and also international laws in his status as a diplomat, which implies other mechanisms of investigation and judgment."" The Vatican confirmed Wednesday that Jozef Wesolowski had been removed from his post and that an investigation is under way but did not say what allegations were made. Wesolowski had been an apostolic nuncio, the Vatican's official representative in the Dominican Republic. But the pope pulled him from the post last month after an internal church report connected him with child abuse and pedophilia, according to Monsignor Agripino Nunez Collado, the rector of a Catholic university and spokesman for the church in the country. ""It is a situation that really shames and hurts the conscience of all Catholics,"" he told reporters Tuesday. ""Really when there are these kinds of situations, justice must be done."" The former nuncio's whereabouts were unclear Wednesday, and he could not be reached by CNN en Español for comment. The situation goes beyond the authority of Dominican church officials, Nunez said, because Wesolowski was the Vatican's envoy there. ""It was a surprise for me. It is an unprecedented case,"" Nunez said. ""An ambassador of the Holy See, that it reaches that level."" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi confirmed Wesolowski's removal and that ""an investigation is ongoing regarding the accusations moved toward him."" The church's sexual abuse guidelines allow local dioceses to make the initial decisions on the removal of accused priests. Papal nuncios, however, are appointed and supervised by the Vatican. Before he was elected pope, Francis said that he supports a ""zero tolerance"" approach to clergy sexual abuse. In 2012, when Francis was still Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, he said that when he was asked for advice by another bishop, ""I told him to take away the priests' licenses, not to allow them to exercise the priesthood any more, and to begin a canonical trial in that diocese's court."" For years, the Catholic Church has faced calls for reform in the wake of scandals involving the sexual abuse of children by priests and allegations of corruption. Shortly after his election to the papacy, Francis told a senior Vatican official to ""act decisively"" against sexual abuse and carry out ""due proceedings against the guilty."" In July, the pope made it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people.","""We have formally opened an investigation,"" the attorney general says .

"SAN ANTONIO, Texas (CNN) -- One of three American hostages rescued last week from Colombian rebels said Monday he believes his former captors will retaliate against those still being held. ""Right now, they're being punished because we got rescued,"" Marc Gonsalves said at San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center, where he and fellow ex-hostages Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell have been treated for days. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) had held the three U.S. government contractors since February 2003, after their plane crashed in a remote region of the South American country. The three were among 15 people -- including Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and 11 Colombian national police and military men -- who were rescued Wednesday by the Colombian military. Read about the rescue operation . On Monday, the Americans spoke publicly for the first time since their rescue. Gonsalves, who called his rescuers ""heroes,"" said he fears for the hostages who remain with FARC. ""They're going to get up early tomorrow morning, they're going to put a heavy backpack on their backs, and they're going to be forced to march with [a] chain around their neck while a guerrilla with an automatic weapon is holding the other end of [the] chain like a dog,"" Gonsalves said. Gonsalves blasted the leftist rebel group, calling them ""terrorists"" who pretended to be fighting for the poor of Colombia so they could engage in crimes such as drug trafficking and extortion. ""They say they want equality; they say they just want to make Colombia a better place,"" Gonsalves said. ""That's all a lie ... to justify their criminal activity."" He said the rebels deprive their captives of basic human rights, adding that hostages were often chained at their necks and held at gunpoint, and that he once saw the rebels keep a newborn in captivity even though the infant was ill.  Watch Gonsalves describe hostages' treatment » . ""They are not a revolutionary group. They are terrorists -- terrorists with a capital T,"" said Gonsalves, a Florida resident and Connecticut native. He said FARC claims it is not a terrorist group, but he said it should prove that claim by freeing its remaining hostages. FARC is believed to hold more than 700 hostages in camps scattered throughout the jungle. ""Don't tell us that you're not terrorists. Show us that you're not terrorists,"" he said. He said the majority of FARC forces were poor children or young adults tricked into thinking they were joining a just, revolutionary cause. Later, he said, some would regret their decision to join, but they knew they would be killed if they tried to leave. ""I've seen how their own guerillas commit suicide in a desperate attempt to escape the slavery that the FARC have condemned them to,"" Gonsalves said. Before they spoke, the three contractors, along with their families, entered to cheers and a standing ovation. All three wore button-up shirts and dark suit jackets. They were photographed holding a small American flag. Howes, the first contractor to speak, said, ""Five and a half years ago, we fell off the edge of the Earth."" He thanked Northrop Grumman -- the contractor that employed him, Gonsalves and Stansell -- for supporting his family. Like Gonsalves, he called the Colombian rescuers ""heroes."" ""We're doing well, but we cannot forget those we left behind in captivity,"" he said, adding later, ""It's a pleasure to be in the USA."" When it was his turn to speak, Stansell walked up carrying his twin 5-year-old sons. He said his family's ongoing support is ""the reason I'm alive."" Stansell, of Florida, wrapped up his brief statement, in which he thanked the Colombian and U.S. governments, with a playful question for Gov. Charlie Crist. ""To Gov. Crist of the great state of Florida: Sir, I don't have a driver's license. How am I going to get home?"" Stansell said. The contractors thanked the news media for covering their story but declined to take questions. From the day of their rescue until Monday, the Americans had been kept from the news media so they could undergo a reintegration process that included medical tests. Monday's statements were part of a ""yellow-ribbon ceremony"" that was intended to mark the contractors' success in that process and prepare them to ""attempt a normal life,"" said Maj. Gen. Keith Huber. It was unclear when the men would be leaving the medical center. Officials at the center said the men are healthy. ""Although their time in captivity has been extremely difficult and at times traumatic, they have in general fared very well,"" Col. Jacki Hayes said. ""They've shown themselves to be strong and adaptive."" Each contractor lost roughly 30 pounds during captivity, a result of strenuous activity and poor diet, the center said. Northrop Grumman Electronic Systems President James Pitts said the company's crisis team is prepared to assist the men as they adjust to their lives as free men. The contractors were conducting a joint U.S.-Colombian aerial counternarcotics mission in February 2003 when their aircraft made a forced landing because of mechanical failure. FARC members patrolling the area reached the aircraft and killed two crew members before taking the three captive. FARC, which has been fighting the Colombian government and other paramilitary groups for decades, defends the taking of captives as a legitimate act of war.","Ex-captive says FARC probably will punish hostages still in jungle .

"(CNN) -- A quip often attributed to Albert Einstein defines insanity as conducting the same actions repeatedly but expecting different results each time. By that characterization, insanity has been running rampant in Vienna, where diplomats from Iran and the P5+1, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany, have extended the deadline for talks aimed at resolving concerns over Iran's nuclear program. The problem is not the attempt to resolve the crisis through diplomacy, but rather that the current diplomacy neither takes into account past Iranian behavior nor the lessons from similar diplomacy two decades ago to resolve North Korea's clandestine nuclear work. First, it's important to remember the root of distrust regarding Iran's nuclear program. Iran has, for several decades, declared nuclear enrichment and experimentation to be its unalienable right. It signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, membership of which includes technology sharing and enrichment. Every signatory, however, must negotiate a Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, an agreement the IAEA concluded in 2005 that Iran violated. Efforts to resolve suspicion about Iran's nuclear ambitions are based on two pillars: Logic and behavior. Iranian authorities repeatedly say they want an indigenous nuclear program to power their country and they seek energy security. The problem is that Iran only appears to have enough uranium reserves to provide fuel for eight reactors -- the number Iranian authorities seek -- for 15 years. Conversely, for a fraction of the cost of its nuclear program, Iranian authorities could refurbish and expand its oil and gas refinery and pipeline network and power itself for more than a century. Then, of course, there's Iran's past behavior. Accusations against Iran rest not on secret intelligence such as that used in the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq war, but rather on a litany of lies exposed by successive IAEA inspection reports. Countries seeking only a civilian program do not construct enrichment sites in secret, acknowledging them only after their discovery. Nor do countries pursuing civilian energy experiment with nuclear bomb triggers. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's past contributes to the questions over his motives. In April 2009, for example, Rouhani reportedly bragged that when he earlier headed nuclear negotiations, he used the talks to distract the West while Iran upgraded its centrifuge capacity. And for all the discussion of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's supposed fatwa against developing nuclear weapons, no such fatwa exists on his webpage. Nor does it appear that Iranian officials quote it consistently, suggesting they may have simply made it up to confuse. A key problem with the current diplomacy is that it fails to consider what it would take to force a real Iranian compromise. Iranian authorities up to and including Khamenei have sworn no compromise on Iran's right to enrich. Rather than challenge that demand, the Obama administration has acquiesced to it, in the process voiding multiple unanimous or near unanimous Security Council resolutions prohibiting Iranian enrichment. While Iranian officials insist an enrichment freeze is a nonstarter, it is important to recognize that Iranian authorities have in the past reversed themselves on issues about which they have been equally rigid. For example, revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini compromised on U.S. hostages not because of the persistence of diplomacy, but rather because Iraq's invasion of Iran made Tehran's isolation too great to bear. In contrast, the Obama tactic of presaging negotiations by agreeing to unfreeze $7 billion in frozen assets and by allowing Iran to court new investment fails to increase Iran's isolation to its breaking point. Negotiation absent leverage always fails. And even if an agreement is reached, there is no indication that it takes into account the vital lessons of North Korea: It has been just over 20 years since the United States and North Korea signed the Agreed Framework, a hard-fought agreement meant to return North Korea to the good graces of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Agreement. At the time, diplomats understood that the agreement was flawed, but they calculated a bad agreement trumped no agreement. In a subsequent book about their experience negotiating with the Hermit Kingdom, Bob Gallucci and his colleagues explained, ""If North Korea could walk away from the treaty's obligations with impunity at the very moment its nuclear program appeared poised for weapons production, it would have dealt a devastating blow from which the treaty might never recover."" Then, as now, preserving the treaty trumped all else, even if it meant creating the fiction of effectiveness. And, just as the Obama administration appears frustrated with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for raising public objections to the deal, 20 years ago, the Clinton team did likewise after South Korean President Kim Young-sam raised doubts about the wisdom of the accord and the direction of negotiations in a New York Times interview. Of course, in hindsight, South Korea was right. North Korea viewed the agreement as a means to a cash infusion, not as an obligation to forfeit nuclear ambitions. But, as evidence surfaced that North Korea was cheating, diplomats sought to exculpate Pyongyang so as to preserve the appearance that diplomacy had worked. Indeed, the desire to keep diplomacy alive became so deep that when the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded in 1999 that it could not certify that North Korea was using food aid as stipulated in its agreements, the State Department objected on the grounds that to acknowledge cheating would undercut diplomacy. Ditto when the GAO reported that North Korea had diverted heavy fuel oil. History shows that once a process begins, the State Department will not allow it to end. Keeping the talks alive soon trumps all other considerations, including their initial purpose: preventing nuclear proliferation. Alas, fiction can trump reality for only so long: North Korean nuclear tests belie the progress it made against the backdrop of diplomacy. So, back to Iran: Assessing the Islamic Republic's previous nuclear negotiations, Iranian negotiator Hossein Mousavian once reportedly bragged that Iranian negotiators had ""managed to make far greater progress than North Korea."" Regardless of what happens now an extension has been announced, one thing is certain: As disputes arise, diplomats will shift the goalposts to keep all sides at the table. And once again, diplomatic insanity will triumph as Tehran grinds closer to its end goal.","Michael Rubin: Current Iran diplomacy doesn't reflect its past behavior .

"(CNN)Tails wagging wildly, tongues panting heavily, ears -- soft as felt -- flapping around as if they were wings propelling them against gravity. These canines are getting some much-needed freedom from their leash, running, leaping and rolling on a field at a landfill in North Carolina. But this is no normal walk in the park for these dogs, as it might be their last. Homeless and ownerless, these shelter dogs have almost maxed their shelf life in the local pound, and they could end up in the landfill buried with everything else people have discarded. This is the sad reality of a pet overpopulation problem that photographer Shannon Johnstone wishes to change through her wide lens and huge heart. As a last-ditch effort to save these dogs from euthanasia, her ""Landfill Dogs"" project has already changed the metaphorical landscape: Of the 127 dogs she has photographed on these symbolic grounds, 108 have gotten homes. But it's more than just finding owners for the animals. She hopes to change the physical landscape as well and open the conversation about how to save these animals from a fate six feet under. ""Throwing bodies into landfill after being injected with a barbiturate isn't good for the environment,"" Johnstone said. ""My hope is that underlying that, we can figure out what to do to curb overpopulation from starting in first place."" Johnstone knew nothing about homeless dogs until she adopted one of her own after completing graduate school. Her journey to shoot ""Landfill Dogs"" started with a forgotten crate and a neighbor nice enough to return it. The two spoke for a while about rescue animals and led Johnstone to start volunteering at the local shelter in Raleigh, North Carolina. ""I was awestruck by how many animals there were and how quick the turnover was,"" Johnstone said. The Wake County Animal Shelter houses animals as long as possible before they run out of room or resources to take care of them. ""The saddest thing is there is no alternative for animal overpopulation other than euthanasia, no other tool in their arsenal,"" Johnstone said. Her first project on the shelter in 2009, titled ""Breeding Ignorance,"" depicted the lethal injection process. She wanted to show people what happens when the animals are not adopted, and she wanted to show how hard the animal shelters work as ""first responders"" to ""discarded property,"" she said. Years went by before she approached the subject again, but this time she took a different, more positive angle. Instead of showing the ""doom and gloom,"" she wanted to show that animals could be helped out before it was too late. The former director of the Wake County Animal Shelter asked her to come out to a landfill that he was turning into a public park. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. She paused and thought, ""Why is he involved in both waste and animals?"" The county animal shelter falls under the same management as the landfill. By law, pets are property. ""If you don't want your property anymore, that's what the animal shelter is for. And most of the time, they then end up in landfill,"" she said. Thus, ""Landfill Dogs"" was born to give man's best friend the chance to be seen for their beauty -- and to be saved, like the wasteland-turned-park that they play on.

"Alex Honnold's fingertips and toe tips barely cling on to the side of a mountain in Yosemite, thousands of feet in the air. He is free solo climbing, which means he has no rope to support him, so one false move would mean a long fall to the rocky ground below. He looks up at filmmaker Peter Mortimer, who is capturing his climb in silence, and finally breaks the ice: ""So what should I be doing? Do you want me to make it look like this is hard for me?"" Watching 26-year-old Honnold climb, it seems impossible. Mortimer, also a climber, first discovered him in 2008, and he was so amazed that he started turning his climbs into documentaries. As with the routes Honnold scales, it has taken many small moves to get here. ""He was a horrible kid to raise, from the day of his birth, and I mean that literally,"" says his mother, Dierdre Wolownick. ""He was always trying to get vertical. At 11 hours old, he would hold on to your pinkie and stand up on his little legs."" Soon his mother would have to get used to him climbing on counters, refrigerators, bookshelves, and everything else. He found his outlet when he was about 10 years old and a climbing gym opened in Sacramento, California, where he lived. He found his passion and his home, hanging on walls. He started working at the gym when he got older. After hours, when the supervisors went home, he and his friends would try climbing without a rope, and that started a passion that has only grown in the 17 years since. Extreme kayaker helps young adults with cancer through outdoor adventures . ""It was exciting. It was also kind of scary, but I really liked it,"" Honnold remembers. Honnold graduated high school and took the next logical step for a smart kid, to the University of California, Berkeley. But after his first year, he faced some difficult challenges. He wasn't happy at school, didn't have many friends, and then in 2004, his father passed away. Around the same time he placed second at the Youth Nationals climbing competition, realized that was one of the few things that made him happy, and decided to chase his dream. ""At first I didn't even have a car. I had a bicycle and a tent, and it was pretty grim,"" he remembers. ""But I just wanted to climb all the time, so that's what I did."" His dedication paid off as his name started circulating in the climbing world and sponsors started calling. Soon he was able to support his lifestyle and to attempt things that had never been done. This includes his most recent feat of climbing the ""Yosemite Triple"" on his own in one day, about a 7,000-foot course. Mortimer remembers when he first met Honnold, ""He was so self-confident and so calm. His vision of what was possible in climbing was, 'Anything is possible.' I mean the first things he free-soloed, people thought it was a joke, it wasn't even possible."" Climbing friends gave him the nickname ""No Big Deal"" because of his nonchalant attitude toward incredible feats. Honnold climbs with a rope 90% of the time, but every year, he'll take on one or two epic challenges with no rope at all. Honnold's demeanor is a clash of the uber-confidence you'd expect of someone who would climb a 3,000-foot wall with no rope vs. the modesty of an average climber. ""I'm one of the best soloists ... but only because there's been like eight really good soloists ever, so it's not that hard to be one of the best,"" he claims. But many, including Mortimer, would disagree. ""On the physical side, he's an elite climber. In the mental game, Alex is inarguably the greatest in the history of the sport. His ability to be composed in the most extreme positions is beyond wherever anyone has gone or thought they could go."" Watching him defy gravity raises the question: How long he can sustain this lifestyle? He travels the country, sleeping in a van, and regularly tackles dangerous climbing destinations all over the world. But people close to him believe he'll be around for the long haul. ""He's very, very calculated, and he has this ability to stay even-keeled when climbing. So I don't think there's a high probability that he will fall,"" says Mortimer. His mother agrees, ""I'm his mother, of course I worry about his safety. But I think he's very in tune with what he's capable of."" 2 American climbers found dead in Peruvian mountains . Now Honnold faces his biggest challenge of all: fame. He's become somewhat of a legend in the climbing world after documentaries like Peter Mortimer's ""Alone on the Wall"" have made the film circuit, and his 2011 appearance on ""60 Minutes"" expanded his audience. The sudden exposure caused him to run away the same way he did college. ""I kind of dealt with it by fleeing back into the van and embracing my old style of just being on the road,"" he says. ""But then I realized that won't fly. So I've spent the last few months going the other direction, embracing all the craziness. Hopefully channeling it to do something positive."" Honnold is getting more comfortable in the spotlight. His list of sponsorships has expanded from The North Face to include even a luxury watch line. His most recent climb is featured in another film to be released this year, and he's appeared in a popular Citibank commercial. He is now working on starting a nonprofit that will help the environment, a cause he cares about deeply. ""Hopefully I can translate all this into something that will have a more lasting effect on the world."" says Honnold. He has a shot to be a recognizable character in a sport that hasn't yet had its Michael Jordan, a crossover hit with the general public. ""Nonclimbers can relate to him in a way that they can't relate to regular rope climbers. What he's doing is overcoming a basic human fear.

"A Chinese obstetrician convicted of selling babies after telling their parents they were sick has been given a suspended death sentence, China's Xinhua news agency reported Tuesday. Zhang Shuxia, a maternity doctor at a hospital in Shaanxi province, in central China, sold seven babies to a trafficking ring in six separate cases from November 2011 to July 2013, according to statements posted on the official microblog account of the local court. She persuaded her patients that their newborns were sick and they should give them up, according to the Weinan Intermediate People's Court. One baby died after being sold. Xinhua said the death penalty had a two-year reprieve, which typically means her sentence is likely to be life imprisonment if she doesn't commit any crimes during that period. The ring was exposed in July when a mother surnamed Dong told police she suspected her baby had been abducted after Zhang told her that her child had a congenital disease, Xinhua reported when Zhang went on trial in December. ""The doctor told me that my son could not go to school and might endanger society as his mother was infected with syphilis and hepatitis,"" Xinhua quoted the father as saying. The court heard that Zhang sold the baby the same night for $3,500 to an individual identified as Pan in neighboring Shanxi province. Pan sold the baby onto a villager in Henan province for 59,800 yuan ($9,900.) The baby was found and returned to his parents on August 5. Twin baby girls, which Zhang sold for 30,000 yuan ($5,000) in May 2013, were reunited their parents in August after their mother Wang Yanyan filed a complaint. Zhang told her the twins had serious health issues and would be brain damaged or paralyzed. ""I never suspected that she was selling my babies, because she was a family friend,"" Wang told CNN in  August. Nine suspects were detained including Zhang, who pleaded guilty and expressed remorse in court. ""I am deeply sorry for the pain I have brought to those families and beg for forgiveness,"" said Zhang. The court said in a statement it believed Zhang should receive a severe penalty: ""Her actions violated professional ethics and social morals. Although she partly admits her guilt, her case is considered serious."" The court did not say whether Zhang would appeal.","A Chinese obstetrician has been sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve .

"Incoming Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday he expects to legally challenge President Barack Obama's new immigration action ""in the next two weeks."" Abbott, currently the attorney general in Texas, said he's reaching out to other governors and top state attorneys about joining the expected lawsuit. ""Our constitutional structure does not work when our president is untethered from the law. That is what has happened here,"" he said at a news conference Monday. Abbott's charge against Obama's executive order limiting deportations has vaulted the Republican onto the national stage, giving him a lead role on a prominent issue just as he prepares to replace outgoing Gov. Rick Perry. RELATED: Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli on immigration lawsuit: 'Take it slow' He accused Obama on Monday of violating the Constitution's requirement that the president faithfully execute laws passed by Congress, and said Obama's move is dangerous because it paves the way for future presidential candidates to claim, for instance, that they would waive penalties for Americans who didn't pay taxes. He said the attorney general's office is currently conducting ""research and analysis"" on a legal challenge and is contacting other states with status updates. Oklahoma officials have already said they expect to sue, and others -- including Indiana Gov. Mike Pence -- have said they're considering joining the challenge, as well. He said a 2012 Obama order deferring the deportation of ""dreamers"" -- undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, who would have gained legal status under a bill dubbed the ""DREAM Act"" that never became law -- led to ""millions of dollars in costs to schools, to law enforcement, to health care"" in Texas. ""If history repeats itself even in the slightest, Texas will once again sustain consequences from the president's executive order,"" Abbott said.","Texas Gov.-elect Greg Abbott says the state is preparing to challenge President Obama's immigration order in court .

"China has smashed four child-trafficking rings and arrested more than a thousand people for using websites and instant messaging groups to trade babies, Chinese authorities said Friday. On February 19, police from 27 provinces across China rescued 382 babies and arrested 1,094 people suspected of buying and selling infants online, China's Ministry of Public Security said in a statement on its website. The sting was part of a six-month operation launched after police in Beijing and Jiangsu in eastern China received reports of a website promoting private adoptions. Potential buyers . Further investigations uncovered a virtual black market -- involving four websites, online forums and some 30 groups on a popular Chinese messaging platform -- that connected traffickers with potential buyers. The ministry said some of the people arrested confessed to using the sites. According to local media reports, 27 suspects were arrested in the country's southern Sichuan province, where 13 babies were also rescued. Another 43 suspects were arrested and 11 babies rescued in Anhui province, in eastern China. A woman arrested by police in Leshan, Sichuan admitted to buying two baby girls from Wuhan and Chengdu, in August 2013 and January 2014, respectively, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported. Another couple in their 30s told CCTV they used a Chinese website to buy a baby from an expectant teenage couple in Chengdu. They paid 20,000 yuan (US$3,250) for the child. It is not known where the other arrests took place. Major concern . Child trafficking has become a major concern in China, as traffickers seek to profit off a growing demand for healthy babies from potential adoptive parents both in China and beyond. Last month, a Chinese doctor received a suspended death sentence for selling babies to a trafficking ring. The woman, an obstetrician at a hospital in Shaanxi province in central China, sold seven babies in six separate cases after persuading her patients that their newborns were sick and should be given up, according to statements posted on the local court's official microblog account.

"I left my daughter in my car on a hot summer day. It was in July 2007, and I remember that day as if it were yesterday. My husband and I drove to Home Depot. I wanted to buy herbs for my new garden. He wanted to buy power tools. Our 5-year-old son stayed behind with my mother, but we decided to bring our 14-month-old baby girl along. She was cranky that day, and a car ride always soothed her and made her fall asleep. We strapped her into a rear-facing baby seat -- they're safer.  We parked, turned off the ignition, closed the sun roof tight and locked the doors. I went to get a shopping cart while my husband stood by the car waiting. We then walked together past the car and toward the crowded Home Depot. Walking into the garden center, my husband turned to me and said: ""My God. We left Paloma in the car."" I screamed, dropped my purse, ran to the car and opened the door.  The car was already warm.  Her face already flushed.  But she was fine and still sleeping.  I was ashamed, embarrassed and horrified at what I had done. It dawned on me immediately -- I could have killed my girl. But the son of Justin Ross Harris, 22-month-old Cooper, did die. Harris left Cooper in a hot car, strapped to his rear-facing seat in Atlanta last week, when he went into work at a Home Depot corporate office, according to a Cobb County criminal warrant. Witnesses describe Harris' reaction as very distressed, as he repeatedly asked: ""What have I done?"" But investigators have implied that this might have been premeditated. Police are still investigating, but Harris has pleaded not guilty to charges of child cruelty and felony murder. If he is convicted, he could spend the rest of his life in prison. But what if this was just a tragic accident -- the type of accident that happens every single year?  In 2013, 44 children died from vehicle-induced heat stroke.  About 450 children in the U.S. have died this way since 1998. ""It's reasonable to call this an epidemic,"" says memory expert David Diamond, a scientist at the Veterans' Hospital in Tampa, Florida, who is often consulted on such cases. ""It happens, on average, once a week from spring to early fall."" Parents everywhere are talking about the Harris tragedy -- in restaurants, in homes and on social media -- and many want him prosecuted even if this was an accident. On Facebook, Matthew Leahla Wierson writes: ""If he's not punished for his gross negligence, then that sends a get-out-of-jail-free card to all parents who are evil and want to murder their children."" Stephanie Lowry writes: ""It's beyond me how ANY parent can forget their baby in a car! I was 15 when I had my first son and NEVER managed to even ALMOST forget either one of my THREE boys! EVER!"" Before I left Paloma in that hot car, I would have agreed with Matthew and Stephanie. I would have said that you must prosecute even those parents who leave their kids in a hot car accidentally because you must send a message to parents that they have an obligation to protect their children. Before I left Paloma in that hot car, I would have said that the anguish that this parent would feel is not enough of a punishment. Had you asked me about one of these cases, I would have told you that I am a watchful mother and would never, ever do that. But I left her. My husband did, too. If Justin Harris left his son accidentally, he should not face charges. Period.  How can you prosecute a parent for accidentally leaving a child in a car? There is no crime. There is no intent. And trust me, his anguish will be punishment enough. I punish myself all the time for leaving my girl in that car for a few minutes. So I'm reserving judgment on this one. I need more facts. Is there a history of abuse? A bitter divorce and custody battle? Internet searches for how to kill a child? Is there evidence of intent -- or was this the case of a hardworking, harried, watchful, loving, adoring, protective parent who made a horrible mistake? I hope by coming forward, I have prevented another parent from saying the words that are so hard for me to say: ""I left my child in a car on a hot summer day.""","Justin Ross Harris' toddler son died, left in a hot car while Harris went to work .

"President Barack Obama called for calm Monday night, moments after a Missouri prosecutor announced there would be no indictment against the police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown. His measured tone stood in stunning contrast to the images of violence on the streets of Ferguson that intensified on a split screen. As the President spoke -- warning protesters that throwing bottles and smashing car windows won't help -- some members of the crowds of hundreds in Ferguson were doing just that. Police responded by firing tear gas. Obama said anger over a grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson is an ""understandable reaction."" But he urged protesters to remain peaceful and called on law enforcement officers in the city of Ferguson to exercise ""care and restraint in managing peaceful protests that may occur."" ""We are a nation built on the rule of law, and so we need to accept that this decision was the grand jury's to make,"" Obama said late Monday night. ""There are Americans who agree with it and there are Americans who are deeply disappointed, even angry. It's an understandable reaction. But I join Michael's parents in asking anyone who protests this decision to do so peacefully."" Elsewhere in the country, angry demonstrators took to the streets peacefully in New York, Seattle, Chicago and Washington, as more than 120 vigils and gatherings were organized nationwide. Some are scheduled for Tuesday. Holder: Federal Ferguson investigation will continue . The President said the inflamed tensions over the case, both in Ferguson and elsewhere, are in part a result of decades-old strains in race relations. ""There is inevitably going to be some negative reaction, and it'll make for good TV,"" Obama said. ""But what we want to do is to make sure that we're also focusing on those who can offer the kind of real progress that we know is possible -- that the vast majority of people Ferguson, the St. Louis region, in Missouri and around the country are looking for,"" he said. ""I want to be partners with those folks and we need to lift up the kind of constructive dialogue that is taking place."" Asked whether he will visit Ferguson, Obama said: ""Let's take a look and see how things are going."" He pointed to Attorney General Eric Holder's visits to the area. While most protesters demonstrated peacefully, the situation on the ground worsened overnight among smaller pockets of the Ferguson area. More than a dozen buildings were set ablaze. A police car was smash, while another was engulfed in fire. Gunshots could be heard and looting took place. In nearby Dellwood, a row of cars were set afire at a car dealership, as more businesses were torched. The grand jury's decision not to indict Wilson was sharply criticized by the chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Marcia Fudge, who called the proceedings a ""miscarriage of justice."" 'A thousand Fergusons across America' ""It is a slap in the face to Americans nationwide who continue to hope and believe that justice will prevail,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""This decision seems to underscore an unwritten rule that black lives hold no value; that you may kill black men in this country without consequences or repercussions. This is a frightening narrative for every parent and guardian of black and brown children, and another setback for race relations in America."" Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican, said he joins Brown's family in urging protesters to remain peaceful -- and said he hopes to see law enforcement officers improve their tactics after Brown's death. ""I've talked extensively to law enforcement officials to learn more about the tactics, resources, and procedures that our first responders utilize statewide,"" Blunt said in a statement. ""Law enforcement officials have been candid in identifying ways officers could have handled the situation in Ferguson better, and I trust those recommendations will be helpful as we continue to count on them to protect us.""

"The Connecticut medical examiner has ruled the death of a 15-month-old boy who was left in his father's car in July a homicide. The cause of Benjamin Seitz's death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure, the state medical examiner said on Wednesday. On July 7, Kyle Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care in Ridgefield, Connecticut, but the drop-off never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN last month. Seitz drove to work, and at the end of the day he went to pick Ben up at day care, only to realize he was not there. That was when Seitz found his son in the car. He rushed the child to the hospital, but Ben had died. A grieving mother's mission to stop hot car deaths . No criminal charges have been announced in the boy's death, but state prosecutors said Wednesday that the criminal investigation is ""ongoing."" ""The autopsy report is one factor to be considered by the state's attorney in the evaluation of the incident once the investigation is complete,"" a statement released by State's Attorney Stephen J. Sedensky said. Neither prosecutors nor Ridgefield Police provided further comment. Despite the medical examiner's ruling, the decision about whether to press criminal charges is made by the state's attorney, said CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan. ""The use of the word 'homicide' in an autopsy report, though often seen in connection with criminal cases, does not necessarily mean that criminal charges will be lodged against the father,"" Callan said. ""In legal parlance, the term means that death was caused by another human being rather than by strictly natural causes,"" he added. Benjamin Seitz's death came in the wake of the June case of 22-month-old Cooper Harris, whose death after being left in a hot car in Georgia drew international attention. His father, Justin Ross Harris, pleaded not guilty to murder and child cruelty charges after leaving Cooper in the backseat of his car for an entire workday in the sweltering heat. Harris said he forgot the child was in the car. Investigators say he researched how hot a car needs to be to kill a child, and that while his son was dying in the parking lot, Harris was sending explicit text messages to several women. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths? According to child advocacy group KidsAndCars.org, 44 children died of heatstroke in cars in 2013, and more than 500 have died in hot cars since 2000. In the wake of his death, Rogers-Seitz created a blog called ""The Gift of Ben,"" which she has said she is using to bring attention to the number of children who die of heatstroke in cars and to press for action to save lives. About 50% of cases involving deaths of infants abandoned in automobiles result in criminal charges, Callan said, adding that each case is ""highly individual."" ""The criminal law generally does not punish for accidental events absent evidence of gross negligence, recklessness or a depraved indifference to the value of human life,"" Callan said. Seitz family attorney Bob Gulash told CNN he could not comment on the ongoing investigation. In a post from August 15, Rogers-Seitz wrote that she ""realized the hardest part of this journey is not that we believe we cannot live without you, Ben. It is that we know and feel we have a long life ahead of us, and we must live it without you physically in our arms."" The post ends: ""We miss and cherish you Benjamin.""","Fifteen-month-old Benjamin Seitz was left in his father's hot car on July 7 .

"A plane full of illegal migrants were flown from Israel back to Africa on Sunday night, the first of what potentially could be thousands of such deportations of people who have illicitly entered the Middle Eastern country in recent years. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a Cabinet meeting Sunday ""the first plane of illegal infiltrators (would) leave for South Sudan"" that night, with another aircraft set to depart next week for Africa. ""Today, the government will begin the operation to repatriate illegal work infiltrators to their countries of origin,"" Netanyahu said, according to a cabinet communique released by Israel's foreign ministry. ""We will do this is an orderly and dignified manner. The issue of illegal African migrants has been of growing concern in the country in recent months. According to government records, more than 59,000 illegal African immigrants have entered the country in recent years through its southern border with Egypt. Most of the migrants come from Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. Some of them have refugee status and hold temporary permits to remain in the country, but Israel does not recognize the status of most of them and says it is looking for ways to send them back to their home countries. More than 2,000 new migrants have been reported over the past month. Some residents of southern Tel Aviv neighborhoods, where there is a large concentration of Africans, have blamed their new neighbors for increasing crime and suffocating the infrastructure and public services. Some also complain the illegal immigration is changing the fabric of Israel. Earlier this month, an Israeli court approved a government plan to deport 1,500 migrants from Africa. Many Israeli refugee agencies and officials pushed against those plans and called on the government to allow the migrants to stay. And Israeli authorities announced last Tuesday that they'd detained 240 illegal migrants -- all of them Sudanese -- as part of the controversial plan, with another 300 people volunteering to return to their country of origin. ""We are sending the infiltrators, migrants, back to their homes like all countries in the West, in Europe, in the USA act when dealing with migrants,"" Interior Minister Eli Yishai said then. In his remarks Sunday to Cabinet, Netanyahu said that construction of a fence along Israel's southern border will be finished ""in the coming months."" Until then, any migrant who is caught crossing the border illegally will be detained ""immediately,"" with Netanyahu noting that ""holding facilities"" are being built to ""to house tens of thousands of infiltrators until they can be sent out of the country."" The prime minister vowed to block such illegal migrants' entry into Israel and, if they do get in, to ""hasten their deportation."" He also pointed to a law, recently passed by the Knesset, the boosts fines on those who employ illegal migrants. Still, while making clear they weren't welcome in Israel, Netanyahu stressed that they would be treated well. ""We have a Jewish tradition of treating strangers humanely,"" he said, ""And even when we need to deport them from our midst due to the state's desire to control its borders, we must do so humanely and in a manner that finds expression in a restrained and humane manner.""","Israel's prime minister says a plane of illegal migrants will depart for South Sudan .

"(CNN) -- We all know the slogans meant to express empathy and solidarity: ""We are Columbine."" ""We are all New Yorkers."" ""I am Trayvon Martin."" The ""We are Ferguson"" messages have already begun, and we will likely see more. The well-intended connections seldom work. Most of us are not Columbine because most of us did not lose children in our community in a high school mass shooting. We are not all New Yorkers because only some of us experienced the aftermath of 9/11 at Ground Zero. I am not Trayvon Martin because I am not a black male. Are we Ferguson? That's a harder question. Ferguson has a median household income of $36,645 and an unemployment rate topping 13%. And as the world now knows, Ferguson's overwhelmingly white police force arrests blacks at a pace nearly four times higher than whites. On the other hand, although you wouldn't know it from most of the news coverage, Ferguson is also one of the most racially integrated municipalities in Missouri. It includes not only working-class blacks and white professionals, but also black professionals and working-class whites. And many of Ferguson's residents bridge racial and socioeconomic lines in their neighborhoods. With all of its complexities, Ferguson does not sound like my world. I teach at Washington University, where most of my colleagues and students are white. I shop at mostly white places that feel safe and convenient. Most of the contentious issues in my mostly white neighborhood are about bike paths and trees. Many of you live in my world. It would be easy for those in my world to say we are not Ferguson. But highlighting our differences misses something important: We are part of the reason for the circumstances that it confronts today. We may not be Ferguson, but we helped make Ferguson. That we made Ferguson is reflected in politics and geography. Ferguson is one of dozens of municipalities nestled around St. Louis. Like many large urban areas in this country, each St. Louis municipality is separately incorporated with its own police force, schools and tax base. I pass through three of them to get to my local grocery store -- and Ferguson's burned down QuikTrip is just seven miles from my workplace and house. In the best cases, these divisions create the possibility for good local government and communities where friendship and civic involvement can flourish. In the worst cases, they provide opportunities for self-interest and exploitation. St. Louis has some of the best; it also has some of the worst. The worst cases are often tied to the issues of race and class. We made Ferguson because our choices reinforce racial and class divisions that manifest not only in cultures and attitudes, but also in schools, neighborhoods, churches and businesses. Many of us do not live in large urban areas. But we, too, made Ferguson because we're complicit in a system of criminal justice that disproportionately harms black men, and therefore, the black community. We made Ferguson because we do not address the vast and growing injustices for America's poor -- black and white. We made Ferguson because too many of us would rather tweet than get involved in the messiness of local politics and community building. The hard work of solving problems doesn't happen from hashtag campaigns or writing blog posts and articles -- like this one. We made Ferguson because we have more tolerance for riots after sporting events than for citizens protesting injustice. We stand by and watch the government's most egregious violations of our First Amendment rights when the protests are about the things that matter most. And that's true not only of the initial police response to Ferguson, but also of the restrictions placed on many of the Occupy demonstrations, on some labor protests and in many other instances of political and religious dissent in recent years. Ferguson does not have any easy solutions. But we need to begin by talking about the problems in a more honest and self-reflective way. We need to start having the tough conversations that many of us too often avoid out of fear, ignorance or inconvenience. Some of us have been engaged in these conversations for a long time. But many of us, especially many people whose lives and neighborhoods and workplaces look a lot like mine, have not yet begun. Whether we've already been talking or are just about to start, we need to risk awkwardness and misunderstanding as we stumble toward dialogue. And we need to extend grace to one another as we take those risks. But we can't just talk. We need to be willing to share time and experiences that lead to friendships, not just conversation partners. We might look to Ferguson to see what else must come next: learning about the issues, better supporting local businesses and nonprofits, expanding voter registration and voter education, monitoring local courtrooms and bureaucrats and holding accountable those officials who have used their power for harm rather than for good. We can do these things after the cameras go away and where the cameras have never been. We may not all put bodies on the line for the largely peaceful demonstrations. But we can put them on the line in the months and years to come -- by choosing to engage in the slow and difficult work of restoring communities. We owe at least that much to Ferguson and to all the Fergusons across our country.","John Inazu: Slogans like ""We are all Columbine"" aren't true, nor is ""We are Ferguson""

"New devices intended to prevent children from dying of heat stroke in parked vehicles are unreliable, and should not be used as stand-alone measures to prevent such tragedies, the federal government warned Monday. The devices, which sense the presence of a child in a car after the adult walks away, were determined to be ""inconsistent and unreliable"" and could give parents a false sense of security, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration chief David Strickland said. ""Though well-intentioned, we cannot recommend parents and caregivers rely on technology to prevent these events from occurring,"" Strickland said. The warning is the latest concerning a phenomenon that has befuddled safety experts and terrified parents: the unintentional abandonment of children in cars.  In many cases, parents or caregivers -- stressed by heavy workloads or distracted by minor changes in their normal routine -- absent-mindedly leave children in cars, only to later discover them dead or suffering from hyperthermia. Indeed, heat stroke is the leading cause of non-crash vehicle deaths for children under the age of 14, the safety agency said. A total of 527 children have died of heat stroke in cars since 1998, an average of 38 children a year, it said. In about 51% of the cases, a parent or caregiver forgot about the child. In another 17%, an adult intentionally left a child in the vehicle, apparently unaware that heat can quickly rise to deadly levels even on mildly warm days. And in 30% of the cases, the child entered an unlocked, unattended vehicle. The tragedies have prompted a number of manufacturers to develop products to remind parents to check their cars. Though some devices offer simple reminders to check on children, the safety agency's study, conducted by the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, focused on devices that sense the presence of a child in a safety seat or restraint and alert the caregiver if he or she walks away from the car. ""We evaluated whether the device notified the caregiver as they walked away from the vehicle, and we measured the distance at which the alarm sounded,"" said Kristy Arbogast, the study's author. ""The results showed that none of these three devices ... were completely reliable and consistent in their function and ability to detect children."" Researchers noted numerous problems with the devices, saying some require the adults to adjust the position of the child within the restraint, some can't function in the presence of liquids, and some are hampered by cell phone interference. Arbogast commended manufacturers for attempting to address the safety issues, and said they are working to refine their technologies. The government stopped short of advising parents not to use the devices, saying they could be used as part of a ""layered"" approach to protecting a child. Instead, the safety agency advises that drivers should make a habit of looking in vehicles -- front and back -- before locking the doors and walking away. They should also place a Teddy Bear or note on the front seat as a reminder that a child is in the car, or place a cell phone, purse or briefcase in the back seat to ensure no child is accidentally left in the vehicle. They also suggest asking child care providers to call if a child does not show up for care as expected. Importantly, none of the aftermarket devices protect against a child entering an unlocked vehicle. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said parents should teach children a vehicle is not a play area, and should store keys out of the reach of children. Agency officials said heat stroke tragedies have befallen people of all education levels and all walks of life. During an agency conference call with reporters Monday, Reginald McKinnon, a supervisor for a telecommunications company, described losing his young daughter after unintentionally leaving her in a car in 2010. He didn't realize his error until returning to his SUV and opening the vehicle to put down his laptop computer. ""That's the exact moment I'll never forget,"" McKinnon said. ""To my horror, I realized Payton was still in her car seat. It's the last thing I remember. I heard someone screaming; it was me."" McKinnon said he still doesn't understand how the incident occurred. ""I know you must be asking yourself, how did he forget his own child? And it's a legitimate question, and it's one I've asked myself every day for over two years now. ""And regardless of the painful hours of soul searching, therapy and prayers my family and I have undergone, it's a question that remains unanswered: How did I forget my child?"" He added that ""experts will tell you that it can happen to anybody. They say our busy lifestyles can create enough stress to trigger mental lapses.

"People wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards are banned from riding public buses during the Xinjiang Sports Games in northwestern China, a Communist Party-run newspaper reports. The ban went into effect Monday in the city of Karamay, in the country's restive northwestern Xinjiang region. It applies to passengers who wear veils, large beards, as well as three types of Islamic dresses -- including those with the star and crescent symbol -- according to the Karamay Daily, a newspaper affiliated to the Chinese Communist Party. Dozens of public bus stations in the city will be manned by security personnel to conduct checks. The bus ban is being touted as one of a number of a security measures as the city hosts the 13th Xinjiang Sports Games, a large event in the autonomous region, the paper said, citing the event's organizing committee. The ban will be enforced through August 20, when the Games come to an end. Officials said those who violate the ban will be reported to the police, the paper reported. Uyghur rights groups have criticized the measure, calling it a ""green-light"" for racism. ""Officials in Karamay city are endorsing an openly racist and discriminatory policy aimed at ordinary Uyghur people,"" Uyghur American Association president, Alim Seytoff said in a statement. ""The concern is officials feel they can flaunt the laws of China in order to implement Xi Jinping's one year anti-terror campaign that appears more and more to be a wholesale onslaught against the Uyghur peoples' religious beliefs and practices. ""What this bus ban tells us is that Uyghurs in China have fewer rights than other citizens, even in their homeland, and that it green-lights discrimination against Uyghurs by ordinary Han Chinese."" Dozens of public bus stations in the city will be manned by security personnel to conduct checks. The ban on bus riders wearing beards and Islamic-style clothing does not specifically single out Uyghurs, but its language clearly points to them as potential targets of the restrictions. It comes about a month after the Chinese authorities in the region banned students and civil servants from fasting during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month. In recent years, the Xinjiang region has seen an uptick in violence between Uyghurs and Han Chinese over economic and other issues. Last week, nearly 100 people -- most of them ""terrorists,"" according to state media -- were killed in an attack in the region. A total of 37 civilians died, and police ""gunned down 59 terrorists,"" the Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua reported, bringing the death toll to 96. There have been numerous attacks in the region, where tensions are simmering between Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic people, and Chinese Han people. A Muslim separatist group founded by militant Uyghurs has been blamed for terrorism in the area, the Council on Foreign Relations explains. Xinhua said the ""mastermind"" behind the attack last week ""had close connections with the terrorist organization,"" known as the East Turkestan Islamic Movement. Karamay is a resource-rich city of some 450,000 people located in northwest Xinjiang, which has a dense Uyghur population.","Bus ban criticized as ""green-light"" for racism against Uyghurs in Xinjiang .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's disapproval rating has reached a new high of 55% while the number of Americans who think he is a strong leader has dropped to a new low, 48%, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday. And a familiar pattern in public opinion on Obama again asserts itself: Americans don't like his track record on major issues while they continue to like him personally. Nearly eight in 10 respondents say Obama is likeable; large majorities believe he is compassionate, hard-working, and has a vision for the country's future. Three-quarters think he fights for his beliefs. But only 39% approve of how he is handling unemployment, and just 36% approve of the way he is handling the economy, not surprising when more than eight in 10 think the economy is in poor shape. Opinion on Obama's economic track record is mixed, however. While fewer than one in 10 (9%) think his policies have made the economy better, about four in 10 (39%) credit them with preventing the economy from being even worse than it is today. On the other side, 37% say Obama has made economic conditions worse. Fifteen percent think his policies have had no effect. Overall, 55% now say they disapprove of how he is handling his job as president. That's one point higher than the 54% disapproval rating he routinely hit in polls taken in July and August. Forty-three percent now say they approve of how Obama is handling his job overall. That is not an all-time low for him; he hit 42% a year ago. Six in 10 say Obama has fallen short of their expectations. Those numbers are not great, but they're way better than the 15% who approve of how Congress is handling its job. One piece of good news for Obama is that his standing among the Democratic base has turned the corner after a drop in the wake of the debt ceiling agreement. The number of Democrats who wanted the party to renominate Obama dropped to an all-time low of 70% in early August, but it rose to 72% in the previous poll and 76% in the current survey. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 9-11, with 1,038 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. The sampling error for the question asked only of Democrats is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.","Overall, 55% of Americans say they disapprove of how Obama is doing as president .

"Gail Sandidge rushed to help when screams rang out during a stabbing at a Texas medical center on Tuesday. Horrified patients and family members watched as a man stabbed the nurse in the chest. ""She was just saying...'I'm hurt. He got me,'"" witness Jana Jackson told CNN affiliate KLTV. ""And that's when we realized there was blood all on the front of her scrubs."" Hours later, authorities pronounced Sandidge dead. Police said four others were wounded when 22-year-old suspect Kyron Templeton attacked visitors and employees Tuesday morning at Good Shepherd Ambulatory Surgical Center in Longview, Texas. The hospital's president told reporters that the dedicated nurse died trying to save her patients. ""Nurses are protectors by nature. And Gail, she fit that profile,"" said Steve Altmiller, head of Good Shepherd Health Systems. ""She was protecting her patients in an act of courage today, and in so doing, she lost her life."" He described Sandidge as ""a seamstress, a Sunday-school teacher of 2-year-olds, a huge Baylor fan, a mother, a grandmother, a healer, a trainer, a mentor, a nurturer."" She had worked for the hospital for nearly two decades, he said. Police arrested Templeton on a street near the hospital, KLTV reported. He was arraigned on one count of first-degree murder and four counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon Tuesday. But authorities haven't identified a motive, a police spokeswoman said. Witnesses told KLTV they saw a man running through the surgery center around 7 a.m. with a hunting knife, screaming, ""You're not going to kill my mother."" ""He had a death grip on the knife and he was just muttering and his eyes were kind of wild-looking,"" said Jackson's husband, Chad. ""It was just, he was very confused."" Moments later, the surgery center about 120 miles east of Dallas turned into a crime scene. Some staff members rushed patients into safe areas. Others performed CPR on the victims, Chad Jackson told KLTV. One of the injured victims remained in critical condition Tuesday afternoon, Altmiller said. Another is in good condition. Two others, including a hospital employee, were treated and released, he said. Templeton is being held on $2.6 million bond as the investigation continues, KLTV reported. Meanwhile, the Jacksons say they're trying to explain what happened to their two young daughters. ""We're just telling them there's bad people out there,"" Chad Jackson told KLTV. ""There's not a lot of things we can do about the craziness in the world. That's why we go to church. They pray. They say their prayers every night.""

"After Vic Huo graduated from fashion design school in 2007, she landed four jobs as an apparel designer for Chinese brands. The first three jobs, she quit. At her last job, she was fired. Huo's career problems stem largely from the fact that she says her bosses encouraged her to more or less copy international designs rather than to create her own. Management perceived anything too unique to be too much of a business risk: As Chinese consumer tastes still tilt overwhelmingly towards the mainstream, anything off-kilter simply may not sell. ""They just want to copy from the other brands,"" the 26-year-old said. ""They are scared of the creative."" Now Huo says she does not know what to do. Chances of working for an international brand seem slim. She would like to launch her own label, yet funding for independent fashion lines is hard to come by and there's no guarantee the country's brand conscious consumers will buy anything without a famous international label printed ostentatiously on a shirt, bag or other piece of clothing. ""Designers always want to follow their own hearts,"" Huo said. ""But they have to consider the market needs."" No doubt China's once almost non-existent fashion industry is on the verge of exploding. New domestic brands pop up seemingly everyday. Chinese models, like Liu Wen, who has shot campaigns with Calvin Klein, Dolce & Gabbana and Estee Lauder, are increasingly becoming a hot commodity on foreign runways while domestic designers, such as Richard Wu, who debuted mainstream VLOV menswear brand at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week this week in New York, are piquing the interest of the international fashion elite. But for grassroots designers, the fashion landscape is still largely difficult. Aside from money, independent designers say they struggle with coming up with original concepts that represent modern Chinese style. ""In order to establish a foundation, it is important to slow down and look back,"" Qiao Qiao, who founded her womenswear brand One by One with only 40,000 yuan (about $6,000) in Shanghai in 2003, said. ""The problem is every time they [designers] stop and look back, they resort to the period of the Cultural Revolution's style."" The style during the Cultural Revolution, a period between 1966 and 1976 when millions lost their lives in the midst of political violence, was overtly drab. Men and women wore dark colored clothing. Anything remotely stylish was banished as art, music and intellectual endeavors were perceived as bourgeois and thus a threat to the State. A Cultural Revolution aesthetic, so to speak, has had a resurgence in China in the form of kitschy t-shirts, bags and caps, which can be found in a number of artsy boutiques in Shanghai, Beijing and elsewhere. However Qiao Qiao points out that over the past half-century, after China reopened its doors to the rest of the world in 1978, all other influences have been predominantly from the West. The archives of ancient China must be opened to find new inspiration, the designer said. She points to American designer Rick Owens, whose avante-garde clothes draw influence from dynastic times, as an inspiration: ""He is very successful,"" she said. ""But that should be the work Chinese designers do, and yet we cannot surpass him."" Chen Ping, founder of the Pari Chen womenswear brand, is one domestic designer who is trying to slow down and look way back to the country's deeply rich history for inspiration. It has not been easy. Before starting her own fashion label in 2008, Chen said she sat at home ""totally depressed."" ""There was a huge gap between my ideal and the practice and the work. I lost my orientation in the business,"" she said, adding that the market, especially younger segments, cared only about fast fashion rather than fashion as an art form that reinvigorated cultural beauty from the past. Now with no store, no employees, little money and a studio located in an apartment building amidst farmland outside of Shanghai, Chen is struggling to survive. During a good month, she sells maybe around half a dozen of her pieces, which feature flowing swaths of silk and chiffon meant to mimic calligraphy or attire worn by scholars during the Song Dynasty. ""There are many designers who want to do things quickly,"" she said. ""From my perspective, it is important to have a certain amount of time to accumulate your style."" The situation is not so bleak for everyone, especially those who have turned to the internet, specifically Taobao, the country's largest e-commerce platform which is home to countless grassroots stores selling everything from wrenches to  iPhones. Around three years ago, Wei Fu Ying launched her Wing Free brand on the shopping site. Akin to H&M or Topshop, Wei's vintage-inspired designs are hip and chic, targeting teenagers and twenty-somethings. She sells up to 300 pieces of her clothing per day. She is optimistic about her future but tempered on the overall future of homegrown design. ""For those who are really talented, they should just go abroad and they will be recognized,"" Wei said. ""Here, the industry is more based on contacts, relationships and publicity. It is a bit like an illusion."" There are some who are trying to support the local industry, especially those whose designs are more haute couture than high street hip. In Beijing, for example, Hung Huang, a TV host known as the ""Oprah of China,"" has opened a boutique called Brand New China, or BNC. The store features work from select Chinese labels. It's neighbors include famous foreign brands such as Commes de Garcon, Versace and Balenciaga. Chinese celebrities are also helping to drum up demand for homegrown style, according to Annie Wang, an advisor to the Beijing Media Group, which publishes a number of newspapers and magazines. Actress Fan Bingbing wowed global audiences at this year's Cannes Film Festival when she wore a stunning red gown embroidered with white cranes from  up-and-coming domestic designer Bo Kewen. The celebrities ""want to represent China,"" Wang said. ""The whole black tie and Western style is not the Chinese tradition at all, that is why I see there is a market for China to have local designers who know the flavor of the Chinese. But whether this will become a big market in China or not, I don't know. I can only say it is possible.""","China's fashion industry is expanding at a rapid pace .

"After nearly 40 years on the throne, King Juan Carlos I of Spain said Monday that he will be stepping down. It is ""time to hand over to a new generation -- younger, with a lot of energy -- that can, with determination, take on and carry out the changes that the current situation demands, and to face with intensity and determination the challenges of tomorrow,"" he said in a televised statement, according to a CNN translation. ""The long, deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially, but it has also pointed toward a future of hope,"" he said. Crown Prince Felipe, 46, will succeed his father. The King said he decided it was ""time to prepare and pave the way so that he who is in better conditions can continue."" Prince Felipe is ""stable"" and has ""the maturity, the preparation, and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation,"" King Juan Carlos added. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy first announced the King's decision. Spaniards generally hold King Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for his service to the nation and his defense of democracy after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. But the King's popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis. The focus of his reign was to bring about reconciliation between Spaniards of different political persuasions and from different regions. Many consider the King's finest hour to be his decisive stand to halt a right-wing military coup in 1981, when he went on television to say that the monarchy would not tolerate attempts to interrupt democracy by force. Some push for end of monarchy . Thousands of people demonstrated in Madrid and elsewhere, calling for an end to the monarchy altogether  after the announcement Monday. They waved flags and chanted: ""La monarquia es una porqueria!"" In English, that phrase means ""the monarchy is garbage."" On the global campaign website Avaaz.org, a petition calling for a referendum on the future of the monarchy quickly racked up more than 100,000 signatures.  Most were from people indicating that they were in Spain. ""This is a historic opportunity to promote a broad public debate to help regenerate our democracy and determine the future of the monarchy,"" Luis Javier wrote in the petition. The call was echoed on Twitter, with some users also posting photos of elephants, saying they were celebrating the King's abdication. Retirements of monarchs (and a pope) Oversaw democracy's return . Born in Rome in 1938, Juan Carlos didn't set foot in Spain until he was 10. In Franco's Spain, he carried out military training and became the first Spanish officer to hold the rank of lieutenant in all three branches of the military. In 1969, he was invested as crown prince and the designated successor to Franco. On November 22, 1975 -- two days after Franco's death -- Juan Carlos was crowned king of Spain, restoring the monarchy after a 44-year interregnum. In 1977, he enacted political reforms that led to Spain's first democratic election since 1936. During his reign, Spain grew into an economic powerhouse and a vacation playground for Europe. The King and Queen Sofia had three children and numerous grandchildren, styling their monarchy as accessible and relatively austere. Juan Carlos: All you need to know . Hunting trip dented image . The private trip to Botswana in 2012 became public only after King Juan Carlos fell, broke his hip and was rushed back to Madrid for surgery. With millions of Spaniards unemployed, the expense of the African trip caused an outcry. That prompted the king to make a rare apology in which he said he had made a mistake that would not happen again. The King had previously expressed his concern about the impact of the crisis on Spaniards and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times. Other recent scandals have also damaged the monarchy's image. Princess Cristina, the king's youngest daughter, is caught up in a tax fraud and money laundering investigation. She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied any wrongdoing over his business dealings and the alleged diversion of public funds. The scandal has created unprecedented problems for the royal family and kept the country riveted. There have been open calls for the King to abdicate in favor of Prince Felipe, who is seen as untouched by the scandals.

"With Iran's president in New York for the UN General Assembly, an Iranian-American family in Michigan is appealing to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad publicly to have their son - imprisoned in Iran on espionage charges - released before his father dies of brain cancer. In a hospital interview with CNN, the father of former US marine Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, says if his son is not released soon, he will pass away without ever seeing him again. ""Please, please, please release an innocent man,"" pleaded the father, Ali Hekmati, who had a cancerous tumor removed from his brain. ""Reunite him with his father, his mother."" Ali Hekmati's doctor says the cancer is incurable and that he has just months to live. He will undergo radiation treatment and chemotherapy in hopes of extending his life long enough embrace his son one last time. Family pleads for son's release . ""That's my biggest fear, that he may not see me and that's my last wish, to hug him and kiss him before I pass to the other side,"" Ali Hekmati said. Amir Hekmati, a former marine and decorated Iraq war veteran, was born in Arizona and raised in Nebraska and Michigan.  Within weeks of setting foot in Iran for the first time in August 2011 to visit his grandmother, he was arrested, interrogated, imprisoned. Months later he appeared on Iranian TV, showcased as a confessed CIA operative. ""They forced him to do that. That's not true,"" said Hekmati's mother, Behnaz, referring to the alleged confession. ""They knew he was a military (soldier) because he told the Embassy of Iran he was in the military,"" she adds, explaining that her son checked with Iranian authorities in the United States before making the trip. The U.S. State Department also denies Hekmati was spying for the U.S. government and calls the case a gross miscarriage of justice. ""We never thought he should have been arrested. We've been trying, because he's a dual U.S.-Iranian national, we've been trying to get access to him since he was originally locked up,"" said State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland. ""The Iranians have never allowed us to go to see him."" Mother of accused U.S. spy says Iranian charges are false . A court convicted Hekmati of espionage, sentencing him to death, but he has since been granted a retrial. He remains in prison in Iran and has no idea that his father is dying, his family said. He has a government-approved lawyer in Iran, but contact with him has been sporadic. His father's neurosurgeon, Dr. Ryan Barrett, believes the emotional stress of his son's imprisonment will make cancer treatment more challenging. Although the Iranian president has thus far declined to meet with the Hekmatis or discuss Amir's case, the former marine's mother is convinced Ahmadinejad will hear their pleas. ""I'm sure that he's going to hear my voice. He's in the United States; he's going to listen to me,"" said Amir's mother. ""I just want him to hear my voice as a mother."" She has traveled to Iran three times and been granted limited visits. She described her son as disheartened and completely confused as to why he was arrested. ""He is skinny, pale, like a chalk, his face was like chalk. Hair was shaved, had a beard, he walked like this and the feet was together he walked like a robot,"" she said. ""He couldn't stop crying and he was (saying) 'I don't know why I'm here,' Mom.""

"(CNN)  -- At age 13, Hope Witsell struggled in middle school. Not because her class work at Shields Middle School in Ruskin, Florida, was challenging, but because Hope was being bullied. Her friend, Kyla Stich, told CNN that fellow students would ""walk up to her and call her 'slut,' 'whore,' and they would sometimes, they would call her 'skank' and just be really cruel to her."" Another friend, Lexi Leber, said, ""We had to make like a wall, we had people surrounding her, and she had to be in the middle because people would come by and try to hit her and push her into a locker or something. ""She was afraid to walk alone, she was afraid someone would do something to her, like verbally attack her, so she would always have someone with her,"" Leber added. This all started in the spring of 2009 during the last week of school. Friends and family say Hope had ""sexted"" a picture of her breasts to her boyfriend. Another girl from school, they say, got her hands on the photo and sent it to students at six different schools in the area. Before Hope could do anything to stop it, that photo had gone viral. The school alerted Hope's parents. Her mother, Donna Witsell, told CNN how she learned about the photo. ""The assistant principal had a meeting with my husband and I and pretty much told us that he did not see the image but that he had heard that it was Hope and when he confronted Hope, Hope did not deny it. She wasn't proud of it but she didn't lie,"" Hope's mother said. Mrs. Witsell says she had warned her daughter about the dark side of technology, about ""some of the pretty sexual images of young girls and guys."" She added, ""Hope was very aware of that, of inappropriate dress and most definitely posing."" Still, because of that photo, Hope had become a target for 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old bullies. But she didn't share her pain with her parents. Even when bullies wrote horrible things about Hope on a MySpace page called the ""Shields Middle School Burn Book"" and started a ""Hope Hater Page,"" the young girl kept silent. Summer provided a bit of a break, but when the new school year began, the taunting was even worse. On Saturday, September 12, 2009, Hope Witsell helped her father mow the lawn. They cooked a special seafood dinner together as a family. Then Hope disappeared to her room upstairs. Her parents stayed downstairs and watched TV. Donna Witsell will never forget the moment she went to say goodnight to her daughter. ""I went upstairs to go in her room and kiss her goodnight. That was when I found her. I screamed for my husband. And started doing CPR."" It was too late. Hope was already dead. She had used her favorite scarves to hang herself from her canopy bed. After Hope died, her mother learned her daughter had been summoned to meet with a school social worker. A spokesperson for the school says the social worker was concerned Hope might have been trying to hurt herself, so she had Hope sign what's called a ""no harm"" contract in which Hope agreed to talk to an adult if she wanted to harm herself. Hope's mother says she was never told about the contract, which she found crumpled up in the garbage in her daughter's bedroom after she died. School officials told CNN they believed the social worker had tried calling Hope's mother to alert her but weren't sure if she had left a message. ""The school dropped the ball,"" Donna Witsell said. ""The school did not call. We have the digital telephone; we have the cell phones that indicate when there was an incoming call and what number was calling in. We have a house phone, I have a cell phone, my husband has a cell phone. We have emergency contact numbers at the school which was my sister-in-law and her husband. There was no indication that the school called any of those numbers,"" Hope's mother said. Days after Hope died, her older sister, Samantha Beattie, discovered the bullying was still going on. Even in death, Hope could not escape it. ""I knew she had MySpace and Facebook. There were people putting comments on there: 'Did Hope really kill herself?' 'I can't believe that whore did that.' Just obscene things that I would never expect from a 12-year-old or a 13-year-old,"" said Samantha. In the year or so that has passed since Hope Witsell took her own life, her mother has started a group called Hope's Warriors. She hopes it will help combat bullying and save other moms from feeling the horrendous pain that she feels. Donna Witsell has a message for parents: ""It happened to my daughter, it can happen to yours too. No one is untouchable. No one is untouchable."" Watch Anderson Cooper . 360° weeknights 8pm ET.

"Hillary Clinton was making her way around the Hamburg Inn on Wednesday -- a quaint, politically historic family restaurant in Iowa City -- when she got the question. From the back of the restaurant, a young man loudly asked when Clinton was going to announce she was running for president. While the room chuckled, Clinton looked at the chocolate bourbon pecan pie shake in her hand and blurted, ""Love the shake!"" After that, Clinton paid for two shakes and some coffee ($18.26, she put the change in a donation tin on the counter) and exited the establishment with a hearty goodbye. Clinton's non-answer to the question was not surprising. When asked about 2016 in the past, Clinton -- who is likely to make a presidential run but has played coy for the last year -- has done everything from shrug and walk off stage to laugh and say, ""next question."" In this case, though, it was the question, not the answer, that was most telling. Instead of if she'll run, the question was framed as a certainty, like it was a forgone conclusion the former secretary of state was going to make a run at the White House. That could be felt throughout the Hawkeye State. As Clinton visited this week to campaign for Rep. Bruce Braley, the Democratic Senate hopeful, both people who support Clinton and those who don't said the former secretary of state's candidacy is a foregone conclusion and that very few Iowans look at what she is doing as anything but campaigning. ""I'm absolutely sure, absolutely sure,"" said Steven Lucas, a former pipe fitter and labor member, as he stood in line to see Clinton speak in Cedar Rapids. Lucas' opinion comes from what he said were years of watching politicians come through Iowa and play coy about running for president. ""It's the politics of denial,"" said Lucas, a Sen. Elizabeth Warren supporter. ""It is a mind game. It really is."" Iowans are generally more politically tuned in than most voters. Because of the state's place as the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus, bumping into a top flight presidential contender at a local labor hall or barbecue around caucus time is just another day for most Iowans. That familiarity with campaigning has caused Iowa voters to look at what Clinton is doing - traveling the country to support Democrats, spending the last week of her midterm campaign in both Iowa and New Hampshire -- and think the former first lady already made up her mind. ""I know she is running,"" said Deb Lohrer, who stood at the front of the line at one of Clinton's events. ""I think it was obvious years ago."" Clinton did little to tamp down those beliefs while in Iowa on Wednesday, most likely because she doesn't want to. While speaking in Cedar Rapids, Clinton heralded Iowa's astute voters and the state's focus on politics. ""You have a lot to be proud of,"" Clinton said. ""You test your candidates, you actually force them to be the best they can be and they have to be willing to answer the tough questions."" She also tailored her speech to focus on the state. She mentioned devastating floods that rocked Cedar Rapids earlier in the year and thanked the state for opening ""their hearts and homes"" to her during her failed presidential bid in 2008. In addition to Clinton's not too subtle actions, she has had help on the ground in Iowa that has reinforced the idea she already is running. Ready for Hillary, the super PAC urging Clinton to run for president and organizing around her possible candidacy, has made the state a focus and put their money behind nearly the entire slate of 2014 Democrats running in Iowa. To date, the group has donated $123,000 to Iowa candidates, including the Jack Hatch, the gubernatorial hopeful who been consistently polling behind incumbent Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, and all the congressional candidates . Ready for Hillary also loomed large at the final Harkin Steak Fry in September, where the group activated more than 100 volunteers for the event. What's more, the PAC donated $5,000 to the event's account, $10,000 to the Iowa Democratic Party and also purchased the party's voter file data for $20,000. Ready for Hillary's impact is also being felt by everyday Iowans and the state's top political operatives. At Clinton's events on Wednesday, women and men sport baby blue shirts emblazoned with ""Ready,"" swag that group handed out earlier in the year. And to Tyler Olson, the former chair of the Iowa Democratic Party and a Clinton supporter, Ready for Hillary has done a great deal to raise Clinton's already high profile in Iowa. ""I'll be surprised if Secretary Clinton doesn't run, and I think she'd be a great president. Most Iowa caucus-goers I talk to believe she will run and will support her if she does,"" said Olson, who informally advises the Clinton PAC. Standing outside Clinton's first event on Wednesday, people chatted about Braley and whether they thought the Senate hopeful could come from behind to best his Republican opponent. But quickly, the conversation turned to Clinton. Gayle Reese of Newhall, Iowa turned to her friend and reflected on why Clinton was even in Iowa. ""Even my husband asked me, 'Why do you want to go see her,'"" she said to a small group of people. Her blunt answer: ""I told him, 'She is going to run for president.'""","Clinton plays coy on discussing a 2016 bid, but people in Iowa assume she's running .

"(CNN)  -- The Los Angeles City Council overwhelmingly approved a boycott of Arizona-based businesses and governments Wednesday unless the state repeals a new law giving police the power to question a detainee's immigration status. Several other California cities, including San Francisco and Oakland, have already adopted resolutions requesting city departments to not sign any new contracts with Arizona companies. The Arizona law requires immigrants to carry their registration documents at all times and allows police to question individuals' immigration status in the process of enforcing any other law or ordinance. The Los Angeles resolution passed Wednesday said Arizona's new immigration law ""encourages racial profiling and violates Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection for U.S. citizens, legal residents and visitors who are detained for suspicion of being in the country unlawfully."" The city's legislative analyst reported that Los Angeles currently has $56 million in contracts with companies headquartered in Arizona. The city's Harbor Department, which has $26 million of such contracts, is opposing the resolution, the report said. This includes money for the ""Clean Truck Program,"" it said. ""The Harbor does not recommend rescinding this incentive program due to adverse effects this action would have on the environment and public health,"" the analyst wrote. The resolution also prohibits city employees from traveling to Arizona ""unless special circumstances can be demonstrated"" that canceling a trip would ""harm city interests."" The National Council of La Raza announced a boycott last week against Arizona's $18.6 billion tourism industry because of the new law, and called on other groups to join. Nearly 30 organizations have come on board, including the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, People for the American Way, the Japanese American Citizens League and the Service Employees International Union. Critics of the law say it will lead to racial profiling, while supporters say it involves no racial profiling and is needed to crack down on increasing crime involving illegal immigrants.","Los Angeles City Council approves boycott of Arizona-based businesses and governments .

"The United States is now using drones and manned surveillance aircraft over Nigeria in the search for the hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram. But signs of them are yet to emerge, and the task is complicated by the possibility that the girls have been separated into groups. The United States, which is supporting the Nigerian government's efforts, will continue to deepen its efforts, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Wednesday while traveling to Saudi Arabia. However, ""I have seen no intelligence come back that I am aware of that shows that we've located those girls,"" he said. The assets provide some of the best tools to try to find the girls, but the Nigerian government has shown some reluctance to use U.S. help. For now, the United States is not sharing raw intelligence from its surveillance aircraft with Nigeria's armed forces because the countries have still not established the intelligence-sharing protocols and safeguards needed for an intelligence-sharing agreement, Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said. That said, the intelligence gathered through the surveillance flights is being fed to an interdisciplinary team on the ground, and that team is analyzing it and providing advice to the Nigerian government, he said. Warren added that the manned and unmanned aircraft being used are unarmed. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the kidnapping of hundreds of girls an ""unconscionable crime,"" vowing to do ""everything possible to support the Nigerian government to return these young women to their homes and to hold the perpetrators to justice. ""I will tell you, my friends, I have seen this scourge of terror across the planet, and so have you. They don't offer anything except violence,"" he said in a statement. ""They just tell people, 'You have to behave the way we tell you to,' and they will punish you if you don't."" Pressure to find the girls . Wednesday marked one month since the 276 girls were abducted from Chibok by Boko Haram. A worldwide campaign to ""bring back our girls"" has spread awareness of the incident, and as the days go by, the pressure to find them increases. At least four Nigerian soldiers died in an ambush Wednesday as they were returning from patrol duties in Chibok, the Nigerian military said. U.S. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, is among those who support American military intervention to find the girls, if needed. ""You know,  it's interesting to me that when a ship is hijacked and taken into custody by these pirates, we have ... no reservations about going in and trying to take that ship back and the crew that's being held,"" he said. ""We have no compunctions about that."" When it comes to the hundreds of girls who were kidnapped, the response has dragged, he said. A U.S. military operation ""could be done in a way that is very efficient, but for us not to do that, in my opinion, would be an abrogation of our responsibilities,"" McCain said. Two senior administration officials told CNN that it is premature to talk about a special operations incursion into Nigeria because the girls have not been found yet. The U.S. military is there to advise and assist, but not to actively participate, the sources said. If the girls are found, it would be up to the Nigerians to devise a plan and execute it with U.S. assistance, the sources said. And that raises other complications. The Nigerian military is capable of carrying out a rescue operation, but there are concerns because it has been heavy-handed in the past and killed many civilians, the sources said. As it currently stands, U.S. law prohibits the U.S. military from working with Nigerian military units that have been accused of abuses, a senior State Department official said. ""We've been very clear about our concerns about the Nigerian reports of and evidence of abuses by the Nigerian military,"" the official said. Even with all of these complications, the U.S. is committed to doing everything it can to find the girls, the official said. Separately, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan is not considering swapping Boko Haram prisoners for the kidnapped girls, according to media reports, which cited Mark Simmonds, Britain's Africa minister, who met with the President. The director of Nigeria's National Orientation Agency, a government information ministry, had previously said negotiations could be an option.","At least four Nigerian soldiers are killed in an ambush .

"A cadre of top Obama administration information technology officials told Congress on Wednesday that improvements have been made to the problem-plagued HealthCare.gov portal and more are on the way in coming weeks as enrollment in Obamacare was far below what was first anticipated. The administration experts warned the website would ""not be perfect"" on November 30, when the White House has promised it would be running smoothly for most users. Administration: Site won't be perfect on Nov. 30 . Source: Nov. deadline possible . At a hearing on the website, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa asked White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park if the Obamacare website ""will work"" by month's end? Park did not answer yes or no. He said the team assembled to fix it ""is working incredibly hard to meet that goal."" But White House spokesperson Jay Carney told reporters shortly afterward the website overhaul is ""on track"" for the site to be working smoothly for the ""vast majority"" of consumers by the deadline. The website is the primary federal portal for people to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Some states have separate web-based systems for consumers to register as well. Capacity, enrollment fall short . Since it's troubled launch on October 1 when it could not perform the basic functions it was envisioned to do, Park said HealthCare.gov has increased capacity and is now able to handle up to 25,000 users on the site per hour. Additionally, 17,000 are able to register on the website each hour. Although improved, it is still far short of the administration's goal of increasing capacity to at least 50,000 people per hour. Obamacare promises: Where things stand . On signing up, only 26,794 people have completed the enrollment process for health care coverage through the federal insurance marketplace, including HealthCare.gov, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius told reporters on a conference call. In addition, 79,391 have enrolled for coverage through separate state-based exchanges. Obamacare's first month: 106,000 signed up . Map: Enrollment numbers . The government reported that nearly 27 million unique users have visited either HealthCare.gov or state exchange sites since enrollment began on October 1 — 19.5 million of those to the federal site. Park is one of several government IT officers who testified at the 4 1/2-hour Oversight hearing. In the first hour, both Park and Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the problems with the website ""unacceptable."" At times, the question-and-answer session before the Republican-led panel became contentious, not only between witnesses and members of Congress but also between lawmakers. Democrats have accused Issa of over-politicizing the issue. One testy exchange involved Issa and Democrat Rep. Jim Cooper, who likened the hearing to a kangaroo court. Issa shot back. ""This is not a partisan hearing. I will not have it accused of a partisan hearing,"" Issa said. Cooper then said, ""This is a hearing on a broken website by a broken committee."" During his opening statement, Issa said HealthCare.gov ""wasn't a small mistake."" He said it went ""live and effectively exploded on the launch pad."" ""The President should have known,"" Issa added, ""They weren't ready. They weren't close to ready."" Rep. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, demonstrated the website's continuing problems by holding up his iPad and saying he had been trying to use the site for about an 90 minutes. But when he hit the ""create account"" button, it didn't take him to the next screen. The button ""just changes colors."" The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, said in his opening statement that the hearing is motivated by politics and Republicans have no intention of working on a solution to ensure the Affordable Care Act is successful. ""For the past three years, the Number One priority has been to bring down this law,"" Cummings said, referencing the recent government shutdown and repeated attempts by Republicans in the House to repeal or defund the measure approved without Republican support in 2010. Park was subpoenaed . Politics around the hearing had reached fever pitch on Tuesday. Park was subpoenaed last week by Issa, after the White House balked at a request for his voluntary immediate appearance because he is leading the team working feverishly to fulfill a promise that by the end of the month problems will be eliminated on HealthCare.gov. Issa insisted Park appear immediately to explain why the website wasn't ready when it was launched to adequately handle inquiries and enrollment. The White House decided at the last minute to allow him to testify. The site's problems have been a major early policy and political setback for Obama on this issue, but the administration says it is working aggressively to fix it and should have it working smoothly for most people by month's end. Meanwhile, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who served as an economic adviser to  Obama, said the President has not been adequately served by his staff in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. ""He was not well served by his colleagues in the administration,"" Summers said on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""The American people were not well served by the way in which this played out."" White House officials get earful from House Democrats . Summers wrote a memo to the President in 2010 suggesting that HealthCare.gov was not something the government could handle and he needed to bring in experts. While Summers would not provide details about internal discussions, he said Tuesday, ""You need experts. You need to trust but you need to verify. You can't go rushing the schedule when you get behind or you end up making more errors."" Security . Security of personal and financial information was also a topic of concern to committee members. Chao admitted security aspects had not been tested ""thoroughly."" The admission came when Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, a former owner of web consulting business, paraphrased Chao's previous statement about security testing, indicating that Chao said security testing had been conducted ""thoroughly."" Chao jumped in and said ""If I said 'thoroughly,' I apologize."" David Powner, director, Information Technology Management Issues at the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, said security testing was done early on an incomplete system. Powner noted however, that he did have access to testing record after mid-September. ""The fundamental question is what is being done now and is that adequate to date,"" he said. Using his knowledge of web development, Farenthold said HealthCare.gov's design to access information from the IRS and Social Security Administration is a ""target for hackers."" Official: Hackers tried repeatedly to attack Obamacare website . But Chao assured the committee that consumers would be notified if their credit card information has been compromised, adding that ""several laws and rules apply"" that the government is required to follow. Cost of HealthCare.gov . At the hearing, the administration technology officials were stymied by the question: ""how much all this is going to cost us to straighten this out?"" They had no answer. One said they were ""blind to that."" The actual figure of money in the pipeline to last for development and early implementation of the website is north of $630 million.

"The scene was somber, sullen and mostly silent outside the Turkish coal mine. But every so often, the grief came out loud and clear. ""Enough for the life for me!"" yelled one woman -- her arms flailing, tears running down her cheeks -- according to video from Turkish broadcaster DHA. ""Let this mine take my life, too!"" As she was pulled away, she added, ""Enough is enough."" Sadly, the torment for her and many others isn't over. Yes, rescuers did save at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up Tuesday during shift change at the mine in the western Turkish city of Soma, sparking a choking fire deep inside. But another 274 are known dead, according to Turkey's Natural Disaster and Emergency Coordination Directorate. Those who underwent autopsies died of carbon monoxide poisoning, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said. There is every expectation that number will grow. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Wednesday as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine, though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd. As helicopters buzzed overheard and flags flew at half-staff, police and rescue workers were everywhere on the scene Wednesday night. But for most, there was precious little they could do. The smoke rose from openings in the ground showed the continuing dangers both to those trapped and anyone who dared try to get them. Rescue volunteer Mustafa Gursoy told the CNN team at the mine that conditions inside the mine were abominable -- hot, smoky and filled with carbon monoxide. Authorities worked to pump in good air into the mine, so they could get in. However, as Davitt McAteer, a former top U.S. mine safety official points out, sending in oxygen likely would ""increase the likelihood that the fire would grow and continue to put those miners at risk."" These stiff challenges notwithstanding, rescuers haven't given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air. ""If they could reach those emergency rooms and reach their gas masks and close the doors and protect those emergency areas from the poison gas, then they could survive,"" Gursoy said. ""It's possible. We are ready for anything."" But Yildiz, speaking earlier, said ""hopes are diminishing"" of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine. Veysel Sengul has already given up. The miner knew that four of his friends -- at least -- are dead. ""It's too late,"" said Sengul. ""There's no more hope."" Political fallout . The trauma from what already looks like the worst mine disaster in Turkish history has left Soma and the rest of Turkey in shock and, in some cases, in anger. The latest death toll already tops a mining accident in the 1990s that took 260 lives. Even as officials in the United States and elsewhere offered their condolences to his people, Erdogan found himself on the defensive. Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region had filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. In some incidents three people died, in others, five, said opposition spokesman Aykut Erdogdu. And Ozel wanted to get to the bottom of the deaths. Several dozen members of opposition parties signed on to his proposal, but the conservative government overturned it. Some of its members publicly lampooned it, he said. Erdogan questioned Ozel's version, and said the mine had passed safety inspections as recently as March. The mine, owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S., underwent regular inspections in the past three years, two of them this March, Turkey's government said. Inspectors reported no violation of health and safety laws. The company has taken down its regular website and replaced it with a single Web page in all black containing a message of condolence. Not everyone in Soma, at least, has sided with Erdogan, who canceled a trip to Albania to tour the rescue effort and speak to relatives of dead and injured miners. He was met by a chorus of jeers as well as chants of ""Resign Prime Minister!"" while walking through the city Wednesday, according to DHA video. Video from that network, social media messages and pictures posted to Twitter showed hundreds participating in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering in some cases with water cannons and tear gas. While not focused on mine safety, such demonstrations railing against Erdogan and his government have been commonplace in Turkey in recent months, as has the police responding with water cannons and tear gas. In the nation's capital of Ankara, some called for silent demonstration to ""stand for humanity."" Others left black coffins in front of the Energy Ministry and the Labor and Social Security ministry buildings. That grim symbol speaks to the sadness permeating Turkey, whatever one's political bent. For Sengul, the miner waiting by the tunnel entrance for more of his friends to emerge, the mourning may go on much longer than the three days ordered by Erdogan. After what's happened, he said, he'll never work in a mine again. 2 West Virginia coal miners killed .","Protesters lay symbolic coffins at government buildings, rail against Erdogan .

"Oscar De Lena is a man with a mission. And a measuring stick. De Lena is president of the local archeological society in the picturesque hamlet of Termoli, on Italy's Adriatic coast. For the past four years he's also been self-appointed guardian of Termoli's claim of being home to Italy's narrowest alleyway. It's a boast hotly contested by rival villages, but De Lena is determined to see off all challengers. ""I've known it since the day of my birth,"" he says. ""So I started measuring it over and over again, up and down, down and up. I've covered each single point."" Termoli, a jumble of white cobbled streets and bright-colored houses covered in bougainvillea, is already a draw for visitors to Italy's Molise region. There's a cathedral and a castle, both of which still bear the signs of pirate attacks  -- every August a festival and firework display commemorates one raid in 1566. And now there's the alleyway. Named Rejiecelle, or ""the little street,"" it's said to date back to a French invasion of 1799. 'Don't open an umbrella' ""It's just 41 centimeters (about 16 inches) wide but in some parts it shrinks down to 38,"" says De Lena. ""If you're a bit overweight and your tummy sticks out like mine then you'll have to walk sideways to squeeze through. Oh, and don't open an umbrella."" Since making the discovery, De Lena has made it his life's work to promote it, traveling across Italy with a meter stick in his suitcase to size up rivals. ""Wherever I go I measure each single street just to make sure we're the winners. So far, no one has beaten us. At one end of Rejiecelle lies a tantalizing glimpse of the shimmering blue Adriatic. Within its walls, a lingering smell of urine indicates that  perhaps not everyone shares De Lena's pride in the alleyway. ""Local authorities should take greater care of if, place a sign and some lights. It's one of the city's jewels,"" he adds. De Lena could have a point. Two other Italian towns, Ripatransone in the Marche region and Citta della Pieve in Umbria, have made identical claims about the width of their alleyways. Both use them to lure in tourists, and bitterly dispute rival claims. Simply called ""the Alley"", Ripatransone's well-kept 43 centimeter-wide passage has for decades drawn crowds of visitors to what a sign proclaims is the narrowest in Italy. 'Glowing cobblestones' The town's mayor grants a faux-medieval certificate to those who succeed in squeezing through ""a place where bodies shrink and dreams come true."" Not everyone fits. In Ripatransone, townsfolk speak about the alley with pride. ""Who cares about the other towns?"" says Carlo Michettoni, a waiter at the nearby Sammagno bar. ""Italy's tightest pathway is here."" Ripatransone, dates to prehistoric ages, is also home to a necropolis and seven museums. The strategic clifftop position that once warded off barbarian invaders gives it superb panoramas across the Apennine mountains. Ilene Acquaroli, a tourism official who is also curator of the local archeological museum, says many visitors come just for the alleyway. ""So many people have walked through it the cobblestones glow,"" she says. ""Many others probably had to give up because of claustrophobia. ""They contact ahead the museum for guided tours. We've been listed in the Guinness Book of Records and we'll fight till the very end to defend our top attraction."" Acquaroli dismisses Termoli's claim, insisting it fails to meet the criteria of a proper alley. To qualify, she says, they must have a window or entrance contain a sidewalk and connect two roads. Bickering neighbors . The third contender, the ""Kisswomen Alley"" in the Umbrian town of Citta della Pieve, fits the bill. At 45 centimeters wide, it was originally set up to divide the estates of two bickering neighbors. According to a sign at its entrance, the romantic name ""springs from the inhabitants' fertile imagination."" ""It's so tight you can easily imagine Renaissance ladies and knights passing by, shyly brushing against each other... gentlemen kissing ladies' hands,""says Fiorella Fringuello at the local tourist office. The Kisswomen pathway opens up to a spellbinding view over local beauty spots including the Chiana Romana valley and Mount Cetona. Here too there's determination to claim the record. ""We'll keep on saying that it's Italy's narrowest alley, or at least among its narrowest. It's part of our identity"", says Fringuello. Back in Termoli, De Lena is still brandishing his measuring stick. ""It's a matter of historical accuracy. People must know that Termoli has the narrowest alley in Italy. It's a fact"", says De Lena. At least until another town claims the record.","Oscar De Lena has made it his mission in life to prove his hometown of Termoli has Italy's smallest alleyway .
He faces strong competition from rivals in the towns of Ripatransone and Citta della Pieve .

"In her race to defeat Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Alison Lundergan Grimes has barnstormed Kentucky, talking up her support for raising the minimum wage and criticizing the GOP's so-called war on women. But the restaurant owned by Grimes' family doesn't always practice what she preaches, and Kentucky Republicans have been happy to point that out. On the campaign trail, Grimes said recently, ""I'm fighting for all Kentuckians, all working Americans across this nation. I don't believe $7.25 an hour raises a family of four above the poverty level."" But documents and interviews with employees reveal that, like many restaurants, her family's burger joint pays some tipped staffers minimum wage. We caught up with Grimes in Kentucky and asked how she can advocate for raising the minimum wage, when that's all her family's restaurant pays some workers. ""Listen, my family is not in this race. I'm on the ballot. And as much as Mitch McConnell wants to attack my family, he has from the beginning, I'm going to stay focused on the issues,"" she told CNN. ""And for me, it's about making sure that hard working Kentuckians have a bright future. And that future includes having not just a minimum wage, but a living wage."" Of course, servers can often make more than minimum wage after tips. And while Grimes doesn't own the restaurant, she did do legal work for the business, signing incorporation documents and representing it in a lawsuit. But minimum wage isn't the only issue dogging Grimes' family business. Hugh Jass Burgers -- say it out loud to get the joke -- has menu items like ""Charlotte's Rack, sure to be voted biggest rack"" named after Grimes' mom and ""Abby's Hugh Jass,"" a burger named after her sister. They also sell souvenirs like an apron with ""Check Out My Buns"" emblazoned across it. The restaurant's approach has raised eyebrows, especially since Grimes' camp accused the GOP of sexism. ""I am the Kentucky woman who my Republican colleagues in this state so gentlemanly refer to as an empty dress,"" Grimes said. When we tried to ask Grimes about her family's use of double entendre, she refused to answer, letting her security detail lead her away from reporters.","Alison Lundergan Grimes is campaigning on raising the minimum wage .

"Senegal President Abdoulaye Wade acknowledged Monday that he fell short of a majority in his country's weekend presidential vote and will have to face a runoff. The 85-year-old Wade is seeking a third term, but his 32% showing in results from Sunday's balloting was well short of the outright majority he had vowed to win. He was booed and jeered when he cast his vote in a contest overshadowed by violent protests. He sounded a conciliatory note toward the public during a Monday night news conference. ""I would like to pay homage to you, my dear compatriots, for the maturity, spirit of tolerance, and the civility that you have shown,"" Wade said. He offered words of respect for his 13 opponents, whom he called ""bad politicians and bad losers"" mere days before. Wade is likely to face Macky Sall, his former prime minister and protege, in the March runoff. Sall amassed 25% of the vote on Monday evening and is expected to have the support of several of the other candidates, who vowed solidarity against Wade in February. Senegal, a small country on Africa's west coast, has been an outpost of democratic stability in a region with a history of electoral chaos, civil wars and coups. But deadly demonstrations broke out after the country's highest court cleared Wade to seek a third term in January, and protesters demanded that Wade give up his bid for a new mandate. Opponents argue that the court was compromised and the constitution limits presidents to two terms. But Wade successfully argued that he is exempt because he took office in 2000, before the term limit was put in place. ""We've had enough of this regime of thieves and assassins. We will defeat them here,"" said Cheikh Gassama, a voter at Wade's polling place. Gassama and others chanted ""Na Dem"" -- ""step down"" -- as the president arrived. Wade did not address the crowd, looked visibly frustrated at one point and made some sort of gesture to the crowd, which also included some of his supporters. Wade once was hailed as a visionary, but his popularity has plummeted. ""Wade built schools, roads and hospitals,"" said Ayo Johnson, an analyst on African affairs. ""His leadership has now failed. ... There are increasing levels of poverty, inequality, lack of jobs and an increasing numbers of disillusioned youth."" Protesters calling for Wade's ouster have clashed on the streets, with at least three people killed during demonstrations last weekend, an opposition leader said. At least two others died in previous clashes. A presidential spokesman has accused opposition candidates and their supporters of fueling ""urban guerrilla warfare"" leading up to Sunday's vote. But Amath Dansokho, head of the opposition June 23 Movement, blamed police for the escalating violence, saying they were responsible for some deaths during demonstrations in Dakar and Rufisque this month. The presidential spokesman denied the police or military were involved in the deaths.","President Abdoulaye Wade got 32% of the vote Sunday .

"The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 could take its place at the top of the biggest unsolved mysteries of history. ""This is a very strange event,"" aviation historian Carroll Gray said. ""It doesn't lend itself to the normal sets of explanations."" Such mysteries are ""phenomenally gripping,"" Gray said. ""Things that are unsolved just sort of grab people, especially when you have the common experience of flying."" Answers about what happen to the Boeing 777 and the people on board must come soon, he said. ""When you get on the plane the next time, are you going to wonder a little bit about whether you are going to disappear?"" But history holds tight to some secrets, leaving us with just speculation, conspiracy theories and educated guesses. A mystery can have a long life, never forgotten and often re-examined. Here are some of history's most tantalizing mysteries and debatable events: . Who shot JFK and RFK? The assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, remains one of the most shocking events of the 20th century.  The shooting of his brother Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, added to the conspiracy theories. In each case, a lone gunman was accused. In both deaths, questions remain: . Was there a second shooter on a grassy knoll along JFK's motorcade route? How could a man with a mail-order rifle target the President in a moving car from such a distance?  Lee Harvey Oswald was himself shot to death at a Dallas police station days after JFK's death. A blue ribbon panel headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren concluded Oswald was the only assassin, but a Gallup survey six decades later found 60% of Americans don't believe that. As for RFK, a witness told CNN in 2012 that she heard two guns firing during the 1968 shooting in Los Angeles and that authorities altered her account of the crime. The mystery of Marilyn Monroe . The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that actress Marilyn Monroe's August 1962 death was a ""probable suicide"" from an overdose of barbiturates.  Despite the official conclusion, questions have lingered for decades about her death at 36. The fuel for conspiracy theories include discrepancies about what time her body was found, the disappearance of her internal organs at the morgue and her links to President John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy, as well as organized crime bosses. Also, the Monroe the world saw was not the real Norma Jeane Baker.  She was not a dumb blonde, but an intelligent, well-read brunette, according to those who knew her. Was Natalie Wood's death an accident or murder? The death of actress Natalie Wood, whose was found floating off California's Catalina Island in November 1981, was initially ruled an ""accidental drowning,"" but the Los Angeles County coroner officially changed the death certificate last year to read ""drowning and other undetermined factors."" Homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who said they had additional information about the actress' drowning, the Sheriff's Department said. Wood's death happened during a trip on her yacht with husband Robert Wagner and actor Christopher Walken. ""Since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation, it is opined by this medical examiner that the manner of death should be left as undetermined,"" the coroner said in a 2012 statement. What happened to Amelia Earhart? Famed aviator Amelia Earhart vanished along with navigator Fred Noonan during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937. ""There's still no concrete evidence as to what happened,"" Gray said. Theories about her fate included one that Earhart's plane was forced down by the Japanese around the Marshall Islands. Another is that Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity. Earhart was on the last segment of her global route, flying from Lae, Papua New Guinea, with a destination 2,500 miles away in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  If her plane crashed into the waters short of her planned refueling point on Howland Island, the wreckage is likely resting 17,500 feet below the ocean's surface. Only in recent years has it been possible to explore those depths with underwater vehicles. Expeditions scanning the ocean's floor have offered tantalizing evidence in the past two years that Earhart's plane could be near Nikumaroro Island in the South Pacific. Where is Jimmy Hoffa? Ex-Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa was last seen on July 30, 1975, outside a Detroit-area restaurant. His disappearance is a mystery that triggers occasional digs by FBI agents looking for his remains. The last such search centered on a field near Detroit in June 2013, based on a tip from alleged mobster Tony Zerilli that Hoffa was hit with a shovel and buried alive there.  Nothing was uncovered after three days of work with a backhoe. The FBI said at the time of his disappearance that it could have been linked to Hoffa's efforts to regain power in the Teamsters and to the mob's influence over the union's pension funds. Hoffa was thought to be trying to get back into a power position with the labor movement after his release from prison. He was sent to prison in 1967 for jury tampering and fraud. President Richard Nixon pardoned him in 1971. Popular theories over the years include that Hoffa was disposed of under the old Giants Stadium in New Jersey, buried in a Michigan horse farm, taken to a Florida swamp as alligator food or that his body was incinerated. Another early theory was that Hoffa simply took off for South America with a go-go dancer. Hoffa's middle name, by the way, is Riddle. Who was Jack the Ripper? The name Jack the Ripper came from a letter sent in 1888 to London police, purporting to be the killer of five prostitutes. His true identity has never been proved.  Stories about the serial killings on the streets of Victorian London captured readers around the world, spurring intense speculation that lasted well beyond a century. Crime writer Patricia Cornwell contributed to the theories with her 2002 book ""Portrait of a KIller -- Jack the Ripper: Case Closed.""  Cornwell fingers painter Walter Sickert, in part based on the similar watermarks on the letter to police and Sickert's personal writing paper.  She also argued that many of his paintings depicted Jack the Ripper crime scenes. The ghost ship Mary Celeste . The twin-masted merchant vessel Mary Celeste set sail from New York on November 7, 1872, bound for Genoa, Italy.  Its 10 passengers were not on board when it was found floating in the middle of the Strait of Gibraltar four weeks later. There were no signs of a struggle, and all of its cargo was still on board. Its only lifeboat was missing. Speculation over the past 140 years about why the ship was abandoned include theories involving pirates, a crew mutiny and even monster from the sea.  A documentary titled ""The True Story of the Mary Celeste"" released in 2007 ruled out those possibilities but stopped short of a conclusive explanation. What's the deal with the Bermuda Triangle? The legend of the Bermuda Triangle began with the unexplained disappearance of a group of military planes carrying 14 men off the coast of south Florida in December 1945. ""We are entering white water, nothing seems right,"" the flight leader supposedly said before radio contact was lost.  Thirteen more servicemen sent to search for the missing fliers also vanished. Other mysterious disappearances and encounters have been linked to the area of ocean that is a triangle anchored by Bermuda, Florida and Puerto Rico. Two British South American Airways passenger planes disappeared in the area a year apart in 1948 and 1949.  No explanations or wreckage were ever found. Victims credited to the area in numerous books and documentaries have included a large oil tanker, a pleasure yacht and a small passenger plane. Books, including ""The Devil's Triangle,"" ""Limbo of the Lost,"" and ""The Riddle of the Bermuda Triangle,"" suggest supernatural explanations.  Aliens in spaceships, wormholes and the mythical lost continent of Atlantis have been blamed. Are Big Foot, Sasquatch or Yeti for real? Stories of elusive giant, hairy human-like beasts have been told on several continents for centuries.  In the Himalayan Mountains, it is known as the Yeti or the Abominable Snowman.  North Americans have reported sightings of Big Foot or Sasquatch.  Russians call theirs the Almasty. One common feature in modern reports is that most photos are blurry and video is shaky.  Serious examination often leads to conclusions of mistaken identity or elaborate hoaxes. But just last year, a British geneticist said that hair samples supposedly from two of the mystery creatures proved to be a genetic match to an ancient polar bear.  The scientist submitted his DNA results for publication in a peer-reviewed science journal, and it is due to publish a book based on his research this year. Is the Loch Ness Monster a real creature? The earliest documented sighting of the mysterious creature swimming in Scotland's Loch Ness came in 1871, according to the monster's official website.  Yes, it has a website that serves the purpose of promoting tourism to the area.   Dozens of sightings have been logged since then, including the most recent in November 2011 when a Mr. George Edwards reported seeing a ""slow moving hump"" emerge from the murky depths of Loch Ness. A U.S. research team targeted Nessie -- the creature's affectionate nickname -- in 2009 using a submarine to explore the lake's bottom. The only discovery were thousands of golf balls 300 feet down and 100 yards off the shore. No mystery there, though: Locals and tourists have been known to practice their golf swing there for years. Was the Shroud of Turin the burial cloth for Jesus? The Shroud of Turin may be the most famous religious relic. Some Christians believe the shroud, which appears to bear the imprint of a man's body, to be Jesus Christ's burial cloth. The body appears to have wounds that match those the Bible describes as having been suffered by Jesus on the cross. Many scholars contest the shroud's authenticity, saying it dates to the Middle Ages, when many purported biblical relics -- such as splinters from Jesus' cross -- surfaced across Europe.  Even the Roman Catholic Church does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of Jesus. Its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity. Just before stepping aside as Pope a year ago, Benedict XVI authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from Turin Cathedral, where the mysterious Christian relic is kept out of sight in a bulletproof, climate-controlled glass case.","Conspiracy theories surround deaths of JFK, RFK, Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood .

"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani says the controversy surrounding the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, does not exemplify a larger national problem. ""93 percent of blacks are killed by other blacks,"" Giuliani said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""We're talking about the exception here."" ""What about the poor black child that is killed by the other black child? Why aren't you protesting that?"" In a heated exchange Sunday with academic and radio host Michael Eric Dyson, Giuliani suggested that the white police officer who fatally shot Brown in mid-August shouldn't be the focus of the nation's attention. ""We are talking about the significant exception,"" Giuliani said. ""I'd like to see the attention paid to that, that you are paying to this."" Giuliani went on to explain that he and other New York City mayors have worked hard to make New York Police Department ""as proportionate"" as possible to reflect the racial makeup of the city. In response, Dyson called Giuliani's comparison ""a false equivalency."" Giuliani says the chaos signifies that the nation is focusing on racial disparity when it should be setting its attention on the way the police force is arranged in respect to high crime rates. ""Why don't you cut it down so that so many white police officers don't have to be in black areas?"" ""White police officers wouldn't be there if you (speaking to Dyson) weren't killing each other 75% of the time."" The former New York mayor, who has been credited with greatly reducing crime in the Big Apple among poorer areas, insisted that the focus of the nation should pivot towards reducing crime among the black community. ""(Crime) is hardly insignificant,"" Giuliani said. ""It is the reason for the heavy police presence in the black community.""

"A 40-year-old quad amputee was all thank yous at a news conference Tuesday at a Boston-area hospital as he showed off his two new arm transplants. Will Lautzenheiser sat next to the doctors from Brigham and Women's Hospital who spent almost nine hours in surgery with him last month. ""To have come here and to have received this gift is really astonishing to me, and it's obviously life-changing,"" he said. Lautzenheiser, a former professor of film production and screenwriting, lost his limbs in 2011 after a battle with a severe streptococcal infection, according to the hospital. The arms came from an anonymous donor through the New England Organ Bank, the hospital said. ""Of course I want to thank, to acknowledge and to honor the memory of the man whose arms I have so gratefully received,"" Lautzenheiser said. ""This person who's anonymous to me will always be as close to me as my own skin now."" In an anonymous statement, the family of the donor said, ""Our son gave the best hugs, we pray that you make a wonderful recovery and that your loved ones will be able to enjoy your warm embrace."" While his doctors said it may be years until he will be able to actually move his hands in complex ways, Lautzenheiser said he was astonished at his progress. ""This is about it so far,"" Lautzenheiser said, laughing and slightly stretching his arm, which was in a splint and cast, ""but I had nothing, so even that is incredible."" There have been about 70 hand transplants around the world, according to Dr. Simon Talbot, one of the surgeons on the team that performed the operation on Lautzenheiser.

"Pizza, pasta, Verdi, the Coliseum, runway models. We know Italy does some things incomparably well. But travelers to the elegant boot don't just want to eat spaghetti, deal with opera and gawk at old ruins. Beyond the clichés, you'll find 10 other surprising ways in which Italy shines. More on CNN: Verdi: Exploring the Italian hometown of a musical genius . 1. Flattery . Depending on whether or not you think the occasional catcall or butt grab is flattering, you'll find Italians are aggressively complimentary of friends and beautiful strangers alike. A historical tool for both disarming and defusing, flattery is the fulcrum on which Italian society teeters. As Luigi Barzini writes in ""The Italians,"" ""The people have always employed such arts offensively, to gain advantages, destroy rivals and conquer power and wealth; and defensively, as the squid uses ink, to blind and confound powerful men, dictators and tyrants."" But you'll likely only notice the butt grabs. 2. Hot baths . If flattery doesn't get you out of your clothes, the peninsula's 380 spa sites offering healing mud and bubbles will. Boiling as much beneath the surface as its people, Italy pioneered the world's first large-scale spas, exporting them as they colonized Europe. Watery therapies include island baths (such as those on volcanic Ischia), Tuscan hot springs, mountain baths in the town of Bormio and the thermal park of Lake Garda. Just drinking the mineral-rich water in some places is reputed to be healthy. So convinced is the Italian government of the healing power of hot springs and geothermal mud packs that it covers the cost of some therapies for its citizens. Free hot springs in Tuscany: www.turismo.intoscana.it . 3. Cursing . Be it in Italian or any other language, the accent of native Italy turns any expletive into a blunt force instrument. Rhythmic, staccato and with an almost operatic legato that fuses syllables together like a hammer-on guitar note, swearing here is a performance art. Inspired mostly by pigs, anatomical exit points and promiscuous women, Italian profanities -- which vary by region -- sound equal parts dramatic, angry and comical. Powered by the passion characteristic of the Italian people, the results stun, intimidate and even charm their recipients, sometimes all at once. More on CNN: 15 best coffee bars in Rome . 4. Beach bumming . With 7,400 kilometers (4,600 miles) of coastline, Italy boasts the most beaches in Europe, as well as 27 marine parks. Summer temperatures peak in many places at just below 30 C (86 F), compared with the mid 20s (70s F) in France and Portugal. It's like swimming in tropical waters, minus the sharks and trinket hawkers. When it comes to beaches, it's a tough choice between blinding-white dunes, pebble and even turf shores, but 248 Italian beaches have been awarded Blue Flag status for clear waters and unspoiled sands. More on CNN: Italy's best beaches and islands . 5. Pop-up governments . Italians tear through regimes like their sports cars do dinosaur juice. Since the end of World War II, Italy has established 62 governments under 38 prime ministers (40 if you count Silvio Berlusconi's three total terms), and only one has lasted a full five years. Fearing the rise of another Mussolini, Italy's constitutional system years ago provided for a weak executive branch that requires majorities in both legislative houses just to get anything done. That, combined with an already fractured political landscape of small, warring parties, puts Italy's average MPG (months per government) barely over 12. 6. Volcanoes . Ten active volcanoes allow Italy's geology to vent the way voting gives release to its citizens. The country's (and Europe's) largest volcano is Mt. Etna in Sicily, the world's second most active volcano after Hawaii's Mauna Loa. Etna's spectacular eruptions, soot-blackened scenery, lava flows and extensive caves draw more than a million tourists a year. It leads TripAdvisor's top-10 must-see volcanoes list, along with four other Italian spouters, including Mt. Vesuvius. In June, Etna became a UNESCO World Heritage Site, joining three other Italian volcanoes, including the Aeolian islands of Vulcano (no translation prizes there), Lipari and Stromboli, known as the Mediterranean's Lighthouse for its breathtaking eruptions. Mt. Etna tours and excursion: www.sicilytravel.net . More on CNN: Scandal-rocked Pompeii finally gets a makeover . 7. Dessert . Apple pie is good and all, and it's never a bad time for a sticky slice of baklava, but for sheer volume and variety of treats, nothing beats Italian sweets. Much is made of the peninsula's food, the usual suspects being pizza, pasta and antipasti. But the real stars of Italian cuisine are gelato, tiramisu, cannoli, Neapolitan, biscotti spumoni, tartufo, zeppole -- hell, Italy has nearly as many signature desserts as it's had governments. Italian confectioners work in all media, too, combining cakes, cookies and creams both iced and otherwise to create the world's vastest, tastiest arsenal of desserts. Ironically, Italians don't even really eat this stuff, most often preferring a piece of fruit or chocolate after a meal instead. More: $84 gelati! Greatest travel rip off? 8. Caving . Rich in crumbly, sieve-like karstic landscapes, Italy is one of the most cave-pocked countries on the planet, with more than 35,000 cavities above ground and thousands more underwater. Grotta Gigante holds the Guinness World Record for largest accessible cave on Earth at a yawning 850 meters (2,788 feet) wide, with 500 steps that descend 100 meters (328 feet) into the earth. Other notable caves include the Blue Grotto on Capri, where Emperor Tiberius loved to swim. Inside the Grotta del Vento, winds whip through its tortuous trails at 40 kilometers an hour. More info: Rock climbing and caving in Italy . More on CNN: 24-hour tourism: Rome in a day . 9. Sports cars . Eliciting more turns per head than even its fashion models do, Italy's catalog of exotic land jets is what Porsche drivers dream about. What began as a racecar manufacturer in the 1930s has become the standard bearer for aspirational autos -- in 2012, Ferrari sold just 7,000 cars, but booked $3 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, Lamborghini may be owned by German Audi now, but the hips are still all Italiano. Pagani, Alfa Romeo, Maserati -- these names are sex on wheels. Italy doesn't even crack the top 20 in global auto production, but for out-of-your-league supercars that cover more adolescent male bedroom walls than Kate Upton, no other country can outrace Italy. 10. River cruises . Unlikely to be among the top two or three or hundred things that spring to mind when you think of Italy, river cruising on the peninsula is actually a vibrant business, and new routes keep opening up. Italian rivers aren't as long or easily navigated as those in the rest of Europe, but visitors can float from one beautiful UNESCO World Heritage Site to another. Po River Travel, UniWorld and European Waterways offer week-long cruises that take in areas like the Venice Lagoon, Manuta, Padu, the Po Valley and Verona, the city of Romeo and Juliet.

"For the 108,000 women who are diagnosed with lung cancer each year, Lung Cancer Awareness Month can be a lonely time of year. Lung cancer kills nearly twice as many women as breast cancer. But November, unlike October and Breast Cancer Awareness Month, goes practically unnoticed: no sea of ribbons, no colored NFL cleats, no national monuments aglow in pink. Breast cancer is a terrible disease. My grandmother fought and beat it twice, benefiting from innovative treatments that have propelled five-year survival rates to 90%. But the five-year survival rate for lung cancer has hovered around 16% for decades. And for someone like my mom, who was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, the survival rate is an appallingly low 4%. An indiscriminate killer, lung cancer takes more lives annually than breast, prostate, colon and pancreatic cancers combined. The disease has not generally received the public attention or research dollars in proportion to its devastating lethality. Lung cancer receives just $1,442 in federal research funds per death, compared with $26,398 for breast cancer and $13,419 for prostate cancer according to an NIH study. Factor in private donations, and the funding gap becomes even more staggering. Often portrayed as a ""smoker's disease,"" the majority of those diagnosed with lung cancer are former smokers or have never smoked at all. And while smoking history shouldn't matter as nicotine is highly addictive, all lung cancer patients face the same unrelenting stigma. My mom never smoked -- in fact, studies show one in five women diagnosed with lung cancer never smoked -- and so her lingering, months-long cough didn't trigger any red flags. In fact, her doctors were certain she had pneumonia. That is until her CT scan came back showing the mass in her lung. An otherwise healthy, vibrant, beautiful woman, my mom was given less than a year to live. Thanks to advancements in targeted therapies, my mom survived -- thrived, in many respects -- for more than 40 months. She lived long enough to walk me down the aisle, attend my youngest brother's high school graduation, watch my dad make a lasagna from scratch and fulfill a lifetime wish to hike the hills of Sedona and visit the Grand Canyon. But in July 2013, after an unbelievably courageous and inspiring fight, my mom passed away. She was 59. It's impossible to describe adequately how special my mom was. She was incredibly caring, equanimous, brave and nonjudgmental. She possessed patience and calmness so rarely encountered -- and in short supply in a family full of strong personalities. She was the ballast that kept our family upright and moving forward. While lung cancer robbed my family of an unbelievably special mom and spouse, there is so much we can do to ensure happier endings for other lung cancer patients and their families. Whether you are a lung cancer survivor, caregiver, advocate or just someone who wants to join the fight, there is much we can do to bring our country's No. 1 cancer killer out of the shadows. • Visit Uniting Against Lung Cancer, Free to Breathe, the Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation or the LUNGevity Foundation for great resources, local events and patient support groups. • Write a letter to your local newspaper, urging greater public awareness or encouraging corporate sponsors to step up in support of the lung cancer fight. • Join the growing #lcsm (lung cancer social media) community on Twitter. • If you are in a high-risk group -- a heavy long-term smoker -- see your doctor about CT screening. Sadly, over the next five years, more than 1 million Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer. They will be our mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, co-workers and closest friends. Together, we can help them.","Lung Cancer Awareness Month doesn't get attention it deserves, Arielle Densen says .

"Former Washington Mayor Marion Barry is dead, a Washington hospital spokeswoman said early Sunday. He was 78. Barry was elected four times as the city's chief executive and was a council member in the District of Columbia for 15 years. The one-time leader of the city's old Board of Education, Barry was, at one time, revered nationally as a symbol of African-American political leadership and beloved for his prowess at local politics. But his professional accomplishments were often overshadowed by bad behavior in his personal life that made for startling headlines. Barry was infamously busted in 1990 on law enforcement surveillance tape smoking crack cocaine in a drug sting involving the FBI and Washington police. That footage was televised. Barry was convicted of possession and served six months in prison. But he made a tremendous political comeback. Barry reclaimed his seat in the mayor's office in 1995. In 2002, police said they found ""apparent"" traces of marijuana and cocaine in Barry's car but didn't arrest him. He was re-elected to the City Council in 2004. In 2006, he was suspected in separate incidents of driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. He was found not guilty of the DUI charge, and the state said a computer glitch erroneously reported that Barry's license had been suspended. In 2009, he was arrested on a charge of stalking, which prosecutors later dropped. ""Who can better help our city recover than someone who himself has gone through recovery?"" he once asked confidently. Former Harvard professor and civil rights leader Cornell West said on CNN on Sunday that Barry ""had his flaws"" but  was a ""great freedom fighter"" for the poor and disenfranchised. The Washington Post noted that he ""plowed hundreds of millions of tax dollars into job training and employment programs, senior centers and social-welfare endeavors. Rank-and-file workers were hired by the thousands to serve under Mr. Barry's newly-appointed supervisory corps of African American middle and top level managers."" He ardently promoted African-American-owned enterprises. His recently released autobiography, ""Mayor for Life: The Incredible Story of Marion Barry, Jr.,"" recalls a quote that underscored Barry's ability to spotlight inequalities in America. ""Why should blacks feel elated about seeing men walk on the moon when millions of poor blacks and whites don't have enough money to buy food to eat on earth?"" he said during President Richard Nixon's administration. ""In Washington, I have worked hard for the people and I've been loved by the people,"" Barry said in a July interview on CNN.  ""I didn't get elected because of my name. I got elected because I work hard for the people."" President Barack Obama said in a statement that he and first lady Michelle Obama were ""saddened"" to hear of Barry's death. The President recalled that Barry was born a sharecropper's son and came of age during the Civil Rights movement. ""As a leader with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Marion helped advance the cause of civil rights for all. During his decades in elected office in D.C., he put in place historic programs to lift working people out of poverty, expand opportunity, and begin to make real the promise of home rule,"" the statement said. ""Through a storied, at times tumultuous life and career, he earned the love and respect of countless Washingtonians, and Michelle and I extend our deepest sympathies to Marion's family, friends and constituents today.""

"A man suspected of involvement in the September attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi is being held in Libya, according to two sources who have spoken with CNN. Both sources confirmed the man's name as Faraj al-Shibli (also spelled Chalabi). One of the sources, who has been briefed on the arrest by Western intelligence officials, said al-Shibli was detained within the past two days and had recently returned from a trip to Pakistan. A Libyan source also confirmed that al-Shibli was in custody in the north African nation. The FBI was given direct access to him, and it interviewed him recently in the presence of Libyan authorities, according to the Libyan source. The Libyan government allowed one or more members of the U.S. law enforcement agency to question the man -- something that is not necessarily done when a person is detained in a foreign country -- around the time on Wednesday when its prime minister, Ali Zeidan, met with U.S. President Barack Obama. The United States has been pressing Libyan authorities on the Benghazi investigation, with FBI Director Robert Mueller traveling to Tripoli in January for talks on the case. It is unclear exactly what al-Shibli's role might have been or whether he was present at the U.S. compound at the time of the attack. It's also unclear whether his detention is likely to lead to charges in connection with the assault on the compound, which resulted in the deaths of four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican and a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Thursday that ""we think there are more than a dozen people involved in this."" ""The idea that potentially we have somebody ... it's obviously positive news,"" Chaffetz told CNN. ""... This is the most positive development I've seen in the past six months."" Al-Shibli is the only known suspect in custody in connection with the attack in Benghazi. A 26-year-old Tunisian, Ali Ani al Harzi, was held in Tunis for several weeks in connection with the assault on the compound after being extradited from Turkey. But he was released by a Tunisian judge in January on grounds on insufficient evidence. And in December, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation said authorities were examining whether the alleged leader of a post-revolution terrorist network in Egypt had played a role in the September 11 attack. Mohammed Jamal Abu Ahmed was released from jail after the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and is believed to be the driving force behind a new militant group, according to two U.S. officials. He is currently reported to be in prison in Egypt after being arrested in December, when police raided an apartment allegedly being used by a jihadist group active in Cairo. An associate of Abu Ahmed's subsequently said that he had not been in Benghazi or anywhere in Libya on the day of the attack on the compound. Al-Shibli comes from a town called Sidi Armouma al-Marj, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Benghazi. He was a member of the Libyan Islamist Fighting Group, a militant organization that tried to overthrow the Gadhafi regime in the mid-1990s. In 2004, the Libyan government reported al-Shibli to the United Nations as on its ""wanted"" list and issued an Interpol ""Red Notice"" seeking his arrest. It was the second warrant issued by the Gadhafi regime for al-Shibli's arrest. In 1998, he was named with two other Libyans as allegedly involved in the murder of a German counterintelligence official, Silvan Becker, and his wife, Vera, who were killed in the Libyan town of Sirte in 1994. The Libyan authorities also issued an arrest warrant for Osama bin Laden in connection with the crime. Investigators have learned that he has had contact with the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and al Qaeda members in Pakistan, sources said. However, some analysts have cast doubt on the Gadhafi regime's assertion that Libyan Islamist Fighting Group members carried out the attack on the German couple. Jihadist groups are strong to this day between Benghazi and the town of Derna to the east, an area that includes al-Marj. Several groups are thought to have camps in the Green Mountains between al-Marj and towns along the coast. U.S. investigators have identified at least 15 individuals whom ""we're taking a serious look at,"" a U.S. law enforcement official said in January, indicating that some of them were identified on video of the assault. Ultimately, the official said at the time, ""we will get indictments, but it's not possible to put a timetable on it.""","Libya let the FBI interview Faraj al-Shibli face to face, a Libyan source says .

"(CNN)Just after Thursday's Oscar nominations, the Critics' Choice Movie Awards moved the discussion forward on awards season Thursday night -- and the leader continues to be ""Boyhood."" Richard Linklater's movie about growing up, shot over the course of 12 years, won best picture at the honors, which are given out by the Broadcast Film Critics Association. But the awards didn't leave ""Boyhood's"" main competition, ""Birdman"" and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" bereft. ""Birdman"" earned trophies for best acting ensemble and star Michael Keaton, while ""Budapest"" took home the award for best comedy. ""Birdman"" won seven awards overall. Keaton had quite a night. Not only did he win, he apparently fell off stage after accepting his best actor award. The event wasn't captured on video, but a number of observers tweeted about it. Keaton was fine and, being a trouper, later re-enacted the plunge backstage for the press. ""I took the 'Birdman' flying thing way too far,"" he joked. Other winners included ""The Lego Movie"" -- snubbed by the Oscars -- as best animated feature, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" for best action movie and J.K. Simmons for best supporting actor. The awards weren't without their controversy. Host Michael Strahan led off the ceremony by doing a little stripping -- he has a part in the ""Magic Mike"" sequel -- and Judd Apatow, who presented the best director award, brought up Bill Cosby. Apatow, who was apparently a late addition to the presenters' lineup, has been a noted Cosby critic. ""They knew I'd be home tweeting about Cosby,"" Apatow said.

"If you're heading to the airport to fly to the East Coast for Thanksgiving, expect delays of three to six hours. A nor'easter is expected to dump heavy rain and snow on the eastern United States late Tuesday into Wednesday and cause severe delays on what's traditionally the busiest travel day of the year, CNN meteorologists say. About 30 million people from the mountains of North Carolina to Maine could be affected. ""The storm will have a major impact nationwide to air travel, as the ripple effect from delays and cancellations in the Northeast hubs impacts the rest of the country,"" said CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen. ""Expect very long delays, in some cases averaging three to six hours for major airports in D.C., Philadelphia, New York and Boston, which will be impacted by a combination of heavy rain, snow and wind. Most delays and cancellations will occur from late morning through Wednesday evening,"" Hennen said. The silver lining for Thursday morning fliers? ""By Thanksgiving, the storm will be exiting, and conditions should return to normal,"" he said. Use CNN's winter weather tracker . Heavy rain will affect the Southeast overnight as heavy snow begins to develop in the Appalachians, according to CNN's Wednesday forecasts. Rain and snow will begin to hit the Washington and New York metro areas about daybreak Wednesday and Boston by late morning. The peak of the storm will be from about noon Wednesday until midnight. Travelers can expect some significant snow accumulations. Though Washington should see a mix of rain and snow after midnight, areas far west of the city will get heavy snowfall. Philadelphia will get rain mixed with snow around sunrise, with accumulations of about an inch. New York will receive rain beginning shortly after sunrise, mixing with snow. Three or 4 inches of snow are possible in the city, with heavier accumulation in northern New Jersey and in the Hudson Valley. Boston can expect rain and snow in the morning, changing to all snow in the late afternoon and evening. The city is forecast to get 4 to 5 inches of snow, with 10 to 15 inches in central Massachusetts. Mike Todd, a spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Safety, said power outages are a major concern. ""This is New England, this is just another winter storm here, and the complication is just that it's the holiday weekend. Tomorrow is, of course, a big travel day,"" he said.

Amtrak advised that travelers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states follow its regional Twitter handles, @AmtrakNEC and @AmtrakVA, for updates. AAA is expecting 46 million Americans to travel 50 miles or more from home during the Thanksgiving weekend, and 90% of them are traveling by car. That would be the most travelers since 2007, AAA said in a news release. Drivers should check weather forecasts before setting out on the road ""to ensure the safety of you and your family"" and consider leaving earlier or later to avoid the storm, AAA advised. Travelers should also check tire pressure, car batteries and windshield wipers. Stock up on nonperishable food and emergency supplies in case you get stuck in the storm.

"Washington (CNN) -- Members of the Congressional Black Caucus gave voice to the frustrations of demonstrators who gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, as well as places like Washington, D.C., Monday night to protest a grand jury's decision not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown. Rep. Marcia Fudge, the caucus' chair, called the grand jury's decision a ""slap in the face to Americans nationwide"" in a statement released just moments after St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch announced the grand jury's decision. ""This decision seems to underscore an unwritten rule that Black lives hold no value; that you may kill Black men in this country without consequences or repercussions,"" Fudge said, calling the decision a ""miscarriage of justice."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . The shooting of Brown, an unarmed black teenager, at the hands of Wilson, who is white, drove locals and activists around the country to the streets of Ferguson this summer and again this week in anticipation of a grand jury announcement which many hoped would at least deliver a trial in the shooting. As tensions in Ferguson flared and violence erupted amid largely peaceful protests, the caucus members called on protesters to remain peaceful in expressing their anger and urged activists to channel a moment of frustration into a larger movement to effect change on the justice system and relations between African-American communities and police departments nationwide. Rep. John Lewis, a veteran of the civil rights movement who helped lead the 1963 March on Washington alongside Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., sent a message to protestors on Twitter: . ""Only love can overcome hate. Only nonviolence can overcome violence,"" he tweeted. ""I know this hard. I know this is difficult. Do not succumb to the temptations of violence. There is a more powerful way."" Obama calls anger over Ferguson decision 'understandable,' but urges peace . The Black Caucus members also stressed the need for the Justice Department to pursue its federal civil rights investigation into the deadly shooting, with several calling the local investigation deeply flawed. Rep. Karen Bass said in a statement Monday that she was ""deeply disturbed"" that the grand jury did not indict Wilson. ""The announcement continues a trend of injustice that has rightfully created an environment of anger and concern in Ferguson, Missouri and across the United States,"" Bass said. ""From the onset, Ferguson law officials have been negligent in their handling of this tragic death."" She said Ferguson officials ""botched"" the case from the start, noting that Brown's body was in the street for hours after he was killed and called officials ""mean-spirited"" for leaking surveillance footage of Brown stealing cigars from a convenience store shortly before he was gunned down. That footage had not been requested by media in an information request. ""And tonight the grand jury attacked justice by not holding Officer Wilson accountable for his actions,"" she said."" Attorney General Eric Holder pledged Monday night to pursue the civil rights investigation into the shooting and a second investigation into allegations of misconduct by the Ferguson Police Department. Rep. Lacy Clay, who represents Ferguson and St. Louis County in Congress, called the grand jury's decision ""extremely disappointing"" and said he shares ""the anger and frustration,"" but called on protesters to be nonviolent. Poll finds racial divide over Wilson charges . Clay added that he was not surprised by the grand jury's decision and said he had been concerned about the local investigation since Brown's death. ""The pursuit of justice for Michael Brown, Jr. and his family is not over,"" he said."" The two senators from Missouri, Democrat Claire McCaskill and Republican Roy Blunt released statements following the grand jury's decision calling for protests to remain peaceful. Blunt said in a statement he hoped the community could ""move forward and heal as we work to find better job opportunities in and more investment for challenged communities."" He added that his thoughts were with Brown's family and with ""those in law enforcement who continue to protect the rights of all they serve."" McCaskill acknowledged that many were disappointed by the decision and said she is waiting for the results of the Justice Department's civil rights investigation. Holder: Federal Ferguson investigation will continue . ""While we await the conclusion of that independent investigationâ€”and continue working together for solutions to systemic issues highlighted by this tragedyâ€”I'm praying that the good people of St. Louis and local law enforcement will remain peaceful and respectful of one another,"" McCaskill said. Another Missouri lawmaker and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, posted a dozen messages on Twitter as St. Louis County prosecutor began his press conference to announce the grand jury's conclusion. Sen. Cory Booker, the only Senator in the black caucus, tweeted after the grand jury decision Thursday that his thoughts were with Michael Brown's family and echoed ""their calls for peace / nonviolence."" Sen. Tim Scott, a black Republican who is not a member of the caucus, said he hoped that ""good can come out of this tragic situation"" and called on activists to channel their frustration into ""productive ways to build our communities.""","The Congressional Black Caucus called the decision to not indict Darren Wilson 'a slap in the face'

"French prosecutors have widened an investigation into former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn's alleged participation in a prostitution ring. Authorities said Monday that Lille police will open a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in Washington, which they believe could constitute gang rape. ""Following the decision by the examining magistrates, who are in charge of the affair known as the 'Carlton affair,' they have reason to believe ... pertaining to events which allegedly took place in Washington between December 15 and 18, 2010, that there is suspicion of gang rape,"" a statement from the Lille prosecutor's office said. Strauss-Kahn's attorneys issued a statement saying, ""The investigation will establish that Dominique Strauss-Kahn has never committed acts of violence or had any relationship whatsoever without the consent of his partners."" Strauss-Kahn: A reputation battered by sex allegations . The French newspaper Liberation reported earlier this month that the allegations stemmed from statements made by two women it describes as ""escort girls,"" who were interviewed by Belgian police as part of an investigation into a prostitution ring run out of the Carlton Hotel in Lille, near France's border with Belgium. According to the newspaper's account of the depositions, the women said they had accompanied two associates of Strauss-Kahn on a visit to Washington, where they had stayed at the W Hotel. One of them alleged that Strauss-Kahn had used force against her during a sexual encounter at the hotel, despite her protests. The newspaper did not specify how it obtained the statements. CNN could not independently confirm the report. The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington said no sexual assault at the hotel was reported at that time. French law allows authorities to prosecute a French national for a crime committed abroad. In a statement to Agence France Presse, Strauss-Kahn's attorneys Frédérique Baulieu, Richard Malka and Henri Leclerc said the ""declarations made by these young women are contradictory.""  It also said the women's testimony was disclosed at an ""opportune time,"" just before the final round of the French presidential election. Strauss-Kahn lawyers fight against prostitutes claim . The prostitution investigation continues a string of sexual allegations against Strauss-Kahn. He has not been convicted of a crime. Strauss-Kahn has been formally warned by French authorities that he is under investigation for ""aggravated pimping"" in connection with the prostitution investigation and has been released on 100,000-euro bail. He has pushed back against the accusations, saying he did not know young women at parties he attended were being paid for sex. One of the sex scandals torpedoed his expected run for the French presidency this year. He stepped down from the top job at the International Monetary Fund after the May 2011 incident, in which a New York hotel maid accused him of sexual assault and attempted rape in May. He denied the accusation. Strauss-Kahn countersues maid for at least $1 million . The case ultimately fell apart after prosecutors decided they could not be sure about the credibility of the alleged victim, despite forensic evidence that showed a sexual encounter had occurred. The maid, Nafissatou Diallo, has since launched a civil action against the former IMF chief, alleging a ""sadistic assault."" This week a judge in New York rejected Strauss-Kahn's claim of diplomatic immunity. Strauss-Kahn also faced allegations of attempted rape from a young French writer. Tristane Banon filed a complaint, alleging a 2003 attack, though it could not be pursued because of a statute of limitations. He denied the allegations and has since filed a countersuit in France, alleging slander.","Strauss-Kahn's attorneys say he has never committed an act of violence .

"(CNN) -- If all goes as planned, the state of Texas will soon execute Rodney Reed for murdering Stacey Stites 18 years ago in the city of Georgetown. The only hitch in this plan is that Reed might actually be innocent of the crime. Getting to the bottom of this quandary might require little more than a simple DNA test of items recovered from the crime scene, as requested by his attorney and the Innocence Project. But if the state of Texas has its way, Reed will be executed without those tests ever being conducted. The fate of the DNA testing is the subject of a hearing in a Bastrop County court, scheduled for Tuesday. On the face of it, Reed's tireless claims of innocence are not without merit. The police investigation was riddled with glaring foibles and failures. Crucially, the detectives gave up briskly on investigating a likely suspect -- Stites' fiancÃ©, Jimmy Fennell. Fennell was a police officer who was accused of committing acts of sexual violence and was ultimately sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting a woman he took into police custody. Fennell, according to affidavits, was irate that his fiancÃ©e, a white woman, was having an affair with Reed, who is African-American. Why on earth, one wonders, would Texas battle fiercely against conducting the testing? Would it be naive to propose the state should welcome it? The answer cannot be the meager costs of running the tests or the negligible time they would take to run. Nor could the state claim to be acting out of respect for the victim's loved ones -- a dubious justification from the outset -- given that numerous members of her family are campaigning publicly on Reed's behalf. The best explanation for the state's aversion to the testing may be the dread of learning the truth. The prospect of finding that Reed is innocent would deliver a resounding condemnation of the state's criminal justice process -- its detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, jurors and appellate courts. The Reed case and others of its kind give Texas' criminal justice system a bad reputation, as they should. Yet justice in Texas is a study in contradictions. The state has taken formidable strides toward a more accurate criminal process. Following the leadership of outgoing Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins, numerous prosecutorial units have been established to uncover faulty convictions. Texas also boasts a statewide Criminal Justice Integrity Unit that recommends lessons learned from wrongful convictions and oversees policy reform. The state runs an active Forensic Science Commission that both promotes professionalization of the field and investigates complaints of scientific abuse. Texas has enacted a law that requires all police departments to adopt lineup procedures that comply with scientifically based best practices, and all major counties require taping of interrogations. Texas has also reacted admirably to some of the revelations of false convictions. Michael Morton spent almost 25 years in prison for the murder of his wife, a conviction that would likely have been averted but for the misconduct of the prosecutor, Ken Anderson. In response to Morton's exoneration, the state enacted a sweeping law that mandates broad discovery of evidence to the defense. Moreover, Anderson, who had since become a district judge in Williamson County, was disbarred for his acts and briefly carted off to jail. None of these reforms should be taken to justify Texas' bullheaded decision to move ahead with the execution of Rodney Reed. No state should exact criminal punishment -- not to mention death -- before taking all feasible measures to verify the defendant's guilt. It is of course impossible to redo the investigation conducted so long ago or to amend its apparent flaws. But the state has an obligation to Reed, and to its citizenry in whose name it is about to execute Reed, to test every bit of remaining evidence. If the new evidence undermines Reed's guilt, he should be allowed to walk out of prison as a free man for the first time in 18 years, and the Georgetown police should reopen the investigation of the barbarous murder of Stacey Stites.","Dan Simon: Texas may execute Rodney Reed for murder, except he might be innocent .

"A Louisiana family may have won a reprieve in its fight to protect its beloved pit bull from a local ""vicious dogs"" ordinance. The village of Moreauville passed an ordinance in October banning pit bulls and Rottweilers as of December 1, but local officials put enforcement on hold after a national outcry. It all started with resident Joanna Armand, who started an online petition to protect her family's pit bull, Zeus, from exile or worse. Her petition, which asks the village to reverse the ban, has drawn more than 200,000 signatures. Zeus is more than the family dog, Armand said. He provides love and support for her children, especially daughter O'Hara, who uses a halo brace and a wheelchair because of severe neck problems. Zeus acts as a sort of therapy dog for O'Hara, Armand said. He sleeps by her side every night. If O'Hara wakes up with seizures, he rouses her mother. Owners of the animals received a letter saying that pets found within the corporate limits of Moreauville after December 1 will be ""impounded and transported to a veterinary clinic for further disposition,"" according to a letter posted on the family's Facebook page. Moreauville Alderman Penn Lemoine told CNN affiliate KALB that the ordinance was created to placate residents in the small village. ""We had several residents that were complaining about not being able to walk along the neighborhoods because these dogs were basically running along town,"" Lemoine said, according to KALB. Lemoine told KALB that the wording of the letter caused a misunderstanding and that town officials don't want to kill anyone's family pet. Village leaders are working to set up an emergency meeting about the ordinance, according to KALB. Moreauville is not the first town to pass a ordinance restricting the ownership of pit bulls, Rottweilers or other ""vicious dogs."" But the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals recommends breed-neutral laws ""that focus, not on breed, but on people's responsibility for their dogs' behavior, including measures that hold owners of all breeds accountable for properly housing, supervising and controlling their dogs."" The White House also signaled its opposition to breed-specific legislation in 2013, saying ""research shows that bans on certain types of dogs are largely ineffective and often a waste of public resources."" Several states have passed legislation banning local governments from introducing breed-specific laws or ordinances. Besides, pit bulls are not a breed of dog. Several breeds of dogs, mainly the bull terrier, the bulldog and the American Staffordshire terrier, are commonly referred to as ""pit bulls."" These dogs descended from an English bull-baiting dog bred to bite and hold bulls, bears and other large animals around the face and head, according to the ASPCA. They were later bred with terriers to produce a more agile, athletic dog. ""It is likely that that the vast majority of pit bull type dogs in our communities today are the result of random breeding -- two dogs being mated without  regard to the behavioral traits being passed on to their offspring. The result of random breeding is a population of dogs with a wide range of behavioral predispositions. For this reason it is important to evaluate and treat each dog, no matter its breed, as an individual.""","Village's ""vicious dogs ban on pit bulls and rottweilers may be on hold .

"(CNN) -- As if dealing with the impact of devastating storm surges, drenching rains and potent winds weren't hard enough, hundreds of thousands in New York and northern New Jersey battled a new adversary Saturday night: the cold. The National Weather Service forecast temperatures would dip into the 30s in Belle Harbor, New York, and Cape May, New Jersey. And even after the sun rises Sunday, residents may be lucky if the thermostat tops 50 degrees. For many, keeping warm isn't simply a matter of turning on the heat, after Superstorm Sandy knocked out gas lines and electricity. Some 2.4 million people had no power for a fifth straight day Saturday, their patience running low, along with the temperatures. Several residents in the Rockaways, in Queens, vented their frustrations at New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as he toured the area Saturday. One woman yelled, ""When are we going to get some help!"" while a man talked about ""old ladies in my building who have got nothing."" Supplementing and, in some cases, dissatisfied with the government response, neighbors and volunteers from afar to hard-hit areas Saturday to offer food, clothing and whatever else to those who are still cold and hungry. ""We covered two children with a blanket freezing and shivering here trying to get food last night,"" Rockaway resident Lauren O'Connor told CNN affiliate NY1. ""We said we had to do something."" Official: Sandy-stricken areas will vote 'come hell or high water' At a Saturday news conference, Bloomberg admitted he'd encountered many who were ""worried and frustrated and cold"" and urged those without electricity to go to a shelter or find another ""warm place"" to stay. ""Please, I know sometimes people are reticent to take advantage of services -- the cold really is something that is dangerous,"" he said. For all the continued problems, however, many residents and officials also could point to progress Saturday. More public transit services were back running, fewer people were out of power, and even the days-long gas shortage showed signs of abating. ""We need to continue to focus now on the next phase -- returning to normalcy,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said restoring electricity is the top priority, reiterating Saturday that his state will hold utilities accountable if they weren't prepared for Sandy. More than 835,000 customers were in the dark statewide by mid-afternoon. Marathon canceled . One of New York's top utilities, Con Edison, has restored power to all but 270,000 of its initially 940,000 customers affected by the storm, Senior Vice President John Miksad said. Bloomberg praised that company, while blasting the Long Island Power Authority -- which services the Rockaway peninsula -- for not having ""acted aggressively enough."" ""We realize that LIPA has outages throughout Long Island, but the Rockaways were the hardest hit by the storm,"" he said, adding that the utility indicated it could take two weeks to restore power there. ""When it comes to prioritizing resources, we think they should be first in line. So far that has not appeared to be the case, and that is certainly not acceptable."" LIPA did not immediately respond Saturday night to CNN requests for comment on the mayor's criticism. But the utility's official Twitter feed was active, with promises of extra crews and that 90% of its customers should have power by late Wednesday. Both Bloomberg and Cuomo praised the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for restoring 80% of subway services in New York City. The mayor said it should be up to 90% by Sunday. ""Not only did they try hard, but they got it done,"" Cuomo said. Powering cars and trucks is another issue, as evidenced by long lines at gas stations around the region. Long gas lines test patience . Christie noted that about 70% of gas stations from Interstate 195 and points north weren't operating Saturday -- not necessarily because they did not have gas, but because they couldn't pump it due to power outages. (By comparison, about 95% of stations south of Interstate 195 were working, he said.) In Suffolk County on New York's Long Island, Leah Cepeda-Winfield said people were sleeping in their cars around 3 a.m. Saturday, trying to be first in line once the pumps reopened. About eight hours later, lines were still about a quarter-mile long. ""It seems that these long lines are everywhere you go,"" said Cepeda-Winfield, a CNN iReporter. Still, a concerted effort in recent days to address the gas shortage appears to have yielded some positive results. Whereas the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported no gas in 67% of metropolitan New York stations on Friday, the federal agency estimated that figure plummeted to 38% on Saturday. In addition to other sources again flowing into the region, the federal government announced Friday night it would deliver 12 million gallons of unleaded gas and 10 million gallons of diesel to dispense around the hard-hit region. Such fuel had already arrived at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst and was being shipped out to stations, Christie said Saturday. Powerless in New Jersey . The governor also singled out Hess, based in Woodbridge, New Jersey, for distributing gas to rival companies whose stations had run dry. ""That's what New Jersey is all about,"" he said. Drivers in New York City and Long Island, meanwhile, were able beginning Saturday to fill up directly from 5,000-gallon fuel trucks moving around the area. Plus, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano issued a temporary waiver of the Jones Act, allowing oil tankers from the Gulf of Mexico to enter northeastern ports. On Saturday, officials cheered developments on several fronts. With one small exception, the Port of New York and New Jersey is now open to all vessels, the Coast Guard said. All water has been removed from the once-flooded World Trade Center work site, said Cuomo. Nearly $28 million in federal disaster emergency grants have been allocated across nine counties, the governor added. Migration to coast heightens impact of storms . Still, as millions can attest, headaches and heartache from Sandy persist. The 900-mile-wide superstorm left a huge swath of damage when it hit the Northeast this week, claiming at least 106 lives in the United States and two in Canada after earlier killing 67 around the Caribbean. Worst-hit New York state suffered 48 deaths, including 41 in New York City, authorities said. Twenty of those were in Staten Island. As communities grapple with the human toll, the price of the damage is stunning: between $30 billion and $50 billion, according to disaster modeling firm Eqecat. That far exceeds the firm's pre-storm estimate of $20 billion. The region may be in for more bad weather, with a weaker storm predicted for next week. But Christie, for one, isn't ready for that quite yet. ""I know there are some forecasts of a Nor'easter next week,"" the governor said. ""I can't believe it."" 7 health risks in the wake of the superstorm . CNN's Faith Karimi, David Ariosto, Erinn Cawthon, Henry Hanks and Maria White contributed to this report .","Cold temperatures heighten health and other concerns in areas still without power .

"Americans are split over President Barack Obama's latest immigration move, but they've become less sympathetic to immigrants here illegally over the past year, a new nationwide poll finds. According to the poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University and published Tuesday, just 45 percent of Americans believe Obama should issue an executive order to address the immigration issue if Congress fails to act, while 48 percent oppose such a move. The number of Americans who believe those here illegally should be allowed to stay and given a path to citizenship has dropped since last November, however — now, only 48 percent believe they should stay, compared to 57 percent who said the same in 2013. And the number of Americans who say illegal immigrants should leave the U.S. is at an all-time high in the new poll. Thirty-five percent of respondents said they should be required to leave, up from 26 percent last year. But while Americans might be split on how to tackle the country's immigration problem, they agree on one thing — that shutting down the government is not an appropriate response to Obama's move, a tactic floated by some Republicans. Americans oppose such a move 68-25 percent. Still, Obama's unilateral action has likely contributed to his strikingly low approval rating in the survey. With just 39 percent of Americans approving of his job performance in the latest Quinnipiac poll, he's nearing his all-time low approval rating of 38 percent. Fifty-four percent disapprove of the job he's doing. And Americans now trust Republicans in Congress more to do what's best for the nation than Obama, by 47-42 percent. While the poll shows a majority of Americans, 51 percent, are happy the GOP has taken over the Senate, two-thirds of the nation expects more gridlock over the next two years, and they're split over who will be to blame. Forty-four percent believe it will be Obama's fault, while 42 percent blame Republicans. The survey was conducted among 1,623 registered voters from Nov. 18-23 with live interviews via landline and cell phone, and has a margin of error of 2.4 percent.","A new poll out from Quinnipiac University finds a split on approval of Obama's immigration plan .

"Roma, Texas (CNN) -- Michele Bachmann leapt out of a black SUV near a high cliff overlooking the Rio Grande, dashed to the edge of a boulder and scanned the river that divides her country from another. It was a quiet Friday afternoon in this border town where immigrants routinely sneak across the river in inflatable rafts, climb a ravine and seek shelter in a local church. But at this moment, there was little more to see on the Mexican side than some fishermen casting rods and a few horses snacking near the river. ""Today it's dead,"" said Bachmann, a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota, sounding disappointed. She blamed the stillness on the presence of a hand-held CNN camera. ""I think it's quiet because the cameras are here. Because more than anything, the criminal cartel worries about and fears the wrath of the American people,"" Bachmann said. ""They're crooks, they're villains, but they're businessmen. And that's why they fear the CNN cameras."" She was joined by her friend, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, on a boulder above the river. The duo represent a coalition of House lawmakers who are staunchly opposed to any legislative action on immigration that would offer lawful status to immigrants living in the United States illegally. While they don't hold much official sway in Washingtonâ€”neither chair a congressional committee and Bachmann plans to exit Congress in Januaryâ€”they do play an outsized role in amplifying conservative messaging. They are prolific fundraisers and enjoy widespread support among the GOP's tea party base. Bachmann raised her profile in 2011 when she launched a brief presidential bid. As a veteran congressman from Iowa, the state that holds the first electoral contest of the presidential calendar, King also has the ear of the nation's top Republicans. And both are known to make inflammatory statements, a practice that gives them a platform in both conservative and liberal media. They arrived in Texas a day after President Barack Obama announced a controversial plan to invite certain immigrants living in the United States illegally to ""come out of the shadows"" with an offer for temporary legal status to some who pass background checks and pay back taxes. The President said he was acting in the absence of congressional action since the Republican-led House had failed to take a vote on a bipartisan immigration reform bill the Democrat-controlled Senate passed in 2013. The announcement outraged Republicans, who argue that he's overstepping the bounds of his office. House Speaker John Boehner labeled him ""Emperor Obama"" and one rank-and-file Republican, Rep. Mo Brooks, suggested the President could face impeachment and even prison time for his decision. Not to be outdone, Bachmann and King, representatives of districts that both lie more than 1,000 miles to Roma's north, wanted to be some of the first lawmakers on the border to respond. The spot they chose to visit, a Rio Grande overlook near a bridge that connects these two countries, is one they know well. The duo visited this exact place in July, when they took cell phone video of what they said showed a pregnant woman crossing the river. ""It just occurred to me,"" King said on his second trip here, ""the pregnant mother who was put off on the side here, she surely had the baby. That little baby is an American citizen. Last night Barack Obama gave that little baby's mother amnesty. She now has amnesty. Lawless, unconstitutional amnesty."" King's claim about the woman isn't accurate: To receive legal status under Obama's new plan, immigrants must have lived in the United States for a minimum of five years. The woman in his story, which occurred over the summer, would not qualify. In response to Obama's action, Bachmann and King want Congress to pass a resolution of disapproval, followed by a vote to censure him. Then they want to send an appropriations bill to the White House that excludes money necessary to carry out his plan, a strategy that Republican House and Senate leaders support. King didn't rule out impeachment down the line. ""Let's hope that we never have to answer that question,"" he told CNN. ""Let's hope that we can do the most reasonable things that we can do first."" WATCH: CNN'S tense encounter at the border. As for a solution to the nation's illegal immigration problem, King has proposed a three-tiered fence system that could span the length of the 2,000-mile border. After surveying the border, King opened the hatch of his SUV and pulled out a worn piece of paper that revealed a mock-up of a concrete fence system he designed in his free time. ""I constructed that fence on the floor of the House,"" he said. ""It's kicking around on YouTube."" King's not joking. In 2006, he constructed a scale model of the fence he designed live on C-SPAN, complete with miniature barbed wire and cardboard to represent the dirt. When asked about critics who argue a border-length fence would be costly and nearly impossible to build in entirety, King compared it to the Great Wall of China, a project intended to keep out invading armies that cost the lives of thousands of Chinese workers to build. ""There were plenty of Chinese left over,"" King said. The fence idea, however, would potentially only solve part of the problem. Even if the border were completely secured, an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants would still would remain in the United States. For Republicans who routinely rail against offering so-called ""amnesty"" to these people, they have little to say about what to do with them. Even King, who has built his career on railing against immigration, initially skirted the question. Finally, after multiple attempts for clarity, he conceded that he didn't feel it was the government's responsibility to address them. ""We do not have a moral obligation to bring people out of the shadows,"" King said. ""They came here to live in the shadows, that's their choice. So this idea that we've identified people that are living in the shadows and say 'We're going to come find you and bring you out of the shadows -- we're not called to do that."" With dusk approaching and no crossings to be found, King and Bachmann loaded back into their SUV and drove east toward McAllen, where they met with border control agents at a Homeland Security outpost. After the long day, they congressional day-trippers capped their adventure at a local Mexican restaurant over plates of enchiladas and a round of margaritas. On the rocks and with salt, of course.","Michele Bachmann and Steve King traveled to the border together .

"(CNN) -- There is optimism, and hope, that the Egyptian-brokered three-day ""humanitarian cease-fire"" between the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas will turn into a longer-term cessation of hostilities -- with good reason. Why? Militarily speaking, Hamas is on the ropes. Although the group has survived an IDF aerial, naval and ground onslaught, it has suffered a severe blow. Despite its somewhat successful attempts to portray itself and all Gaza as victims of a disproportionate Israeli military campaign, in the end it failed to prevent the IDF from achieving almost all its military goals, while achieving very little on its part. The Israelis stated early on in the campaign that their objectives were to find and destroy Hamas' networks of tunnels constructed under the Gaza border with Israel, tunnels designed to be used for offensive attacks on Israeli cities and kibbutzim in southern Israel. At the outset of hostilities, the IDF believed there were over 20 tunnels. At the end of the fighting, they had destroyed 32 tunnels, some almost 2 miles in length and demonstrating surprising engineering capabilities. Granted, it is impossible to know if the IDF has found all the tunnels. Opinion: Bring Hamas to the table . Let's look at the situation as it appeared on the day after the last rockets were fired, the last bombs were dropped and the last tunnels were destroyed. Hamas has lost most if not all its offensive tunnels. These tunnels were constructed over several years at great expense, not only in terms of resources expended, but in terms of diversion of those resources from the construction of infrastructure projects, including schools, hospitals, mosques and housing. As for casualties, the overwhelming numbers of dead and wounded were Palestinians. The death toll among the Gazans reached almost 1,900, according to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights. There are differing claims by human rights organizations and the Israeli government about how many of the dead were Hamas fighters versus innocent civilians. The human rights groups say 80% of the dead were civilians, while the Israelis counter with a figure of just under 50%. Assuming the human rights groups are correct, Hamas has lost fewer than 400 fighters; if we are to accept the Israeli figure, Hamas losses would be over 900. Given its suspected strength of more than 10,000 fighters, Hamas can absorb this level of manpower losses. If past conflicts are a guide, Hamas recruitment will soar in the wake of the fighting as young men are drawn to the organization that, at least in their own minds, successfully stood up to the vaunted Israel Defense Forces. Personnel losses will not affect the ability of Hamas to survive. That said, in addition to the loss of the tunnels, much of Hamas' rocket inventory has been depleted or destroyed. According to a spokesman for the Israeli military, Hamas started the conflict with an arsenal of about 10,000 rockets. One-third of those were fired at Israel, albeit with limited effect, and another third were destroyed in Israeli strikes. If those figures are accurate, that leaves Hamas with over 3,000 rockets. The numbers can be deceiving, since we do not have a breakdown of how many of which type remain in the inventory -- do they have a large number of the more capable Syrian-made M-302 (100 mile range) or locally made M-75 (50 mile range) rockets, or more of the less capable, locally made short-range al-Qassam rockets? In any case, Hamas still has thousands of rockets. However, of the thousands of rockets fired by Hamas (as well as some launched by Palestinian Islamic Jihad) at Israel, few caused significant damage. There have been three civilian deaths in Israel thus far in the conflict. The primary reason for the low number of deaths and injuries in Israel, aside from the inherent inaccuracy of the rockets, is the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome anti-rocket/missile system. After similar conflicts in the past, Hamas has been re-armed and resupplied by its supporters, primarily Iran and to some extent Syria. The most efficient method for the re-arming and resupply effort has been via the large number of smuggling tunnels between Gaza and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. That is not likely to be the case this time -- another blow to Hamas, which it must factor in to its assessment of this conflict as well as its future planning. The new government in Egypt under former defense chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is not a friend of Hamas. Al-Sisi considers Hamas to be nothing more than a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he has outlawed in Egypt. He has increased the Egyptian military and police presence on the Gaza border and destroyed many of the smuggling tunnels formerly used to import weapons into Gaza. Hamas cannot expect to be fully re-armed and resupplied via Sinai as it has in the past. This conflict ended, at least for a while, as most of the past wars have. Israel dominated the battlefield, possessing complete control of the air and sea, and took the ground fighting deep into Gaza, Hamas' home turf. The much more powerful Israeli armed forces did enormous damage to the public and civilian infrastructure while mostly achieving its military objectives. I said earlier in this conflict that Israel would pursue its objectives despite the inevitable world condemnation of its so-called disproportionate use of military force, and would stop its operations when it had achieved those objectives. We appear to be at that point. There has been far too much loss of life in Gaza. It is time to stop the fighting and seek a solution to this current crisis and establish a framework for a long-term solution. We have a chance to do just that. In this particular instance, the catalyst for that search may just be the serious military defeat suffered by Hamas. Fearing daughter's Gaza border wedding .

"For more than a year the Sudanese government has been bombing and spreading terror in the country's South Kordofan state, surgically cleansing the land of the Nuba people. The government of Sudan argues it is fighting a rebellion led by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement that engineered the secession of South Sudan. Khartoum still struggles to stomach the victory of the Southerners, brought about partly by the large number of Nuba fighters who -- after decades of marginalization and political exclusion -- joined forces with the Sudan People's Liberation Army. Accordingly, Khartoum treats the Nuba people as the enemy within -- a foe whose independent spirit has never been tamed . The cost: half a million people have been displaced or severely affected by the conflict, according to the U.N.'s Humanitarian Affairs office. The most recent rash of bombings is the second time in 20 years that the Nuba people have been targets of the same Khartoum leaders -- President Omar al-Bashir and Governor Ahmed Haroun. Both men are internationally indicted war criminals, although both deny the charges. See also: Evidence of cluster munitions in Sudan . Haroun engineered attacks against the Nuba in the 90s, refined his deadly tactics in Darfur in 2004, and is now back pursuing his murderous agenda against the Nuba with even greater efficiency. I traveled to Sudan bear witness, as a journalist and a Rwandan, to a people under siege, at the war-torn border between the two Sudans, one of the most isolated regions on earth. Smuggled into the Nuba Mountains, an area closed to the world, I filmed local activists documenting the attacks being perpetrated by the Khartoum regime. Despite being bombed several times a day since June 2011, the activists remain nonviolent. Armed with cameras and the hope for a better tomorrow, they relentlessly scour their homeland collecting the testimonies, pictures and evidence to build up a case against their aggressors: their government. Our team traveled to a number of villages up to 20 km from the front line. During my time in the region I experienced bombings as regimented as prison meals. We were attacked an average of three times a day. We were filming as the scale of atrocities unfolded with excruciating precision: the bombs falling, the people hiding in caves for safety, the destruction of villages, the casualties. Every day, we experienced hunger, fear, abandonment, exhaustion and unspeakable harshness, like the Nuba people do. At a moment's notice, we jumped in and out of foxholes and crawled in caves like they do to survive. Cramped, hot and terrified, we have seen and smelled the death of children, pregnant women and the elderly; the destruction of villages, crops, schools, water pumps, mosques, churches and hospitals. In the making of ""Erasing the Nuba"" we were bombed 19 times and lived to tell the story of resilience of a people harassed daily by landmines and rockets, in a region transformed into ghost towns, craters and ruins. See also: U.N. seeks probe into possible war crimes in South Kordofan . A lingering smell of death and growing despair ushered us out of the Nuba Mountains. Almost 63,000 Nuba have fled to the Yida refugee camp in South Sudan. There I saw a people left to fend for themselves, a people that know they have no friends, yet determined to face their destiny with the only thing they have left: dignity. In Yida, I attended a WFP-sponsored food distribution and saw how a 3kg ration of USAID-produced sorghum was distributed for each family to eat until the uncertain next round of food supply. In Yida, a mother begged me to take home with me her three-month-old baby, whom she had delivered squatted down under a tree on a rainy afternoon. I sat with Yida's oldest resident, a 101-year-old man who journeyed on donkey back for eight days to be reunited with one of his sons. The poor man was so disoriented that he had stopped eating and talking for days at a time. His family feared that leaving him alone might drive him to commit suicide. In Yida I watched children sitting on the branches of a tree to follow a mathematics class as the open-air ""classroom"" was packed. It struck me to see how one adult volunteer could teach a class of children, without the use of a blackboard and chalk. There is no such thing as pens or notebooks for the thousands of children in need of an education at Yida. See also: Sudan violence amounts to war crimes . Dreams for domestic reconciliation exhausted after two decades, the Nuba are holding onto the belief that ""the hearts of the international community"" woven into the fabric of our shared humanity ""will hear their cries."" They say they have been sacrificed at the altar of peace agreements between North and South Sudan and they feel cheated by the world's inaction. ""Erasing the Nuba"" has captured the spirit of the Nuba people of Sudan, a minority bowed but not broken -- not by the daily hellish rain of bombs and rockets, nor by the world's complicit silence. But for how much longer can they prevail -- hostages of Khartoum and us, the international community? A group of people and their way of life is being destroyed. Why are the Nuba, the heirs of a civilization that once stretched from Cairo to Lake Victoria, asked to shake hands with Haroun, and his murderous gang of ""Butchers of Khartoum""? Would one have asked European nations to make peace with Hitler? They have been forced to crawl in caves like beasts, survive on leaves and berries only to be told of a ""Sudan Fatigue.""  Unlike Assad in Syria -- bad as he is -- only one current head of state in the world is indicted officially by a due legal process: al-Bashir. Yet many in the world are advocating the removal of Assad. Mountains of grudges and greed fuel this conflict, where humanitarian assistance is used as a pawn on the chessboard of peace negotiations. Beneath the surface, jumbles of players -- local and foreign -- are waging a merciless war against each other for the political, economic and military control of the two Sudans. There can be no peace, no security, no stability, no settlement to this conflict as long as the blood of the Nuba children, women, men and communities will be spilled. My family falling victim to the Rwandan genocides that started in 1994, and a commitment to uphold the vow made by those touched by genocide the world over to ""never forget,"" inspired me to bring their story to light. ""Erasing the Nuba"" is my testimony, as a Rwandan and a journalist, to ensure these people are never referred to in the past tense.

"An online threat made by one of the killers of British soldier Lee Rigby could have tipped off security agencies and perhaps prevented his murder, lawmakers said Tuesday, but UK authorities were never alerted to it. The brutal May 2013 assault, in which Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale hit soldier Lee Rigby with a car, then hacked him to death with a meat cleaver and knives, shocked the nation. The men, both Islamic converts, were handed down lengthy prison sentences this year. A parliamentary committee investigating the killing concluded in its report that despite carrying out seven probes into the pair, the UK security and intelligence agencies could not have stopped the attack based on what they knew. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the Intelligence and Security Committee, said only one thing could have changed that: an online exchange that came to light after Rigby's death. But, he said, it was ""highly unlikely"" that the agencies could have discovered it, and the company involved did not alert them to it. While there were errors and delays in the seven investigations into the two men, Rifkind said, none of them was significant enough to have made a difference to the outcome. Prime Minister David Cameron, addressing Parliament on Tuesday, said that he shared the committee's concerns about terrorists' use of the Internet and that the government was doing all it could to combat this. ""We expect the Internet companies to do all they can, too,"" he said. ""Their networks are being used to plot murder and mayhem. It is their social responsibility to act on this. And we expect them to live up to it."" 'Safe haven for terrorists' In the December 2012 exchange, between Adebowale and an extremist overseas, Adebowale ""expressed his intent to murder a soldier in the most graphic and emotive manner,"" Rifkind said. ""This was highly significant. Had MI5 had access to this exchange at the time, Adebowale would have become a top priority. There is then a significant possibility that MI5 would have been able to prevent the attack."" But the only party that had access was the company hosting the exchange, he said, and it does not regard itself as under any obligation to ensure that it identifies such threats or reports them to authorities. ""We find this unacceptable: however unintentionally, they are providing a safe haven for terrorists,"" he said. Rifkind had stern words for online companies in relation to their cooperation with law enforcement agencies. ""None of the major US companies we approached proactively monitor and review suspicious content on their systems, largely relying on users to notify them of offensive or suspicious content,"" he said. Nor do they consider themselves obliged to comply with UK warrants, he said -- meaning that even if MI5 had sought information before the attack, the Internet company might not have responded. ""They appear to accept no responsibility for the services they provide,"" he concluded. How Islamist hate narrative inspired killers . Higher threat level . The government has started to take action, through a law passed this year and the appointment of a special envoy on intelligence and data sharing, Rifkind said. ""However, the problem is acute: until it is resolved the British public are exposed to a higher level of threat,"" he said. However, Jeremiah Adebolajo, brother of Michael Adebolajo, in a statement released by CAGE, a Muslim-led human rights advocacy group in London, accused the committee of trying to justify the expansion of the government's spying powers. Far from posting extremist material, his brother had almost no online presence at all, he said. ""It seems opportunistic that such a report will allow the expansion of a policy that is proving unpopular in all spheres of British society,"" Jeremiah Adebolajo said. ""It is sinister, to say the least, that emergency government policy will be drafted to allow the security services easier access to our social media and internet activities."" All this, he said, will only further alienate young Muslims, make it harder to track ""lone wolf"" attackers as they abandon social media, and restrict people's freedom of expression. UK Home Secretary Theresa May said Monday that a new counter-terrorism and security bill to be introduced in Parliament on Wednesday would include measures to help prevent radicalization, improve access to communications data and boost authorities' ability to act against those who go abroad to fight with terror groups. Intrusive techniques . Rifkind said the report, following an 18-month investigation, was the most detailed the nine-member, cross-party committee had ever published. The lawmakers inspected hundreds of highly classified documents and questioned ministers, the heads of the three agencies concerned and senior officers from the Metropolitan Police, he said. Of the two suspects, Adebolajo -- the older of the two -- was a high priority for two operations by officers from MI5, the domestic UK security and intelligence agency, but none of their efforts revealed any evidence of attack planning, Rifkind said. However, Adebowale was never more than a low-level subject of interest and the agencies had no intelligence to warrant more intrusive investigations. Rifkind defended the agencies' actions, saying, ""To put these investigations into perspective, it should be borne in mind that at any one time MI5 is investigating several thousand individuals who are linked to Islamic extremist activities in the UK."" But the UK security and intelligence agencies also have lessons to learn, he said. Urgent steps are needed to ensure that anti-radicalization programs work better, particularly given the number of young British men and women who have traveled to Iraq and Syria in recent months to join extremist groups. Also, he said, the response by Britain's overseas intelligence agency when Adebolajo was arrested in Kenya for suspicion of trying to join a terrorist organization was ""inadequate."" 'Eye for an eye' Adebolajo and Adebowale, both in their 20s, were convicted of murder in December of last year. Cell phone footage replayed at the trial showed Adebolajo, still clutching a cleaver in his bloody hands, ranting that the killing was ""an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" for British soldiers killing Muslims overseas. Adebolajo will spend life in prison, while Adebowale received a sentence of at least 45 years. Rigby, who had served in Afghanistan and was off duty when he was killed at the age of 25, left behind a wife and a young son.","Michael Adebolajo's brother says committee is trying to justify new spying legislation .

""I believe it was a correct verdict. In fact, I think it was the only verdict the grand jury could reach,"" Giuliani told CNN's New Day. Giuliani, who also served six years as a U.S. attorney, said the case against Wilson failed the two tests that should be considered in weighing an indictment: whether there is probable cause and whether a prosecutor could clinch a conviction.

""You have every right to protest, you have every right to scream, you have every right to yell.

"(CNN) -- Tareq Salahi said Tuesday he and his wife ""did not party-crash"" a White House state dinner last week. The Obama administration said Salahi and his wife, Michaele Salahi, attended but had not been invited to the state dinner for visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and officials say they got into the event because of a breach in security. Appearing on NBC's ""Today"" show with his wife, Tareq Salahi said the aftermath of the incident has been ""the most devastating thing that's ever happened to us."" ""We're greatly saddened by all the circumstances that have, you know, been involved and portraying my wife and I as party crashers. I can tell you, we did not party crash the White House."" Salahi said he and his wife ""are cooperating extensively with the U.S. Secret Service"" in their investigation of the incident and said ""the truth will soon come out."" Yet White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday the Salahis were not on an invitation list of guests. ""If your name is not on an invitation list and you show up, in my book, that's called crashing,"" he said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""The president was concerned about the security breach here, as was the Secret Service,"" Gibbs said. ""The Secret Service is evaluating their procedures."" The Salahis said last week that they would appear Monday on CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" but they later canceled after CNN reported Thursday about several lawsuits involving the Salahis. The couple's publicist, Mahogany Jones, urged CNN to delay its report about the couple's legal woes. ""We will begin doing press and media next week providing exclusive interviews and press junkets,"" Jones said in an e-mail to CNN on Thursday. ""If you would like to be considered in our media circuit we request that you hold your proposed published profile until then."" On the ""Today"" show, Gibbs was asked about a report that the Salahis had an e-mail exchange with a Pentagon official and believed they had an invitation. ""I think if you ask the Salahis directly, they were not on a list here at the White House. Their name was not in a security tower in order to get into this secure complex. And they had been told on a number of occasions that they did not have tickets for that dinner."" Monday, Defense Department official Michele Jones denied in a statement obtained by CNN that she helped try to get the couple on the list for the state dinner. ""I did not state at any time, or imply that I had tickets for ANY portion of the evening's events,"" Jones said in a prepared statement released by a White House official. ""I specifically stated that they did not have tickets and in fact that I did not have the authority to authorize attendance, admittance or access to any part of the evening's activities. Even though I informed them of this, they still decided to come."" Jones is a special assistant to Defense Secretary Robert Gates and serves as the Pentagon's liaison to the White House. The Washington Post reported that the Salahis have turned over copies of an e-mail exchange with Jones to Secret Service investigators. In the Tuesday interview on the ""Today"" show, however, the Salahis didn't want to give more detail on their position while the Secret Service investigates. Tareq Salahi said he and his wife are ""respecting"" the Secret Service ""timeline"" and ""want to get through that process."" They suggested there was no misunderstanding. ""In our view, it's clear to us. And based on the timeline, I think the American public is actually going to be extremely surprised with all the details that went from beginning to end into what was supposed to be a lovely, beautiful evening,"" Tareq Salahi said. The Salahis also denied a report that they were uninvited guests at a Congressional Black Caucus dinner in September, saying they had been invited there by a law firm and had been its guests at the dinner. ""Were we escorted out? Of course not. That's another gossip rumor,"" he said, saying the story got started through a gossip column. Yet a spokesman for the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation said Tuesday that the couple was asked to leave the event. President Obama and the first lady also attended that fundraiser dinner, but foundation spokesman Lance Jones emphasized that ""at no time did Mr. and Mrs. Salahi have access to President Obama and Mrs. Obama."" Jones said that at the CBC foundation's fundraiser two months ago, he saw the Salahis at the pre-dinner reception, and later in the evening was informed that the couple was seated at a table without tickets. The table was in the event's ""Gold Section,"" where tables sell for $20,000 each, he added. ""At that time, I went to grab a few security personnel, who were not Secret Service,"" Jones said. ""We walked with (security) to the table and just tried to sort everything out. When we realized they did not have tickets, the security personnel escorted them out."" The Salahis -- who said they were not paid by NBC to make an appearance on the ""Today"" show -- have been characterized as publicity hounds. They said their lives have been ""destroyed"" by their notoriety. ""Unfortunately, we've been mischaracterized, you know, through the media and other paparazzi forums, and you know, our homes have been invaded, and it's been just devastating what's happened to Michaele and I,"" Tareq Salahi said.

"Some residents of Oakland, California, fear their community is creating a monster. The city calls it the Domain Awareness Center, but opponents call it a ""spy machine"" and a potential ""tool of injustice."" Known as ""the DAC,"" it's a proposed central surveillance facility where authorities can monitor the Port of Oakland and the city's airport to protect against potential terrorism. But the broader issue of centralized data surveillance poses serious privacy questions for millions of people in cities around the globe. In March, more than 100 worried Oakland residents waited past midnight to complain about it during a City Council meeting. Standing at the mic, Maya Shweiky, a self-described public school teacher and Muslim, warned lawmakers their proposal would be used to ""discriminate against minorities and perpetuate racial, religious and political profiling."" While the council voted on the proposal, rowdy protesters began chanting, ""No! No! No! No!"" Council members have proposed expanding the DAC to add live, 24/7 data streams from closed circuit traffic cameras, police license plate readers, gunshot detectors and other sources from all over the entire city of Oakland. The danger, say opponents, is putting all these data resources into one place. ""If you need to go to four different locations to track someone's movements across town, you're not going to do it unless you have a good reason,"" said Linda Lye of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. ""But when you can do it with the press of a button because it's all at your fingertips, you'll end up doing it based on your idle curiosity."" That, Lye said, creates a situation ripe for abuse. Oakland represents just one battleground in a fiery debate about how cities should be using so-called ""Big Data,"" especially aggregated video and other types of surveillance. City closed-circuit TV cameras performed famously when they helped identify suspected terrorists in London in 2005 and in Boston last year. Community surveillance 2.0 . But the issue has progressed far beyond the power of a few hundred video cameras and streetlight posts. Community surveillance 2.0 is now all about huge data mash-ups and incredible software that quickly sorts through mountains of information. Bottom line: A relatively small number of people have easy access to data that can track your whereabouts. In many cities, cameras mounted on police patrol cars gather video of millions of license plates. That data that can be used to track vehicles, possibly yours. Add traffic cameras to the mix. Then include cameras at bus stops, airports and train stations. How about cameras owned by schools and private security companies? The key to using all this information is the data-mining software that can easily and effectively rifle through it. Cities leading the way in video data collecting include London -- an early and strong adopter of widespread camera surveillance. The UK reportedly has 5.9 million CCTV cameras nationwide. For every 11 British citizens, there's one CCTV camera, according to Salon. Nice, France, has been expanding its surveillance center, which is projected to eventually count one camera for every 500 residents. As Rio de Janeiro hosts the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, the city plans to make heavy use of its IBM-designed Operations Center, which combines video and other data from 30 agencies including traffic cameras, subways and even weather satellites. The network includes more than 550 cameras, 400 employees and 60 different layers of data streamed from citywide sensors. Mayor Pedro Junqueira says the center helps emergency teams warn residents in landslide-prone areas when to evacuate during heavy rainstorms. The center also takes credit for a rapid response to an emergency after a truck toppled a pedestrian bridge, blocking lanes on a major highway. Traffic was back to normal within nine hours.

It's using that data to help businesses learn how to market to pedestrian consumers. Placemeter also says it wants to use the data to help consumers with information such as when to visit your neighborhood coffee bar when the line is shorter.

Lessons from Boston . Last year's Boston bombings investigation showed how fast police were able to sift through mountains of surveillance data. After London's terrorist attacks in 2005, it took thousands of investigators weeks to painstakingly analyze all the CCTV footage. Eight years later in Boston, the FBI was able to release blurry images of two suspects in just three days. Read more about the pros and cons of security cameras . But the facial recognition data tools used in the Boston probe wasn't perfect. Images of the two suspects were available in public data bases, but the computers that searched that data missed them, CNN's Tom Foreman reported last year. Security analysts widely admit facial recognition technology is not yet good enough to spot a suspect in a crowd. Read more about facial recognition tech . Studies trying to determine the crime-fighting effectiveness of cameras have been inconclusive. According to the Surveillance Studies Centre at Queen's University in Ontario, urban surveillance systems have not been proved to have any effect on deterring criminals. But a study from the U.S. Justice Department says it depends on the circumstances. Sometimes cameras can be a ""potentially useful tool for preventing crimes"" the study says, ""when actively monitored."" Meanwhile, U.S. communities are taking steps to make their surveillance more robust. -- Chicago: When the transit authority put more cameras in rail stations, crime went down, according to CNN affiliate WGN. -- Dayton, Ohio: Police plan a new crime fighting strategy that includes 27 video cameras placed downtown, according to the Dayton Daily News. -- Sacramento, California: The sheriff has asked homeowners and businesses to register their security cameras on the department's website. Investigators would contact camera owners located near crime scenes to search their video for potential evidence, according to CNN affiliate KCRA. Even in tiny Chadbourn, North Carolina -- population about 2,000 -- CNN affiliate WECT reports they're talking about putting a camera down at the local Piggly Wiggly grocery store. Cities looking for guidelines aimed at safeguarding surveillance centers from privacy abuses might look to The European Forum for Urban Security, which suggests putting systems into place that include mechanisms for transparency, independent oversight and accountability. Privacy safeguards are being put in place in Menlo Park, California, where leaders recently passed a law requiring all data captured by automated license plate readers to be destroyed after six months unless it's part of an investigation. The whole issue is ""very explosive"" and the Oakland City Council recognizes this, said the ACLU's Lye. At the March meeting, after so many residents expressed their concerns, the council voted to curtail the scope of the DAC, limiting surveillance to just the port and the airport. The vote was 5-4. ""There will be efforts in the future to expand the DAC to include city-based surveillance systems,"" Lye warned. Oakland Mayor Jean Quan has promised to look into what privacy safeguards might be needed before trying again to expand the scope of the surveillance center. Quan, who favors the DAC, told the San Francisco Chronicle: ""This is obviously an issue that is splitting the country."" What do you think?

"(CNN) -- Screams of outrage. Crowds marching down streets, blocking intersections and interstates. Fists raised in silence. As the Ferguson grand jury's decision was announced Monday night, protesters around the country -- who had begun to gather hours earlier -- responded in solidarity. In New York, a roving crowd wound its way through the city, surging to more than 1,000 in Times Square before heading toward the Upper West Side, CNN's Miguel Marquez tweeted. Earlier in the evening, about 200 people flocked to Union Square, brandishing signs that read, ""Jail killer cops,"" and a large display, in lights: ""Black lives matter."" Protesters knocked down barricades and headed toward the West Village before turning north, accompanied by police. Emotions boiled over in Philadelphia, too. 'A thousand Fergusons across America' ""Shouts of ""f--- the police"" at word of no indictment,"" a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter tweeted. ""A man with the mic: 'we don't need to get mad.' Others: 'yes we do!'"" In Oakland, California, shop owners posted signs in their windows, ""We support Michael Brown,"" as marchers took to the streets. A crowd filled the intersection at 14th and Broadway, and some demonstrators laid their bodies down in chalk outlines, reports on social media showed. Later they merged onto Interstate 580, shutting down traffic. Similar scenes of a ""die-in"" were staged in downtown Seattle. ""Same story every time, being black is not a crime,"" protesters shouted, according to a report from CNN affiliate KIRO. In Washington, D.C., a large crowd assembled outside the White House, with some protesters lying down on Pennsylvania Avenue. In Los Angeles, a city still scarred by the riots of 1992, silent protesters staged a similar demonstration at the intersection of La Brea and Wilshire. A group also assembled in front of the Colorado Capitol in Denver calling for nonviolence, according to CNN affliate KMGH. The Chicago Tribune reported that some 200 protesters gathered outside the city's police headquarters, chanting ""We are Mike Brown!"" and ""I am Mike Brown!"" They also carried signs, the paper reported, bearing phrases like ""Won't stop 'til we get justice,"" ""Killer pigs must pay,"" and ""Stop the racist killer cops."" Later they marched through downtown before stopping at the State of Illinois Center, where they chanted into bullhorns. Chicago police scrambled to keep up. Protests around the country appeared to be largely peaceful, compared to the scenes unfolding in Ferguson. There, demonstrators set police vehicles ablaze and officers fired canisters into the crowds. In Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the streets appeared largely quiet. But at Morehouse College, where about 200 students gathered to hear the grand jury's decision, a collective gasp rippled through the crowd. What's next for the Michael Brown family? Some of the students at the historically black men's school looked at one another in disbelief, others started to tear up, and a few stared ahead as their jaws dropped. Police sirens wailed in the distance as the students chanted: ""Ferguson's hell is America's hell."" Kevin Harvey, a senior dressed in a blue blazer, button-down shirt and penny loafers, walked away from the demonstration with his head down. He said he was angry and bewildered by a storyline that's become all too familiar. ""I'm afraid to raise my son in this country,"" he said. ""When I do have a family, I'm afraid to raise him in this country and that's a terrible thought. Because I know that he is not valued."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . When asked his reaction to the verdict, Harvey tried to sort through his emotions. ""Confusion, anger, and generally just being upset,"" he said. ""I'm scared and frustrated."" Long before the grand jury decision was shared, announcing that Officer Darren Wilson would not be indicted for the murder of 18-year-old Michael Brown, the nation held its collective breath. As the sun set back East, people rose up -- hours before the decision was announced after 9 p.m. EST. More than 120 vigils and gatherings, both immediate and for Tuesday, were organized in cities large and small. From Toledo, Ohio, and Bangor, Maine, to Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Detroit, details have been shared on the Ferguson National Response Network. Read what Darren Wilson told the grand jury .

"An Iranian-American ex-Marine convicted of spying on his ancestral homeland and facing a death sentence wouldn't have been involved in espionage, a onetime colleague has said. Iranian state television aired what it called a ""confession"" by 28-year-old Amir Hekmati last month. His family said he was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives in Iran and that his statement had to have been coerced. In December, Sherri Condon, a software engineer who worked with Hekmati in 2008 and 2009 on an effort to develop a two-way, hand-held electronic translator for U.S. troops, said, ""it just doesn't sound like Amir to me."" Condon was the lead author of a 2008 paper describing the research. She thanks Hekmati in the acknowledgments. She described him as ""an entrepreneurial guy"" who sent colleagues a holiday card with a quote from Benjamin Franklin: ""Be always at war with your vices, at peace with your neighbors, and let each new year find you a better man."" ""I really like him,"" said Condon, who identified Hekmati from the images released by Iranian state television. ""He wasn't too nose-to-the-grindstone, but he really worked and put out good effort on behalf of these programs we worked with."" The work, funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, was aimed at improving communications between U.S. troops and local populations -- a problem with which Hekmati had grappled during service with the Marines in Iraq. He appeared in a video that touted the ""souped-up iPods,"" describing how American troops sometimes lost hours waiting for a translator to help them pose simple questions. ""He knew enough to be very helpful for us, and he was very helpful to us in terms of understanding the context in which the devices might be used,"" Condon said. ""He had the military experience."" Hekmati was convicted of ""working for an enemy country ... for membership in the CIA and also for his efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism,"" Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported Monday. He was sentenced to death. His family, along with the United States, has denied the accusations against him. ""We are deeply concerned that Amir is not receiving a fair trial and has not been afforded due process,"" said a family statement released last week. ""We have struggled to provide Amir with an attorney in Iran. We have sought to hire at least 10 different attorneys in Tehran to no avail."" The family said their son was being represented by a government-appointment lawyer. ""Under any standard, this is not acceptable due process of law,"" the statement said. ""We will not stop hoping and praying for justice, for peaceful dialogue with Iran, and for Amir's safe return home."" The Arizona-born, Michigan-raised Hekmati joined the Marines in August 2001, after high school. His four-year hitch included an assignment with the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, and a six-month deployment in Iraq in 2004, according to U.S. military records. In 2006, after leaving the service, he started his own linguistics company and began offering his services as an English-to-Arabic translator, according to Michigan incorporation records. He contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses, offering training in cultural competency and working with troops at military bases to promote understanding of and positive communication with people of other cultures, his family said. In 2010, he spent five months working as a research manager for defense contractor BAE, company spokesman Brian Roehrkasse told CNN. And Condon said Hekmati recently worked for a company that produced language-training material for the U.S. military. The United States and Iran have no direct diplomatic relations, but Hekmati's family has said he made the trip after obtaining permission from the Iranian Interests Section of the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. The interests section did not respond to CNN requests for comment. News of Hekmati's conviction is the latest turn in a series of allegations of espionage and plotting between Washington and Tehran, following the capture of a U.S. surveillance drone by Iran. Iran claims to have arrested a dozen CIA spies and there have been U.S. allegations that Iran sought to kill Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. Hekmati's family said that after his August 29 arrest, Iranian officials told them to remain silent ""with the promise of an eventual release,"" but they went public after Iranian television aired the accusations and Hekmati's statement. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said last month Hekmati is being falsely accused, but had no further comment. Condon said she fears Hekmati's military history drew him unwelcome attention in Iran. ""I can't begin to imagine what must have been in their minds, but I agree he wouldn't have been involved in any spying,"" she said. She said she has worked with other people who have families in Iran, ""and it's always scary when they go to visit."" ""They're always worried,"" she said. ""You feel so helpless, because it seems like there's nothing you can do.""","Iranian media report Amir Hekmati is sentenced to death .

"(CNN) -- Adam Mansbach's toddler wasn't thirsty. She wasn't hungry. And she definitely didn't need Dad to make up another story about farm animals having a picnic and dozing off. The possibility that he would never get to leave her room for dinner or a glass of wine or the world outside became a distinct possibility. The noted author didn't keep his feelings to himself. Instead, he turned his frustration into writing ""Go the F**k to Sleep,"" a tongue-in-cheek adult bedtime book that has swept the Internet and has already hit No.1 on the Amazon bestseller list a month before its June 14 publication date. Illustrator Ricardo Cortés captures the colorful mood of Mansbach's poetry. The cubs and the lions are snoring, Wrapped in a big snuggly heap. How come you can do all this other great sh*t But you can't lie the f**k down and sleep? ""I laughed and laughed and laughed,"" said Colleen Oppenzato, a Brooklyn mother of a 3-year-old boy who fights sleep every night and a 1-year-old girl who doesn't. ""I thought it was my life. Every single page, you're like 'yes, yes.' You don't need water, you don't need to go to the bathroom. You just don't want to sleep."" ""Go the F**k to Sleep"" hits a nerve with parents who hope for a life after their kids' bedtime. Independent publisher Akashic Books has responded to preorders and overwhelming Internet interest by increasing its first printing to at least 150,000 copies and moving up the publication date from October to June. The nightly exhaustion is ""a frustrating part about something we love very much,"" said Mansbach, a visiting professor at Rutgers University. ""A lot of these frustrations are not permissible to talk about. We're not completely honest because we don't want to be bad parents."" ""Looking at parenting books, there are more and more books that are less earnest about raising your child. They help parents step back and laugh at themselves a bit,"" said Mark Rotella, senior editor at Publishers Weekly and father of a 5- and 2 -year-old. ""It's more like a parenting book for when the parent is inconsolable in the middle of night and frustrated."" (Rotella warns parents not to leave the book lying around for children to see, noting that the illustrations are captivating.) Mansbach, whose novels include ""The End of the Jews"" and the best-selling ""Angry Black White Boy,"" started out as a poet before writing full-length novels. Each of his new book's 32 pages is written in the style of a classic children's picture book, but there are two conversations going on: The first two lines are what the parent is saying to the kid; the second half is the internal monologue that is never said. The eagles who soar through the sky are at rest And the creatures who crawl, run and creep. I know you're not thirsty. That's bullsh*t. Stop lying. Lie the f**k down, my darling, and sleep. At the end of the day, the child never hears the worst of the parent's frustration. ""The book is all about the obligation of a good parent to internalize the frustration and take the irrational behavior of a child and absorb it oneself,"" said Akashic Publisher Johnny Temple. ""The book is an outlet for that frustration, but it completely reinforces parents sucking it up and dealing with it. There's never a moment where the kid suffers because of the parent. It's actually pretty idealistic."" A G-rated version appropriate for young children is in the works, inspired by Temple's censored reading of the book to his 3- and 5-year-old children. ""They're aware we struggle every night to get them to sleep, and they get a big kick out of the fact that the book addresses their stall tactics,"" Temple said. Has his reading of the book taught his children any empathy for their parents' nightly struggle? Not at all. The 3-year-old's current tactic is to demand Mom or Dad snuggle to get him to sleep. ""And this is after the juice and too many books,"" Temple said. Even then, it's a gamble to get up. ""When you hear his breathing change, can you get out of the bed too early and burn yourself for another 15 minutes?"" The movie rights have been sold to Fox 2000.","Adam Mansbach turned his frustration with an unsleepy toddler into a funny book .

"During the height of the months-long protests in Ferguson last summer, police said demonstrators could protest all they want -- as long as they stayed home after dark. The reasoning back then: Troublemakers from outside the city come in to create chaos under cover of darkness, making the police's job of maintaining order difficult. And yet, even though a grand jury reached a decision on whether to indict Officer Darren Wilson by Monday afternoon, the decision wasn't publicized until hours later -- around 8 p.m. in Missouri. So why did officials wait so long? How prosecutor defended grand jury's decision . Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon was asked by reporters about the nighttime announcement. Nixon said the decision was made solely by St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. ""We coordinated with law enforcement, gave schools time to get their children home and in a safe place, gave businesses time to make a decision on their employees' safety, gave media time to set up, prepared our statement and made the announcement,"" Edward Magee, executive assistant to McCulloch, said in a statement. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said McCulloch's decision was ""foolish and dangerous."" ""I find this a completely bizarre decision to do this at night,"" Toobin said. ""Here's the thing about that time of night: it's dark. Anyone -- anyone! -- should have known that the decision in the Brown case would have been controversial. Crowd control is always more difficult in the dark."" CNN legal analyst Paul Callan noted the announcement was supposed to be made at 8 p.m. ET but was rescheduled for 9 ET. ""Why would you be moving it another hour? I think the only reason can be that they don't have their security forces in place,"" he said. Initially, prosecutors were expected to give law enforcement 48 hours' notice from when the grand jury made its decision to when the announcement was made. But that clearly didn't happen Monday, since the decision and the announcement came on the same day. Community activist John Gaskin anticipated McCulloch's explanation, saying he could understand if officials wanted to get schoolchildren home and businesses closed first. ""But he could have easily made this (announcement Tuesday) morning,"" Gaskin said at the time. Also, chilly nighttime weather can sometimes deter violence -- though Ferguson's near-freezing temperatures overnight didn't stop agitators from looting businesses and setting dozens of buildings and cars on fire. Benjamin Crump, the attorney representing slain teenager Michael Brown's family, said Brown's parents didn't know what the decision was after dusk fell on Ferguson. And they found out that the grand jury had reached some sort of decision from watching CNN.

"Guns don't make a nation safer. That's the conclusion of a study that found a strong correlation between gun ownership rates and the risk of death by firearms in more than a dozen developed countries. The United States and Japan were on opposite extremes of the scale of gun ownership, with 88.8 guns per 100 Americans and 0.6 guns per 100 Japanese. They were also on opposite extremes for firearm-related deaths -- 10.2 deaths per 100,000 people in the United States versus 0.06 per 100,000 in Japan. Britain's death rate was also low, at 0.25 per 100,000. ""This argues against the notion of more guns translating into less crime,"" said Dr. Sripal Bangalore, a cardiologist and director of the cardiovascular outcomes group at New York University School of Medicine, the lead author of the study. The study was based on data from the World Health Organization. The sole outlier was South Africa, which had 12.7 guns per 100 residents but nearly the same firearm fatality rate -- 9.41 per 100,000 residents -- as seen in the United States. The other countries were Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. The study, published in the current issue of The American Journal of Medicine, also correlated the incidence of mental illness with crime rates in each of the countries and found a weaker, but still significant, association. (Crime rate data were obtained from the U.N. Surveys of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems.) ""The gun ownership rate was a strong and independent predictor of firearm-related death, whereas the predictive power of mental illness burden was of borderline significance,"" the investigators concluded. ""Regardless of exact cause and effect, the current study debunks the widely quoted hypothesis that guns make a nation safer."" Bangalore noted that his study looked only at correlations. But a sharp reduction in gun deaths in Australia after its gun ownership laws were tightened proved a cause-and-effect relationship there, he said. ""I think it's reasonable to expand it to the United States,"" he added. Still, Bangalore said he would not go so far as to recommend changes, based on his work, in gun ownership laws. ""We prefer not to go too political into this, but the evidence shows guns don't make the nation safer, and mental illness is also a contributing factor,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""So something needs to be done. It is up to legislators and people who make policies to decide what that should be."" Shootings in Aurora, Colorado; Tucson, Arizona; Oak Creek, Wisconsin; and at Virginia Tech spurred them to look for a relationship between mental illness and access to guns. The National Rifle Association did not immediately respond to a request for reaction.","The United States and Japan are on opposite extremes of gun ownership rates .
They're also on opposite extremes for firearm-related deaths .
South Africa was the sole outlier in the 27-nation study ."
"Britain joined the U.S. and its allies in the fight against ISIS -- but any mission will come with a huge price tag. The UK parliament has approved airstrikes in Iraq against the terror group which prime minister David Cameron has called one of ""staggering""  brutality. Cameron had said Britain should join international allies in combating ISIS, an action that he warned would ""take not just months, but years."" While the total cost will depend on the intensity and length of operation, past experience can give some guidance, Malcolm Chalmers, research director from the Royal United Services Institute said. Chalmers pointed to the UK's seven month involvement in Libya through 2011, which cost around $390 million, including missiles and flight hours. The bill is additional to standard defense budgets, which include staffing costs and weapons spend. Last year, the UK defense budget was $60 billion. Chalmers said he would expect the cost of ISIS airstrikes to be in the ""ballpark,"" of the Libya operation, ""assuming we only use air power and the campaign lasts for a couple of years."" Cameron has said that the mission against ISIS could last ""years."" However, it is U.S.-led rather than the operation in Libya, in which European countries took the lead. 'Unique' missiles . Cameron, in Friday's debate aimed at convincing parliament to approve airstrikes, said Britain has ""unique assets"" no other coalition ally can contribute. Cameron named  the Brimstone precision missile, which he said minimized risk of civilian casualties, as one only Britain could contribute. The missiles can target convoys as well as fast moving, fleeting targets that were previously harder to strike, according to IHS Jane's senior weapons analyst Ben Goodlad. The Brimstone, which travels at supersonic speed, is a 1.8-meter missile weighing just under 50 kg. Advanced radar equipment enables it to guides itself to the target, so pilots don't need to maneuver to release it. IHS Jane's estimates each missile costs around $240,000. Brimstone missiles are compatible with the UK's Tornado GR4 aircraft. The aircraft were used by British troops for relief missions in northern Iraq just over a month ago. Six of these are ready for deployment at the UK's RAF base in Cyprus. Flying the Tornadoes costs around $57,000 per hour, according to information released in a parliamentary debate about Libya in 2011. From the Cyprus base, the aircraft could reach Iraq in just over an hour. Goodlad said the RAF also has Tornado's Storm Shadow cruise missiles, which cost $1.3 million each, and submarine-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles. These can be used to target areas that can't be accessed by planes, for example due to defenses, and cost round $1.5 million each. U.S. forces have been using Tomahawk missiles for airstrikes in Syria earlier this week -- dropping 47 of them on Monday evening. In total, the U.S. has conducted 20 strikes in Syria and 198 in Iraq from August 8 through September 23. Many of those operations weren't included in the Pentagon's daily average spending figure of $7.5 million at the end of last month.","UK can start bombing ISIS within hours, as it has six fighter jets on standby in Cyprus .

"Amir Mirzaie Hekmati, an American sentenced to death in Iran for espionage, has 20 days to appeal his case, according to Iranian law. ""If the sentence is appealed, then the Court of Appeals will hear the case. If not, then the sentence is final,"" judiciary spokesman Mohseni Ejeie said, according to the semi-official Iranian Student News Agency.  The statement was the first by a judiciary official, regarding the trail and the sentence. Hekmati's family has hired a high-profile lawyer with success in negotiating with Tehran to seek his release. ""We're prepared to open up a line of communication with the government,"" attorney Pierre Prosper said.  ""Our hope is that they will talk with us."" The goal is to remove the case from the political realm. ""This case is entrapped in an intense political environment,"" he said. Prosper is a former ambassador-at-large for war crimes under the Bush administration and a prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal at The Hague.  He successfully negotiated with the Iranian government for last year's  release of Reza Taghavi, an Iranian-American businessman detained for more than two years in Iran before being freed in 2010. Attorney who negotiated Iranian-American's release takes on case . Prosper said his next step is to revive the contacts he dealt with in dealing with Reza Taghavi's case and try to meet directly with Iranian authorities. Taghavi's release was the product of three trips by Prosper to Iran, meetings with Iranian officials in New York and Europe, and close to 300 e-mails with Iranian officials. On Monday, the semi-official Fars news agency reported that a court had convicted Hekmati of ""working for an enemy country,"" as well as membership in the CIA and ""efforts to accuse Iran of involvement in terrorism."" Hekmati's family and the U.S. government deny the allegations. The sentence came down five months after Hekmati's arrest. In Flint, Michigan, where the Hekmatis live, the community rallied around them. ""It's horrible.  I feel very bad for them,"" family friend Holly Ochodnicky told CNN affiliate WDIV-TV.  ""They're a great family.  They're good people."" The news came amid rising tensions between the United States and Iran. The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed Monday that uranium enrichment has begun at a nuclear facility in northern Iran. U.S. State Department strongly condemned the verdict. ""Allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was sent to Iran by the CIA are simply untrue,"" said department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland.  ""The Iranian regime has a history of falsely accusing people of being spies, of eliciting forced confessions, and of holding innocent Americans for political reasons."" The department urged Iran ""to grant the Swiss protecting power immediate access to Mr. Hekmati, grant him access to legal counsel, and release him without delay. "" In the absence of diplomatic relations between the United States and Iran, Switzerland serves as the ""protecting power"" for U.S. interests in the country. The complexities of the situation weren't lost at Mott Community College, where Hekmati attended and his father is a professor. ""Amir Hekmati is a pawn in this battle between two very powerful countries,"" school representative Michael Kelly also told WDIV.  ""Our concern here at the college is to protect the family.  They are in a very difficult situation."" Hekmati's parents said they were ""shocked and terrified"" by the news. ""We believe that this verdict is the result of a process that was neither transparent nor fair,"" Behnaz Hekmati wrote in a statement on behalf of herself and her husband, Ali. ""Amir did not engage in any acts of spying, or 'fighting against God,' as the convicting judge has claimed in his sentence.  Amir is not a criminal.  His very life is being exploited for political gain,"" the statement said. ""A grave error has been committed, and we have authorized our legal representatives to make direct contact with the Iranian authorities to find a solution to this misunderstanding.  We pray that Iran will show compassion and not murder our son, Amir, a natural born American citizen, who was visiting Iran and his relatives for the first time."" The statement also said Iran was denying that Amir is a U.S. citizen. The family is working with a public relations firm and has launched a website -- FreeAmir.org. ""Maybe, and it's only a maybe, maybe there's a possibility that some international pressure might encourage the Iranians to issue a stay of clemency of some kind,"" political professor and family friend Paul Rozycki told CNN affiliate WEYI-TV. Until now, Hekmati was represented by a government-appointed lawyer, despite his family's repeated efforts to hire a private lawyer for him. Hekmati was arrested in August while visiting his grandmother and other relatives, his family in Michigan said last month. The Hekmatis said their son served in the Marines from 2001 to 2005.  Later, he started his own linguistics company and contracted his services to the military as well as civilian businesses. His military contracts included cultural competency training. He worked with troops at military bases to promote understanding and positive communication with people of other cultures, his family said. Iran's notorious secretive trials have been assailed by human rights groups and governments around the globe. The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report on Iran says the court system is, in practice, ""corrupt and subject to political influence.""  And while the country's constitution provides a defendant the right to a public trial, presumption of innocence, and a lawyer of his or her choice, ""These rights were not respected in practice."" Hekmati is the latest in a series of Americans to face arrest in the country in recent years. Three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested in 2009 and ultimately released. Sarah Shourd was freed on medical grounds in 2010; Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer were freed in September 2011. Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public.  She was freed in May that year. Iranian-American Kian Tajbakhsh was among many people arrested in July 2009, amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown.  Exactly what he was convicted of was not clear. In March the next year, he was allowed temporary release within the country to celebrate the Persian New Year. That temporary release was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org, which works for his release.","Hekmati's family has hired a lawyer with success in negotiating with Tehran .

"Lawyers for Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, have sent letters to two photographers asking them to stop following the couple's son, Prince George, and his nanny around public parks, Buckingham Palace said Thursday. The two individuals have essentially been stalking Prince George, who is 14 months old, said a palace spokesman. William and Kate want their son, who is third in line to the British throne, to have ""as normal a childhood as possible,"" the spokesman said. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are grateful to the British press for refraining from publishing the paparazzi photos, he added. The letters were delivered ""earlier this week,"" the spokesman said. There has not yet been a response. Buckingham Palace spokesmen traditionally are not quoted by name. Catherine is expecting the couple's second child, royal officials confirmed last month, and as a result has canceled some public engagements. As during her first pregnancy, she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or acute morning sickness. The condition involves nausea and vomiting more severe than the typical morning sickness many women suffer during early pregnancy.","Two photographers have been following Prince George and his nanny in parks, palace says .

"Once known as the ""Hollywood Madam,"" Heidi Fleiss in recent years has become known as a fan of exotic birds. That interest, parlayed into a 2011 Animal Planet reality show, ""Heidi Fleiss: Prostitutes to Parrots,"" apparently helped spare Fleiss from handcuffs after authorities said they found nearly 400 marijuana plants growing at her residence in Pahrump, Nevada. A deputy did not arrest Fleiss because she had exotic birds valued at more than $200,000, Nye County Sheriff Anthony De Meo told CNN on Tuesday. ""We don't have facilities for exotic birds, and they are pretty rare and very expensive,"" the sheriff said. Authorities said they sent their report to the district attorney for charges to be filed. A deputy went to the home on August 7 to look for another woman wanted on an arrest warrant. The officer, finding the front door open and no one responding, went to the rear of the main residence and spied some of the plants, the sheriff's department said in a statement. Officers encountered Fleiss, who allegedly gave them consent to search another area. She told detectives she was growing the plants to sell to a cooperative in Las Vegas, about 55 miles to the east, authorities said. ""Ms. Fleiss could not produce the necessary documentation to support this. Later she admitted, in a roundabout way, that she was going to get a license because she did not have one,"" the statement said. Another factor in not arresting Fleiss was her consent to a search without a warrant and the fact that she was cooperative, the department said. A total of 392 suspected marijuana plants were counted, authorities said. Fleiss grabbed headlines in the 1990s after she was arrested in connection with a high-priced prostitution ring serving Tinseltown's rich and famous. CNN was unable Tuesday to find a phone listing for the residence. There was no answer at what is believed to be Fleiss' mobile number. CNN also left a message with a publicist known to represent her in 2011. Pals of suburban mom help her make $500,000 bail in pot case .","Authorities search Nevada home of Heidi Fleiss .

"(CNN) -- Evocative, unusual and perhaps a little disquieting, Asako Narahashi's photos of Japan can inspire a variety of reactions. From coasts to rivers and lakesides, her seemingly semi-submerged photographs frame water and land as if taken by a castaway catching sight of shore, presenting a unique perspective of the country. Since 2001 Narahashi has been using an all-weather film camera to take the series of photos that were first grouped under the title ""Half Awake and Half Asleep in the Water."" Using an all-weather film camera she has traveled across Japan in all seasons, wearing a bathing suit in summer or fishing waders in winter months, and sometime taking to a boat or canoe to capture the shots. ""After much trial and error, I realized that it was better to give a sense of the water in the foreground, and gradually I took more photographs positioned as though the lens was put partially in the water,"" Narahashi told CNN via email. ""When I first started shooting this series, I imagined shooting all the way around Japan from the sea. But as I progressed, I felt this framework is not necessary for me, so I shoot both in Japan and other places."" Her latest book ""Ever After"" is a continuation of that first series and saw travel across the world shooting in new locations. But her singular views of Japan are perhaps the most captivating. The commingling of the natural and the man-made is a consistent theme for Narahashi. ""(In Japan) nature exists within reach of people,"" she said. ""You'll find old and new buildings or billboards and other artificial things randomly mixed along with nature. The natural and man-made are constructing landscapes while permeating each other."" But as the tsunami of 2011 illustrated to devastating effect, the natural and human worlds do not exist in harmony. The catastrophe also had a significant impact on Narahashi and her photography. ""After seeing the images of the 3/11 tsunami, knowing the scope of the disaster, it was a time when I questioned whether I could continue to shoot in the same manner as before,"" she said. ""Since I began the series I had been thinking that both 'fear' and 'consolation' are in my photographs in the state of being suspended in mid-air, unable to go up or down. But after 3/11, I felt like the pendulum had swung to the 'fear' side. ""The only answer I could find was to continue to take photographs. In last few years, I'm continuing to shoot in the sea but I have more occasions to shoot in rivers and lakes in (the) last few years than before.""

"Beijing (CNN)In this narrow Beijing hutong, the rainbow flag flies free. I'm in Two Cities Cafe, a popular meeting place for the local gay community. Here, I meet with some of the country's leading LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) advocates to learn about gay identity in China. In the last two decades, China's LGBT community has made huge gains in social acceptance. Homosexuality was decriminalized in 1997, and a few years later it was removed from an official list of mental illnesses. But unlike their counterparts in the West, China's LGBT community does not have to face down strident political opposition or right-wing religious uproar. For them, the biggest source of pressure comes from the family, brought on in part by China's one-child policy. ""You have only one child so you want your child to be as 'normal' as everybody else,"" says Xiaogang Wei, Executive Director of the Beijing Gender Health Education Institute. ""There's also the pressure of carrying on the family line,"" adds Chi Heng Foundation founder Chung To. Fake marriages? Many Chinese gays and lesbians are responding to the family pressure with ""cooperative marriages"" -- gay men and lesbian women marrying each other out of social and economic convenience, often finding each other online. ""I grew up in the 80s and 90s and most of the people my age, everyone, got into marriage -- no matter gay or straight,"" says Xu Bin, founder of the advocacy group Common Language. ""If you're not, you're a monster."" Despite advances, the social stigma remains immense. According to a 2013 survey by U.S. research group Pew, only 21% of China's population was in favor of the acceptance of homosexuality. Same-sex marriage remains a taboo topic for many across China. And a number of clinics in China offer so-called ""conversion"" shock treatment to ""cure"" homosexuality. Earlier this year, a Beijing court heard China's first case to challenge the treatment. But a delay in the ruling has raised concerns in the gay community that clinics may continue to provide such treatments without challenge. Discrimination . China's LGBT professionals must also contend with a lack of legal protection against discrimination at work. ""The job discrimination is very subtle and you might not get a promotion because you are single. You might get fired because of all kinds of reasons,"" says To. ""There's no protection."" Though China has a long way to go before its gay professionals thrive professionally in all workplaces, Chinese gay activists are encouraged by the recent announcement by Apple CEO Tim Cook. ""I think Tim Cook's coming out of the closet is very important to the Chinese society, especially in the business world,"" Wei tells me. ""It also very effectively motivated people into thinking about the direct and non-direct connections between homosexual people and the products that we all use in our lives."" New generation . With these forces for change coming from both outside and inside China, the country's LGBT community is forging ahead, despite its unique set of challenges. ""For the past ten years, the most change probably came from the visibility of the LGBT community in Chinese society.  For the next ten years, I would say it's the visibility of LGBT rights in China,"" says Xu. As the focus shifts to a stronger call for greater rights, China's pioneering gay activists are looking to the younger generation to pick up the mantle. ""This generation is a lot more confident and self-assertive,"" To tells me. ""And they have more resources,"" adds Xu. ""In the end, I think we're fighting not just for a better situation for LGBT (people), but a better situation for all minorities and vulnerable people,"" says To. Out and proud, China's gay activists are an increasingly vocal minority pushing for change that could very well reach every corner of Chinese society.","China's LGBT community has made huge gains in social acceptance .

"Sometimes a 3-D printer part is just a 3-D printer part. Police thought they had seized the UKs first 3-D-printed gun on Thursday when they raided a local model-making shop, arrested its 38-year-old owner, and confiscated a 3-D printer and a number of parts they believed were for a 3-D printed gun. However, it now appears the parts are likely just replacement components for the 3-D printer itself. Officers suspected one piece was a 3-D-printed plastic magazine and the other a 3-D-printed trigger.  The seizure was part of a larger raid targeting organized crime by the Greater Manchester Police. ""If what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against this next generation of homemade weapons,"" said detective inspector Chris Mossop in a statement announcing the raid. Photos of the parts were quickly picked apart online by the 3-D printing community, including GigaOm, and identified as pieces for a 3-D printer. The store owner told the BBC the ""magazine"" part was actually a ""spool holder"" for the printer, and that the parts were designed by the printer manufacturer. In a follow-up statement, the department acknowledged that they could not confirm the parts were from a 3-D printed gun, saying they needed further forensic testing by ballistics experts. They also plan on searching through the shop-owner's computer for any incriminating files that might indicate he planned on printing a 3-D weapon. In addition to the plastic components, officers found air rifles and an air pistol in the shop, and said they had ""intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology."" These particular parts may not be for a gun, but law enforcement officials feel the threat of homemade firearms is very real. Since the first 3-D printed gun was successfully fired in May, 3-D printing technology has been on police radars. The printers are dropping in prices, costing anywhere between $300 and thousands for a home 3-D printing machine. Before they were taken down, the blueprint files needed to make a gun were available online for anyone to download. ""What this has also done is open up a wider debate about the emerging threat these next generation of weapons might pose,"" assistant chief constable Steve Heywood said in a statement. ""The worrying thing is for me is that these printers can be used to make certain components of guns, while others can be legitimately ordered over the Internet without arousing suspicion. When put together, this could allow a person to construct a firearm in their own home."" The 3-D printed gun technology is still in the early stages, but if it irons out the kinks and makes it affordable and easy to produce guns at home, it would create new opportunities for criminals hoping to stay off the radar.","UK police raid model-shop looking for 3-D printed gun .
