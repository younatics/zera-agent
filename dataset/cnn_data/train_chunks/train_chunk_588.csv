Left-wing Labour MPs marred generous tributes from across the political divide last night as they used an extraordinary recall of Parliament to launch vicious and intemperate attacks on the late Baroness Thatcher. A visibly emotional David Cameron said the former Prime Minister’s epitaph should be ‘she made our country great again’ and Labour leader Ed Miliband called her a ‘unique and towering figure’ – while criticising her for closing coal mines, her position on gay rights and other issues. There were more than seven hours of debate in the Commons – compared with only 45 minutes following the death of Sir Winston Churchill – and five and a half hours in the Lords. Scroll down for video . Divided benches: The scene in the Commons yesterday, with dozens of empty seats on the Labour side and packed benches on the Government side . But up to 150 Labour MPs boycotted the . special one-day session, convened in Lady Thatcher’s honour – leaving . the party’s benches half empty –  while some of those who did attend . prompted outrage by using the occasion to condemn her. Glenda . Jackson sparked angry protests from Tory benches as she launched into a . tirade against the ‘heinous’ former Prime Minister, telling MPs she did . not consider her a woman. ‘The . first Prime Minister of female gender, OK. But a woman? Not on my . terms,’ said Miss Jackson. Her remarks prompted such uproar that the . Conservative MP for Banbury Sir Tony Baldry attempted to raise a point . of order with Speaker John Bercow to draw a halt to attacks but was . rebuffed. Away from the House, former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair had urged critics of Thatcherite policies to be respectful. ‘Even . if you disagree with someone very strongly, you can still – . particularly at the moment of their passing – you should show some . respect,’ he said. No shows: Few Labour MPs turned up to the seven hours of debate in the Commons where representatives from all parties paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher . Leading tributes: Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour Leader Ed MIliband paid tribute to Margaret Thatcher during the special one-day session . Disgrace: Heartwarming cross-party tributes paid to Baroness Thatcher during yesterday's session in Parliament were tarnished by outrageous attacks from left-wing politicians in attendance . But Miss . Jackson, an Oscar-winning actress who entered the Commons in 1992, . claimed Lady Thatcher had taught that vices were virtues. ‘Greed, selfishness, no care for the weaker. Sharp elbows and sharp knees, this was the way forward,’ she said. ‘People saw the price of everything and the value of nothing. There was a heinous social, economic and spiritual damage wreaked upon this country.’ Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott tweeted a link to TV footage of Miss Jackson’s rant, saying he was ‘proud to be a fan’. 'Not a woman': MP Glenda Jackson marred the tribute session launching a furious attack on the late Margaret Thatcher . Former Labour Environment Minister Michael Meacher said Lady Thatcher lacked the ‘generosity and magnanimity’ that needed to accompany greatness ‘if one is to earn a place in the heart of the nation’. Veteran MP David Winnick claimed Lady Thatcher had adopted policies that were ‘highly damaging... caused immense pain and suffering to ordinary people’. Former Labour Housing Minister John Healy was among MPs who stayed away, alleging Mr Cameron had attempted to ‘hijack’ Lady Thatcher’s death for political gain. Others complained about the costs of recalling Parliament and the taxpayers’ contribution to the cost of Lady Thatcher’s funeral. Mr Cameron insisted that it was right to commemorate our first and only woman prime minister, who won three elections in a row and was the 20th century’s longest-serving British premier. ‘They say “cometh the hour, cometh the man”. Well in 1979 came the hour and came the lady,’ the Prime Minister said, his voice cracking with emotion. ‘She made the political weather, she made history, and – let this be her epitaph – she made our country great again.’ Replying for Labour, Mr Miliband listed a series of policy areas where he considered ‘she was right’, including the Falklands war. But areas where he believed she was wrong included on gay and lesbian rights, her position on Nelson Mandela and sanctions against South Africa and for saying there was ‘no such thing as society’. ‘I disagreed with much of what she did but I respect what her death means for many, many people who admired her and I honour her personal achievements,’ he said. In a poorly-received speech, Nick Clegg said: ‘That those of us who are not from her party can shun the tenets of Thatcherism and yet still respect Margaret Thatcher is part of what was so remarkable about her.’ Regrets: Lord Tebbit in the House of Lords yesterday . Baroness Thatcher’s friends and foes alike united yesterday to remember a titan of politics whose public reputation for stridency was tempered by private kindness. LORD TEBBIT Lady Thatcher’s party chairman, laid bare the fury of Thatcherites at the way the Cabinet ousted her in 1990. Saying he regretted not returning to her Cabinet after caring for his wife, a victim of the Brighton bomb, Lord Tebbit concluded: ‘I left her, I fear, at the mercy of her friends. That I do regret.’ LORD LAMONT the former chancellor, revealed she had told him: ‘You do not have a constructive idea in your head and if you had been in government since 1979 I would have achieved nothing.’ ‘I said: “Well Prime Minister you are always right about everything but there is one thing you are wrong about – I have been in your government since 1979”.’ LORD HOWARD the former Tory leader, said: ‘It has been said many times that she was a divisive figure. She was. She had to be. There was no consensus on the right thing to do for our country. If she had waited for consensus, nothing would ever have happened. She saw what needed to be done and she did it with clarity, courage and conviction.’ LORD ASHDOWN the former Lib Dem leader,  recalled visiting Downing Street with his wife, who ‘hated [Mrs Thatcher’s] policies with a passion’. He continued: ‘The Prime Minister stopped and talked to us for a few moments and as she moved away, my wife hissed through gritted teeth: “She’s absolutely bloody charming, dammit”.’ SIR GERALD KAUFMAN Labour’s shadow foreign secretary in the 1980s, said: ‘Unlike Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan or Ted Heath, she broke the post-war consensus; that was her objective, and that was her achievement. In personal relationships, and in some policy areas, Margaret Thatcher could be more than civilized – indeed, punctilious and cordial.’ SIR MALCOLM RIFKIND who served as a minister throughout Lady Thatcher’s 11 years in power, said: ‘It was sometimes said that she did not have a sense of humour... but I recall on one occasion that she was asked, “Do you believe in consensus?” To our surprise, we heard her saying, “Yes, I do believe in consensus: There should be a consensus behind my convictions.” I thought at the time that this was an extraordinary example of wit, but as the years have gone by I have realised that she was actually being deadly serious.’ LORD ARMSTRONG . Lady Thatcher’s cabinet secretary, recalled how French president . Francois Mitterand flirted with her at their first meeting. ‘I said to . her: “That visit went rather well, didn’t it?”. She said, “Yes, I . suppose it did”. Then there was a pause and she said, “Of course he . likes women, you know”. The President had been – how shall I put it? – . flattering her femininity throughout the meeting, and she had recognised . that and enjoyed every minute of it.’ Tribute: Former Tory leader Lord Howard honoured Margaret Thatcher, saying she did what needed to be done for the country with 'clarity and courage' LORD FOWLER described his ‘total amazement’ at being named in Lady Thatcher’s first Cabinet and his disappointment at being  named transport minister.  “Norman,” she said, “I did transport, you can do transport”.’ LORD JOPLING who was Lady Thatcher’s chief whip in her first term, recalled her personal kindness: ‘At the first Christmas for which she was Prime Minister, she said to me: “Do you know of any of our people in the Commons who are going to be alone this Christmas period? If you do, I would like to ask them to stay at Chequers”. That, I thought at the time, was one of the most generous things from somebody with all the pressures on them of being prime minister.’ BARONESS WILLIAMS one of the Gang of Four who founded the SDP, recalled the strength of Lady Thatcher’s marriage to husband Denis: ‘I cannot underline too strongly the extent to which I think Mrs Thatcher began to lose her life when he passed away.’ LORD YOUNG of Graffham Lady Thatcher’s trade secretary, praised her ‘compassion’. He said: ‘Every night during the six weeks of the (Falklands) campaign she would have a list of the casualties and every night, before going to bed, she would write a long hand-written letter to the parents or the partner.’ CONOR BURNS MP a close friend, recalled a taxi ride to her home. He said: ‘I went to pay the driver, but he refused to take the fare. The driver said: “Your fare tonight, guv, is you go in there and you tell her from me that we ain’t had a good’un since!” I imparted that message to Margaret, who looked at me and said: “Well, he’s quite right.”’","Labour benches empty at special Commons session in honour of Thatcher .

A young Boston University student was killed in a house fire over the weekend, the latest in an alarming series of deaths reported in the school community since April of last year. Binland Lee, a 22-year-old senior from . Brooklyn, New York, was killed over the weekend in a massive blaze at . her off-campus apartment. Boston fire officials said that 15 others, including six firefighters, were injured on Sunday morning at a 2-1/2-story wood frame house in the Allston neighborhood. Tragic deaths: Binland Lee, left, was killed on Sunday in a fire at her off campus apartment on Sunday, while Lu Lingzi, right, was one of the fatal victims of the Boston Marathon bombings . She is the 11th BU student fatality to be reported in 13 months. Miss Lee's death came just two weeks after 23-year-old Lu Lingzi, a grad student at BU, perished in the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15 - one of three deaths reported in the horrific blasts. Miss Lu had aced her qualifying exams in the days before the historic race. The senseless deaths of the women have rocked the Boston University community - and for many, they are the latest in a long line of fatalities in anything from accidents to shootings to suicides. Trend: At least 11 Boston University students have died in the past 13 months . Emily Overholt, the editor-in-chief of BU's student newspaper - the Daily Free Press - told ABC News: 'We get them in these little clusters. It's hard, because it's really catching up to people.' She added: 'It's one thing after another.' BU President Robert A. Brown told the Boston Globe that he too is coming to grips with the student deaths. He told the paper: 'There’s a sadness because you see people come here with so much aspiration. To have what look like sets of random tragedies, you’d like to analyze each one and figure out why it happened... It's just so senseless.' A town hall style meeting regarding the recent university tragedies was held on Monday. Last month, freshman Anthony Barksdale II was found unconscious at an off campus apartment where a BU fraternity was holding an event. Mr Barksdale was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. His death resulted in the suspension of the fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu, BU Today reported. Communications student Christopher Weigl, an avid photographer and cyclist, was killed in December when he was hit by a tractor-trailer while riding his bike. Weigl's death came just a month after another cyclist, Chung-Wei 'Victor' Yang, died after he was struck by an MBTA bus at the Harvard and Brighton Avenues intersection.

In May of last year, three BU students studying abroad in New Zealand were killed when the minivan they were riding in went off the road and crashed. Daniela Lekhno, 20, of Manalapan, New Jersey; Roch Jauberty, 21, whose parents live in Paris; and Austin Brashears, 21, of Huntington Beach, California, were pronounced dead at the scene.

"By . Rob Cooper . PUBLISHED: . 04:11 EST, 18 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:11 EST, 18 April 2013 . Facebook plot: Ceri Shipman, 25, was jailed for two and a half years after creating the false confessions which purported to be from her boyfriend's rape victims . The girlfriend of a rapist who tried to clear his name by framing two of his victims with false Facebook profiles has been jailed. Ceri Shipman, 25, wrote fake confessions that the sex attacks had been made up in in a desperate attempt to get her partner Jason Savage, 29, out of prison. One of the bogus messages said: 'Maybe we did lie, but there's nothing you can do about it'. After police were alerted, the rape victims were arrested and questioned by detectives before police uncovered the sick plot in Hull, East Yorkshire. Savage, a former boxer, was found guilty of three counts of rape and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm against two of his victims. He may never be released from prison after receiving a life sentence with a minimum term of nine years in April 2010. Shipman thought the sentence handed down to her boyfriend was unfair and was convinced the victims were lying, so set her plan in motion, Hull Crown Court heard yesterday. After Shipman created the false profile for the first victim, Shipman sent a message to herself reading: 'You want to know about . your loser boyfriend yet?' She replied from her own profile: 'I have nothing to say to you. I added you by accident.' The 'victim' said: 'Maybe I did make up the rape, but he broke my heart.' Shipman then remarked: 'It is women like you who need to be locked up.' After creating the false Facebook confessions, Shipman handed her dossier of 'evidence' over to police who arrested the victims. They were questioned for a total of 13 hours and bailed for four months. However, police and IT experts were able to trace the location the messages were sent from and discovered that they had all been sent from Shipman's address. They also found that she was browsing her own Facebook at the same time the fake messages were written, and found pictures of the victims on her computer when it was seized. After the plot unravelled, Shipman pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Both victims of the deceitful plan were present at Hull Crown Court as Judge Mark Bury described the plan as 'despicable'. 'If the victims would have been convicted of lying, then they would have been vilified as young women who cried rape,' Judge Bury said. Sex attacker: Shipman, 25, made up the fake confessions in an attempt to get her rapist boyfriend Jason Savage, 29, right, released from prison . 'You could not believe the sentence that was imposed, you thought it was unfair and you thought the victims had lied. 'It is despicable conduct. You are the only individual that has lied. 'There is no precedent in a case like this, and there's not been a case like this. It gives me no option but to impose an immediate custodial sentence.' Mark McKone, prosecuting, described how Shipman carefully created the fake Facebook profiles so that they appeared genuine. 'Ceri Shipman set up two false Facebook accounts in the name of two of Savage's victims, and also created fake valid email addresses,' he said. 'She copied the profile pictures and information from their real accounts and set up the fake accounts herself. 'It was found that at the time of when the victims' fake messages were sent, Ceri Shipman was online and browsing her own Facebook account.' The court heard that Shipman, of Hull, sent the messages between May 13, 2010 and August 3, 2010. Jailed: Ceri Shipman was given two and a half years behind bars yesterday at Hull Crown Court. There was applause from the public gallery after the judge delivered his sentence . A bogus conversation involving the second ‘victim' read: 'He got what he deserved. 'Maybe we did lie, but there's nothing you can do about it.' Shipman's response was: 'See what I mean, you lied and you just admitted it, how can you live with yourself?' One of the victims was said to be 'in a state' after being arrested by officers, fearing that there may be a retrial or her attacker may be released from prison. Mitigating, Andrew Fitzpatrick said: 'Nowadays, it's so simple to write a Facebook message and click ""Send"", but she is fully aware of just how serious this is.' Admission: Shipman pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice after her plot came unravelled . Guilty: The judge said Ceri Shipman's case was without precedent as he jailed her . Judge Bury jailed Shipman for two-and-a-half years, which drew brief applause from the public gallery. Senior Crown Prosecutor Michael Waudby said after the case: 'What Ceri Shipman did goes against the heart of the criminal justice system. Dissatisfied with the outcome of a Crown Court trial involving her boyfriend Jason Savage, she tried to change it in a calculating and devious manner. 'She sought to undermine the stories of two of her partner's victims, firstly by creating fictitious Facebook accounts in their names and then recording false conversations on those accounts which implied the women had lied at the trial of Jason Savage. This information was then passed to the police. 'Initially the accounts were so believable that the police had to instigate a criminal investigation against the two victims, which involved their arrest and questioning at a police station. It soon became apparent however that Ms Shipman was involved and an early analysis of her computer revealed criminal behaviour. 'Obtaining the evidence to prove exactly what Ms Shipman had done still proved to be complex and took time as we worked closely with Humberside Police as well as Facebook and MSN in the USA. 'When the evidence was put to Ms Shipman she denied any wrongdoing but eventually had to accept that the case against her was so overwhelming that she was left with no alternative but to plead guilty, and she has now been sentenced by the Crown Court to two and a half years imprisonment. 'It's disturbing to think that anyone could put victims of violent and sexual abuse through further torment but Ceri Shipman decided to take on the criminal justice system. 'She has failed and now, like her partner, finds herself having to serve a prison sentence.'","Ceri Shipman, 25, wrote false confessions from the victims to herself .

"By . Rachel Reilly . PUBLISHED: . 06:11 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:36 EST, 22 April 2013 . Four-year-old Ethan Stewart is at risk of dying from a seizure every time he falls asleep, gets excited or is bored. Since his birth he has suffered thousands of epileptic fits because he was born with a unique combination of rare neurological conditions. Even the delight at hearing the doorbell ring is enough to cause the youngster to black out and lose all control. Fragile: For young Ethan Stewart from Scotland, the things that make childhood fun are what put his life at risk . His parents Erica and Philip must keep a close eye on him constantly, as he is susceptible to a fit at any time. Ethan suffers three separate neurological conditions. He has Sturge-Weber malformation that causes epilepsy and increases the risk of stroke. It affects only around one in every 50,000 babies. He also has widespread intercranial haemangioma, a rolling ball of blood vessels in his skull, as well as an abnormal collection of blood vessels under his skin, which are visible as a blue mark on his face and forehead. And, if that wasn't enough, he also suffers with cortical dysphasia, an abnormality in the brain’s development, which causes the electrical signals to misfire, which also triggers seizures. The combination of these diseases means that the youngster suffers from frequent seizures, which vary dramatically in severity and length. Most last for just a few seconds but some can go on for several minutes. The seizures occur throughout the day and night. The most serious of which leaves his mother unable to rouse him from his sleep. Doctors mistook the blue veins on Ethan's forehead for a bruise immediately after his birth . Little did doctors know that Ethan suffered a unique combination of three different neurological disorders . It first became apparent there was . something seriously wrong with Ethan shortly after he was born at . Aberdeen Maternity Hospital. He had to be resuscitated as he stopped breathing when the umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck during labour. Ethan, weighing just 5lb 1oz, was . then taken to the neonatal unit, where staff originally thought bruising . on his head was caused by the forceps used to deliver him. But they soon realised it was more serious and scans showed his brain had developed abnormally. Genetic testing and MRI scans were then carried out, before doctors confirmed his unique diagnosis. Mrs Stewart said: ‘The wind dropped out of our world. It seemed so unreal.‘ . Ethan had to be resuscitated after birth because his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck . ‘His . MRI scan just looked like a mishmash of blood vessels. The neurologist . calls him a walking miracle because he can’t believe the way he is now . and the way his brain scan was.’ Ethan has a weakness down his right side and he is slightly smaller than average for his age. Mrs Stewart, 34, from Mosstodloch, Moray, said: ‘Ethan’s had thousands of seizures. I try to keep a diary of them. ‘In the last month he has had about 100, but he’s probably had more than that, because sometimes they’re so quick, I can’t catch them all. ‘The slightest thing can trigger it, excitement, boredom, exhaustion. He gets excited when his friends come over or when someone arrives at the door and the bell rings. It’s very difficult. But his condition is just part of life now. ‘Sometimes at night you think, “what if?”. It’s always at the back of your mind that something awful could happen but you can’t allow yourself to live in fear. ‘You’ve got to enjoy one day at a time and not let it steal your life. ‘My biggest fear is Ethan not being socially accepted because of his condition rather than him dying.’ On a good day Ethan might only suffer two or three seizures, but most days he suffers up to 10. But Ethan, who is hoping to start mainstream school this summer, has astounded everyone with his incredible resilience and determination. 'Medical miracle': Doctors thought Ethan would struggle in life but he is astonishingly spritely and able . Doctors have hailed him a ‘walking miracle’. Indeed  despite suffering from multiple seizures every day, he enjoys life like any other happy-go-lucky toddler, and loves nothing more than going to nursery and kicking a football around the garden. Mrs Stewart said: ‘Ethan does get frustrated sometimes because he is tired a lot of the time. Fitting exhausts him. But he just takes it all in his stride.’ During many of his milder seizures, Ethan can appear to be daydreaming. Other times his muscles will go weak and he’ll fall to the ground. Some cause him to run about, smack his lips, and mumble incoherently, though he is unconscious at the time and is completely unaware of his actions. Other seizures make him feel scared or he’ll get a strange feeling in his stomach. He can also suffer from the more serious tonic-clonic seizures, which can be life-threatening. Mrs Stewart said: ‘There is a misconception about epilepsy that you lie down and have a fit. But Ethan’s are all quite different. Ethan hopes to start mainstream school this summer and has astounded everyone with his incredible resilience . Bright future: Ethan now takes medication to help control his symptoms . ‘Some of the seizures can just look like naughty behaviour. But his eyes will be away in the back of his head and if I click my fingers in front of his face, he won’t respond. With complex partial seizures he starts mumbling incoherently and runs about all over the place. It looks like he is awake but he’s not. ‘I’ve got to monitor him in the bath and watch he doesn’t climb up high. ‘There was one time, when we went swimming, Ethan became excited and had seizure after seizure. If I hadn’t had a hold of him he would have been under the water. Ethan is a determined young chap who is looking forward to starting school . ‘If he’s not conscious the worst thing is trying to restrain him. You just have to make sure he’s safe and that he doesn’t bump into things or run out into the road.’ Sometimes Ethan is able to warn her when a seizure is about to happen because he gets a strange smell, known as an aura, or his face will turn red. Many, however, are so brief that when he was younger it was not always obvious when he was having one. Because of this, Ethan was not formally diagnosed with focal epilepsy, where the excessive electrical activity that causes the seizure is concentrated on one part of the brain, until last September. He is now on anti-convulsion medication to try and control the number of seizures he has . Mrs Stewart, hopes the drugs Ethan is now on will have a greater effect over time. But Mrs Stewart said: “He is very bright. “They [the doctors] didn’t think he would do very much and would struggle with everything. ‘But from the moment he was born, I have been praying for that child. I feel so blessed to have him in my life. ‘He is such a character and he is so strong and very confident in himself. ‘He really is the sort of person who just gets on with it. We are so proud of him.’ Mrs Stewart is now trying to raise awareness of Epilepsy Scotland, which has helped her cope with Ethan’s seizures. She has already raised more than £1,200 for the charity, after dying her hair purple last month.

After the affair: Actress Antonia de Sancha was pictured outside a cafe 20 years after her affair with Tory minister David Mellor made tabloid headlines . There she sits, fag in hand, hair cascading over her shoulders, woolly coat wrapped around her body to keep off the chill. On a winter’s day, Antonia de Sancha is having lunch outside a tapas restaurant in London. She is ready for her next beer, if not her close-up. Yet, come on. Antonia looks pretty darn good for a 51-year-old smoker. She still has that lovely skin and the pale, Modigliani face. She still looks in great shape, which is more than you could ever say about David Mellor. Then or now. Still, can it really be 20 years since she was a femme fatale, to put it politely, who famously romped with goofy Dave when he was a Tory minister in the John Major government? Have two whole decades really passed since the unlikely couple were making whoopee together? Of course, that was before Antonia burst their lurvve bubble and became the most famous kiss-and-tell merchant of her day. Their torrid cavortings were splashed all over the newspapers and TV screens for weeks afterwards. Toe-sucking, spanking, skipping about in a Chelsea football strip? Oh, Excellency, you knew how to spoil us with ministerial affairs back then. Following her revelations, there was the never-to-be-forgotten spectacle of Mellor parading his wife and children behind a garden gate, like targets on a fairground stall. All in a desperate, doomed attempt to prove his family life was intact. He was just as shameless as she was. Eventually, Mellor left the government and his wife. Meanwhile, de Sancha tried and failed to cash in on her notoriety. She took part in a documentary about mistresses; she briefly became the agony aunt of Erotic Review magazine. However, the public — unlike Mellor —remained resistant to her charms. Especially when, after ten years, she admitted the saucier details about their affair were untrue. How unforgiveable! Mellor recently complained her allegation that he insisted on wearing a Chelsea FC strip when making love would follow him to his grave. Pass me a hankie, darlings. That’s enough to bring a tear to a glass eye. Where did all this get Antonia? She apparently imported textiles and jewellery from India and Thailand for a while. At some point, her brief marriage also failed. Today, she lives in a one-bedroom flat in a down-at-heel area of London and exhibits few signs of a woman who has made a great triumph of her life. Cashing in: Antonia de Sancha became the most famous kiss-and-tell merchant of her day . The lover: David Mellor, pictured on the night he quit as Heritage Secretary in 1992, following a number of scandals, including his affair with Miss de Sancha . In contrast, look at David Mellor, who exudes the sleek, satisfied air of the rich and successful international businessman he is. He lives with his glamorous partner, Penelope, Viscountess Cobham. His life is charmed. He has shaken free from his former shame, like a dog wriggling off the raindrops following a storm. All things considered, Antonia seems to have fared less well. And that is my point. In the world of kiss and tell, short-term gain is always followed by long-term decline. The women almost always come off worse than men, many of whom seem to ultimately survive the bombshell of their indiscretion and go on to thrive, like cockroaches. Sorry: Escort Jenny Thompson says she is full of regret about her torrid past . For the kissers and tellers, however, there is only the initial, exciting firework explosion of notoriety and fame. Closely followed by nothing but ashes. Perhaps all this will be noted by Jenny Thompson, the escort girl who made public her affair with married footballer Wayne Rooney. This week she made a TV apology to his wife Coleen. The 23-year-old said she wanted to apologise about the England and Manchester United star’s infidelity with her while she was a £1,300-a-night call girl. She only embarked on this career, she says, because she was a teenage rebel. It was only later that it ‘become an addiction’. Ms Thompson has given up being an escort, become a mother and says she is full of regret about her torrid past. Asked what she would like to say to Mrs Rooney, she replied simply: ‘I’m sorry.’ Hmmmm! Is she really? If she was truly contrite, wouldn’t she want to spare Mrs Rooney further embarrassment? Wouldn’t she have the good grace to crawl under the nearest luxury rock, instead of rubbing Coleen’s nose in the scandal on a daytime TV show watched by millions? It is hard to imagine Jenny’s mischievous apology brought any comfort for Mrs Rooney. Let’s face it, she’s not mortified or humbled — she is utterly brazen. Still. Jenny is only on the telly to promote herself and to try to rehabilitate her reputation. For she is working on a book about her life, no doubt with lots of tell-all sauce about her links to Premier League stars. That’s how truly sorry she is. And while she might be the centre of attention now, all she has to do is look at Antonia de Sancha to see what the future holds. Not much glamour there! Twenty years from now, Jenny will understand the pattern. Be they footballers or politicians, powerful men will survive the attentions of their mistresses or consorts, and go on to prosper. While it is unlikely the indiscreet mistress will come out of it well. The woman almost never does. Just ask Antonia. This week, Sir David Attenborough said that if he had a torch, he would pass it to Professor Brian Cox. The legendary broadcaster has no plans to retire, but suggested that Cox should take over fronting the BBC’s natural history programmes when he does. Noooooo! Cox, who has become a household name following the success of his BBC2 series Wonders Of The Solar System, is hugely popular. He is the man credited with making physics sexy — that’s if you like your quantum theories delivered by someone with a choirboy haircut and a perma-smirk. Is he really a worthy successor to peerless David Attenborough? Enthusiasm isn’t everything. Plus the prof is always slightly too pleased with himself for comfort. And anyone who is never off TV, who made a guest appearance on stage with Gary Barlow, and who still likes to complain about the downside of fame does not my vote get. Not something Sir David would have ever done. Nor Sir Patrick Moore. Not even David Bellamy. Every blade of grass may have 3.8 billion years of history written into it — but it is still humble. She's already got the Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild gong, and she’s probably going to get the Bafta, too, closely followed by a lovely, piping hot Oscar. Is it going to be a straight flush of Best Supporting Actress gongs for Anne Hathaway (above) for her role as Fantine in Les Miserables? Get your hankies at the ready, for I think it has to be a yes. How can she fail? Winner: Actress Anne Hathaway has already won a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award and is hotly-tipped to take home a Bafta and an Oscar . Anne with the quivering, Malteser eyes plays a good girl forced into prostitution to care for her illegitimate child. She has to go on a starvation diet, get all her hair cut off, swop her prim needlewoman’s dress for a tart’s rags, be ravished by an army captain, get her teeth pulled out, give it the big boo hoo when she sings I Dreamed A Dream (think of Gazza crying at the Word Cup, multiply it by ten and you are almost halfway there), die, get resurrected as a ghost and do all of this in about 15 minutes of screen time. Give that woman a medal as well as a gong. She deserves it. Actor Brendan Coyle is the latest celebrity to reveal himself on Twitter. Reveal himself as a not very nice person, that is. Brendan — perhaps most famous for playing Mr Bates the valet in Downton Abbey — made several barbed remarks on Twitter about former prime minister, Lady Margaret Thatcher. As a way of establishing yourself as a political thinker, that’s on a par with spray-painting a peace sign on a wall. I mean, grow up, Brendan. No wonder that on reading his remarks, NHS consultant Roberta Knighton tweeted him to suggest the comments were beneath him. The star replied by telling her to ‘go f*** yourself’. Twice. Oaf! Coyle is the kind of Twitter celebrity who only wants followers to agree with his every tiny, gorgeous thought. He will brook no dissent. Look, if he can’t cope with the modern world of communications, he should go back to brushing dandruff off Lord Grantham’s shoulders. Or just shut up. Oooh, get him! Karl Lagerfeld is being bitchy again, claiming Michelle Obama ‘looks like a newscaster’ with her new fringe and hairstyle. Now just hold it right there, K-Lag. I won’t have a word said against FLOTUS (that’s the First Lady of the United States, for those who never watched West Wing). Bond villain look: Karl Lagerfeld has criticised Michelle Obama for her new fringe haircut . Especially not by some desiccated ogre in leather glovettes and a peroxide comb-over. What is the Chanel boss like? If he was a Bond villain, Karl would be too far-fetched. As the Child Catcher, he’s more believable. He’s not just ghastly. He’s not just wrong. He is out of touch with ordinary women who like and admire Michelle for all the right reasons. What is going on? I read that when appearing on an American chat show this week, Catherine Zeta-Jones (right) ‘easily passed for a woman much younger than 43’. Oy! There are millions of us out here who don’t think 43 is particularly old. Who would actually love to be 43 again. And not just around the hips. Meanwhile, Davina McCall complains that because she has long hair at the age of 45, her granny thinks she is a slut.

A teenage boy hitched a lift home from school by riding on the tailbar of a 40 tonne lorry in a dangerous stunt that 'could have killed him'. Police said they were trying to track down the schoolboy responsible and said the stunt was 'extremely dangerous and reckless'. The schoolboy - who nonchalantly gave the thumbs up after leaping off the back of the truck - was today condemned by road safety officials for the prank which was caught on camera. The child, thought to be aged around 14, is wearing his blue school blazer, as he foolishly jumps on the back of the lorry in Blackburn, Lancashire. Scroll down for video . Dangerous: Sonny Wilson rides on the tailbar of the lorry in a terrifying stunt which was filmed and posted on Facebook . Terrifying: Sonny Wilson didn't expect the lorry to drive off when he jumped on the back . The driver set off completely . unaware that a child was hanging off the back of his vehicle and at risk of serious harm. Footage of the incident was captured by a . front seat passenger in a car travelling behind and the 52-second clip was posted on Facebook. The lorry driver negotiated a major road junction before travelling up hill along a busy road for around half a mile as the boy sat on the tailgate seemingly admiring the view. Eventually when the TNT delivery lorry slowed down at traffic lights the boy jumped off and gave the occupants of the car behind a cheeky thumbs up before walking off down the street. Danger: As the vehicle climbs uphill on the main road through Blackburn, the boy continues to cling to the back . Risk: The lorry makes its way past parked cars with other vehicles and a bus passing in the opposite direction . Horror: A lorry passes in the opposite direction, left, and the boy then shortly afterwards jumps off, right . The road which has small shops and terrace houses is one of Blackburn's busiest approaches, leading towards the M65 and towns including Accrington and Burnley. Today Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: 'This is a dangerous and foolish act which could easily result in serious injury or death. 'We urge teenagers not to give into peer pressure or to encourage others to copy this behaviour.' The group who filmed the video can be heard shouting: 'What's he doing the crazy little f*****?' Calm: The boy wanders off after jumping off the lorry as if nothing untoward had happened . They then add: 'Are you filming it? He must be s****** himself. Look at him. What the f*** is he doing?' The lorry passes a bus, as well as rows of parked cars as he travels at up to 30mph on the street. The clip with the title 'Only in Blackburn ya find a little kid like this couldn't believe it funny as f***' has now been shared thousands of times on the social media website. Suzanne Sourbutts said: 'Silly boy, if that wagon had to brake suddenly God knows what might have happened.' Pauline Emmerson added: 'What if he'd fallen, not so funny if he'd landed underneath a car.' Andrew Tony posted a message saying: 'Saved himself 40p bus fare there..... Bit crazy tho...' Councillor Jim Shorrock said it could have led to 'devastating consequences' and he called for local head teachers to tackle the to 'prevent it becoming a craze'. He added: 'I also hope other young people across Blackburn are not thinking of doing anything so stupid.' Lancashire police said they are aware of the footage and were making inquiries to trace the boy in the video. Inspector Gareth Hill, head of the Road Policing Unit, said: 'What this young boy did is extremely dangerous and reckless. 'It is a potentially life threatening practice that we would not support or encourage. Pleased with himself: The boy walks off after completing his ride through the town which was condemned by road safety experts . 'We know the route this vehicle took and we will now be making inquiries to ascertain who this young man was. 'All those sharing this reckless . incident on social networking sites such as Facebook are acting . inappropriately, almost encouraging other young people to do the same . thing. 'I now plan to visit schools in the area to explain the dangers involved in behaviour like this. 'I appeal for anyone who recognises this young man to come forward and contact police.' A TNT Express spokesman said: 'TNT . Express is aware of video footage on social media channels which shows a . young schoolboy riding on the rear bumper of one of its vehicles. 'TNT does not condone such dangerous and illegal behaviour which could lead to serious injury or worse.

When Phillip Schofield handed the Prime Minister a list of names of supposed paedophiles on live TV last November, he had no idea the ten-second stunt would end up personally costing him tens of thousands of pounds. Until now it’s been widely assumed that ITV would put up the majority of the libel payout to Lord McAlpine, whose name was briefly visible on a card that the 51-year-old presenter handed to David Cameron during his appearance on This Morning. However, I’m told Phillip has agreed . to split the £125,000 damages plus legal costs, meaning he will lose at . least £62,500 from his £1million salary this year. Doing the honourable thing: Phillip Schofield has agreed to split the the libel payout to Lord McAlpine, whose name was briefly visible on a card that the presenter handed to David Cameron on This Morning . Libel pay out: A technical fault was blamed when the list accidentally flashed on screen on This Morning, meaning Lord McAlpine's name was visible . My ITV source reveals: ‘Phillip was . aware his job was on the line. He felt very grateful to ITV for the . significant public support they showed him at the time when there were . many calls for him to be sacked. ‘Obviously £60,000 is a significant . amount of money, even for someone making as much as him. 'It shows how . seriously he took the situation, but he has no plans to speak publicly . about it. He wants to move on.’ Phillip presented a list he’d obtained . from the internet of names of five former Conservative politicians . apparently connected to the North Wales child abuse scandal. But a . technical fault was blamed when it accidentally flashed on screen, . meaning McAlpine’s name was visible to over a million viewers. Jonathan Dimbleby branded Phillip’s . actions as ‘cretinous’ and McAlpine’s solicitor Andrew Reid said they . had ‘destroyed my client’s reputation’. Cut: Beattie Edmondson, 25, has been axed from comedy series Live at the Electric . For over two decades, Jennifer Saunders has been a darling of the BBC, creating French and Saunders and Absolutely Fabulous. But her daughter hasn’t had the same success. I’m told Beattie Edmondson, 25 (whose father is comic Ade) has been axed from comedy series Live at the Electric. Her comedy group Lady Garden were dropped after a tasteless Nazi-themed sketch had to be scrapped because it featured torture. My BBC source reveals: ‘Beattie’s group didn’t cut the mustard with BBC bosses. The fact she’s Jennifer and Ade’s daughter couldn’t save her.’ But Beattie (above) was given another chance — the BBC offered her a role on new Ben Elton sitcom The Wright Way, which has been widely panned by the critics. Jason Manford will remain host of ITV panel show Good News, Bad News, despite sending flirtatious messages behind his wife’s back for a second time. In 2010 he sent explicit Tweets to a fan, resulting in his exit from BBC1’s The One Show. But the show’s executive producer Jimmy Mulville insists: ‘It’s irrelevant. He’s a comic host doing a fine job.’ Adventurer: Bear Grylls is at the centre of a very showbiz bidding war between the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 . Adventurer Bear Grylls became a worldwide star after drinking his own urine and eating ants to survive in the wild, but now he is at the centre of a very showbiz bidding war between the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The channels are battling to sign the UK’s Chief Scout after the former SAS soldier signed a deal with Discovery allowing him to work with UK terrestrial broadcasters for the first time. ‘This will turn him into one of the biggest TV stars in Britain,’ an insider predicts. Broadcasters want to launch a version of his new NBC format Get Out Alive. My source reveals: ‘He takes 20 pairs of ordinary people into the wild and sends them on brutal and dangerous journeys. They are fighting for a £500,000 prize so the stakes are high.’ ITV also want him to compete on I’m A Celebrity... and Channel 4 already have an agreement to make another series of Wild Weekend. Meanwhile, Bear is expected to begin filming for another new show called Ultimate Survivor across Europe, Canada, Guatemala and North Africa next month. Returning: ITV's decision to bring back Broadchurch for a second series was down to 'people power' ITV’s decision to bring back Broadchurch for a second series was down to ‘people power’, according to sources on the hit drama that came to a dramatic conclusion on Monday night. I’m told writer Chris Chibnall and ITV executives only ever envisioned it as a one-off whodunit, meaning planning for series two is at a very initial stage. Most of the cast have no idea whether they will be asked back, although there is an assumption that the leads David Tennant and Olivia Colman have ‘expressed interest’ in returning. Joe Sims, who plays Nige Carter, tells me: ‘I have no idea if I’ll be asked back. Most of the cast don’t yet. Of course, none of us wanted to be the killer because we all hoped the door would be left open to us if there was a new series.’ Meanwhile, the actor says the huge popularity of the drama has intruded on his everyday life. ‘I was in the street and a policewoman approached me to ask whether I’d killed a dog. I thought I was about to be wrongly arrested before I realised she was talking about my character on Broadchurch.’ Sadly, the last minute decision to bring Broadchurch back means the next series might not air until 2014.","It'd been assumed ITV would put up most of libel payout to Lord McAlpine .

Fitting road to go down: Poland wants to name a roundabout in Warsaw after Baroness Thatcher because there's no need for U-turns, a reference to her reluctance to perform a political volte-face during her time as Prime Minister . It is, in hindsight, the natural tribute. A council in Poland is trying to re-name one of its roundabouts after Baroness Thatcher as U-turns are impossible. City officials in Warsaw have made the proposal. Local councillor Wojciech Bartelski told local media it would be 'the perfect way' to remember Lady Thatcher’s role in aiding the collapse of Communism in eastern Europe. One of his colleagues claimed: ‘A roundabout is the perfect way to represent Mrs Thatcher. It makes u-turns unnecessary.’ Lady Thatcher coined the phrase 'the lady's not for the turning' in a speech to the Conservative Party Conference in October 1980 to symbolise her refusal to perform a U-turn on her tough economic reforms which earned her the nickname the Iron Lady. In it, she said: 'To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the 'U-turn', I have only one thing to say: ""You turn if you want to. The lady's not for turning"". 'I say that not only to you, but to our friends overseas and also to those who are not our friends.' Poland is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the former Prime Minister, who died earlier this month aged 87. There have also been proposals from politicians in the country to build a statue in her honour. She is well-liked for her role in helping end the Cold War in Eastern Europe. However, the plan may face opposition from political foes in Poland. Some left-wingers in Warsaw claim the roundabout should be named after Edward Gierek, a former Polish communist party first secretary from the 1970s.

But three years ago, it was struck by an infestation of flies, forcing the congregation out.

The evangelist Martin-Luther church in Krumpendorf in Styria, in southern Austria has been hit by a plague of flies . The church takes so long to clean before each service, at least two hours, that the congregation has left the building and now has to use a nearby catholic church in Krumpendorf. Helga Duffek said: 'The church has been on the site since 1969 but suddenly in 2010 the was an infestation of flies – we called in the pest control and it didn't help at all, so we called several other pest control advisers but nobody was able to do anything.

Despite frequent cleaning away of dead flies they are still littered everywhere on the seats, on the floors and on the tables and alter while other living flies are seen buzzing around overhead. Insect experts who have attempted to get to the bottom of the bizarre problem have identified five completely different species of flies infesting the church. The church was built in 1969.

Politics in the OPEC nation, which has oil reserves to rival Saudi Arabia, has been left in a volatile state following the death of popular socialist leader Hugo Chavez last month. Mr Maduro - Chavez's annointed successor - defeated opposition centre-right candidate Henrique Capriles by 1.5 percentage points in the ensuing election. Mr Capriles has refused to recognise his loss in the vote, alleging that thousands of irregularities were committed and the election 'stolen'. The vote exposed a nation evenly divided after 14 years of Chavez's socialist rule, which saw him raise taxes on foreign oil companies and redistribute the money to social programmes for health and education. It shocked many on the left who had expected an easy win for their candidate, a former bus driver.

Last night's clash erupted when members of the opposition unfurled a banner in the National Assembly denouncing the measure that has stripped them of most legislative powers until they recognise the election result. One of the opposition parliamentarians was left with a bruised and bloody face, seen as he gave an interview to a local TV station in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital.

Government parliamentarian Odalis Monzon said she and her colleagues were attacked and beaten during the punch-up. 'Today again I had to defend the commander's (Chavez's) legacy,' she said. The fighting came after the government-controlled assembly passed a measure denying opposition members the right to speak in the chamber until they recognised Mr Maduro as president. 'Until they recognize the authorities, the institutions of the Republic, the sovereign will of our people, the opposition deputies will have to go and speak (to the private media) but not here in this National Assembly,' said Diosdado Cabello, the head of parliament. Both sides accused each other of starting the incident, which took place behind closed doors without media present.

As many as four in ten Muslims living in Afghanistan and Palestine support the use of suicide bombing, an extensive new international survey has found. The high support for the desperate tactic in those war-torn regions was nearly matched in Egypt and Bangladesh, where 29 per cent and 26 per cent of respondents agreed with its use respectively. However, the worldwide poll of Muslims by the Washington-based Pew Forum found that in most countries three-quarters or more rejected suicide bombing and other forms of violence.

Views on punishments such as chopping off thieves' hands or decreeing death for apostates is more evenly divided in much of the Islamic world, although more than three-quarters of Muslims in South Asia say they are justified. Those punishments have helped make sharia controversial in some non-Islamic countries, where some fear radical Muslims want to impose it on Western societies. The survey shows, however, that Muslim societies are far from monolithic in their views. 'Muslims are not equally comfortable with all aspects of sharia,' the study said. 'Most do not believe it should be applied to non-Muslims.' British Muslim activist Anjem Choudary: Some in the West fear that Muslims want to enforce sharia law in non-Islamic societies . Unlike codified Western law, sharia is a loosely defined set of moral and legal guidelines based on the Koran, the sayings of Prophet Mohammad (hadith) and Muslim traditions. Its rules and advice cover everything from prayers to personal hygiene. Princeton University political scientist Amaney Jamal, was special adviser for the project, said Muslims in poor and repressive societies tended to identify sharia with basic Islamic values such as equality and social justice. 'In those societies, you tend to see significant support for sharia,' she said. By contrast, Muslims who have lived under 'narrow if not rigid' Islamic systems were less supportive of sharia as the official law. More than four-fifths of the 38,000 Muslims interviewed in 39 countries said non-Muslims in their countries could practice their faith freely and that this was good. This view was strongest in South Asia, where 97 per cent of Bangladeshis and 96 per cent of Pakistanis agreed, while the lowest Middle Eastern result was 77 per cent in Egypt. The survey polled only Muslims and not minorities. In several Muslim countries, Christian minorities say they cannot practice their faith freely and are subject to discrimination and physical attacks. The survey produced mixed results on questions relating to the relationship between politics and Islam. Democracy wins slight majorities in key Middle Eastern states - 54 per cent in Iraq, 55 per cent in Egypt - but falls to 29 per cent in Pakistan. By contrast, it stands at 81 per cent in Lebanon, 75 per cent in Tunisia and 70 per cent in Bangladesh.

Conflict with other religions loomed larger, with 68 per cent in Lebanon saying it was a big problem, 65 per cent in Tunisia, 60 per cent in Nigeria and 57 per cent in Pakistan. A section of the survey on U.S. Muslims noted they 'sometimes more closely resemble other Americans than they do Muslims around the world'.

E-numbers, television and chemicals have all been traditionally blamed for causing hyperactivity in children. But a new study suggests living near a noisy road can lead to the condition. Youngsters who were exposed to the highest noise levels at home showed 28 per cent more symptoms of hyperactivity and inattention than those exposed to the lowest traffic noise levels, researchers found. Noise pollution and sleep deprivation can affect emotional wellbeing, German researchers found . Michelle Bosquet, a psychologist at Boston Children's Hospital, says that noise pollution can have a dramatic affect on children's behaviour and their mental wellbeing. The loud noises lead to broken sleep and can affect behaviour . Ms Bosquet, who was not involved in the German study, says that traffic noise can disturb a child's sleep or concentration, which could be linked to hyperactivity. Researchers led by Carla Tiesler at the Helmholtz Zentrum German Research Center for Environmental Health studied 900 children living in Munic, NBC reported. Noise levels outside of each child's home at the wall of the house were measured, and parents answered a questionnaire about their 10-year-olds' behaviour. Youngsters who lived in the homes with the highest level of noise were more than twice as likely to show unusual emotional behaviour - such as anxiety - than those in the quietest properties, according to NBC. After researchers considered sleeping . problems, they also concluded that difficulty in going to sleep was also . responsible for emotional difficulties. Nearly . 8 per cent of U.S children between three and 17-years-old have been . diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder the Centers for . Disease Control and Prevention have said. Nearly 8 per cent of U.S children between three and 17-years-old have been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder . The study's authors considered other factors which can influence behaviour - such as the subjects' exercise levels - but said that other variables than sleep deprivation and noise could cause ADHD. chemical pollution and sound-proofing were not measured . The study was published online in March in the journal Environmental Research. The study comes after a leading U.S doctor believes that many cases of diagnosed ADHD are in fact sleeping disorders in disguise. Vatsal Thakkar, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine, says he is treating an increasing number of people with ADHD symptoms but who actually have suffer with poor quality sleep. For some people - especially children - sleep deprivation does not necessarily cause lethargy; instead they become hyperactive, forgetful and unfocused, he said. ADHD is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is normally diagnosed between the ages of three to seven, and it is more common in boys. Although the cause of ADHD is not known, research shows that it tends to run in families.","German researchers measured noise pollution outside 900 children's homes and found loud noise affects their sleep and behaviour .

Warwickshire Police announced yesterday that it would not name suspects as it charged one of its own former officers with the theft of £113,000 from the force’s former headquarters. A short footnote at the bottom of the press release revealing the charging decision said: ‘Due to a change in policy we no longer release the name of an individual on charge.’ Warwickshire Police have refused to name an officer charged with a £113k theft from the force's former headquarters . It is a long-standing convention for police to name those they charge with an offence. Until recently, they would also routinely name anyone they had arrested if asked. But following the Leveson report into Press standards, forces have begun rolling back the public’s right to know who is being arrested. To the horror of free speech campaigners, senior officers have drawn up plans which would ban the Press and public being told the identity of anyone arrested. However, the refusal to name a suspect who has been charged and may already be in police custody goes a significant step further in wrapping the judicial system in a cloak of secrecy. The naming of suspects who have been charged with criminal offences – and who will stand trial in court –  is widely seen as an essential bulwark against arbitrary arrest and detention. Last night critics condemned  the Warwickshire force’s decision, branding it an extension of the ‘secret state’. Tory MP Philip Davies, an influential member of the Commons culture committee, said: ‘This is completely and utterly unacceptable. MP Philip Davies said the move by Warwickshire Police was an extension of the 'secret state' ‘This kind of secret state that they are trying to encourage goes against all our freedoms and traditions in this country.’ ‘The Government really needs to stop this in its tracks before it gets out of control.’ Freedom of speech campaigners said the decision not to name a former police officer charged with a crime was ‘extremely worrying’. Index on Censorship chief executive Kirsty Hughes said: ‘Keeping secret the names of people who have been charged with crimes goes against the principle of open justice that we have in this country. ‘Although there may be instances when it is appropriate not to release a name, this should not be a general policy. ‘That the police have decided not to name a former police officer is extremely worrying.’ Last night the Warwickshire force’s acting deputy chief constable Neil Brunton defended the policy. He denied the new secrecy had  anything to do with the fact that it was a former officer who had  been charged. He said: ‘The policy was recently changed to align with national policy post-Leveson and not because of today’s outcome.’ Lord Justice Leveson’s report called for a ban on the Press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested. The report said: ‘Save in exceptional and clearly identified circumstances (for example, where there may be an immediate risk to the public) the names or identifying details of those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the Press or public.’ Lord Justice Leveson¿s report called for a ban on the Press or public being told by the police if a crime suspect has been arrested . In the wake of the report, senior police officers have drawn up guidelines to apply to all forces which would ban them from confirming the names of suspects to journalists. In the coming weeks, the Association of Chief Police Officers will publish detailed policy designed to bring the draconian new rules into force. The plan is opposed by the Law Commission, the Government’s  own adviser on legal reform, which has said it is in the interests of  justice that the police name those arrested, except in very exceptional circumstances. Last month, two senior judges backed the ‘secret arrests’ policy. Lord Justice Treacy and Mr Justice Tugendhat said arrest could cause ‘irremediable damage to the person’s reputation’. Only in exceptional circumstances should details of those arrested or suspected of crime be made known to the public, they said. Even before the full rules are in use, some forces are already operating under the new practice.Critics of the ACPO plan say it undermines open justice. The step taken by Warwickshire to not name even those who are charged was unheard of until last night. In its press release, the force said the accused man is a 54-year-old from the Stratford area. It said it would give the individual’s surname to journalists the day before he appears before Leamington magistrates on May 22.

David Cameron is braced for heavy losses in today’s local elections as the Tories battle to prevent voters deserting them for the UK Independence Party. The Prime Minister said backing the Conservatives was a ‘vote to keep your Council Tax bill down’ as polling stations opened in 34 councils in England and Wales. But pollsters predict UKIP could win up to 100 seats, and cost the Tories hundreds more after a campaign dominated by the rise in Nigel Farage’s anti-EU party. The parties go into battle in 34 councils in tomorrow's elections, with the Tories braced for big losses in areas last contested in 2009 when Gordon Brown was leading Labour to a major defeat. But all eyes will be on what impact UKIP can make, and how many votes it can take from the bigger parties . More than 10,000 candidates are contesting 2,500 seats in today's elections. Poll Clerk Amelia Hetterley (left) and Presiding Officer Sue Bunney are pictured setting up their polling station at Dungeness Lifeboat Station in Dungeness, Kent . A woman arrives at a polling station in Toft, Cambridgeshire while a man turns out to vote at a temporary polling station in Durham Close, Fazeley, Tamworth . In a last ditch bid to woo voters, Mr . Cameron yesterday revealed he could rush forward legislation on staging a . referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. The Prime Minister suggested MPs could vote on Bill before the general election, despite opposition from the Lib Dems. ‘‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum,’ he told the BBC. The . surprise announcement, which even caught Conservative Cabinet ministers . off guard, was seen as an attempt to stop the Tories haemorrhaging . votes to UKIP today. But Mr Farage dismissed it as ‘another brittle pledge by Cameron which we won’t be falling for’. He . added on Twitter: ‘Cameron EU poll pledge just isn't believable: . clearly another desperate attempt to stop the rise of @UKIP.’ Mr Cameron also came under criticism from Tory MP Zac Goldsmith. He told the Evening Standard, Mr Goldsmith said: 'I don't think people on the streets are clear enough about what Cameron stands for - and that's a problem in politics. 'You need to have a clear sense of direction and that cannot involve a lot of U-turns or nudge-nudge, wink-wink, which is effectively what our airports policy is. Even critics respect leadership and decisiveness and I do think we are lacking in that up to a point.' Coalition woes: David Cameron's Tory party and Nick Clegg's Lib Dems are both braced for heavy losses in today's elections . UKIP leader Nigel Farage took time out from campaigning yesterday to enjoy a pint of ale at a pub in Ramsey, Cambridgeshire . However, UKIP has been battered by a string of embarrassing revelations about its record slate of 1,700 candidates. Mr Farage was forced to admit his party had not properly vetted everyone standing on a UKIP ticket after members were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'. He defended Somerset candidate Alex Wood over an image which apparently showed him giving a Nazi salute, insisting: ‘I believe him when he says that he was angrily trying to take a camera off his girlfriend who was annoyingly taking pictures of him in the pub imitating a pot plant,' he told Huffington Post. Hampshire candidate Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile to a Halloween party last year and Richard Delingpole, 46, a candidate in Somerset posted a photo mock-up on Facebook of himself stood next to Adolf Hitler. Today it emerged Christopher Thorpe, a UKIP candidate in Hertfordshire, was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform.

UKIP Candidate Bradley Monk was revealed to have worn a Jimmy Savile mask to a Halloween party while today it emerged that Hertfordshire candidate Christopher Thorpe (left) forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform . During the campaign Mr Farage was also forced to admit some of his policies need ‘more work’ amid claims it contains a £120billion blackhole in unfunded tax cuts and spending promises. However, the dire publicity has done little to dent UKIP’s standing in opinion polls. One ComRes survey poll in the 34 areas where council elections are being held suggested UKIP could secure 22 per cent of the vote, pushing the Lib Dems into a humiliating fourth place. Mr Farage insisted it was not his fault the UKIP campaign bus had parked in a disabled parking space during a visit to Ramsey in Cambridgeshire . Mr Farage pictured outside a pub in Ramsey has called for an end to the smoking ban in pubs . Rising popularity: UKIP leader Nigel Farage believes he is on the verge of a major breakthrough and has seen many Tory supporters switch in favour of his party . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg last night admitted his party faces a poor result. ‘You know, we have been beaten by UKIP before in the polls,’ the Deputy Prime Minister told Channel 4 News last night. ‘What I am saying is that these things come and go in politics and I've seen them in my time come and go. UKIP beat us in 2009; a year later we won 24 per cent of the vote in the general election and UKIP were nowhere.’ Pressure is also mounting on Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has seen his lead in opinion polls narrow in recent weeks. The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely. Boris Johnson warned that the Tories . could struggle in the local elections. The Mayor of London said: 'It's . going to be a tough fight for my party in mid-term, that is inevitable. 'Obviously, for hard working . Conservative councillors who do lose their seats, I'm sure they will be . back. Mid-term blues are inevitable.' The Tory leader focused on council tax bills in his polling day message on Twitter . Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg hopes to make gains in the party's traditional West Country stronghold . Mr Miliband must prove that his One Nation slogan can win votes outside Labour's northern base . Mr Farage used Twitter to dismiss Mr Cameron's suggestion that he could bring forward legislation on an EU referendum . London Mayor Boris Johnson, who today tried his hand at making a Gu chocolate souffle in London, warned the Tories face a 'tough fight' in today's elections . Mr Miliband launched a back to basics campaign, touring the country and addressing crowds from a wooden pallet 'soap box' in high streets and town centres. But he suffered a major setback when he repeatedly refused to admit during a BBC radio interview that his plan to cut VAT would increase borrowing. He was asked 10 times on Monday about the impact of his policies on the nation's finances, but refused to answer. Confronted on Tuesday by claims his economic policies had descended into a 'Milishambles', he caved in and said: 'I am clear about this, a temporary cut in VAT, as we are proposing, would lead to a temporary rise in borrowing.' On the campaign trail yesterday Mr Miliband said he was 'certain we can overcome our country's problems'. He added: 'The choice is between a One Nation Labour party that knows we rebuild Britain by standing up for the many and a Conservative-led government that only stands up for the few.' Labour Leader Ed Miliband launched a back to basics campaign, holding hustings in town centres including in Long Eaton's High Street, Nottinghamshire . The Labour leader is under pressure to prove his One Nation slogan can win votes outside Labour's northern heartlands . Lord Tebbit courted controversy when he urged tactical voters to back the UK Independence Party in tomorrow’s local elections. In an extraordinary intervention, the Tory grandee said UKIP’s policies were now those ‘closest to a traditional Conservative agenda’. And he urged Right-leaning voters in Labour areas to vote tactically for whichever candidate had the best chance of causing an upset – even if they are not Conservative. ‘If you have a Labour councillor then I suggest that the best vote is the one most likely to replace him or her with either a Conservative, UKIP or sound independent one,' he said. UKIP has been under sustained assault from the Tories, with Kenneth Clarke branding the party a ‘collection of clowns’ supported by 'racists'. And Tory sources believe the anti-EU party could do serious damage today with Conservatives potentially forced to go into coalition with UKIP councillors in once-safe Tory areas. But Lord Tebbit said his party’s tactics were counterproductive and accused senior Tories, including Mr Clarke, of waging a ‘smear campaign’ against UKIP which could drive disaffected voters into the arms of the smaller party. Mr Cameron refused to be drawn into the row over UKIP being branded 'clowns' and 'racists'. 'I’m not calling anybody anything, what I’m doing is talking about what the Conservatives offer at the local elections and in the end it’s people who will go and vote and people who will choose,' he said yesterday. He said he would not make predictions about the scale of Tory losses in tomorrow's elections. 'The Conservatives are defending more seats than anyone else, we control more councils than anyone else, so everyone’s having a shot at us.'","More than 2,400 seats up for grabs in 34 county and unitary councils in England and Wales .

Police have released a second video . they hope will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother . who went missing while working the register of a western Michigan gas . station April 26. Jessica . Heeringa, 25, who has a three-year-old son, vanished 15 minutes from . the end of her shift at an Exxon gas station in North Shores. Her car . and purse were found left behind at the scene. The new video, police say, more . clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that . police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel . this mystery. New footage: Police say this latest video evidence released in the disappearnce case of Jessica Heeringa shows a suspect silver minivan . A $15,000 reward was pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared. The new . footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had . no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm. Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night. Clue: Christian Van Antwerpen, pictured, says he heard the van's driver flirting with Heeringa 'suspiciously' hours before she vanished April 26 . Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen on Friday night . Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice. The . tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since . Heeringa vanished and will be added to what small bits of evidence . investigators have thus far been able to gather. The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30, . based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from . the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate . their investigation. 'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton . Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some . of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the . sketch. Workplace: The Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan - from where Heeringa was snatched. the parent company has pledged a $15,000 reward . Mystery: Heeringa has a three-year-old son, who family members said she would never leave behind . 'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.' Authorities . have also released previous video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead . Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area . around the same time that Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, . but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the . mystery. Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV: . 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it . up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He . told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & . Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's . disappearance. Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor. 'There . is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who . the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores . That . customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he . normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher: . 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just . walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car . out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing woman's family made a . heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her . disappearance as an abduction. Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch . In . a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were . treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.' With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The . anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved . by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing . his mom and wants her back.' Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident. 'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said.

Perched upright on a rock, this grizzly bear looks like any mother putting her feet up after a long day. The four-year-old had spent the morning fishing for salmon in the river before giving herself a well-deserved break. The bear spent a few minutes finding a comfortable place on the rock before enjoying some quiet time. Taking the load off: After tiring herself out catching salmon, this grizzly bear enjoys a well-earned rest . I'm just resting my eyes: The four-year-old is so exhausted that she rests her head on a rock in the river . She was caught on camera by Russian photographer Sergey Gorshkov, who watched as the bear tired herself out looking for food. The bear was pictured resting her head on a rock while she waded through the water. The grizzly then climbed on a boulder and fidgeted as she tried to get her whole body out of the water. After settling down, she closed her eyes and relaxed. Mr Gorshkov said she was so calm he was able to get closer to her than he normally can with the wild animals at the Kronotskiy Reserve, Kamchatka, in Russia. That's better: The grizzly gets herself comfortable on the boulder during a break from fishing . Sleepy eyed: She squints into the sun as she clambers on the rock in the Kronotskiy Reserve . He said: 'I loved being out in the forest on my own, watching the bear catch salmon to eat. 'I was standing very near the bear but she was calm, because she had acclimatised to my presence and was not afraid of me. 'She was a very good and active model - I wish they were all like that.

A classic Jaguar which has been left to rot in a garage for more than 40 years is expected to fetch between £15,000 and £25,000 at auction. The Jaguar XK120 Competition Roadster was one of the world's top sports cars when it left the factory in 1953. But over the past 43 years the car has been left abandoned in a Surrey garage, where it transformed from a stunning racing car into a heap of rust. Rusty: The 60-year-old Jaguar was discovered in a disheveled state in a garage in Surrey, but is still worth at least £15,000 . Heyday: Mechanic Douglas Potter (pictured) bought the Jaguar from an Army Lieutenant in the 1950s . Discovered by auction house Coys, the find will come onto the open market for the first time when it goes under the hammer at the auctioneer's Ascot sale on Saturday. Although the guide price is a reasonable £15,000 to £25,000, experts believe whoever buys the Jaguar will have to spend between £50,000 and £100,000 to return the car to its former glory. The XK120 Competition Roadster was supplied new in 1953 to a Lieutenant in the army, who sold it to mechanic Douglas Potter in 1961. Mr Potter worked for a number of racing teams and competed in various cars before getting his hands on the XK120. The engineer then used his knowhow to turn the Jaguar into a competition car, racing it around the UK at circuits including Silverstone and Brands Hatch. Under the bonnet of the Sir William Lyons-styled roadster was a 3.4-litre engine which developed 160bhp - giving the car a 0-60mph time of 10 seconds and top speed of 126mph. Abandoned: Mr Potter had not used the Jaguar in 43 years . Restoration project: Experts estimate it will cost the buyer £100,000 to have the car restored professionally, or around £50,000 to do it themselves . Both the car and its driver became well known in Jaguar and racing circles, but Mr Potter stopped his competition career in the 1970s to focus on aeronautical engineering. Remarkably, the Jaguar then remained undisturbed at storage at his home in Surrey for the next four decades. Graham Searle, from the Jaguar Enthusiasts' Club, expects there to be a lot of interest when it goes under the hammer. He said: 'It has got a good recorded history which helps prices and when it has been restored it could easily be worth £150,000. 'The key thing is the history and this car will help the owner get into all the events like Goodwood and that is important. 'The . XK120 was a very important car in the history of Jaguar, it was their . first ever genuine sports car and helped put them on the map. 'There . will be a lot of excitement about this. It will probably cost around . £100,000 to restore professionally or at least £50,000 if the buyer does . it themselves.' Racing: Mr Potter used the Jaguar as a competition car at circuits including Silverstone and Brands Hatch . Speedy: The Roadster, built in 1953, can reach 126mph and go from 0-60 in 10 seconds . Sale: The Jaguar will be auctioned alongside other classic cars at Coys in Ascot on Saturday . The Jaguar will be sold alongside a number of other classic cars including a Ferrari 512BB and Aston Martin DB2. A spokesperson for Coys said: 'We are proud to offer this unique piece of Jaguar's competition history to the open market for the very first time. 'Complete with its original Buff Log book, and with a variety of period racing shots, bills and receipts this must be the most exciting XK discovery this decade. 'Here was a car with incredible style and looks, a powerful six cylinder engine installed in an outstanding chassis and a remarkably low price - a quarter that of a V12 Ferrari, of similar performance. 'The combination was unbeatable and the XK120 represented without doubt a significant milestone for both Jaguar and the motor industry as a whole. 'Highly original and unmolested, there will not be a more significant XK120 available anywhere in this condition.'","Jaguar XK120 Competition Roadster left in a Surrey garage for 43 years .

The last survivor of Bangladesh's devastating Primark factory collapse burned to death after rescuers sparked a fire with the very power tools they were using to free her, it has emerged. The unnamed woman, who had survived for five days since the garment factory caved in last Wednesday in the country's capital Dhaka, had captured the hearts of the millions of Bangladeshis watching the drama unfold on television. When most had given up hope of finding anyone alive in the rubble, a faint voice was heard echoing from the darkness, triggering a massive rescue effort to free her from the twisted mass of metal and concrete. But the 11-hour battle to bring her . to safety ended in tragedy when sparks from firefighters' cutting . machines set light to surrounding debris, pumping acrid smoke into the . cavity. Smell of death: A body is carried out from the garment factory building that collapsed Wednesday . Hunt over: Rescue team digging inside of the building and searching for survivors. So far, 380 have been confirmed dead . As the flames and smoke grew, firefighters were forced to abandon the dig until the fire had been doused. Many were seen weeping among the rubble on television as news of her death filtered throughout the rescue operation. Scroll down for video. No hope: Emergency crews have now given up hope of finding any more survivors in the rubble as they began using heavy machinery to remove the rubble and look for bodies . Fading hope: Relatives show pictures of loved ones still not accounted for at the garment factory in the desperate hope some may still be found alive . 'The fire broke out as we were cutting a beam to bring out what we believe was the last remaining survivor from the collapsed building. We managed to douse it, but as we came back we saw her dead,' the country’s fire chief Ahmed Ali said. At least 380 people were killed when . the illegally constructed, eight-storey Rana Plaza collapsed in a heap . on Wednesday morning along with thousands of workers in the five garment . factories in the building. About 2,500 survivors have been accounted . for. Emergency crews have now given up hope of finding any more survivors in the rubble as they began using heavy machinery to remove the rubble and look for bodies, an official said. The building owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested on Sunday in the western border town of Benapole while he was trying to flee to India. But despite the spectre of death looming over the site, there was one glimmer of hope as a woman miraculously gave birth while trapped beneath the mound of broken concrete and metal. Police say as many as 900 people are still missing in the aftermath of the collapse. This woman is one of nine survivors who were pulled from the rubble today . Hope: A survivor is carried into an ambulance while surrounded by onlookers, after being rescued from the garment factory building that collapsed Wednesday in Savar, near Dhaka, Bangladesh . The collapse was the deadliest . disaster to hit the garment industry in Bangladesh that is worth 20 . billion dollars (£12.8 billion) annually, supplies global retailers and . is a mainstay of the economy. Volunteers, army personnel and firemen . have worked around the clock since Wednesday, mostly using hands and . light equipment to pull out survivors. At around midnight on Sunday, . authorities deployed hydraulic cranes and heavy cutting machines to . break up the massive slabs of concrete into manageable segments that . could be lifted away. 'We are proceeding cautiously. If . there is still a soul alive, we will try to rescue that person,' said . army spokesman Shahinul Islam. Property tycoon Sohel Rana was arrested by Bangladesh police today over the collapse of the Primark garment factory . 40 survivors were yesterday found trapped in a room that had only partly-collapsed under the weight of crumbled concrete . Blaze: A soldier is evacuated from the fire which broke out this evening at the collapsed garment factory . 'There is little hope of finding . anyone alive. Our men went inside and saw some dead bodies in the ground . floor. But no one was seen alive,' said Brig Gen Ali Ahmed Khan, the . chief of the fire brigade at the scene. Prime minister Sheikh Hasina visited . the site and a nearby hospital to meet with survivors on Monday, the . first time since the disaster. Hasina had ordered the arrest of . building owner Rana, who is a small-time political operative from her . Awami League party's youth wing. He was brought back by helicopter from . the border town to the capital, Dhaka, where he is expected to be . charged with negligence on Monday. He had permission to build a . five-storey building but added three more illegally. He last appeared in . public on Tuesday in front of the Rana Plaza after huge cracks appeared . in the building. Witnesses said Rana assured tenants . that the building was safe. Police, however, ordered an evacuation. A . bank and some first-floor shops closed, but managers of the garment . factories on the upper floors told workers to continue their shifts. Hampered: Rescue workers react to the fire among the rubble, where the search for survivors was disrupted . Partial halt: A rescue worker is given oxygen as he is evacuated from the fire at the collapsed building . Survivor: A man was pulled from the building earlier today - the fifth day since the devastating collapse . People gather on the site of the ruined factory as rescuers try to bring survivors out of the rubble. The death count is growing . Hours later, the Rana Plaza was reduced to rubble, crushing most victims under massive blocks of concrete. Police have also arrested four owners . of three factories. Also in detention for questioning are two municipal . engineers who were involved in approving the building's design. Local TV . stations reported that the Bangladesh High Court has frozen the bank . accounts of the owners of all five garment factories. Also . under detention are the wife of the building owner who is on the run . and two government engineers who were involved in giving approval for . the building design. Grim task: Bangladeshi rescue workers carry the body of a dead garment worker retrieved in the rubble . The search for life is becoming more pressured as resuce workers enter their fifth day of picking through crumbled steel and concrete . Tragedy: Rescuers carrying out a dead body from the rubble this evening, almost 92 hours after the collapse . The owner had the approval to construct five floors but he added three more illegally. A . huge crack appeared in the building, Rana Plaza, on Tuesday, but the . owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana, assured tenants it was safe to go inside. A . bank and some shops on the first floor shut their premises on Wednesday . after police ordered an evacuation, but managers of the garment . factories on the upper floor told workers to continue their shifts. Hours later the Rana Plaza was . reduced to rubble, and most victims were crushed by massive blocks of . concrete and mortar falling on them. Working round-the-clock, rescuers . have used bare hands and shovels, passing chunks of brick and concrete . down a human chain away from the collapsed structure. On . the ground, mixed in the debris were several pairs of pink cotton . pants, a mud-covered navy blue sock and a pile of green uncut fabric. Owners of the collapsed Rana Plaza garment factory are led away by police. Police have made a total of six arrests including engineers who designed the building . Two arrested owners of the garment factory that collapsed outside the capital, are today escorted to an appearance at the court in Dhaka . Some people have survived five days in the wreckage with no food or water but 900 are counted as missing . Soldiers clear away the crumbled concrete of the Rana Plaza building. Fears are mounting that the death toll could rise far beyond the latest figure of 363 . The . badly decomposed bodies pulled out of the rubble were kept at a . makeshift morgue at the nearby Adharchandra High School before being . handed over to families. A garment manufacturers' group said . the factories in the building employed 3,122 workers, but it was not . clear how many were inside when it fell. About 2,500 survivors have been . accounted for. The death toll surpassed a fire five . months ago that killed 112 people and brought widespread pledges to . improve worker-safety standards. But since then, very little has changed . in Bangladesh. The collapse and previous disasters in . garment factories have focused attention on the poor working conditions . of workers who toil for as little as 38 dollars (£24) a month to . produce clothing for top international brands. Its garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy, having grown rapidly in the past decade. People gather to watch the rescue operation, hoping their loved ones will be discovered alive five days after Bangladesh's worst ever industrial accident . Protestors light fires in the streets as rescue workers continue to search the rubble for survivors and bodies . Among the garment makers in the . building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style . and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, . trousers and other garments a year. The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain's Primark acknowledged it was . using a factory in Rana Plaza, but many other retailers distanced . themselves from the disaster, saying they were not involved with the . factories at the time of the collapse or had not recently ordered . garments from them. Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had . been authorised to be made in the facility, but it is investigating . whether there was any unauthorised production.","At least 380 people killed when illegally constructed Rana Plaza collapsed .

Bags packed: PCSO Oguz Batmaz, pictured at Southwark Crown Court today, passed on information from searching the police database to a criminal gang . A cocaine-dealing PCSO tipped off a criminal gang where cannabis factories were so they could steal the crop, a court heard today. Oguz Batmaz, 27, known as 'Oz', passed on information he got from searching the Scotland Yard database so his crew had an ample supply of drugs. He also told them what the police knew about them so they could avoid getting caught - and even helped an escaped convict. Batmaz, who had worked for the Met since 2007, was earning up to £1,000 a week drug dealing on the side. He is now facing life behind bars after pleading guilty to dealing drugs, conspiracy to steal and abusing his position. He will be sentenced at Southwark Crown Court tomorrow, along with eight others linked with the scam. Prosecutor David Durose told Southwark Crown Court today that Batmaz abused his position for ‘his own selfish profit’. ‘This case arises out of an investigation into the extensive criminal activities of a serving PCSO called Oguz Batmaz,’ he said. ‘Batmaz's primary criminality was that he serially abused his position of trust as a PCSO. ‘He used his access to police databases . for his own selfish profit, selling sensitive information and sharing . data with criminal associates, thereby assisting the criminals to the . detriment of the public.' The prosecutor added: ‘His . misconduct involved him carrying out unlawful checks on police computer . systems on behalf of his associates and supplying those associates with . information so obtained. ‘He . was also involved in the identification of cannabis factories from . police intelligence databases and the subsequent relaying of the details . of such addresses in order that they might be the target of theft . In court: Batmaz conducted searches on names and addresses linked to the boyfriend of Emma Tooke (left), who was a crack cocaine dealer. His friend Kadir Ozresberoglu (right), a drug dealer, was caught on tape with the PCSO . Part of the gang: Lee Hession (left) and Anthony Noble (right) will be sentenced alongside Batmaz at Southwark Crown Court . ‘As the investigation progressed it became apparent that not only was Batmaz exploiting his position as a PCSO, he was also a cocaine dealer and a regular user of both cocaine and cannabis.’ The court heard that Batmaz, who was based at the Mottingham and Chislehurst Safer Neighbourhood Office, began carrying out unlawful checks on associates, including his cousin, just months after he started. The police launched an anti-corruption investigation in 2010 and bugged his home and his place of work. He . was heard talking about meeting ‘geezers’ for drug deals and being paid . a 'bag of sand' - Cockney rhyming slang for 'grand', or £1,000 - a . week. Waiting their fate: Filipe De Frietas (left) and Aaron Eastwood (right) will also be sentenced alongside Batmaz for their part in the crime . In one recording, before his associates raided a cannabis factory, Batmaz even boasted he was doing other dealers a favour by moving the drugs before police had a chance to seize them. ‘See the way I look at it, I'm doing these boys a favour,' he said. ‘Coming up on the system they're obviously gonna (sic) get raided at one point, so I am just raiding them before they get raided.' Referred to as their 'copper friend', the PCSO even helped convict Wayne Farrell, who was serving a six-year stretch for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine, stay on the run after he escaped from prison. The court heard that Batmaz conducted a number of searches on names and addresses linked to Farrell while he stayed with girlfriend, Emma Tooke, who is also in the dock, to avoid the pair getting caught. Crew: Batmaz and his gang must wait until tomorrow to hear their fate at Southwark Crown Court . By April 2010 the police were aware of the PCSO's activities and placed an entry about Farrell on the database to see how Batmaz reacted. Three minutes later records show he phoned Farrell to pass on the information. And two months before the gang were arrested, Batmaz was heard joking that his flat might be bugged. He said: ‘If there's recorders in here we'd be f***** a long time ago.’ His drug dealer friend, Kadir Ozresberoglu, 26, continued the joke by saying: ‘Yeah, they're building one up on us, building big one up on us.’ The pair were arrested at Batmaz's flat in New Eltham, south east London, in June 2010. As they were raided Ozresberoglu, of Sidcup, Kent, tried to throw the cocaine out of the bedroom window, while Batmaz appeared to be in distress and was asking for water. The prosecutor added: ‘The crown suggests that he had swallowed the packets of drugs that were already made up.’ Drugs paraphernalia including scales, cannabis grinders and mixing agents were also found in the property. Batmaz will be sentenced along with drug dealing friends Ozresberoglu, Filipe De Frietas, 26, Lee Hession,30, Anthony Noble, 30, Aaron Eastwood, 32, and his cousin Ayhan Mustafa, 30. Escaped convict Wayne Farrell, 35, and his girlfriend Emma Tooke, 33, will also be sentenced. The court heard Batmaz worked for Bexley Council in south east London, helping elderly people with IT skills before joining the Met in 2003. His barrister, James Hines said: 'This was his misguided attempt to impress others and make him seem more important and interesting than perhaps he was.'

Changes: A young boy enjoys a carton of Ribena, which is one of several drinks to have sugar reduced to protect teeth and curb obesity . Soft drinks like Lucozade, Ribena and Irn-Bru are to have their sugar content slashed by up ten per cent in an admission they should not have been so sweet in the first place. The reduction has been agreed by makers to protect the teeth of children and quell the 'rising tide of obesity' in Britain, the Government has said. At the moment a 500ml bottle of Ribena contains as much as 13 teaspoons of sugar while a can of Irn-Bru has more than half a dozen. But Coca Coca Cola told MailOnline today they will not . reduce the seven teaspoons in a 330ml can of their signature drink. They say they have lots of low calorie alternatives and have cut levels in its . Fanta, Lilt and Oasis brands. Campaigners are still unimpressed, as despite sugar levels being reduced, most of these soft drinks drinks will still get a Foot Standards Agency red light, because they contain more than 6.3g of sugar per 100ml of liquid. Charlie Powell of the Children's Food Campaign pressure group said: 'So they are swapping one red light for another: not exactly impressive.' It came as the public health minister Anna Soubry said that you can spot poor Britons because they are usually overweight. A culture of unhealthy TV dinners and junk food has eroded family life and that many homes no longer even have a dining table, the Tory MP added. Today GlaxoSmithKilne says the sugar in the Ribena ready-to-drink line and Lucozade Energy will be cut by 'up to 10 per cent', while AG Barr will reduce the calorie content across its drinks range, which includes Irn-Bru, by five per cent. The J20 brand has also announced it is to launch two flavours in a new . slimline can which will represent a 10 per cent calorie reduction compared with . its standard 275ml bottle, while Co-operative Food will look at . controlling calories in popular product lines and Burton's Biscuits will . offer more portion control packs and review its recipes. Anna Soubry welcomed the pledges as England has some of the highest obesity rates in the developed world, with 60 per cent of adults and one third of 10 and 11-year-olds being overweight or obese. The Government has launched its Responsibility Deal calorie reduction pledge to encourage businesses and other organisations to help consumers consume less sugar. 'Being overweight and not eating well is bad for our health. To reverse the rising tide of obesity we have challenged the nation to reduce our calorie intake by five billion calories a day. On average that's just 100 calories less a day per person,' Ms Soubry said. Reduction: Lucozade energy will have sugar cut by 10% and Irn-Bru by 5% in changes that raise serious questions about why they were so sweet in the first place . No change: But Coca Cola's signature drink will not have its sugar levels reduced, as thegiant says it has cut it in others and has many low-calorie alternatives . 'Today's announcement will cut the calories and sugar by up to 10% in leading brands like Lucozade and Ribena. Through the Responsibility Deal we are already achieving real progress in helping people reduce the calories and salt in their diet. Overall, more than 480 companies including many leading high street brands have signed up to the Responsibility Deal. Pleased: Public health minister Anna Soubry says that the decision to slash sugar will benefit Britain . 'All of the major supermarkets have now committed to removing artificial trans fats, and over 70% of fast food and takeaway meals sold on the high street have calories clearly labelled, but more needs to be done. 'We are encouraged by the extra businesses which have signed up today but I want to see even more progress. All in the food industry have a part to play and I now expect companies which are not yet taking action to come forward and make pledges.' Last year Coca Cola signed up to the Government’s calorie reduction pledge to cut calories from sparkling soft drinks. 'We recognise obesity is a serious public health issue, which is why we help people make informed choices about our products and encourage them to lead active lifestyles. We will continue to work in in partnership with others to help address the challenge of obesity,' a Coca Cola spokesman said. Responsibility Deal Food Network chairwoman Dr Susan Jebb said: ""I'm pleased to see the soft drinks manufacturers like GSK, AG Barr and Britvic join Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to make some very real commitments to help consumers cut down on their calories as they take control of their weight. 'I hope we will now see others, including the out of home sector, taking a careful look at how they can build on this and come to the table with new commitments to encourage their customers choose smaller portions and swap to lower calorie options.' Food and Drink Federation director general Melanie Leech said: ""We commend these businesses for joining existing pledge signatories in a shared commitment to support the calorie reduction challenge issued to the nation by ministers last year. Of the 31 pledge signatories, 15 are manufacturers, demonstrating our sector's willingness to engage and deliver improved public health outcomes under the deal. 'On calorie reduction, and the other pledges already issued by the Food Network, we urge the Department of Health to continue its efforts to broaden engagement and bring in new companies to work with those of our members, and others, who have already made substantial commitments through the Responsibility Deal.' British Soft Drinks Association director general Gavin Partington said: ""We welcome the commitments made by leading soft drinks producers. Our industry has been taking steps to reduce the calorie content of our drinks for many years now, and currently more than 60% of all soft drinks contain no added sugar.'

European human rights judges are poised to order that millions of pounds be paid to Serbian conscript troops who fought in a war of ethnic cleansing. The soldiers’ claims for pay for their part in the four-month war against Nato and British forces some 14 years ago will be heard by the appeal chamber of the European Court of Human Rights later this month. The decision of the Strasbourg judges to hear pay claims from troops involved in the Kosovo war - described by a UN war crimes court as a ‘criminal enterprise’ - was condemned by Tory MPs as ‘bizarre’ and ‘lunacy’. European human rights judges are poised to order that millions of pounds be paid to Serbian conscript troops who fought in the Kosovo war of ethnic cleansing. Above, withdrawing Serb soldiers on the main Kosovo-Serbia road near Pristina in June 1999 . Serb soldiers, at rear, escort a group of ethnic Albanians out of Kosovo in April 1999. The soldiers' claims for pay for their part in the four-month war against Nato and British forces some 14 years ago will be heard by the appeal chamber of the European Court of Human Rights later this month . It comes at a time when David Cameron has threatened to suspend Britain’s membership of the European court over the continued blocking of attempts to deport terror suspect Abu Qatada to his native Jordan. British judges stalling the Abu Qatada deportation have been following human rights ground rules laid down in Strasbourg. The Serb conscripts’ case will go to a hearing at the Strasbourg court’s Grand Chamber later this month. A lower tier of the court has already ordered the Serbian government to pay thousands of reservists and conscripts who were called up to fight in the war, but were never paid the daily allowances they were promised. The conscripts were drafted in February and March 1999 to fight in Kosovo at a time when strongman leader Slobodan Milosevic was trying to enforce ethnic Serb domination of his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Smoke rises from burning houses in the village of Glavotina, 15km north of Pristina during the Kosovo war . They fought against an ethnically Albanian resistance army in the one-time province of Yugoslavia while British and Nato warplanes bombed the Serb capital Belgrade and Nato land forces, including the British army, assembled to help the Kosovans. The war ended with Milosevic ordered his troops to withdraw in June 1999. The UN International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has ordered jail sentences for a number of Serb generals and leaders who headed the conscript army. It ruled in 2009 that the war involved ‘a campaign of terror and violence directed against the ethnic Albanian population’. The conscripts were drafted in early 1999 to fight in Kosovo at a time when leader Slobodan Milosevic (above at a war crimes tribunal in the Hague) was trying to enforce ethnic Serb domination of his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . It said the attempt at ethnic cleansing ‘was to be executed by criminal means, including deportations, murders, forcible transfers and persecutions of Kosovo Albanians.’ The UN tribunal added that the army into which the reservists were called was responsible for ‘mass expulsions of Kosovo Albanians from their homes, as well as incidents of killing, sexual assault, and the intentional destruction of mosques.’ It said that between March and June 1999 at least 700,000 ethnic Albanians were forced out of their homes. However the European Court of Human Rights held in its initial hearing that Serb conscript troops were the victims of human rights abuses. Strasbourg judges have not considered the actions of the soldiers during the war. They said that the conscripts have suffered discrimination because the modern Serb government has paid the allowances to some troops drafted from the country’s poorest towns, but not others. The European judges ‘concluded that there had been no objective and reasonable justification for the applicants being treated differently merely on the basis of their place of residence.’ The Grand Chamber hearing later this month will consider ‘the payment of allowances to all reservists who served in the Yugoslav Army during the Nato intervention in Serbia between March and June 1999'. Failure to pay the reservists caused discontent and rioting in Serbia even before the end of the 1999 war and was a key factor in the uprising that deposed Milosevic from power in 2000.

Roland Peter Wright denies 15 charges relating to when he was a master then a headmaster at Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire, in the 1960s and 1970s. Wright - who requires regular court breaks because of his age - abused boys in his study bedroom at night time among other places, John Price QC told Aylesbury Crown Court, sitting at Amersham. Trial: Roland Peter Wright denies 15 charges relating to when he was a master then a headmaster at a school . Mr Price said of one boy at the exclusive school who was 12 or 13 at the time: ‘Late one night he had been asleep in his bed in the dormitory. ‘The master came in, sat on his bed, woke him up and quietly told him to go the master's study bedroom which was nearby. The boy did as he was told.’ Once there the teacher got the boy in bed, the court heard. The boy then allegedly took part in a series of intimate acts with the teacher. ‘This was to happen on several further occasions,’ Mr Price said. ‘The boy recalls that the master was never violent, never threatening. ‘Indeed he recalls that he was “quite . gentle and loving...very softly spoken”. At the time of these events . the man was a French and sports teacher at the school. He coached the . first rugby 15.' One pupil, who is the subject of two current charges, described . him as ‘inspirational’, and told police that he had found Caldicott an ‘extremely . enjoyable, pleasant place to have been, in the main.’ Allegations: Wright abused boys in his study bedroom at night time among other places, John Price QC said . The court heard more than a dozen . complainants came forward to make historic allegations about Wright. The . indictment refers to seven alleged victims. Wright, . of Farnham Royal, listens to proceedings with a hearing loop. He denies . 13 charges of indecent assault and two counts of inciting youngsters to . commit gross indecency with him. Witnesses told investigating detectives that the school had ‘an . atmosphere of sexual disinhibition,’ with some children having sexual contact . among themselves, said Mr Price. 'It was in fact not discouraged, but rather was exploited by . this defendant,’ said the barrister. ‘This was a school which catered for boys aged seven to 13 . years. If such an atmosphere did establish itself among boys of . that age one is allowed to ask how that should be allowed to happen.’ 'The master came in, sat on his bed, woke him up and quietly told him to go the master's study bedroom' John Price QC . Many of the complainants were only able to report what . happened to them decades later, the court heard, with some telling their wives . and one man going to his doctor. The jury heard Wright had . committed a range of offences against the boys. As well as at the school, the abuse was said to have been . carried out on trips to Scotland and in Wright's cottage, where he still lives. The £20,000-a-year school - which was first based in . Hitchin, Hertfordshire, from 1904 to 1938 - counts Deputy Prime Minister Nick . Clegg among its alumni and has 240 boys aged seven to 13. Mr Clegg did not . attend the school when the alleged crimes were committed. Wright, known . as Peter, is accused of carrying out the offences between September 1959 . and August 1970. Former school: Wright was a master then a headmaster in the 1960s and 1970s at Caldicott Preparatory School in Farnham Common, Buckinghamshire . Wright was also . said to have given one boy whisky in his room. ‘He was made to feel . special,’ Mr Price said. Some of the boys also said another teacher at . the school, Hugh Henry, abused them. The court heard that Wright and Henry were friends who used to visit the boys' dormitory together to abuse them. Two of the alleged . victims told police that Henry was abusing them on the school grounds . before he had even been appointed a teacher and was taken to the school . as Wright's guest. At 2.30am on June 7 1963, when he was . part of the staff, Henry was taken from the school by ambulance having . taken an overdose. Before that he had been found on a boy's bed, the . court heard. 'An atmosphere of sexual disinhibition (was) exploited by this defendant' John Price QC . Inquiry documents held by the Department for Education and Skills show he took the overdose for ‘the complete mess he had made of everything at the school’. One witness told investigators that Henry frequently abused him in the defendant's bedroom during the day. ‘Why did Hugh Henry feel able to make use of that room with such impunity?’ asked the QC. One man, who was a pupil at the time, told investigators that Wright and Henry were almost caught by their headmaster in their dormitory one night, and had to hide under a bed. Five complainants came forward against Wright in the early 2000s but criminal proceedings did not result in a trial because of legal reasons, Mr Price said. But more complaints were made after 2003, when the first investigation fell down, resulting in today's indictment involving seven alleged victims. However, the jury were told they could hear evidence from the first investigation in support of this prosecution. ‘Twelve men or more do not independently and falsely accuse the same man of doing the same thing,’ said the prosecutor. ‘Such co-incidences do not happen in real life.’ The trial continues tomorrow.

Victim: Catherine Wells-Burr, pictured, was 'almost certainly' dead when her Ford Focus was set on fire at a Somerset beauty spot . A graduate who was allegedly murdered by her boyfriend, his jealous former partner and her uncle was already dead when her car was set alight, a court heard today. Catherine Wells-Burr's body was found in her burnt out Ford Focus by firefighters at a Somerset beauty spot. But pathology tests carried out on the 23-year-old, who was so badly burned that she had to be identified using dental records, determined that she was 'almost certainly' dead before the fire. Prosecutors allege that her boyfriend Rafal Nowak, 31, hatched a plot with his jealous former partner Anna Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, to kill her for her six figure life insurance policy. Nowak, a factory worker, is accused of smothering the business analyst as she slept at the couple's new home in Chard, Somerset, on September 12 last year - leaving him able to access a six figure life insurance payout and the property. His former partner, Lagwinowicz - with whom Nowak is said to have rekindled a romance - allegedly joined her uncle in dumping Miss Wells-Burr's body in her car at a nearby roadside and setting fire to it. Home Office pathologist Dr Hugh White told the jury at Bristol Crown Court that he carried out several different tests on Miss Wells-Burr's body, including examining the airway and taking blood samples, and concluded she was dead when the fire was started. He said: 'Putting all these factors together, it is my opinion that she was almost certainly dead when the fire started.' He told the jury that Miss Wells-Burr had sustained a fracture to the back of her head, close to her right ear.' There had been some sort of blunt force trauma to the back of the head but I cannot be more specific than that,' he said. 'This particular fracture had been exposed to the heat suggesting it had occurred before the fire started.' Case: Rafal Nowak is accused of murdering 23-year-old business analyst Catherine Wells-Burr for her six-figure life insurance policy . Dr White said he was not able to say whether the head injury had been inflicted on Miss Wells-Burr before or after she died. The pathologist said that because of the blaze it was not possible to give a precise cause of the Bath Spa University graduate's death. Prosecutor Richard Smith QC asked Dr White whether it was possible that Miss Wells-Burr had died as a result of asphyxiation or strangulation. 'There is nothing to indicate that this could not have occurred,' he replied. Forensic anthropologist Dr Nicholas Marquez-Grant told the court he had been asked to examine Miss Wells-Burr's skull and said that he agreed with Dr  that it was impossible to tell whether the head injury had been sustained before or after death. But he added: 'I am confident that the injury or damage to the back of the skull was caused prior to the fire.' Dr Marquez-Grant said that he was unable to say what had caused the head injury or the force used to inflict it. The court also heard details of written evidence from forensic scientist Melanie Banks, who examined fragments of clothing found upon Miss Wells-Burr's body. Miss Banks concluded that Miss Wells-Burr might have been wearing a pair of fabric shorts when her car was set alight. She added that due to the extent of the fire she was unable to say what other clothes Miss Wells-Burr could have had on. Polish nationals Nowak, Lagwinowicz, and Dmytryszyn all deny murder. Lagwinowicz was not present in court today having been excused attendance by trial judge Mrs Justice Sharp. The trial continues.

Jailed: Benefits clerk Vajid Ashraf masterminded a £91,000 welfare fraud in which winter fuel payments were deliberately diverted away from hard up OAPS . A corrupt benefits clerk who masterminded a £91,000 welfare fraud in which vital winter fuel payments were deliberately diverted away from hard up pensioners has been jailed. Vajid Ashraf, 34, was the 'lynchpin' behind a scam in which money needed to keep pensioners warm was siphoned off and instead sent to the bank accounts of his relatives and friends. Under the noses of colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) office in Simonstone, Lancashire, Ashraf targeted accounts where he knew he could get the most money. He also rigged the computer to ensure electronically generated letters were not sent to those who should have received the handouts. Twenty four struggling pensioners across Britain were denied Pension Credit, Winter Fuel Payment and Cold Weather Payments during the nine-month fraud. The money was instead withdrawn by Ashraf's team of nine accomplices and shared out - with half going back to him. The scam was uncovered after concerns about the bank account of an 80-year old woman who lived in a council run care home in Bedfordshire. All the pensioners eventually received their payments totalling £91,344.69 from the DWP at the further expense of the taxpayer. At Preston Crown Court, father-of-one Ashraf, from Burnley, admitted conspiracy to defraud and was jailed for three years and seven months. Judge Robert Altham told him: 'You were a cynical and ruthless fraudster. 'These people were vulnerable and lost their entitlements for a period of time and no doubt they suffered stress and anxiety. 'The conspiracy was detected and was stopped but clearly further monies would have been defrauded if not detected. 'Vulnerable people were targeted, it was highly planned and carefully executed. You didn't stop at your own accord, you were stopped.' Earlier the court heard how Ashraf who worked for the DWP for nine years began his scam in September 2010 after he was given access to the departmental computer system for administrating payments to pensioners. The winter fuel allowance was worth £250 for over 65s and £400 for over 80s at the time and cold weather payments are fixed at £25 per week. But Ashraf recruited two lieutenants to pay £50 a time to others to provide their bank account details and amongst the accomplices were at least five young women from Leeds, Stoke, Birmingham and Manchester to receive payments meant for Pension Credit claimants. Mr Kevin Slack prosecuting said: 'The defendant exercised some care in choosing which pensioners' accounts to target so as to maximise the gain to himself and minimise the risk of detection.' He said Ashraf targeted OAPs whose payments had been temporarily suspended following the closure of their bank accounts. He imputted the account details of his own accomplices instead and restored the weekly payments. Accomplices: Ashraf's cousin Zaheer Uddin, left, was a 'key link' in the scam providing bank details for his friends and family. Sima Khan, 27, right, was also involved and was given a 12 month community order with 12 months supervision . Caught out: Vajid Ashraf worked at this government office in Burnley. While there, he rigged the computer to ensure electronically generated letters were not sent to pensioners who should have received the handouts . Mr Slack added: 'The previous suspension meant that the arrears of weekly payments had accumulated so that when he released that suspension and input the details of the new bank account into which the payments were to be made a large lump sum would typically be paid out. 'It would then be followed by ongoing weekly payment in much smaller amounts. The defendant was able to divert more money than would have been the case if ongoing weekly payments were redirected. 'The fact that payments had been suspended may have given the defendant reason to hope that there was a greater prospect of the payments being diverted to another account without the original pensioner noticing the absence of payments. 'In all cases the defendant ensured that the computer system was overridden to prevent from being issued the letter that would be generated and sent to the pensioner informing them that their bank account details had been amended. 'In 21 of the 24 cases it was the defendant who made the relevant entries, lifting the suspension, inputting new bank account details and suppressing the notification letters.' Convicted:  Haseena Dawood, 26, right,  received a 12 week jail term suspended for two years . Wayne Pecco, 31,  left, was given 10 weeks suspended for two years . The fraud emerged in June 2011 after an official at Bedfordshire County Council which had been appointed as carer for 80-year-old pensioner Annie Coggins noticed her payments had been suspended in early 2010. It emerged one of Ashraf's cousin's Zaheer Uddin was a 'key link' in the scam providing bank details for his wife, mother in law, two relatives of his wife and two other family friends. The stolen money would be paid into the accounts and the recipient would typically get to keep up to half - with the rest being collected by Ashraf. Uddin himself received £51,606.48 into his account. In mitigation for Ashraf who has three previous convictions including an offence of dangerous driving, defence lawyer Mark Stephenson said his client had been short of money. Justice: Sanaa Khan leaves Preston Crown Court after being sentenced for conspiracy to defraud . Mr Stephenson added: 'He had worked at the department for nine years and had a position of responsibility, one must have to presume that he did his job well up to then. 'He says he got himself in a hole, he found an opportunity and he took advantage of it. He fell and he fell hard and he got himself in to a situation that snowballed.' Uddin, 28, of Blackburn admitted conspiracy to defraud and was jailed for two years. Shakeel Butt, 28 also of Blackburn, was convicted of conspiracy and jailed for three years and four months. Sanaa Khan, 24, of Chorlton, Manchester, admitted to converting criminal property by making payments of £1,951 to a Natwest bank account and was given six weeks jail suspended for two years and ordered to complete 100 hours unpaid work. Sima Khan, 27, of Moseley, Birmingham, admitted a similar offence, relating to £5,429 and a Lloyds TSB account and was given a 12 month community order with 12 months supervision and 50 hours unpaid work. Sanaa Khan's husband Darrell Aldore, 24, received 12 months jail whilst Haseena Dawood, 26, from Urmston, Manchester received a 12 week jail term suspended for two years with 150 hours unpaid work. Wayne Pecco, 31, from Stoke, was given 10 weeks suspended for two years and 120 hours unpaid work. All pleaded guilty to converting criminal property. Sentencing upon two other women was adjourned. After the case a DWP spokesman said: 'We take internal and external fraud extremely seriously. It is looked into by professionally trained investigators and those caught are subject to disciplinary action, police are informed and we will prosecute.'","Father-of-one Vajid Ashraf was the 'lynchpin'

Laws forcing tobacco firms to sell cigarettes in plain packaging have been ditched, government sources said today. Health campaigners demanded the new rules to deter young people from starting smoking. But David Cameron has ordered ministers to pull the idea from next week's Queen's Speech. Legislation: Cigarettes would have been sold in plain packaging under the plan which has been shelved . The plain packaging idea comes from Australia, the country where it was first tried out. Cigarettes there have to be in a drab olive-coloured packaging, and the brand name is in a uniform typeface. The packets are also adorned with graphic images of the effects of lung cancer. A Downing Street source said: 'We are still waiting to see how it works in Australia before deciding what to do. There are no plans to introduce it now.' The Prime Minister wants minister to focus on economic growth, tackling immigration and reforming welfare. But health campaigners expressed their dismay that the idea has been shelved. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the campaign group Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), said: ‘For a Whitehall source to say that improving public health and reducing premature mortality is no longer one of the Government's key purposes is shocking. ‘Smoking remains the major preventable cause of death and disability and measures to reduce smoking prevalence are popular and effective. Over 60 per cent of the public support standard packaging for cigarette packs' Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking . Last April, the Government launched a consultation on plans to introduce mandatory standardised packaging for tobacco products. Opponents claimed the plan would lead to increased smuggling and job losses. The government has not yet publicly responded to the consultation, which closed in August. Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, added: ‘Given the public health minister herself has publicly acknowledged that cigarette packaging encourages young people to start smoking, it is bewildering that the Government are still allowing this by refusing to introduce standardised packaging.' David Cameron has ordered minister to shelve the idea to concentrate on the growth and welfare reforms . However Simon Clark, director of the smokers group Forest, said: 'We welcome the news, if it's true. 'Plain packaging has nothing to do with health. 'There is no evidence that it would make any difference to youth smoking rates but it could do enormous harm to small businesses, especially in the packaging industry, and help drive illicit trade. ‘We're pleased that the Prime Minister has apparently recognised this and has listened to the hundreds of thousands of people who expressed their opposition to standardised packaging in the Government consultation.’ Labour's shadow public health minister Diane Abbott said: ‘It's clear the Government has given in to their friends in ‘Big Tobacco’, and that doing the right thing isn't their priority. It's like they've given up on trying to improve public health now. ‘Smoking remains the major preventable cause of death and disability, so David Cameron needs to explain why he's letting the general public down like this' Cancer Research UK said it was 'extremely concerned'. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy and information, said: ‘If The Sun story is true, we're ‘We urge the Government not to waste the chance to protect the health of future generations. ‘Slickly designed tobacco packaging tempts children towards this fatal habit. Over 200,000 children take up smoking every year and one in two long-term smokers are killed by their addiction. ‘Plain packaging won't stop everyone from smoking but it will give millions of children one less reason to start. We must put the health of children ahead of the profits of the tobacco industry.’","Prime Minister ditches plan to copy Australia's laws .

Hartman (circled) climbs on top of WPC Chamberlain after pulling her to the ground. She is seen to grab her head and smash it against the pavement . She was ordered to pay WPC Chamberlain £500 compensation and was banned from entering any pub or club in Britain for a year. Officers were called to Shooters club last December when Hartman, who was already barred from the pub, poured a drink over the barman and slapped his manager. She is said to have drunk two bottles of wine and had been in the bar since 6pm. The mother-of-two pulled WPC Chamberlain to the ground by her hair when she tried to make an arrest. She attacked WPC Chamberlain until her colleague used CS spray on Hartman. The victim was left with a sprained ankle, lumps on her head and scratches on her face. Hartman had pulled out clumps of her hair during the assault. The prosecution said when police attended the scene and tried to arrest her friend she had ""lost it"". Judge Mark Horton today said her behaviour was 'appalling'. He said: 'Police officers in our society . are to be protected by the courts because they defend the rule of law . in this country and protect the public.

She is no banned from entering any pub, club or bar for a year . 'Those who do deliberately assault officers can expect to receive an immediate custodial sentence. 'Your behaviour that night was as appalling as it was irrational. It was a sustained assault on a police officer.' In a victim impact statement read to the court, WPC Chamberlain said: 'This attack is by far the worst I've been subjected to. 'The accident has left me more wary when dealing with confrontational situations. 'I count myself lucky I walked away with just the injuries I received especially as the back of my head was hit on the pavement.

Goldman Sachs was let off a £20million tax bill to avoid embarrassing George Osborne, the High Court heard yesterday. Revenue bosses are said to have stopped chasing Goldman Sachs for money it owed after the investment bank agreed to sign up to the Government’s flagship tax agreement – seen as a major coup for the Chancellor. Senior officials at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs are alleged to have granted Goldman Sachs a ‘sweetheart deal’  effectively cancelling the bill, because they feared the bank might otherwise back out of the agreement. Let off: Bosses at HMRC are said to have stopped chasing Goldman Sachs for £20million of tax it owed after the investment bank agreed to sign up to the Government's flagship tax agreement . The deal between the HMRC and the bank resulted in taxpayers being left £20million out of pocket . The deal between HMRC and the bank was said to have caused ‘real disquiet among the tax-paying public’ and to have amounted to Goldman Sachs being ‘rewarded’ for several years of failing to pay the tax it owed. In an email read in court, HMRC’s top tax official at the time, Dave Hartnett, warned colleagues that pursuing the bank for the outstanding money risked ‘major embarrassment to the Chancellor, HMRC, the LBS [a division of HMRC], you and me’. In letting the bank off the bill, Mr Hartnett personally overruled legal advice, as well as HMRC’s own strict guidelines, the court heard. The case dates back to 2005, when Goldman and four other banks were accused of avoiding tax on bonuses by funnelling them through a company in the British Virgin Islands. While the other banks agreed to pay, Goldman refused and was warned by HMRC it faced racking up interest payments. But in 2010, HMRC waived the £20million interest that had accumulated, after Goldman agreed to pay the original sum and sign the Government’s agreement. Deal: The HMRC feared the bank might otherwise back out of the agreement, which had been seen as a major coup for Chancellor George Osborne, pictured . HMRC’s internal review body criticised the move, and in-house lawyers said officials could pursue the money. But a week after Goldman signed Mr Osborne’s agreement, Mr Hartnett decided not to re-open the case. Ingrid Simler QC, representing tax campaign group UK Uncut Legal Action, said the deal between HMRC and Goldman Sachs should be ruled unlawful. Mrs Simler argued the decision was ‘unreasonable and could not be justified on its own merits’. She disclosed an email sent by Mr Hartnett to a colleague 48 hours before dropping the claim for the £20million owed. In it he said Goldman Sachs ‘went off the deep end at the suggestion they should pay interest’ and described the internal review board as ‘something of a formality’. HMRC’s guidelines state its officials should ‘not accept settlements for less than 100 per cent of tax and interest due’. After being accused of lying to MPs last year, Mr Hartnett left HMRC and joined HSBC as an adviser on honesty. He did not appear in court, but said in a written statement that Goldman’s signing of the tax agreement ‘would have been under threat had we reneged on the settlement’. Mr Justice Nichol retired to consider his verdict on the case.

A 22-year-old man who deliberately accelerated to knock a 24-year-old man over, was today jailed for life at Reading Crown Court. Ricky Clarke-Dilly picked-up speed as he drove towards Simon Large, 24, who was part of a rival group. He went from 24mph to 52mph in less than three seconds, in a 20mph zone. He drove off after he struck his victim.Mr Large was crossing the road with friends who had had an altercation with Clarke-Dilly earlier in the evening. A jury was told that Clarke-Dilly was accused of fighting Mr Large's friend, Matthew Turner, and ripping his shirt, in Club One in Ascot. Clarke-Dilly was forced to reimburse Mr Turner, and gave him £90. After several scuffles, the rival groups left the club. When Mr Large, Mr Turner and their friends crossed a road, Clarke-Dilly drove at twice the speed limit into their path. Clarke-Dilly, from Slough, Berkshire, was told that he would serve a minimum of 15 years for the murder of ""gentle and caring"" Simon Large. Mr Large was treated at St George's Hospital, Tooting, London for broken bones and damaged organs. He was placed in a coma but died from his injuries a week later. On sentencing him Judge Zoe Smith . described his action as 'indiscriminate violence' and said that since then he 'lacked remorse or a conscience.' She . said: 'You had been . forced into a position whereby you had to give money to Matthew Turner . as his shirt had been ripped by one of your friends. Clearly this made . you angry. Mr Large, 24, was crossing the road with his friends when the revenge attack happened. His friends got out of the way of the accelerating vehicle . The men had been partying at Ascot's Club 1 when a row over a ripped shirt broke out. Mr Large's friend demanded Clarke-Dilly paid to replace his shirt . 'As you were driving up the road you saw Matthew Turner and his group crossing the road. 'What happened then is captured on CCTV and has been played here and what has been observed can only be described as horrific. 'You accelerated as hard as you could towards them going from 24mph to 52mph in just 2.97 seconds.' Judge Smith said that Mr Large was 'in the prime of his life with a bright future ahead of him.' 'They (his family) have described Simon as a loving, gentle, caring person who was good to be around. 'Their lives and those of his extended family and many friends have been devastated.' Clarke-Dilly had previously admitted manslaughter but denied the more serious charge of murder. The judge gave Clarke-Dilly a life sentence because his 'intention was to cause really serious harm rather than to kill but due to the impact speed it was almost inevitable it would be fatal.' A jury took nine hours to convict him of murder. Judge Smith added: ""I accept that you came across the group unexpectedly and you were not looking for them. 'Your . intention was to cause really serious harm rather than to kill but due . to the impact speed it was almost inevitable it would be fatal.' After the hit and run, Clarke-Dilly crashed the car into a bollard before being arrested by police, explaining his dishevelled appearance as having been ""kicked out"" by his girlfriend. Clarke-Dilly gave police a prepared statement which said that although he was driving, his front seat passenger had taken the steering wheel prior to the impact.","22-year-old Ricky Clarke-Dilly jailed for life for killing Simon Large, 24 .

But events took a terrifying turn in October 2011 when he sent her a hoax bomb - intercepted by police, who found it was a bottle of perfume wrapped in gaffer tape and attached to battery wires. The same day a sickening letter arrived at the 215-room, four-star city centre hotel claiming to detail what Miss Edgley’s family would be entitled to in the event of her death. The girl had also received a book from her stalker who wrote a message inside about their connection through numbers and described the relationship the pair would have. She said: ‘It suddenly hit me that someone wanted me dead, someone hated me that much that they wanted to kill me. I was thinking “I’m only 17, what have I done that means that?”’ Miss Edgley, who also received chilling 3am calls from a man pertaining to be a work colleague asking her to meet him, added: ‘I was signed off work for six weeks. I was stressed, I was paranoid. ‘I couldn’t trust anybody – at one point I even accused my boyfriend. Everyone was a suspect. People commented on how much I had changed, how different I was.

A UKIP candidate is spending election day not campaigning but on holiday in Thailand. David Watson is standing in Basingstoke on a promise to put ‘Britain first’. But as voters go to the polls he is 6,000 miles, boasting on Facebook about relaxing by a swimming pool. UKIP candidate Dave Watson, picture top on a party leaflet, has used Facebook to boast about spending election day beside a swimming pool in Thailand . UKIP leader Nigel Farage is confident of making gains in today's elections, but has been dogged by revelations about some of his 1,700 candidates . The UK Independence Party is predicted to make big gains in elections in 34 council areas today and has fielded a full slate of 10 candidates in Basingstoke. But Mr Watson, who is the party’s vice-chairman in the Hampshire town, is a long way from helping to get out the vote. The 51-year-old local businessman flew to Asia a week ago. He wrote on Facebook that he could  be there for six months, enjoying the ‘sea views’. Speaking from Thailand today he told MailOnline: 'I admit I am here. I am here because my wife and I have had issues. It is a family crisis. 'If I get elected I can do the job with my eyes shut. I won't be charging expenses to come back.' He is the latest UKIP candidate to embarrass the party, after claims of Nazi salutes, photos with Hitler and blaming Jews for the Holocaust. Mr Watson's wife Phattawan said she did not know where in Thailand he is . In one message posted on April 28, Mr Watson said: ‘First day and ended up drunk on chang (beer) followed by Thai whiskey. Woke with a thumping head.’ The candidate for the Basingstoke South East division added: ‘Today had my tablet repaired and had a nice sauna and massage. Tomorrow must get down to business and join a gym.’ On Tuesday, he posted: ‘Get my condo tomorrow 6 months with sea views all on barter cant wait also has swimming pool below lovely.’ However, there is confusion about why Mr Watson is in Thailand. His Thai wife Phattawan Watson, 31, said he left the family home suddenly two weeks ago, leaving her to look after their young children. She added that she does not know where her husband is in Thailand. She said: ‘He just left. I want to find out where he is. I want him to take responsibility for the children. ‘All I know is he has gone to find his future life in Thailand.’ The couple married in August 2002 and have two sons, aged ten and eight. Mrs Watson also has a 12-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. Mrs Watson said her husband owns three properties in Basingstoke, two in nearby Brighton Hill, and one in nearby Popley. He pays the mortgage for their semi-detached home. She claims she has no savings or income, . and only has 100 pounds that was left by Mr Watson when he went away. She added: ‘I don't have anything.’ A UKIP member allegedly posted anti-Muslim jokes and a picture of Barrack Obama mocked up to look like a chimp, it emerged today. Tony Nixon, from Guisborough in North Yorkshire, has been suspended pending a police investigation. It is understood Mr Nixon had been canvassing for UKIP in Stokesley, North Yorkshire, ahead of today's local elections. Simon Cressy, a researcher for the anti-racist pressure group Hope Not Hate, accessed the Facebook page after he befriended Mr Nixon. He said it included images of US president Barack Obama and his wife mocked up to look like chimpanzees. There were also racist jokes about destroying mosques, burning Muslims or knocking over a Pakistani with a bus. A UKIP spokesman said: 'We are shocked to learn about the views of Tony Nixon expressed on Facebook, which are not representative of UKIP.' A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: 'We are aware of the issue and officers are investigating to establish if any offences have been committed. It would not be appropriate to comment further until these inquiries are completed.' Mr Nixon was not available for comment. The Facebook posts disappeared after he was contacted by reporters. He told a journalist he was in Thailand to visit his wife's parents and ‘to see if there is a way to assist my wife through her crisis’. He added: ‘I have also rented an apartment here for the family to use during this trying time. ‘My plan is to return to England in the next week or two. While I am here I intend to try and sell some family land.’ Mr Watson received the backing of his agent Phil Heath, who said: ‘He is a good and honest man. Dave Watson and his family have personal problems. ‘He's taken the decision to go before the election because it is urgent, including selling land to help out with the personal situation. ‘I always recommend to my candidates that they put family first.’ He added: ‘He will be away for a couple of weeks. If he's renting a place for six months that may be for convenience in case he needs to go back. ‘If he needs six months to sort it out, I support him on that.’ During the local election campaign Mr Farage was forced to admit his party had not properly vetted everyone standing on a UKIP ticket. It came after members were exposed for wearing a Jimmy Savile mask, blaming the Holocaust on Jews and branding Margaret Thatcher an 'old w****'. He defended Somerset candidate Alex Wood over an image which apparently showed him giving a Nazi salute, insisting: ‘I believe him when he says that he was angrily trying to take a camera off his girlfriend who was annoyingly taking pictures of him in the pub imitating a pot plant,' he told Huffington Post. Hampshire candidate Bradley Monk, 19, wore a mask of DJ paedophile Jimmy Savile to a Halloween party last year and Richard Delingpole, 46, a candidate in Somerset posted a photo mock-up on Facebook of himself stood next to Adolf Hitler. Today it emerged Christopher Thorpe, a UKIP candidate in Hertfordshire, was forced to resign as a police officer after he was caught working as a male escort in full uniform.","Dave Watson, party vice-chairman in Basingstoke, jetted off a week ago .

British space experts think they may have the answer to clearing up the trail of space junk - a space harpoon. A 'chase' satellite would be fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target . Using laser and radar guidance systems, a piece of space junk would be targeted, and then captured with a gas-propelled harpoon on a tether . Once the space junk is secured, a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere .

Dr Jamie Reed, from Astrium UK, told the Times: 'We've built a harpoon' It comes as the Stevenage based company announces it has been awarded a study contract by the French space agency CNES to tackle the problem of space junk. The study, awarded as part of the Orbital Transfer Vehicle (OTV) programme, will focus on the removal of large pieces of space debris . between now and 2020. The Earth is surrounded by an . ever-growing cloud of space junk, which Nasa has estimated contains . 500,000 objects bigger than a marble, and 22,000 bigger than a cricket . ball.

The first space tests of this harpoon . are scheduled within the next three years. Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

If they are successful a . working device could follow before 2020. 'Through this latest study, Astrium will pave the way to solving a major issue for all space users,' said Astrium Space Transportation CEO Alain Charmeau. Recent . studies by the European Space Agency and Nasa have shown that the . amount of space debris, particularly in low­-Earth orbit, could cause . 'collision cascading' also known as the Kessler effect, which would . hamper all space activity for 50 years. These . studies also point out that the effect can be stabilised by removing, . between now and 2020, between five and 10 items of large space debris. 'In mobilising our industrial resources in conjunction with those of national agencies, we will put forward innovative solutions and technologies capable of dealing with space debris and thereby ensuring the sustainable development of space,' Mr Charmeau said.

"Case expected to go to the jury at end of next week . 3rd juror in a month to be dismissed from the case after being arrested on a DUI . Juror no.8 was known as 'the CEO' because of his extensive note-taking . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:20 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:28 EST, 26 April 2013 . A juror has been released from high-profile Jodi Arias murder trial, the third member of the panel to be dismissed this month. Juror No. 8. was released from the case after being arrested last Saturday on a DUI charge. The 52-year-old man apparently got so . drunk that he blabbed to police about how he had spent the past four . months as a member of the Jodi Arias jury. One week to go: The trial of Jodi Arias is about to reach its conclusion, however the jury seems to be having it's own dramas. A third juror has been dismissed from the case after being arrested for 'extreme DUI' John Lyle, from the Gilbert Police Department in Arizona told RadarOnline.com 'On April 20, Daniel Gibb was arrested for extreme DUI. During the arrest Mr. Gibb claimed that he was a juror currently sitting on the Jodi Arias trial, and the arresting officer was called to the court to speak in a sealed meeting with the judge, the prosecutor and the defense attorneys handling the trial.' The police explained that the 'extreme' classification meant that he was suspected of being at a certain level of intoxication after the arresting officer did a series of tests. Accused: Arias is on trial for the killing of her boyfriend, Travis Alexander, in Mesa, Arizona in 2008. If convicted, Arias faces a potential death sentence . Although the contents of the secret meeting at the Maricopa County Courtroom remains confidential, just two days later the man was dismissed by Judge Sherry Stephens for no apparent reason. Juror No. 11 — another man — was excused because of health reasons on April 12, and a woman who was Juror No. 5 was dismissed on April 2, reportedly for making statements that showed a bias. Closing stages: Dr. Kevin Horn is one of the final witnesses on the case which is expected to conclude towards the end of next week . That now leaves the jury with 15 people - nine men and six women who will deliberate whether Jodi Arias, 32, goes free, spends the rest of her life behind bars, or is executed by lethal injection for the murder of Travis Alexander. Twelve jurors eventually will be selected at random to decide the fate of Arias, who claims she killed her 30-year-old lover in self-defense at his suburban Phoenix home in 2008. Prosecutors say Arias, 32, planned the attack in a jealous rage. She could face the death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder. Arias initially denied involvement then later blamed the attack on masked intruders. Two years after her arrest, she said it was self-defense. Almost five months into the trial, the prosecution has now presented its final witness. A medical examiner testified about the wounds of victim Travis Alexander. Dr. Kevin Horn, who performed the autopsy, said a gunshot injury through Alexander's brain would have rendered him unconscious and unable to defend himself. Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Mesa home in June 2008. Authorities also said his throat was slashed. 'Again because of the injury to the brain, the information processing part of the brain would have rendered him unable to raise his hands to offer any sort of purposeful action or to verbalize anything,' Horn said. Arias wept during part of Horn's testimony and members of Alexander's family averted their eyes when monitors showed autopsy photos. The trial, which began January 2nd, resumes on Wednesday with a final defense witness. Closing arguments are then expected before the case goes to the jury.","Case expected to go to the jury at end of next week .

Countryside retreat: Pearl Lowe said she doesn't miss living in London . 'Freedom to be myself': The fashion designer said she feels under less pressure to wear 'the right clothes' in Somerset . She added that 'there's so much I love about Somerset' because there's 'a lot of creative people here' so her and her husband, Supergrass drummer Danny Goffey, 'sort of fit in'. Pearl and Danny, who have three children, Alfie, 16, Frankie, 13, and Betty, seven, married in the county in 2008 and Pearl has decked out their home with items she's found in local flea markets and vintage shops. Fan of vintage: The mother-of-four has decked her home out with items she's bought at flea markets . She added that another perk of country living was the lower prices. 'You can buy unbelievable vintage dresses for a quarter of what you'd pay in London,' she said. In her youth, Pearl was a regular on the party circuit in London's Primrose Hill counting stars including Kate Moss, Jude Law and Patsy Kensit in her circle of friends. She married Bronner Handwerger when she . fell pregnant with daughter Daisy, now a successful model, at the age of . 19. Daisy discovered after taking a DNA test when she was a teenager . that her real father is Bush singer Gavin Rossdale. Former party people: Pearl and husband Danny Goffey, left, with actress Samantha Morton and actor Rhys Ifans in 2005 . Pearl talked openly about her battle with drug addiction during her twenties in her autobiography. 'It was a never-ending party,' she revealed. 'Yet I was utterly miserable. There wasn't a night I didn't go to bed in tears or a morning I didn't wake up feeling despair, guilt and self-loathing. Why? I was hopelessly addicted to drugs.' Her current country idyll is a far cry from her former lifestyle and she said she and her younger children (Daisy still lives in London) 'have blossomed' in their home that's surrounded by trees with a brook at end of the garden. Still in the capital: Pearl's daughter is now a model . After giving County Homes magazine a tour of her home she admitted: 'I’ve found a sanctuary here, a place of renewal and growth - somewhere to rest. 'We’re close to Glastonbury, so there’s also the healing aspect.'

Bush, who has been in a Houston, Texas, hospital with a lingering cough since November, may miss Christmas at home this year. The former president needs to ‘build up his energy’ before he can be released, doctors said Sunday. Methodist Hospital spokesman George Kovacik said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press that doctors are still optimistic that Bush, 88, will make a full recovery. However, doctors but are being ‘extra cautious’ with his care, he said. Four-week cough: Former president George H.W. Bush has been in a Houston, Texas, hospital with a lingering cough since November 23 . Bush is in stable condition, Kovacik said. The 41st president was hospitalized on November 23 for treatment of a bronchitis-related cough. Hospital officials have said he has been receiving physical therapy to increase his strength. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said on Thursday that Bush could be released in time for Christmas. Kovacik said a discharge date has not been set, and that it remains unclear whether Bush will be able to spend the holiday at home. Kovacik said that could be decided on Monday, Christmas Eve. Optimistic: A Methodist Hospital spokesman said that doctors are still optimistic that Bush, 88, will make a full recovery . The past few weeks have brought high levels of seasonal sickness around the country. Influenza activity continues to increase across the U.S., according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ‘High levels of influenza-like-illness activity continue to be concentrated in the south central and southeastern regions of the nation,’ the CDC states. Widespread influenza activity for the week of December 9-15, 2012, was reported by 29 states, including Texas. May miss Christmas: The hospital spokesman said a discharge date has not been set, and it remains unclear whether Bush will be able to spend the holiday at home . Bronchitis, which Bush is believed to be afflicted with, is an acute or chronic inflammation of the bronchial tubes. The flu is a viral infection affecting the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, lungs and bronchial tubes. The two illnesses are not related, but are both more common during winter seasons when cold viruses become more widespread. Flu seasons can vary widely. Some years are very severe, with hospitalizations of up to 200,000 people and between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths during a season, according to the CDC.","Former president George H.W.

Slim focus: Jenna Lyons, 44, uses organic juice cleanses, consuming nothing but liquids for more than a week, to maintain her slender figure . J. Crew's six-foot-tall creative director and president, Jenna Lyons, may be one of America's most fashionable managers, but even she isn't immune to hang-ups that plague the industry. The 44-year-old revealed she uses organic juice and Isogenic cleanses, consuming nothing but liquids for more than a week, to maintain her slender figure. She told Fast Company's Danielle Sacks: 'I'm so hungry. I haven't eaten in 10 days,' before adding, 'the inside button [on my pants] would pop before I even zipped it. I was like, ""Oh, God!""' The mother-of-one also told Harper's Bazaar recently that she has 'weird eating habits'. 'I don't eat breakfast,' she said. '[For lunch] I have pretty much the same thing every day. I'll go for a year eating the same thing and then I'll switch. Right now I'm eating Cobb salad; last year it was tomato soup. 'Throughout the day I alternate between coffee and this apple, ginger, and lemon juice with cayenne pepper called the Killer.' Ms Lyons said she tries to leave J. Crew's East Village headquarters by 6pm, to eat dinner with her six-year-old son, Beckett . '[He] eats pretty early, so I'll usually eat with him as soon as I get home. His babysitter makes this incredible salmon with ginger, tomato, and cilantro. For some reason she is obsessed with me eating,' she admitted. But she isn't impervious to treats, however. 'I have an insane collection of ice cream in my fridge,' Ms Lyons revealed. 'I love anything related to coffee ice cream. The espresso gelato from Ciao Bella is amazing. I eat a lot of ice cream, chocolate, and cookies, and I drink rosé champagne.' The Southern Californian, who suffers from incontinentia pigmenti, may take pains to look like the models gracing J. Crew's catalogs, but her dual role as top creative executive and president is not to be snuffed at. Todd Snyder, J. Crew CEO Mickey Drexler's former head of men's wear at Gap, . told Fast Company: 'She looks like a model, and then she talks like the . best salesperson you ever met. I think she's the most . talented person [Mr Drexler] has ever worked with in design. Head above the rest: J.

Ms Lyons' move to the top has not been easy; during her childhood she was subjected to constant bullying after her . genetic disorder, incontinentia pigmenti, led to scarred skin, patchy hair, and lost teeth - . requiring dentures. She explained: 'It's amazing how cruel kids can be and superjudgmental and really just . downright mean.' Finding refuge in art, Ms Lyons, who is dating jewelry designer Courtney Crangi, said: 'I searched for ways to make things more . beautiful and surrounded myself with beautiful things because I didn't . feel that in myself. New love: Ms Crangi (left) and Ms Lyons (right) began dating last year, after the J. Crew boss split from her husband of nine years . 'I felt a huge drive to make clothes that everybody could have because I . felt ostracized by that world of beauty and fashion.' Ms Lyons, who started at J. Crew as a 21-year-old 'assistant to an assistant,' also revealed how she landed her current role, 20 years later in 2010. When Mr Drexler arrived at J.Crew in 2003 from Gap, the company . was in financial distress. On his first day at the company, he requested that every employee re-interview for their jobs - including Ms Lyons, who was asked to run through the women's collection in . front of a roomful of 50 people. Mr Drexler asked her thoughts on the three . pairs of skinny stretch pants she was presenting. 'At that point I was like, ""I have to be honest,""' recalled Ms Lyons. 'I can't . lie to him because this is sort of a do-or-die situation.' She was honest, telling him that she didn't like much of the collection, and explained what she would like to change. 'I . didn't know if I was going to be fired,' she said. 'I was so confused, . and I was scared, but I was also a little bit excited, because all the . things that I liked and that I thought were brand-right he was leaving . up on the wall. And I was like, ""Is that good, is that bad? I don't . know.""' She kept her job, even though many did not. 'Honestly, I think it was because I didn't bullshit . him,' Ms Lyons explained. 'His bullshit-dar is insane.' And with a fan base that includes Michelle Obama and Anna Wintour, it's not surprising she was promoted to president and creative director, where 'no financial decision weighs heavier than a creative decision,' seven years later. A former employee explained: 'If Jenna wasn't there, J.Crew would be really good, but it would not be great. Probably a healthily run company like a Banana Republic.

Decades after being sexually assaulted, the woman who sparked the police investigation into Stuart Hall has given a harrowing account of the alleged abuse she suffered. The woman, who has remained anonymous, claims the BBC broadcaster groomed her over a number of meetings, before plying her with alcohol and eventually having sex with her when she was a teenager. She says they had sex on at least three occasions and he even put her on the contraceptive pill and got the prescription himself. Scroll down for video . The woman claims veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall put her on the contraceptive pill when she was a teen . And like other victims who have come forward since Hall admitted 14 counts of indecent assault against young girls, the woman said he met her at her school. Hall, 83, pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as nine, it was announced yesterday. Detectives first launched an investigation into Hall after the woman sent the anonymous letter to Independent journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, who then passed it onto police. In the letter, published for the first time today, she writes that he groomed and exploited her when she was a shy but intelligent schoolgirl in the 1970s. She said he was invited to her school for a prize giving and after the ceremony he asked the headteacher for permission to take her to the BBC studios - which was granted. It was her anonymous letter that sparked the investigation into Hall and he has since pleaded guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault on girls as young as nine years old . The woman said she finally wanted to reveal her secret after he was made an OBE and said she also feared he would die before being brought to justice, like Jimmy Savile . The woman wrote in the letter published by The Independent: 'I was young for my years and easy meat for a man like him'. She said she was allowed to meet him alone at the BBC, where during the third visit he gave her champagne before having sex with her in his dressing room. She alleges they had sex on at least . two other occasions but that she has blocked out the painful memories and is . unsure if it happened at any other times. The woman alleges they even had sex at the home of one of Hall's friends, who 'covered' for his behaviour. She wrote that as an adult she is furious at his predatory behaviour and the abuse she suffered. The woman has also been devastated by the effect it had on her relationship with her mother. She wrote: 'Why am I so angry? Because what he did was to spoil my sense of myself, my relationship with myself, my feeling of who I was for many years. The woman said the It's a Royal Knockout presenter met her at school and then invited her to the BBC . She said his abuse left her feeling shamed and impacted on her relationship with her mother . 'His actions filled me with me with shame and secrecy, and had a terrible effect too on my relationship with my mother.' After . decades of keeping the alleged abuse secret, the woman said she was finally prompted into . writing to the newspaper after he was awarded the OBE last year. She said she feared he would also escape justice, like Jimmy Savile, by dying before the truth was out. He pleaded guilty to carrying out the attacks between 1968 and 1986 at Preston Crown Court. Following a hearing yesterday, the television star's barrister said that Hall was 'only too aware his disgrace is complete'. Her letter bears striking similarities to the testimonies of two victims, who helped bring Hall to justice. Like the anonymous woman, Susan Melville met Stuart Hall after he was hired for her school prizegiving. He invited her to the BBC studios where he groomed and eventually sexually assault her. After waiving her right to anonymity, Mrs Melville said: ' feel he exploited his position within the BBC to essentially groom me and make me go to the BBC offices. ‘I . am aware that Jimmy Savile did similar things to his victims where he . would use his celebrity status to gain their trust and then abuse . them.’ Kim Wright was the first of Hall's victims to make an official complaint. She was working as a clerk when he grabbed her breast. She said: 'I was convinced I couldn’t have been . the only one and I felt it was my duty to report it, in case there was . someone out there who daren’t. Someone who’d suffered more than me. ‘I . felt that if the police could say to another victim, “You’re not the . only one”, it would give them courage to come forward. It was a moral . decision and when I found out about all the other women I thought, “Job . done”.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The woman's anonymous letter to a national newspaper sparked the investigation into the veteran broadcaster .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 15:34 EST, 17 April 2013 . Arrested: Tina Baldwin, 47, is the mother of Ashley Baldwin, who began working at the abortion clinic when she was just 15 years old . A woman who interned at an abortion clinic for years starting when she was 15 testified in court Thursday about seeing at least five aborted babies moving, breathing, and in once case, 'screeching.' Ashley Baldwin, now 22, recalled the horrifying detail before a jury at the murder trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, her employer at the Women's Medical Society clinic in Pennsylvania. Baldwin said she helped perform countless late-term procedures where aborted babies would show obvious signs of life outside the womb. 'They just looked like regular babies,' Baldwin said. One baby was so big that Gosnell joked to her, 'This baby is going to walk me home,' the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Gosnell, 72, is charged with seven counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of seven infants born alive during abortions. He allegedly killed the babies by cutting their spinal cords with scissors. If found guilty, Gosnell faces a possible death sentence. Baldwin recalled seeing the doctor use scissors to 'snip' the necks of newborns who were moving outside the womb. On trial: Kermit Gosnell, pictured, is accused of killing the babies at the Philadelphia Women’s Medical Society clinic and a 41-year-old woman who was administered too much anesthesia and suffered cardiac arrest . Her testimony supports that of Lynda . Williams, 44, who also testified this week to seeing babies have their . necks snipped by Gosnell. Baldwin's remarks to the jury ended the fourth week of testimony in the trial, which is set to resume on Monday. Now the mother of a two-year-old, . Baldwin said she started working for Gosnell at such a young age because . she had dreams of becoming a doctor. Her mother, 47-year-old Tina Baldwin, . also worked at the clinic and she has pleaded guilty to racketeering, . conspiracy and corrupting a minor - her daughter - in connection with . the case. Gosnell is also charged with . corrupting a minor and with one count of third-degree murder in the . death of Karnamaya Mongar, a 41-year-old patient who was killed by an . overdose of pain medication administered during an abortion procedure. Ashley Baldwin said she was at the . clinic the night of Mongar's death in 2009 and that Gosnell had asked . her to plug in a defibrillator while he was pumping her chest. 'Victim': Karnamaya Mongar, 41, died at Gosnell's clinic during an abortion procedure in November 2009 . Murder? Some former employees at the Women's Medical Society, said many women came to the clinic for abortions but looked as if they were too far along in their pregnancies to be there . 'I got a small shock when I plugged it in,' Baldwin said. 'It didn't work.' Earlier in the week, another former clinic worker, Lynda Williams, said Gosnell taught her how to turn a baby over and cut its neck with a pair of scissors - but she only did it once because it gave her 'the creeps.' She added it was one of her duties to pick up babies that women would spontaneously give birth to in the waiting room after getting large doses of drugs, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. Like many of Gosnell's employees, Williams was desperate for work when he gave her a job. She had a poor education and had not even finished eighth grade, although went on to work as an instrument sterilizer. During this job, she met Gosnell who performed abortions at the clinic. 'House of horrors': Another former employee claimed he saw 100 live babies killed at the clinic, pictured . House of horror: A grand jury photograph shows what police say are plastic bags hiding body parts in a refrigerator inside the Philadelphia practice . But . her life began spiralling out of control when her husband was murdered . in 2008 and she was diagnosed with bipolar and depression. She asked . Gosnell if he had any work for her. He hired her to sterilize instrument and soon asked her to carry out ultrasounds, administering intravenous medication and anesthesia to patients. She . told the jury that Gosnell changed paperwork on patients . that were too heavily pregnant to undergo an abortion so that they appeared to be less than 24 weeks - the legal time limit. She . added that pain medication was sometimes out of date or did not work - . and she would see Gosnell 'smack' the legs of women who squirmed, . leaving his hand print behind. Her testimony came a day after . another worker, Sherry West, told the court how she was once handed an . underdeveloped newborn with no eyes or mouth and told to deal with it. Discovery: Investigators found these bags allegedly filled with body parts at the clinic in Philadelphia . Rundown: An internal shot of the clinic, which was allegedly reeking of animal urine and feces . Other employees have described how they saw about 100 babies born alive and then 'snipped'. Some told the court of gruesome . scenes at the clinic which was allegedly found dirty and rundown with . rusting surgical instruments. A Grand Jury report said the clinic was . crawling with cats and reeking of animal urine and feces. Furniture and . blankets were stained with blood and instruments were not properly . sterilized. Disturbingly, the report alleged that fetal remains were stuffed . into: 'cabinets, in the basement, in a freezer, in jars and bags and . plastic jugs'. 'It . would rain fetuses. Fetuses and blood all over the place. It is . literally a beheading. It is separating the brain from the body,' one former employee Stephen Massof told NBC. But he said he believed the . intentions of his boss were honest and that the doctor believed he was helping the . women, often extremely poor, who came to him . The doctor: Kermit Gosnell . Charged: Pearl Gosnell . Employee: Elizabeth Hampton . Arrested: Tina Baldwin . Assistant: Sherry West . Worker: Adrine Moton . Accomplice: Eileen O'Neil . Locked up: Stephen Massof . Held: Maddline Joe . 'I believe that Dr. Gosnell was honestly trying to help women and protect them from abuse and neglect,' Massof said. The trial is in its fourth week and is expected to last another month. If Gosnell is found guilty he could be given the death penalty. Eight clinic employees have pleaded guilty to various charges, while a ninth is on trial with Gosnell. Gosnell's lawyer denies the murder charge and disputes that any . babies were born alive. He also challenges the gestational age of the . aborted fetuses, calling them inexact estimates.","Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, is on trial for 'murdering seven babies and a woman, 41' at an abortion clinic in Philadelphia .

Tragic: Mary Byrne, who was killed yards away her Bradford home as she payed for a cab which had brought her home from a friend's birthday party . A devoted grandmother run down while paying a minicab driver was killed just yards from her front door. Mary Byrne was paying the driver who had just taken her home in Bradford, West Yorkshire, when another car slammed into the cab, pushing it on top of her. She died just a few steps from the gates of a primary school where a poster by her seven-year-old granddaughter pleaded for drivers to be considerate. Three men are in custody as police investigate the incident, which happened at 5.16pm on Saturday. Ms Byrne, 51, had been returning from celebrating a friend's birthday when the cars collided just outside the semi-detached house where she had lived for 27 years. She lived there with her partner Alan Jones, who is currently away in Kos and trying to get a flight home. Neighbours who rushed to her aid said they saw her lying pinned beneath the taxi. One man, who did not wish to be named, said he heard the crash and ran straight out to help, but it was already too late. Ms Byrne's four distraught children told how she devoted her life to them, her elderly parents and seven grandchildren. Today she would have been visiting her daughter Sara Harrison at her nearby home and cooking up a batch of pancakes for her grandchildren, a Monday family tradition. The pair worked together at a nearby nursing home. Ms Byrne was a cook, a profession which she passed on to her son, Ben Byrne, who also used to work with her at another nursing home. She was also a dedicated daughter to her elderly parents, whom she visited several times a week, and who had encouraged her to pursue a love of cleaning and start her own business, which she said would be called Mary's Mops. Ms Harrison said her mother fancied herself as 'a bit of a Kim and Aggie' and had seen a scooter she would use for her business venture. Mr Byrne, her 24-year-old son, said: 'She loved us all. She just loved her grandkids and all of us, she just worried about us all the time. She took her grandchildren everywhere.' Eldest daughter Sam Rees, 33, said: 'She loved us, but whatever love she had for us, you could times that by ten for the grandkids. Bitter irony: Ms Byrne was killed close to school gates which had been decorated with a poster by her granddaughter pleading for drivers to be considerate . 'She was a proper grandma, she was involved in as much as she could be. There wasn't a day when she wouldn't see some of her grandkids.' Her son David Barrett, 21, had spoken to her as she waited for a taxi to take her home. He said she had had a good day and was looking forward to seeing her family over the weekend. Ms Harrison received a phone call about the accident and had tried to call her mother, who liked to know what was happening on her street. But when Ms Harrison realised the timing of the accident she said she just knew what had happened. Busy road: The scene in Bradford, West Yorks, where Ms Byrne was mown down outside her home . Around a dozen brightly coloured bouquets have been neatly placed in the smashed garden wall of the semi-detached house next door to where Ms Byrne lived. Many had cards or messages attached which paid tribute and questioned why she had been taken. One read: 'This should not have happened to a lovely person like you.' Ms Byrne's children said the bitter irony of the accident happening so close to her grandaughter Grace's poster, drawn as part of a school road safety campaign at St John's School, had only served to make them more determined to campaign for traffic calming.

A judge declared a mistrial Tuesday after jurors said they couldn't reach a verdict in the case of a mental patient who slashed a New York City psychotherapist to death with a meat cleaver. The defense didn't dispute that David Tarloff, 45, killed Kathryn Faughey in February 2008, but Tarloff’s attorneys claimed that he was so psychotic that he couldn't tell what he was doing was wrong. The Manhattan District Attorney's office said Tarloff carried out a deliberate plan and understood it was illegal. Cause for mistrial: The defense claimed that David Tarloff (left) was so psychotic that he couldn't tell that killing Dr Kathryn Faughey (right) was wrong . A judge declared a mistrial after jurors said they couldn't agree on a verdict in Tarloff's case . ‘Mr. Tarloff knew it was wrong to shove a knife into someone,’ prosecutor Evan Krutoy said during summations. ‘He's mentally ill and he's guilty of murder.’ Tarloff faced a life in prison if convicted. The district attorney’s office plans to retry the case. Tarloff told authorities he set out to rob Faughey's officemate, encountered her instead and thought she was evil. Tarloff envisioned getting $40,000 from the holdup to whisk his sick mother away to Hawaii. Dangerous mind: Tarloff told authorities he set out to rob Faughey's officemate to get enough money to take his mother to Hawaii, but encountered her instead and thought she was evil . It was the jury's 10th day of deliberations, which appeared to be very heated judging by the shouting coming from the jury room, the New York Daily News reported. Just before 11.30am, the jury panel passed a note to the judge saying that they cannot reach an agreement on a verdict and will remain deadlocked on all counts. 'I'm willing to say that we're finished,' Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin said in response before declaring mistrial. ‘It's very disappointing for us, but we will be back until we get justice in this case for our sister,’ said Owen Faughey, one of the victim's brothers who looked shaken by the outcome. ‘We'll do whatever it takes, and we will see justice, I'm sure of that,’ said another, Michael Faughey.Faughey, 56, specialized in helping people with relationships. She'd never met Tarloff, let alone treated him. ‘We're terribly disappointed that the jury could not reach a unanimous decision,’ said defense attorney Frederick Sosinsky. ‘We believe this was a very powerful case for a `not responsible' verdict, as rare as those verdicts might be.’ Tarloff, now 45, was diagnosed with schizophrenia during his college years. He has been hospitalized more than a dozen times, recounted seeing ‘Satan’ spelled out in his mind and the ‘eye of God’ on the kitchen floor. Innocent victim: Tarloff slashed Faughey 15 times, fractured her skull with a rubber meat mallet, seriously wounded her officemate when he tried to rescue her, and fled . According to court papers, the defendant viewed pieces of paper on the street as a special message from God. His brother testified that he once came to find Tarloff naked and throwing eggs on the wall. For years, his relatives tried unsuccessfully to get him to stay in mental hospitals or adult homes, but he left them. After his mother moved from the Queens apartment they shared to a nursing home in 2004, Tarloff became convinced she was being mistreated and determined to get her out. He hit upon a scheme to get the money: Hold up Dr. Kent Shinbach, the psychiatrist who'd had first him hospitalized in 1991, to get the doctor's ATM code, he later told authorities. Chilling confession: A jury saw Tarloff in this 2008 police interrogation video saying that he only wanted money . After making a series of phone calls to find out the location and hours of Shinbach's office on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Tarloff bought a cutlery set, a rubber meat-pounding mallet and rope. He set out with those and a suitcase of adult diapers and clothes for his mother. Faughey, who shared Shinbach's office suite, confronted Tarloff. He slashed her 15 times, fractured her skull with the mallet, seriously wounded Shinbach when he tried to rescue her, and fled. Tarloff was not in court Tuesday and the jurors were not in court. Several jurors left declining to speak to reporters. Residence: NYPD officers outside his Queens apartment on February 16, 2008 after matching bloody fingerprints at the crime scene to his prints . Manhunt: Police arrested Tarloff in 2008 at his Queens apartment building . A few jurors stopped to talk to Faughey's three brothers and three sisters who were in court. The family could be overheard thanking them for their efforts. Lawyers will be back in court May 21 for status update.","David Tarloff's attorneys claimed he was too psychotic to realize that killing Dr Kathryn Faughey was wrong .

Charged: Dorothy Canfield, 84, allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the Houston-area prosecutor handling her case . An 84-year-old female inmate allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the Houston-area prosecutor handling her case and to maim his boss like the series of killings of other law enforcement officials elsewhere in Texas. Dorothy Canfield allegedly sought to have Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon attacked and his assistant district attorney, Rob Freyer, slain. Canfield allegedly wanted the attacks to appear similar to the recent unsolved killings of two other Texas prosecutors- Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse. McLelland and his wife were found dead in their homes on March 30, about two months after Hasse was fatally shot outside the local courthouse. 'Dorothy Canfield hoped to capitalize on the tragic murder of the Kaufman County district attorney, his wife and assistant district attorney Mark Hasse to disrupt the prosecution of her theft charge in the most violent way possible,' Ligon said. Neither Mr Ligon nor Mr Freyer was injured in the alleged plot, which investigators said surfaced in early April. Her target: Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon and his assistant district attorney were the two men that Canfield was trying to hire the hit man to injure and kill . The deaths of the Kaufman County . prosecutors were among several recent high-profile law enforcement . killings, including the shooting earlier this month of a southern West . Virginia sheriff and the March slaying of Colorado's prison chief. Canfield faces charges of solicitation of capital murder and solicitation to commit aggravated assault on a public servant. Authorities allege Canfield told others of her plans to seek someone to kill Freyer and attack Ligon. Canfield was being held Monday in jail in Conroe, about 30 miles north of Houston, on a property theft charge that involves allegations she posed as an immigration attorney, even though she is not a lawyer, in order to bilk clients. Fears: District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife Cynthia were gunned down at their ranch-style bungalow in late March and their slaying was reportedly the inspiration for the hit that Canfield tried to arrange . Target: Kaufman County assistant district attorney Mark Hasse was killed on January 31 . At a news conference, Ligon played a . recording of a meeting on April 8 in the county jail between Canfield . and an undercover law enforcement agent who posed as a hit man. In . the recording, Canfield urged that the killing and maiming be done as . soon as possible, and for the alleged hit man to 'make it look good.' Canfield sought to pay $5,000 for Freyer to be killed and $2,500 for the attack on Ligon, authorities said. Authorities said Canfield admitted to trying to hire the hit man during an interview with two Texas Rangers on Monday. Sergeant Wende Wakeman, one of the Texas Rangers who spoke with Canfield, said at the news conference the 84-year-old woman was 'very cold and not very remorseful.' Ligon rejected any thoughts of sentiment because of her age. 'If you've got the motivation, the means to make it happen, it doesn't matter your age. It only matters what your intent is. The contract already was sealed,' he said. 'The fact of the matter is the person she was trying to hire was a very robust, young guy that was able to carry out her intentions. Don't get lost in the fact what her age is.' Suspect: Evan Spencer Ebel (left) is the main . suspect in the murder of Colorado prison's chief Tom Clements (right) and Clements murder was the first of a string of such cases in the area . On a tape of their conversation, she said she had $647,000 as proof she could pay. 'If somebody takes a step to actually meet with a hit man, we take that serious,' Ligon said. She was originally in jail for bilking the clients while posing as an immigration lawyer, the charge for which included a bond set at $500,000. Court records show various theft and forgery cases having been filed against Canfield, some dating back to 1993.","Dorothy Canfield, 84, in Houston, Texas tried to hire a hitman to target the prosecutors on her case .

Suicide: Justin Alan Helzer, 41, was pronounced dead at San Quentin State Prison after hanging himself from a sheet in his cell . The death row inmate who killed guitarist Elvin Bishop's daughter and four others in 2000 murder-extortion plot died of an apparent suicide, California prison officials announced Monday. Justin Helzer, 41, was found dead Sunday night in his single cell at San Quentin Prison, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told NBC Bay Area . Corrections Lt. Sam Robinson said Helzer used a sheet tied to his cell bars to hang himself. He was found dead during a security check at around 10.17pm. An earlier suicide attempt two years ago had left the 41-year-old death row inmate blind. Helzer and his brother Glenn Helzer, who went by his middle name, Taylor, were sentenced to death in 2005 for the murders, which were planned as part of a bizarre blackmail scheme. Taylor Helzer was a stock broker and self-described prophet seeking to raise money for a religious group he had launched to hasten Christ's return to Earth. According to court testimony, he dated 22-year-old Selina Bishop so she would open a checking account for him to deposit money he intended to extort from elderly clients of his. The brothers killed Bishop, her mother and mother's boyfriend along with the clients in the summer of 2000. An accomplice, Dawn Godman, testified against the brothers in exchange for a prison sentence that didn't include the death penalty. She is serving a 37-year sentence. 'Children of Thunder': Justin Helzer (left) and his brother, Glenn Taylor Helzer (right), were sentenced to death in 2005 for murdering five people as part of a plot to extort $100,000 to launch a religious group . Co-conspirator: Dawn Godman escaped the death penalty by testifying against the Helzer brothers . ‘In no sense of the word was Justin Helzer a victim,’ Contra Costa County Chief Assistant District Attorney Harold Jewett said Monday. ‘Nevertheless, the origin of the obvious torment he experienced in prison, reflected in self-mutilation and now suicide, clearly rests at the doorstep of his older brother, Taylor.’ In 2010, Justin Helzer attempted to take his own life by stabbing himself in the eye with pens and pencils. He had been under intensified watch since then. After Helzer’s suicide Sunday, his brother has been paced under intensive screening to ensure that he does not attempt to take his own life as well. In 2000, Taylor Helzer and his two accomplices concocted a plot to train Brazilian orphans to massacre the leaders of the Mormon Church so he could become its leader and ‘transform America’ by bringing ‘joy, peace and love,’ according to court testimony. Victims: Ivan Stineman (left) and his wife, Annette (right), were murdered and dismembered by their former stockbroker, Taylor Helzer, as part of a plot to extort $100,000 from them . Silenced: Selina Bishop (left) was killed and cut up after delivering the siblings the money, and her mother, Jennifer Villarin (right), shot dead because she saw the face of one . of the Helzers . The conspirators, who called themselves the ‘Children of Thunder,’ needed money to carry out the bizarre plan, so they decided to extort one of Taylor Helzer's former clients, Ivan Stineman, of Concord, in the hope of getting $100,000. Justin Helzer ended up beating the 85-year-old man to death while his brother killed his wife, 78-year-old Annette Stineman, by slashing her throat. The murderous siblings accompanied by their former roommate, Dawn Godman, then killed Selina Bishop to silence her after she collected the money on their behalf not knowing about the homicidal plot. The bodies if Selina Bishop and the Stinemans were dismembered and stuffed into nine black duffel bags, which were later fished out by divers from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the San Francisco Chroncile reported. Gruesome finds: Divers found nine duffel bags in the summer of 2000 conditioning the cut up remains of Ivan and Annette Stineman and Selina Bishop . Justin’s brother later shot dead Bishop's mother, 45-year-old Jennifer Villarin, and her boyfriend, James Gamble, 54, for fear that they would go to police. Taylor Helzer, who was the ringleader of the group and described himself as the ‘No 1,’ had been sentenced to five death sentences. Justin was sentenced to death for three of the murders and life in prison for their other two. Since 1978, when California reinstated capital punishment, 58 death row inmates have died from natural causes, 22 have committed suicide, 13 have been executed in California, one was executed in Missouri, and six have died from other causes. There are 733 inmates remaining on death row.","Justin Helzer, 41, received three death sentences in 2005 for the murders .

Ralph Finch has been collecting ketchup and ketchup memorabilia for 44 years and has spent thousands of dollars . The pair’s stories were featured on Wednesday night’s My Crazy Obsession, a show that features ordinary people’s collections and obsessions. Mr Levinson, who only wears yellow, fell in love with the condiment more than 25 years ago when during a bout of insomnia he went to the supermarket and heard voices coming from the mustard aisle telling him to collect them. Since then it has become a 24/7 obsession, with him giving up his job as a lawyer for the state of Wisconsin and devoting his life to his mustard collection and running the National Mustard Museum in Middleton.

But, Mr Levinson’s wife Patti thinks that his obsession is ‘totally crazy’, and has forced him to start therapy to help him focus on other areas of his life. She said: ‘The fact that Barry used to be a lawyer and gave up that career to collect mustard, I think is a little crazy but he's an obsessive person.' Mr Levinson's love for mustard grew when in 1987, he grabbed a small jar from a hotel he stayed in and put it in his pocket before an important case in front of the US Supreme Court.

Schoolgirl Emily Marsh’s hiccups started on a normal day in January when she was on her way to a maths lesson. But the 13-year-old has not been able to stop since, hiccuping every two seconds, even when she is asleep. Experts are baffled by her rare condition and haven’t yet been able to find a cure. Scroll down for video . Schoolgirl: Emily marsh has not stopped hiccuping for ten weeks and has experts baffled as they cannot find a cure . Emily has undergone a whole series of tests since she went to her GP after a week, and was referred to St Helier Hospital, in Epsom, Surrey. She has had an MRI scan, ultrasound scan, chest X-ray, endoscopy, biopsies, a nasal chute to measure her pH levels, and a gastric emptying study. Doctors have prescribed a variety of different drugs, which haven't worked and she has tried osteopathy and hypnosis. The schoolgirl has tried every home-made remedy, from a spoonful of vinegar to holding her breath and is so desperate that she is about to have a go at acupuncture and has appointments to see an audiologist and tic doctor. She finds it so exhausting she's been given afternoons off school to rest. ‘We are willing to try anything,’ said her mother Cathy Barrett, 45, a charity worker from Wallington, Surrey. ‘It's been 10 weeks now, and a very long 10 weeks at that. Emily is exhausted by it all but she's taking it in her stride. Concern: Mother Cathy and sisters Natasha 15 (left) and Libby 10 (right) have been worried about Emily's condition . ‘It makes her throat very sore but she deals with it very well. The thing that frustrates her is this constant tired feeling. ‘Strangers are forever offering her a glass of water. But school have been very understanding.’ Emily is one of only a handful of young people known to have had sustained chronic hiccups. She can only manage half a day at Stanley Park High School, Carshalton, Surrey, because the constant movement is not only painful but exhausting. Emily said: 'I have tried everything - even the spoonful of vinegar. That was horrible - I refused to do it again. ‘I've tried drinking backwards, holding my breath and people at school have been trying to scare me a lot.’ The . hiccups - an involuntary contraction of the diaphragm -become minimal . when Emily is in a deep sleep, but return at full force as soon as she . enters a lighter sleep. Exhausted: Emily has been given afternoons off school as her condition leaves her so tired . She is currently being treated with two drugs - domperidone, an anti-nausea medicine, and omeprazole, used to treat gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Cathy added: ‘Absolutely nothing has worked. We have tried hypnotherapy and osteopathy but we are now completely running out of ideas. ‘She's just got to the stage where she's just fed up and wants them to go. I can understand - if you have hiccups for 10-15 minutes it's horrible. ‘We believe that someone somewhere must be able to help or come up with a solution.’She said Emily had never had health problems . Dr Ritu Handa the paediatric consultant looking after Emily at Queen Mary's Children Hospital at St Helier Hospital, said they had tried a string of tests on Emily including an MRI scan, blood tests and extensive assessments of her stomach. Hiccups that last more than 48 hours can be categorised into: . - Persistent or protracted hiccups - a bout of hiccups that lasts for more than 48 hours . - Intractable hiccups - a bout of hiccups that lasts longer than a month . Hiccups are common and most people will get them at some point during their life. They can affect people of any age, including babies. Men and women are equally affected by episodes of short-lived hiccups. However, for reasons that are unclear, persistent and intractable hiccups are more common in men. Intractable hiccups are more common in adults. These types of hiccups can be tiring and upsetting, and can make eating and drinking difficult. Persistent and intractable hiccups are rare and usually caused by another underlying health condition. In 80% of cases of persistent or intractable hiccups, a cause can be identified. The remaining 20% of cases usually have a psychological cause. Most hiccups will pass quickly and usually only last a few minutes. Treatment is not usually required. However, in cases of persistent or intractable hiccups that last longer than 48 hours, further investigations are needed to identify the cause and appropriate treatment. As well as treatment for underlying conditions, there are also self-help techniques that may help some people to stop common types of hiccups. www.nhs.uk . However, all the tests have proved inconclusive. Other medical problems have been known to cause chronic hiccuping, but doctors have so far been unable to find anything wrong with Emily and have ruled out serious medical conditions. Dr Handa said: ‘This condition is very rare and it is frustrating for Emily and her family. We are doing everything we can, working with our colleagues and closely with the family, to try and find an answer to this young girl's hiccups.’ Cathy said the problem was medication known to have worked on adults cannot be used on Emily because it is not suitable for children. One drug she has already tried - Haloperidol - left her ill in hospital for a week. Cathy said a young American girl had created a 'hiccupop' which she believes will stop hiccups as it worked for her but it had yet to be released for public sale. She praised St Helier Hospital, Stanley Park High School and the Chiltern Health Centre who are all providing help to the youngster. Other cases of people to have had chronic hiccuping include an American man, Charles Osborne, who is in the Guinness Book of World Records after having hiccups for 68 years from 1922 to 1990 - when they mysteriously stopped. In 2010 a musician resorted to brain surgery after hiccuping an estimated 20million times over several years. Chris Sands, 26, from Timberland, Lincolnshire, suffered his first hiccuping attack in September 2006. It halted after a fortnight, then returned in February 2007, becoming as frequent as every two seconds, 24 hours a day. The normal remedies all failed, including hundreds of different ways of drinking water and eating a teaspoon of peanut butter, medical schemes including an oxygen chamber and alternative therapies such as yoga and hypnotherapy. Finally he appealed for help on the internet and was flown by a Japanese TV station to see a Tokyo hiccup specialist who found a tumour the size of a Malteser on his brain stem. Following an operation to remove it, Mr Sands believed he was cured but as a result of the dangerous operation suffered numbness down his left side and now has difficulty with co-ordination which he was warned could last for years.","Emily Marsh has hiccuped every two seconds for ten weeks .

This is the moment a veterinary dentist had to get up close and personal with a fully grown brown bear in an attempt to clean his teeth. Marc Losse treated 20 year old brown bear Siggi at the Four Paws animal welfare project Baerenwald in Muritz, Germany. Siggi had to be placed under general anaesthetic while a team of expert vets and dentists worked to ensure that his teeth were treated. Ferocious: Dentist Marc Losse treated the teeth of 20-year-old brown bear Siggi at the Four Paws saunctuary in Muritz . Restrained: The 20-year-old bear had his teeth cleaned following his rescue by the sanctuary . The bear was rescued with his son Balou, 10, in September of last year, and has been cared for by the sanctuary ever since. The bears were taken from wildlife park Hellenthal, which is reportedly known for poor keeping standards for bears, where they had the limited space of just 150square metres to roam. In contrast, Baerenwald, which means bear forest, is now the biggest bear park in Western Europe with 16 hectares of space for their bears. The woodland features a creek and several ponds, which the bears enjoy bathing and playing in. Rescued: Siggi was rescued with his 10 year old son Balou from a different wildlife centre . Treatment: Four Paws say that bears in Germany need better care than is being provided for them by zoos and the government . The transfer was organised by the . Four Paws team, including Dr Goritz, a vet from the Berlin Institute of . Zoo and Wildlife research. The two fully grown male bears struggled at their previous home, often becoming involved in violent conflicts. Siggi, despite being the elder of the two, is far smaller, and suffered at the hands of his more aggressive son. At the Four Paws sanctuary, which opened in 2006, both bears will have room to retreat and mark their individual territory without encroaching on the other. Dentist: The team worked while the bear was under general anaesthetic to ensure that Siggi's teeth were well cared for . Four Paws say that there are still 20 . bears living in inadequate conditions in Germany and blame what they . believe is the country’s efficient legal regulation of keeping standards . for bears. They are now lobbying for improved conditions and are offering assistance to zoos that attempt to change the way they care for their bears. Four Paws is an international welfare charity campaigning for a ‘world where humans treat animals with respect, empathy and understanding’. They care for animals including bears, lions, stray dogs and cats. They are funded through donations and supporters alone.","Dentist Marc Losse cleaned 20-year-old brown bear Siggi's teeth .

Loss: Lauren (left) and Louise Beal (right), pictured with family dog Monty, lost their other dog Bruno after he contracted an infection in the New Forest . Dog walkers are being warned to stay away from a popular beauty spot after fears at least 11 pets have been killed by poison. A toxin in the earth or water has been picked up by the animals as they are exercised in the New Forest, it is feared. Vets say the dogs have been poisoned through small cuts in their legs or paws – and then their kidneys have failed. Eleven dogs are known to have died in recent months after being exercised at Latchmore Brook in Hampshire. But there are fears there could be more cases if pets belonging to tourists or visitors have been taken home before the symptoms have been detected. The area was used to test bombs during the Second World War, raising fears that experiments involving deadly chemicals may be to blame. It is also thought the water or soil-borne  poison has been disturbed by heavy rain at the beauty spot. Louise Beal lost her springer spaniel Bruno a week after he cut his paw during a walk at the spot. She treated the wound with disinfectant and took him to the vet two days later where he was given antibiotics, but his condition deteriorated rapidly. He was hooked up to a drip and seen by renal specialists, but all efforts to save him failed. Mrs Beal said: ‘The vet thinks it’s an unidentified toxin that has worked its way up through disturbed soil, a bit like anthrax. 'We just want to save other people having to go through this – it’s been the most awful week.’ All together: Lauren (left) and Louise Beal (right) with their dogs, Bruno (left) and Monty. Bruno died after contracting an infection in the New Forest . Location: Vets have warned toxin at Latchmore Brook in the New Forest, enters its victims' bloodstream and caused kidney failure . Fatal: Bruno died a week after he suffered a cut paw during a walk at the spot . Mrs Beal, from North Gorley, Hampshire, added: ‘I’m worried that the weather will warm up and small children will be playing up at the site. 'I dread to think what will happen if this affects humans too.’ Tracey Matherick, 45, from Chard, Somerset, was one of the first owners to see her dog fall victim to the toxin. One of her six Siberian huskies came home from a walk in the New Forest with a sore paw. ‘Both my husband and I didn’t think anything of it at first,’ she said. ‘Two days later her whole paw and leg had swollen up. Mrs Matherick, a school dinner lady, took Boo to the vet where she had ‘treatment after treatment’. After tests showed kidney and liver failure, she had to put the dog down. Yesterday local vet Nikki Bentley warned dog owners to avoid Latchmore Brook. She said: ‘Some areas are not safe. Hundreds of people walk their dogs in the forest every day because of its natural beauty, but they shouldn’t take the risk.’ Victim: Tracey Matherick's dog Boo was one of the first pets to die because of the toxins . Infected: Boo's paw became affected by the toxins after she was taken for a walk in the area . Happier times: Boo, Mrs Matherick and Anya, Boo's mother, enjoying themselves by the sea a year ago . Tissue samples from the dead pets have been sent to a US laboratory which specialises in renal problems in dogs, but the results could take weeks to arrive. The deaths are also being investigated by the Forestry Commission, the Environment Agency and New Forest District Council. Anyone who does visit the area is advised to wash their dogs’ paws, examine them thoroughly and seek help if there are signs of injury. Latchmore Brook formed part of Ashley Walk Bombing Range from 1940 to 1946. More than 2,000 hectares were used as a test and practice range for different Second World War munitions.

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 13:08 EST, 26 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:48 EST, 26 April 2013 . A council worker who was found with 352 computer discs containing terrorist material, including footage of executions and the 9/11 attacks, was today jailed for two years. London Borough of Hackney revenue officer Khalid Baqa, 48, also used his work computer to watch the footage and trawl Islamic websites. He stashed the discs - which contained 26 hours of speeches by the hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki - in his car and his children’s bedroom. The disks contained documents written by hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki (pictured) who was killed in 2011 . Terrorist: Al-Awlaki was born in the U.S. and spend much of his life living in America . One . disk was found inside a laptop provided for him by the council, where . he worked for 22 years before being sacked after his . arrest.. Baqa, who work . colleagues said underwent a transformation in 1996 by growing a long . beard, wearing traditional Muslim dress and shunning everyone, said he . was storing the discs for someone else. London’s . Old Bailey today heard the material contained footage of beheadings and . executions, the explosions of improvised explosive devices, the last . will and testament of one of the London bombers, footage of the 9/11 . attacks and jihadi fighters in combat. Sentencing . Baqa, from Barking, east London, Judge Christopher Moss QC said: ‘It is . quite clear to me - and you accept - that you well knew the generality . of what these discs contained, namely encouragement of, and indeed . instruction in, violent acts of terrorism. ‘It is from such material that those . who are already radicalised or about to become so derive their . knowledge, instruction and involvement in the ways of violent terrorism. ‘That is why it is so dangerous and that is why the courts must deal with it so severely.’ The father-of-six had pleaded guilty to two offences of disseminating terrorist publications earlier this month. A further seven offences of having material likely to be useful in terrorism were ordered to lie on file. His activities will be monitored for ten years and his stash is to be destroyed. The . discs also included five issues of al Qaida’s Inspire magazine, 39 Ways . to Support and Participate in Jihad and 44 Ways to Support Jihad, by . al-Awlaki, the leader of al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and who was . killed by an American drone in September 2011. Baqa’s home was raided by police in the early hours of July 5 last year. Mark Dennis QC, prosecuting, said the recovered discs were entitled Awakening and Pure Intentions. Baqa’s basis of plea was that he did not intend to distribute the discs but acknowledged that by giving them back to their owner, the messages of hate would be passed on and potentially radicalise Muslims. Khalid Baqa, who worked for Hackney Council, was sentenced to two years at the Old bailey (pictured) after he was found with hundreds of disks of terrorist material . The contents also showed how to plan and implement attacks. It is not known who made and copied the discs, which were also found at Baqa’s work. Investigations showed that Baqa, who was born in Lahore, Pakistan, had viewed them on a work laptop and used an office computer to make 'frequent' visits to extremist websites. Police searching his house also discovered a number of extremist books such as Virtues of Jihad, and a sweep of his car located bandanas, flags and material bearing the message: 'There is only one God, Muhammad.' Mr Dennis said all the materials 'It was in effect a library of material relating to the promotion of extremist Islamic beliefs and violent jihad. It demonstrated a complete intolerance of other religious views.' Baqa, the son of an English professor, came to the UK when he was two-years-old and holds both British and Pakistani passports. The al Qaeda magazine Inspire (above) was included in the disks . He has four children with his first wife who died in a car crash in 2007, and two more children with his second wife. The prosecutor said Baqa’s work colleagues noticed a big change in him around 1996. 'In work appraisals he was noted as somebody who kept himself to himself at all times and who didn’t engage others unless absolutely necessary,' said Mr Dennis. 'His manager said he would sit in a corner creating a physical barrier between him and everyone else. 'His work performance was assessed as average. 'In 1996/7 he grew a beard and started wearing traditional Muslim dress, became reclusive and wouldn’t speak to anybody in the office. 'He developed a deep faith in Islamic religion and promotion of it.' Andrew Hall QC, defending, said much of the material was available freely on the internet. He said Baqa, who remarried after his first wife was killed in a car crash in 2007, gave much of his earnings to charity before he lost his job. ‘But for his involvement in religious matters and then being drawn into politics in the way we’ve heard described his life would be praiseworthy indeed.’ His previous convictions date back to the 1980s and include theft, fraud and handling stolen goods. He also received a short jail term in 1986 for unlawful assembly.","Khalid Baqa was found with 352 computer disks of terrorist material .

Two weeks earlier, Charlie Astrand's father had proudly walked her up the aisle at her £20,000 wedding to one of his employees. Less happily, he was at the airport to greet her when she returned from honeymoon – and announce that her husband had stolen £18,500 from the family business. Graham Astrand, 53, who employed Huw Jones as a sales executive at his car dealership, made the shocking discovery of betrayal shortly after the couple's departure to the Caribbean. Perfect wedding: Charlie Astrand, 25, with her new husband Huw Jones, . 31, on their wedding day. Charlie's father Graham is pictured left, and . her mother Alison is right. But when she returned from honeymoon, the primary school teacher's dream turned into a nightmare . Yesterday Miss Astrand, 25, said her 'world came crashing in' when she learned that the man she had married was a fraud. She and 31-year-old Jones had been away for only two days when Mr Astrand discovered his new son-in-law had fiddled the books. He went to the police but was advised to let the couple finish their honeymoon before confronting his employee. After paying for the white wedding and . contributing towards the two-week honeymoon on the island of Aruba, Mr . Astrand waited at the airport arrivals lounge armed with proof of . Jones's crimes. Miss Astrand, whose marriage collapsed at that point, . said: 'It was the worst moment of my life – I had just had the most . blissful honeymoon with the man I loved. 'But then everything was shattered. My world came crashing in on me. 'I saw my dad waiting to pick me up – . he gave me the biggest hug I've ever had. But Huw's family were there . too and they just sort of whisked him away without a word. Anguish: Charlie, 25, with her father Graham who broke the news to her that her new husband had been stealing from the family home as he drove her back from the airport . 'I asked my dad what was wrong and he just said, “Come to the car”.' Miss Astrand was shown the paperwork . which proved her new husband had helped himself to the cash from the . family firm in Aberdare, South Wales. She continued: 'I had a panic attack . in the car – I couldn't take in what was happening. In the four years I . had known him there was not the slightest clue anything was wrong. 'We lived together for two years and he was loving, caring and romantic, always spoiling me with presents and treats. 'My family thought the world of him – he was hard-working and committed to building a happy home and future for us.' The post-honeymoon drama was revealed . at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court when Jones, the son of a policeman, . admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft but was spared jail. Picture perfect: Charlie's parents paid £20,000 for her wedding and contributed towards their two-week luxury honeymoon on the Caribbean island of Aruba . Wedding joy: Charlie, right, had no idea that Huw Jones was defrauding her father's company during her four-year relationship - until the news was broken to her after her honeymoon . His secret: Huw kept the deception from his new bride Charlie but has now admitted 24 charges of fraud, forgery and theft . Mr Astrand and his wife Alison were in court to hear how £18,478 'fell through the gaps' of the company accounting system. Prosecutor Heath Edwards said: 'Jones . had forged signatures, manipulated the accounts and sweetened deals. He . forged documents and upped the amount of money in loan applications, . unbeknown to customers. 'He did it to impress his fiancée and her family – and to up his sales figures for commission.' The court heard Jones cunningly hid . his dodgy dealings during his two-year engagement to his boss's . daughter, leading up to their marriage in July 2010. Mr Edwards said: 'Mr Astrand was waiting at the airport to confront his new son-in-law when he stepped off the plane.' Laurence Jones, defending, said: . 'Jones had taken on responsibilities he could not cope with in an . overwhelming desire to impress his future father-in-law.' He added that Jones had 'learned a . very long, hard salutary lesson and is remorseful for his actions'. Judge Dan Williams gave Jones a nine-month suspended jail sentence, . telling him: 'I have given you a chance even though I am not convinced . you deserve it. Please don't blow it.' Joy that didn't last: Charlie, left, has now got a new boyfriend while Huw has remarried and become a father . Family delight: Charlie, 25, with her parents Graham and Alison on her wedding day in 2010. Days later Graham discovered Charlie's husband, and his employee, had been carrying out a deception . Con: When this picture was taken Huw Jones' deception was still a secret - but it unravelled days later . Jones was also ordered to carry out 250 hours unpaid work and complete a 'thinking skills programme'. Afterwards Miss Astrand said: 'I was . in tears again when I found out he was not going to jail. That would . have been the right sentence for what he did to me and my family. 'I was terribly hurt and it's taken me two years to get over it.' Jones remarried last month after becoming a father six months ago. His ex-wife, who has started a new . relationship with accountant Chris Henneman, said of her former husband: . 'He has lived a happy life for the past two-and-a-half years – he's met . someone new, got married and even has a child. He still hasn't paid a . price for everything he did. Every day we have to deal with it. 'We really thought he would go to . prison and that would be the end of it. But I feel like he's had no . punishment for the pain and hurt he's caused me and my family.' She added: 'I have a very happy life with Chris, and it's because of him I am where I am today – he's been my rock.' Mr Astrand said of the sentence: 'I . wanted justice for Charlie and for our customers but he was let off with . a suspended sentence. That is a disgrace. He deserved to spend time . behind bars for what he had done.' Wedding day joy: Charlie, 25, and Huw, 31, who subsequently divorced and both have new partners .

"By . Rob Cooper and Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 07:01 EST, 16 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:53 EST, 16 April 2013 . Victim: Catherine Wells-Burr, 23, was allegedly murdered by her Polish boyfriend as she slept in their home in Chard, Somerset . A Polish factory worker murdered his British girlfriend and burned her body in a plot with his lover and her uncle to claim a six-figure insurance payout, a court heard yesterday. Rafal Nowak, 31, killed business analyst Catherine Wells-Burr while she slept, a jury was told. His mistress Anna Lagwinowicz and her uncle, Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, both Polish, helped to dispose of her body, it is alleged. Dmytryszyn drove the corpse to a field and it was set on fire using petrol, the court heard. Miss Wells-Burr, 23, was said to have been looking forward to a future with Nowak after they bought a house together, with Aviva insurance cover on their mortgage. The trio are accused of murdering her so Nowak could gain ownership of the property and cash in the £123,000 policy. Prosecutors say they planted fake messages suggesting their victim was having an affair with a 'mystery man' who they hoped would be blamed for her death. The group are said to have burned Miss Wells-Burr's body in her red Ford Focus early in the morning to allow Nowak to get to work and have an alibi. Prosecutor Richard Smith QC said Miss Wells-Burr was probably suffocated in bed for her new-build 'smart' home in Chard, Somerset – and simply to get rid of her. Mr Smith said: 'She thought that, in Nowak, she had a caring partner to share the new house with . . . How very sadly wrong she was.' He said Lagwinowicz had a 'fatal attraction' to Nowak and 'absolutely despised' the dead woman. The jury was told Nowak and Lagwinowicz struck up a relationship after he moved from Poland in 2008, leaving behind his wife and child. But in 2010 he met Miss Wells-Burr . when she worked at a factory in her university summer break, and is said . to have two-timed both women before leaving Lagwinowicz. Mr Smith said: . 'Lagwinowicz was bitterly jealous and bitterly spiteful.' Miss Wells-Burr and Nowak moved in . together after she graduated from Bath Spa university. She became a . business analyst for Numatic International – maker of Henry vacuum . cleaners – where Nowak, her parents and sister were also employed. Nowak is said to have then begun an affair with Lagwinowicz and hatched a plan to kill his girlfriend. Mr Smith said: 'They were going to get rid of Catherine from the love triangle and make money out of it.' Couple: Rafal Nowak and business analyst Catherine Wells-Burr got together after he moved to England in 2008 from Poland, leaving his wife and child behind . Mr Smith told Bristol Crown Court: . 'The defendants tried to create a false trail intended to raise . suspicion that Catherine was seeing, meeting with, perhaps having an . affair with some unknown mystery man. 'They bought SIM cards and bought telephones to create the false exchanges,' he said.

In a blow for Chancellor George Osborne financial markets have predicted Britain is heading for a triple dip recession . Britain is on the brink of a triple-dip recession, experts warn as latest figures reveal industrial output has now fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. In a week when chancellor George Osborne put yet another squeeze on the hard working middle-classes, figures for October revealed manufacturing production dropped by 1.3 per cent  - more than two per cent down on this time last year. Markets had been optimistic that October would have seen a rise in industrial production but figures from the office for national statistics revealed it had fallen by 0.8 per cent. This was partly caused by a fall in . North Sea production of gas and oil, which has dropped by almost 50 per . cent in the past three years. Forecasts prepared by the Office for . Budget Responsibility see the economy continuing to shrink for the final . three months of 2012 before growth resumes early 2013, picking up . steadily throughout the course of the year. But the OBR has, in the past, been . accused of being over-optimistic in its predictions and many economists . question whether their figures would be met. Some are calling this recession the . worst yet - and while not as deep as those experienced in the 1920s and . 1930s, recovery has been considerably slower. Yesterday David Cameron declared that . Britain must be more like Germany and develop a more modern workforce . after companies complained of a lack of newly trained engineers. Optimists have pointed to a strong . start to the Christmas shopping season and progress being made in Europe . to tackle the sovereign debt crisis. The wider measure of industrial . production fell 0.8 per cent, reflecting a record fall in oil extraction . although this was partly due to maintenance on North Sea rigs. Making do: The fall in factory output was far worse than had been expected.

The ONS noted ‘a shift in the pattern of the UK’s trade’ – with . exporters becoming far less reliant on the troubled eurozone for . business. Markit chief economist Chris . Williamson said: 'Judging by the official data that we have seen for the . fourth quarter so far, notably retail sales, trade and industrial . production, the UK will struggle to avoid a renewed downturn in the . economy after the brief return to growth seen in the third quarter.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 21:10 EST, 25 February 2013 . Two years after a teenage girl died in an bull riding accident in Brandon, Florida, her father is suing the rodeo for negligence. Brooke Ann Coats, 16, was thrown off the animal during the amateur event at Crosstown Arena on February 18, 2011. The bull kicked her in the chest and the keen rider died just 90 minutes later. Now Keith Coats has filed a suit against 18 defendants involved with the rodeo, including Corey Costa and his company, Remington Rough Stock Inc, who ran the events. Tragic: Brooke Coats, 16, died at an amateur bull riding event in Florida two years ago. Now her family is suing the rodeo for negligence . Keith and his wife Susan allege that Costa allowed their daughter to ride an 'aggressive bull above her skill level,' of failing to provide emergency . personnel at the arena, and of waiting at least 15 to 20 minutes to call an . ambulance after the teenager was kicked. Coats had been bull riding for about a year as a hobby. Her parents were in the stand on the night the tragic accident happened and had signed a waiver allowing the pretty teenager to take part in the event. The 16-year-old managed to stand up and . walk out of the ring after sustaining the massive chest blow, but she . began complaining of breathing difficulties and later collapsed. Miss Coats was rushed to Tampa General Hospital, where she died later in surgery. According to the lawsuit, medics determined the kick had lacerated her liver and she bled to death internally. According to 10 News the rodeo has been shut for sometime and the arena is now for sale. Risk: A video posted on YouTube and since removed showed Coats taking part in a different rodeo in January 2011 . 'Cowgirl': Coats was a keen bull rider and had been taking part in amateur rodeo for a year before her death . As noted by the Herald Tribune, the Coats family filed the suit in in Hillsborough County civil court on February 18 - exactly two years to the day of their daughter's death. The statute of limitations for wrongful death suits in Florida is two years. Family attorney, Patton Youngblood, told the station that Brooke's parents were devastated, adding 'The family knows that the people there that night did not act quickly.' 'This is something the family will never get over. How can they?' added the attorney. Another mother, who has been to the arena, told 10 News she was upset by the tragic incident. 'That girl may have survived if the . ambulance had been there, and it didn't take 10 minutes to get there. So, there was a delay in calling,' said Donna Maggiacomo. Costa has refused to speak to the media since the suit was filed. Authorities said Miss Coats was wearing a protective vest and helmet when she was tossed from the bull. In 2011, Costa called Coats' death a 'freak accident.' According to the Tampa Bay Times he noted that the girl had ridden the same bull - a 900-pound, calf - about 30 times. Tribute: Friends said goodbye to Brooke Coats at the scene of the accident . Shocked schoolfriends placed floral tributes outside the rodeo after learning of their classmate's death. Adrian Guzman, who had known Miss Coats since middle school, said: 'I know that bull riding was one of her really important hobbies. 'She really liked that stuff. She was really quiet and really shy, but she was a beautiful girl. She will be missed.' Others posted messages on a Facebook page set up in memory of Miss Coats. One wrote: 'RIP Cowgirl'. And her swimming coach, Nancy MacLauchlan, told CF News 13: 'Brooke was a beautiful young woman inside and out. She swam, played tennis, and had a great sense of adventure, and was a devoted friend. 'No matter what event we asked her to swim, she would put that incredible smile on her face and go out and do it. She never complained at practice, just gave us her every single day. We will miss her terribly.' Bull riding has been described as the 'most dangerous sport in America'. Riders have to stay on a bucking bull for eight seconds. The rider does not have a saddle but holds on to a braided rope with one hand.

Broadcasters claimed they had been forced to conduct interviews with David Cameron in front of a giant billboard obscuring the palm-fringed beach outside the window. The row came amid concern among the Prime Minister’s aides that the plush venue chosen for the G20, by the Mexican hosts, sits awkwardly with the austerity message emerging from the meeting.

Cover-up: The sun-kissed backdrop was obscured for interviews with the PM by a billboard in this tweeted picture from the BBC's Nick Robinson . Mr Cameron’s advisers are also sensitive to recent claims about his fondness for ‘chillaxing’ The Prime Minister recorded a series of clips with UK broadcasters at Las Ventanas Al Paraiso, in Los Cabos, a luxury beach resort situated between San Jose Del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas. It was where the B20 - a business offshoot of the G20 - was meeting. BBC political editor Nick Robinson posted a picture of the view from the room on Twitter, writing: ‘What spin doctors do.

A Downing Street source said: ‘He recorded the clip in a room provided by the B20. It’s not surprising that we want a B20 backdrop in a room provided by them.’ The PM had earlier this year been embarrassed by claims in a new biography that he spends a significant amount of time 'chillaxing' (a slang term merging the words chilling and relaxing) rather than grappling with the global economic turmoil. The biography painted a picture in which Mr Cameron devoted time on weekends at Chequers to singing karaoke, playing tennis against a machine dubbed ‘The Clegger’ and downing several glasses of wine with lunch. One ally told the book’s authors: ‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for “chillaxing”, the Prime Minister would win it.’ A Downing Street adviser even claimed that Mr Cameron ‘spends a crazy, scary amount of time playing Fruit Ninja’, a computer game which requires players to slash fast-moving fruit in half with a cartoon sword. Extracts from the book were publicised before a crucial G8 summit of the leaders of the world's most powerful nations where the PM was later to be pictured taking time off trying to find a solution to the deepening Euro crisis to watch Chelsea take on Bayern Munich in the Champion League final. The cheers and the tears: Prime Minister David . Cameron (fourth left) was pictured during a G8 summit of world leaders taking time out to watch Chelsea beat Bayern . Munich in the Champions League . Friends of Mr Cameron had also told how he enjoyed drinking ‘three or four glasses of wine’ over lunch at the weekend.

It is the inspiration behind an iconic fantasy castle which has enchanted children and adults across the world for decades. And now a stunning French palace said to have helped inspire the creation of Walt Disney's magical Cinderella Castle could be all yours - it's up for sale for £18million. With its lavish art noveau interior and decked out in head to toe with Pyrenean marble, the Chateau d'Aubiry really is a fairy-tale home and is attracting the attention of billionaire moguls and Euromillions lottery winners. But the beautiful 19th century masterpiece looks nothing like Disney's interpretation of a castle fit for a princess. Fairy tale home: The Chateau d'Aubiry, said to have been one of the inspirations behind Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle, is up for sale for £18million . Inspiration: The chateau, pictured left, is said to be one of a number of castles that inspired Walt Disney's iconic castle, right . The chateau, located on the Les Aspres mountain chain in the Pyrenees close to the town of Perpignan, boasts 15 bedrooms, a chapel, vineyards, a wine cellar and more than 12 acres of sprawling yet immaculately kept gardens. The 26,910 square foot property, which was built by former baker and cigarette paper inventor Jean Bardou, is on the market with Zenith Sotheby's and is said to have attracted quite a stir among interested parties. A source at the prestigious estate agent said: 'The fabulous home has superb panoramic views facing south and is protected by the mountains from the infamous tramontane winds. 'It is all lavishly decorated in the style art nouveau and has all the luxurious features that anyone could dream of. 'There has been plenty of interested parties who have expressed an interest - it really is a once in a lifetime chance to own such a property.' Stunning: The chateau is decked out with Pyrenean marble throughout and beautiful works of art . Has potential: As well as the main building, the chateau has a number of outbuildings in its grounds, some of which would need some work . Ostentatious: The beautiful interior of the chateau features some stunning art and frescoes painted by a pair of Parisian artists . The impressive chateau has its own billiard room, music room, library and scullery and some of the bedrooms are themed, including a Chinese room decorated in honour of the last emperor of Indo China Bao Dai. Designed by highly regarded Danish architect Vigo Dorph Peterson, the property was commissioned in 1894 and work was finaly completed in 1900. The beautiful frescoes throughout the castle were painted by Parisian artists Gervais and Henry Perrault. The stunning grounds of Chateau d'Aubiry feature a winding river, a swimming pool, water features and a Japanese bridge. It is said to be one of several real and fictional castles that inspired Walt Disney's Cinderella Castle - still the flagship attraction at Disney World in the US and Tokyo DisneyLand in Japan.

Outbuildings: The castle even has its own chapel with building work completed on the building in 1912 . Dream home: The impressive chateau has its own billiard room, music room, library and scullery . As well as Chateau d'Aubiry, other fairy tale properties including Fontainebleau in Versailles, the Chateaux of Cheronceau, Pierrefonds, Chambord and Chaumont, Bavaria's Castle Neuschwanstein, Moszna in Poland, and Craigievar Castle in Aberdeen are said to have inspired Disney's creation. Disney World's version of the castle was completed in July 1971 after 18 months of construction work. It had originally been designed with rooms for Walt Disney and his family to stay in when they visited Florida, but the animator died from lung cancer in 1966. Grand: Craigievar Castle in Aberdeen, left, and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, right, are among the other castles thought to have inspired the Disney castle . The rooms were left unfinished for more than three decades, and have now been turned into an exclusive 'money can't buy' hotel suite. The fantasy castle itself, designed by Herbert Ryman, is 190ft tall and is surrounded by a 6ft deep moat. An optical trick known as forced perspective makes the castle appear bigger than it really is. The Tokyo version of the castle is a carbon copy of the US one.

Mrs Martin, 90, and Les Hogan, 92, enjoyed bike rides and trips to the cinema as teenagers after meeting at a youth club. But their blossoming romance was cut short by the outbreak of WWII and they lost contact when Mrs Martin left Kent to join the Women's Royal Navy Service in 1943. Beryl Martin and Les Hogan were reunited on Monday at Holy Trinity Church Fellowship, Sheerness, where they reminisced about the old days . As a treat for her 90th birthday, Mrs Martin's daughter Ruth Reeves, 66, took her back to visit Sheerness, Kent, where she grew up, last week. The great-grandmother-of-five was stunned when she spotted a CD called 'Songs of Sheppey' by her first love - 'Les Hogan'. Mrs Martin recognised the name as she browsed gifts in the Blue Town Heritage Centre on April 23 but could not put her finger on why. But the penny only dropped two days later when the grandmother-of-four saw the familiar name again on a book of poetry in Minster Abbey, Kent, called 'Beyond the Skies.' Curious Mrs Martin then tracked her former sweetheart down through his book publisher. The couple were reunited on Monday at Holy Trinity Church Fellowship, Sheerness, where they reminisced about the old days. Mr Hogan, 92, from Minster, Kent, said: 'It was just incredible to see an old friend again after such a long time. 'I thought it was very interesting because not many people make 90. Most of my friends have already taken off. Beryl Martin (then Beryl Tubb) is pictured, left, in the Women's Royal Navy Service which she joined in 1943 .

'I was a member of Trinity Church and the vicar said I must join the youth club, so I did and that is where I met Beryl. 'I took her to the pictures a few times. We were good friends.' Mrs Martin said: 'I spent four days looking at faces to see if I recognised anyone so it was lovely, just as we were leaving, to meet up with an old friend.

She added: 'It was good and very interesting to see so much of the island because when I was there young people couldn't afford the bus fares or weren't allowed to walk too far from home so we hardly knew anywhere apart from the area we lived in. 'It brought back so many memories.' Mrs Martin's daughter Mrs Reeves, from Worcester, yesterday said: 'My mother procrastinated, but just as we were about to leave she said I should phone the number.

Virgin Trains, owned by entrepreneur Richard Branson (pictured), has one of the worst records for punctuality according to today's figures . A third of trains are running late – rising to more than half among the worst performers - when judged against tougher Government-backed ‘real time’ punctuality targets, damning new figures reveal. More than half Virgin Trains and Cross Country services fail to arrive on time when allowed just  59 seconds leeway from the timetabled schedule  to qualify as being punctual. This strict ‘right time’ measures  contrasts with what ministers say is the more ‘dishonest’ measure favoured by the rail industry. This classes short-distance services as being ‘on time’ if they arrive within five minutes of the scheduled time. Long-distance services are officially on time if they arrive within 10 minutes. Nationally, under the stricter 59-second rule, nearly three out of ten trains (27.7 per cent) ran late with just over seven out of ten (72.3per cent) on time from April 1 to 27. More than four out of  ten (42 per cent) long-distance services were  late with only six out of ten (58per) cent on time in April. In London and south-east England more than a quarter of services (27.3 per cent) of services were late with nearly three-quarters (72.7%) on time. For regional services including Scotland a quarter (25.3 per cent)  were late with three quarters (74.7per cent) on time. Network Rail’s  59-second figures  also revealed punctuality for each train company for the 12-month period ending on April 27. Percentage of trains arriving within 59seconds: . Crosscountry                                 46.1 . Virgin Trains                                    48.9 . Southern                                       55.5 . First Scotrail                                    59.8 . East Coast                                     60.9 . London Midland                              62.3 . First Transpennine Express       63.8 . Southeastern                                  64.5 . South West Trains                        67.9 . First Capital Connect                      68.9 . Percentage of trains arriving within 59seconds: . London Overground                   86.8 . Chiltern                                          86.5 . Arriva Trains Wales                     85.5 . c2c Rail                                          84.5 . East Midlands Trains                  74.7 . Merseyrail                                      74.6 . Northern Rail                               72.2 . Greater Anglia                               71.6 . First Great Western                    69.3 . National average for all providers is 68.0% . Among individual rail companies the poorest-performer was CrossCountry, whose routes reach every part of Britain except London. More than half of CrossCountry's trains  (53.9 per cent) were late  with only 46.1per cent  on time over the 12 month period. It was followed by  Virgin Trains which had just 48.9per cent of trains on time, Southern (55.5per cent), First ScotRail (59.8per cent) and state-run East Coast (60.9per cent). Best-performing company was London Overground with nearly 9 out of ten services (86.8per cent) arriving within 59 seconds of timetable. When judged against the more liberal punctuality measures, Britain’s two main London to Scotland train companies – state-run East Coast and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Trains - were the poorest performers for punctuality last month, rail watchdogs revealed. One in seven (14.9 per cent)  of East Coast trains ran late with only 85.1per cent of trains on time in the period April 1-27 2013. West Coast line operator Virgin was only marginally better with a similar proportion (14 per cent)  of services running late and just 86.0per cent on time. On average only 68 per cent of trains arrive on time, leaving a third of passengers waiting . The national average  was for one in 14 trains running late (7 per cent) with 93.0per cent on time. Network Rail (NR) said East Coast punctuality had been affected by two overhead line incidents - near Potters Bar in Hertfordshire and at Grantham in Lincolnshire. Transport Minister Mr Baker said: 'It is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long-distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time. 'Taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this. That is why we have put  pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real-time performance  figures. ‘I am determined to see improvements on the level of transparency on the . railway and I am pleased that the industry is becoming more transparent . including the release of ‘right-time’ data, for which I have . consistently pushed. ‘This goes further than anything passengers . receive in Europe. Two out of three trains on the network are arriving . within 59 seconds of the stated arrival time and 93% are meeting . target. 'This is a strong performance given the growth in passenger . numbers. I wonder how many motorists could predict their journey time . within a minute?' A spokesman for the watchdog office of Rail Regulation said passengers ‘are experiencing a worse service than a year ago’, adding: ‘We are disappointed with Network Rail’s recent performance.’ The Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) said: ‘Punctuality is vitally important to passengers and train companies and that's why we will continue to work closely with the rest of the industry to drive improvements to services.’ The London Underground is the most punctual train provider in the country, with 86.8 per cent of its trains arriving within 59 seconds .","Third of trains late on average across the country .

Secondary schools should prepare children for adulthood by focusing on pornography, sex abuse and homosexuality, the schools watchdog has said. Too much time is being spent on the ‘mechanics’ of reproduction and not on ‘controversial issues’, according to Ofsted. Children are being left at risk of exploitation and inappropriate behaviour because they are learning about contraception, pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases but not ‘sexual content and the influence of pornography’. Secondary schools should do more to prepare children for adult life by focusing on pornography, sex abuse and homosexuality, according to Ofsted (file picture) Two-fifths of schools are failing to provide pupils with the information they need in personal, social, health and economic education classes, inspectors said in a report. The comments follow an announcement last week by the Sex Education Forum, which represents dozens of charities including the NSPCC, that PSHE lessons should be used to tell children ‘not all pornography is bad’. Ofsted’s report said: ‘In secondary schools... too much emphasis was placed on “the mechanics” of reproduction and too little on relationships, sexuality, the influence of pornography on students’ understanding of healthy sexual relationships, dealing with emotions and staying safe.’ It continued: ‘The failure to include discussion of pornography is concerning as research shows that children as young as nine are increasingly accessing pornographic internet sites.’ Children, it added, complained lessons steered clear of controversial topics such as sexual abuse, pornography and homosexuality. Primary schools were also criticised for placing ‘too much emphasis on friendships and relationships, leaving pupils ill-prepared for physical and emotional changes during puberty.’ Education Minister Elizabeth Truss confirmed in March that PSHE would not become compulsory . Secondary schools emphasised the 'mechanics' of reproduction too much, the report said . Fifty schools were inspected and 178 . young people questioned for the report, which said PSHE classes required . improvement or were inadequate in 40 per cent of schools. ‘Lack of high-quality, age-appropriate . sex and relationships education... is a concern as it may leave . children and young people vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours . and sexual exploitation,’ it added. ‘This . is because they have not been taught the appropriate language or . developed the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours or know where . to go for help.’ Education minister Elizabeth Truss confirmed in March that PSHE would not become a compulsory subject, saying schools and teachers should decide what subjects were covered in lessons. Norman Wells, of the Family Education Trust, yesterday accused Ofsted of assuming ‘sex education holds the answer to the sexual exploitation of young people’. He said: ‘Sex education that provides children with a menu of sexual options, tells them that there are no moral absolutes in the area of sexual expression, and presents contraceptive use as the mark of sexual responsibility is part of the problem, not the solution. ‘As for Ofsted’s advocacy of classroom discussions about pornography from an early age... it would introduce the concept of pornography to many children who had not encountered it before and arouse in some a curiosity to search out more pornographic material for themselves. ‘Most parents would far rather the government introduce an opt-in system to limit the risk of their children accessing sexual images online in the first place than add pornography to the school curriculum.’ The FPA, formerly the Family Planning Association, said sex education classes should be compulsory but called on parents to play a more active role in informing their children. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ‘Our curriculum reforms have given teachers the freedom to tailor their teaching so it meets the needs of their pupils.’","Ofsted said too much time is spent on subject of reproduction .

The figures fly in the face of claims from senior officers that the service is ‘more open than ever’. The survey was carried out after one force, Warwickshire, sparked outrage with a decision to wrap charging decisions in secrecy rules as a result of the Leveson Inquiry. The force announced the move in a footnote to a press release on Wednesday as it charged a former officer with the theft of £113,000 from police headquarters. MPs and free speech campaigners described it as an ‘extremely worrying’ precedent. Yesterday the force carried out an abrupt U-turn and identified the man as Paul Andrew Greaves, 54, from Carlton, Nottinghamshire. He had already been named by the Crown Prosecution Service. The senior police officer responsible for tightening the rules on how police interact with the media took to the airwaves to claim Warwickshire had ‘corrected’ its position and insisted ‘people who are charged will be named’. Chief Constable Andy Trotter, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, denied the case reflected a growing culture of secrecy. ‘We are more open than ever,’ he told Radio 4’s World At One. ‘We engage with the public via the traditional media and social media in a way we’ve never done before. 'What we are trying to encourage is an open and transparent relationship with the media, not one that has been characterised in the past by secret deals and sometimes, unfortunately, corruption, but one which is absolutely transparent.’ But a survey carried out by the Mail yesterday revealed the Acpo guidance is being ignored or defied. Fourteen forces said they did not name individuals on the day they laid criminal charges. Many said they would not give out a name until the day before the suspect appeared in court. Even then, many would only give a surname to allow the Press to identify the individual from the court list. This was the position adopted by Warwickshire on Wednesday night, when it said it would identify the man ahead of his court appearance later this month if journalists called up the day before. Yesterday the force was hit by a torrent of complaints and performed a U-turn. The force was criticised by its own deputy police and crime commissioner, Eric Wood, who said: ‘The commissioner is demanding a full and frank report on all of the circumstances that led to this decision, and we will be seeking assurances that in future all national guidelines are adhered to.’ On Wednesday night, after the story broke, Deputy Chief Constable Neil Brunton took to Twitter to defend the policy. He wrote: ‘The policy was recently changed to align with national policy post Leverson (sic) and not because of today’s outcome.’ It follows Lord Justice Leveson’s report . which called for a ban on the Press and public being told by the police . when someone has been arrested, except in exceptional circumstances . Yesterday the CPS said it would name anyone charged with a criminal offence on the day the charging decision was made, unless there were ‘exceptional circumstances’. Mr Trotter is drawing up draconian new rules that would ban forces from naming anyone who has been arrested, even by way of confirming a name a journalist already has. It follows Lord Justice Leveson’s report which called for a ban on the Press and public being told by the police when someone has been arrested, except in exceptional circumstances. It did not go as far as suggesting the ban should apply to suspects who have been charged. And the Government’s own legal adviser, the Law Commission, has said police should name the arrested party when journalists request an identity. In its statement, a Warwickshire Police spokesman said: ‘We will be adopting the national Acpo guidance in respect to naming individuals on charge. We apologise that our previous approach has not been consistent with this.’ Kirsty Hughes of Index on Censorship said: ‘That the police should withhold the name of a former officer who has not only been arrested but charged is of concern. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to preserve anonymity but a policy of secrecy reverses the principle of open justice that we have in the UK.’ Last night Greaves, who runs a financial investigation training company, said: ‘I have been told by my solicitor not to say anything about this. The whole thing has been so stressful for me and my family’.","14 out of 43 constabularies in England and Wales will not name individuals .

"By . Jaymi Mccann . PUBLISHED: . 12:14 EST, 3 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:16 EST, 3 May 2013 . PCSO Oguz Batmaz was sentenced to seven years after he tipped off his drug dealer friends . A PCSO who tipped off his drug dealing pals where cannabis factories were so they could steal the crop was today jailed for seven years. Cocaine dealing Oguz Batmaz, 27, known as Oz, passed on information he got from searching Scotland Yard databases so his gang had a plentiful supply of drugs. He also updated them on what the cops knew about the gang so they could avoid getting caught and he even helped a convict who escaped from prison stay on the run. Batmaz, who had worked for the Met since 2007, was topping up his £15,000 a year salary with an extra £1,000 a week dealing cocaine and cannabis on the side. He was sacked from the force after pleading guilty to drug dealing, conspiracy to steal and abusing his position last year. Sentencing him at Southwark Crown Court, Judge Andrew Goymer said: 'Oguz Batmaz you were a PCSO and by your own admission and your guilty pleas you misused and abused your of position of trust by accessing information on the computer when you had no good reason to. 'That, however, was not the end of it. You did not simply give family and friends information they were not entitled to, there was a continued and sustained misuse of information on that computer. It went beyond that. 'Your relationship with criminals can only be described as improper and corrupt. 'You gave them information on what the police knew about them and what addresses they had under suspicion. 'And you told them addresses where cannabis factories could be found so they could then steal them knowing the owners of such properties would not report the theft of illegal drugs. 'Your sideline to your legal employment was dealing in class A and class B drugs. 'It makes little difference, if any, that you were not a fully warranted police officer. Felipe Hession (left) and Batmaz's girlfriend Emma Tooke (right) were also sentenced at the court . Batmaz's cousin Ayhun Mustafa (left) received 14 months, while escaped convict Wayne Farrell got three years . 'The public are entitled to expect . the highest standards of service from a police officer. Anybody who . breaks this high standard will be properly punished.' Dressed in a smart grey suit, Batmaz . shouted: 'Stay stong, try and appeal it. It’s ridiculous' to his . distraught family as he was led down to the cells. Earlier his barrister James Hines . told the court he came from a ‘respectable and law-abiding Turkish . family’ and had good intentions when he joined the Met in 2003. But he claimed the Mottingham and . Chislehurst Safer Neighbourhood Team Office where Batmaz worked . encouraged idleness and was rife with gambling. He was also bullied for . being dyslexic. The court heard sergeants and senior officers at the Mottingham and Chiselhurst Safer Neighbourhood Team were dismissed after the investigation into Batmaz exposed their incredible gambling habits. ‘Much has been written about what went on in the pre-fabricated office where the team was based,’ said James Hines, defending Batmaz. ‘The ethos he ran into there did little to encourage his ambitions, or meet his hopes for the police force. Bags packed: PCSO Oguz Batmaz, (left) at Southwark Crown Court, passed on information from searching the police database to a criminal gang, while Kadr Ozresberoglu (right) was also sentenced to 40 months . In court: Batmaz conducted searches on names and addresses linked to the boyfriend of Emma Tooke (left), who was a crack cocaine dealer. His friend Kadir Ozresberoglu (right), a drug dealer, was caught on tape with the PCSO . Part of the gang: Lee Hession (left) and Anthony Noble (right) was sentenced alongside Batmaz at Southwark Crown Court . ‘Revelations that included sergeants . and senior officers there were engaging in backgammon, gambling on . backgammon, playing cards and spending very little time engaging in . police work. ‘Many of them have now been disciplined as a result of this particular surveillance. ‘The extent to which gambling went on . there was quite frankly shocking, with young officers becoming in debt . to senior officers.’ When he first illegally accessed . computers in the summer of 2007 Mr Hines said it was a ‘misguided . attempt to impress others and make him seem more important and . interesting than perhaps he was.’ Batmaz was later paid for information . by various criminal pals and even tipped them off with intelligence on . where ‘Gundawoody’ or cannabis factories were. In bugged recordings which trapped . him Batmaz is heard boasting he was doing other dealers a favour by . moving the drugs before police busted them. 'See the way I look at it I’m doing . these boys a favour....coming up on the system they’re obviously gonna . get raided at one point so I am just raiding them before they get . raided,' he said. Lee Hession (left) recieved 27 months and Kadir Ozresberoglu (right) was given 40 months in jail . The judge said that he had no choice but to give Anthony Noble (left) 18 months, while Aaron Eastwood (right) recieved 18 months . Referred to as their ‘copper friend,’ BMW-driving Batmaz even helped convict Wayne Farrell, who was serving a . six-year stretch for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine, stay on the . run after he escaped from prison. The court heard Batmaz conducted a . number of searches on names and addresses linked to Farrell while he . stayed with girlfriend Emma Tooke to avoid the pair getting caught. But by April 2010 the police were . aware of the PCSO’s activities and placed an entry about Farrell on the . database to see how Batmaz reacted. Three minutes later records show he . phoned Farrell to pass on the information. Two months before the gang were . arrested Batmaz is heard joking his flat might be bugged but said: 'If . there’s recorders in here we’d be f***ed a long time ago.' His drug dealer pal Kadir . Ozresberoglu then continues the joke saying: 'Yeah, they’re building one . up on us, building big one up on us.' The pair were arrested at Batmaz’s flat in New Eltham, south east London, in June 2010. Filipe De Frietas (left) and Aaron Eastwood (right) were also sentenced alongside Batmaz for their part in the crime . As they were raided Ozresberoglu . tried to throw cocaine out of the bedroom window while Batmaz appeared . to be in distress and was asking for water. Prosecutor David Durose said: 'The crown suggests that he had swallowed the packets of drugs that were already made up.' Drugs paraphernalia including scales, cannabis grinders and mixing agents were also found in the property. Eight of his gang were also sentenced for similar offences today. Filipe De Frietas, 26, was jailed for . two years, Ozresberoglu,26, for 40 months, Lee Hession, 30, for 27 . months while dad-of-five Aaron Eastwood, 32, was locked up for 18 . months. Batmaz’s cousin Ayhan Mustafa, 30, who played a minor role, was sentenced to 14 months behind bars. Southwark Crown Court heard that Batmaz had abused his position . Escaped convict Wayne Farrell, 35, . was jailed for three years and his girlfriend Emma Tooke, 33, who . admitted harbouring a criminal was sentenced to six months. The court heard Farrell has since abandoned her despite her going on the run with him for nine months.

The judge said although he had tried to turn his life around he had no choice but to jail him for 18 months.

A bodyguard who protected former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks has been charged with conspiracy perverting the course of justice, it was revealed today . David Johnson, 47, allegedly conspired to hide computers and other items from police investigating phone hacking and corrupt payments to public officials. The self-employed man, from Mitcham, Surrey, was told he will face court when he answered bail at a south London police station yesterday. It is alleged that Johnson conspired with six people, including Brooks and her husband Charlie, who have already been charged under Operation Sacha.

The Tuscan hamlet where Fergie was romanced by her Italian count has been shaken by the brutal murder of a young girl. The Duchess of York made the hilltop village of Castagneto Carducci her second home when she dated Italian millionaire Count Gaddo della Gherardesca in the 1990s. His family has presided over the small borgo since Dante’s time. Murder: The Tuscan hamlet where Fergie was romanced by her Italian count has been shaken by the brutal murder of a young girl . But the normally sleepy hamlet was yesterday in a state of shock after the discovery of the body of nineteen-year-old Ilaria Leone, in a secluded olive grove. The teen, who lived just a few miles down the road, was found half naked with her trousers and underwear pulled down. Police suspect ‘a crime of passion’. The teenager, who lived locally, appeared to have been strangled with the killer’s bare hands and her bruised body was covered with marks consistent with a sexual assault. Past: The Duchess of York made the hilltop village of Castagneto Carducci her second home when she dated Italian millionaire Count Gaddo della Gherardesca in the 1990s . The whole village is said to be ‘traumatised’ by the unprecedented violence. Fergie loved spending time on the count’s estate and was a frequent visitor to the castle at the borgo’s summit during their five year relationship. The out-of the-way hamlet, about 80 miles west of Siena, was also popular with the biggest stars of the day including Naomi Campbell and Elle McPherson. Fergie even hosted the nobleman’s annual Castagneto Day, one of the highlights of the Italian country set’s social calendar, an event which was attended by Gerard Depardieu and Catherine Deneuve. Celebrity haunt: The secluded hamlet, about 80 miles west of Siena, was also popular with the biggest stars of the day including Naomi Campbell, right, and Elle McPherson, left . Until they eventually called the relationship off in 2002, the couple divided their time between the village and his six-bedroom villa in an exclusive section of the Sardinian coast and were photographed passionately kissing on his £500,000 yacht. On their sojourns they were often accompanied by the young princesess and the Count’s daughter Constanza who is just a year older than Beatrice. The count always maintained they were no more than good friends, fuelling speculation that she would eventually remarry Andrew. Restaurants in the village stayed shut yesterday. One restaurant owner told an Italian newspaper: ‘After what has happened I don’t feel like I can work, let alone talk to customers.’ A shopkeeper told La Repubblica: ‘We leave our keys in our doors here, Nothing like this has ever happened before. Now we are frightened.’ Ilaria’s lifeless body was found by a builder on Thursday morning. It appeared to have been dragged into the olive grove. The 19-year-old, who lived four miles away, on the coast was last seen finishing work at 10pm on Wednesday evening. She had started work in a pizzeria in the hamlet just a few weeks ago. Her motorino, which she would normally have used traveling to work, was being mended. But on the night she died she mysteriously refused a lift from her brother, saying she would walk. And when friends rang her later that evening to ask her to join them in a local restaurant she said she was busy. She was passionate about animals and planned to become a cook like her mother. She was already popular with co-workers who described her as ‘sunny’, ‘always happy and smiling, innocent.’ Friends described her as ‘the best of all of us.’ Police are combing through phone records as they believe she was planning to meet the person who eventually killed her. She didn’t have a boyfriend, according to her friends. One theory is that she may have been killed after rejecting the sexual advances of her killer. An autopsy was due to take place today. A Senegalese man is being questioned in connection with the killing. His backpack and bicycle have been confiscated.","The body of nineteen-year-old Ilaria Leone found in a secluded olive grove .

A pensioner who couldn’t get an emergency dentist appointment for over a month was forced to pull out his own tooth with a pair of pliers. Angus Macintyre, 73, was forced to perform the procedure on himself after he was turned away from both NHS and private clinics. The retired teacher had been in agony for three months but heavy pain killers for arthritis had kept the pain at bay until it eventually it became unbearable. Pensioner Angus Macintyre, 73, was in so much pain that he took dental matters into his own hands . Last month Angus went to one NHS dental centre and contacted several private clinics in Leominster, Herefordshire, but was told he would have to wait to have the tooth removed. ‘My wife phoned several private dentists but they couldn’t fit us in or told us they weren’t licensed to perform extractions,’ he said. The former soldier pleaded with staff to extract the molar because he feared blood-thinning drugs he was on could cause complications if it became infected. Frustrated, Angus resorted to the DIY method and managed to pluck the tooth out in just 30 seconds. The offending molar (pictured) took less than half a minute to remove with a pair of pliers . He said: 'The pain had been containable for a while due to the strong pain killers, but after a while it became too much for the drugs to control. 'I went to the local NHS centre and was told I didn’t need an appointment after five - but that they didn’t perform extractions after that time either.' ‘I got so fed up that I decided to do it myself with a pair of pliers I bought recently . 'It was just a few moves inwards, then outwards, a few little cracks and clicks and then 30 seconds later it was out.’ And rather than being in excruciating pain after performing the procedure, he claims he felt fantastic:  ‘Once the tooth was out I felt like I was floating to the ground on a parachute of euphoria.’ Shortly after Mr Macintyre had pulled the tooth out, he tried to visit the dentist to ensure the wound wasn’t in danger of infection, but he was put off by the waiting time. ‘I went with the tooth and my hole to the clinic just to have it checked over and make sure everything was okay,’ he said. ‘But they told me the wait time was about four hours - so I just left. There have been no problems since, so I must have made a decent job of it.' MailOnline has approached NHS Herefordshire, who look after some but not all of the NHS emergency dental clinics in the area, for comment.","Angus Macintyre's tooth caused him agonising pain for three months .

Engleitner was born in Aigen-Voglhub, Austria, in 1905 but grew up in the city of Bad Ischl. He became a Jehovah's Witness in 1932 after studying the bible for many years and faced religious intolerance even before the war began. He was arrested in April 1939 with other Witnesses during a religious celebration, and four months later was transferred to Buchenwald concentration camp. Two years later, Engleitner was held at Niederhagen concentration camp in Wewelsburg, Germany. He was offered release if he agreed to renounce his beliefs, but he refused saying he lived by God's word. Instead, he was transferred to Ravensbruek. He weighed just 28 kilograms - about 60 pounds - on release from the Ravensbrueck camp in 1943 after he agreed to work as farm slave laborer. He was later ordered to report to Hitler's army, but Engleitner hid in the Tyrolean countryside until after the war ended. Engleitner was first sent to Buchenwald Concentration Camp (pictured in 1945) after he refused to renounce his faith as a Jehovah's Witness . Engleitner was arrested with a group of Jehovah's Witnesses after the German invasion of Austria (pictured) in 1938 . Engleitner was able to return home on May 5 1945, but continued to work in slave labour on a farm in St Wolfgang. Despite the end of the war, when he attempted to leave the farm in 1946, he was told by the labour bureau of Bad Ischl that his slave labor duty from the Nazi occupation was still valid. He was finally released from that duty in April 1946 when the US army intervened. Engleitner's life was documented in the book and film 'Unbroken Will' by Austrian film-maker and author Bernhard Rammerstorfer. A memorial for both those who survived and those who didn't at Buchenwald Concentration Camp in 2010 . As a result he toured Europe and across America three times to share his experiences. In 2003, he was awarded the 'Silver Order of Merit of the Province of . Upper Austria' by the Upper Austrian governor Josef Pühringer. He has also received a Ring of Honour of the town of Bad Ischl and a Badge of Honour from the town of St Wolfgang. The oldest known survivor of the camps is Alice Herz-Sommer, 109, who lives in London. She was confined in the camp in Terezin, or Theresienstadt in German.","It has been confirmed that Leopold Engleitner died aged 107 on April 21 .

He amputated the limbs of survivors who were wedged under the ruins. He describes how he cut off a young girl's hand and man's leg with a knife to free them from the ruins. Workers dig mass graves during a mass burial of unidentified garment workers, who died in the collapse of the Rana Plaza building . Didar Hossain spent 50 hours releasing survivors from the wreckage. He was forced to amputate the limbs of trapped survivors . Survivors were found at the site up to five days after the building collapsed. The death toll continues to rise and rescue workers say many more are trapped under the building . He had been working in a factory opposite the Rana Plaza complex when it collapsed and rushed to help the rescue effort. In an interview with BBC World Service, he said he helped 34 people. He performed the amputations with a knife and some anesthetic. He spent five hours helping a young girl on the day after the collapse. Her hand was trapped under crumbled concrete. Mr Hossain said: 'I went out again and told a doctor who was there that he . needed to cut off her hand to get her out. 'But he said: ""I can't go in . there, I'm frightened. You do it."" So he gave me a knife and some . anaesthetic so I could amputate her hand. 'She watched while I amputated her hand. She was screaming and I . was screaming too, and I cried when I saw her crying. I felt really bad, but . there was no other way,' he told BBC reporters. He said that two men who were trapped beside the young girl begged him to do the same so they could escape. Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 500 workers . A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry . Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty . Mr Hossain said he cut off one man's leg without any anesthetic and he managed to crawl out of the ruins on his own. Stories of miraculous rescue efforts come as the death toll rises and there is continued confusion over how many people are missing. The death toll from . the Bangladesh factory which collapsed last week has now passed 500 . after another 29 bodies were pulled from the rubble last night. Hundreds of workers . were inside the eight-storey building near the capital of Dhaka when it . collapsed into rubble last week, many of whom are still unaccounted . for. The Rana Plaza . housed five garment factories and with the new death toll of 507, the . disaster is now ranked the second most deadly structural failure in . modern times after 9/11. The collapse was caused by four . powergenerators located on the roof, the head of a government inquiry . into the disaster said today. The . four generators started up when the power was cut following an . earthquake, and this may have caused the building to fall in on itself. The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail . Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble . The building collapse, in which over 500 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history . Rescue workers expect the number of . dead to rise because they believe many bodies are still buried on the . ground level of the building. The building's owner, Mohammed Sohel Rana has been arrested along with the engineers who designed the building. Rana had permission to build five storeys but added three more illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the . building a day before its collapse, police ordered an evacuation, but . Rana told tenants it was safe. The owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was arrested last week (left) He was seen wearing a police-issue helmet and body armour as he was escorted from a hearing at the High Court in Bangladesh yesterday (right) The next day, a bank and some shops refused to open but factory managers told their workers to go back inside.

And it seems as though his industry has paid . off, although he did not hide his relief at having come through a . difficult 12 months. ‘I have finished all of the . high-intensity treatment,’ he said. ‘From now on I’ll be on the softer . one. It’s been a very, very long year. I had my hard moments but I had . good moments as well. ‘I can say I’m lucky because some . people with this disease will die very quickly and I managed to keep . battling and still be here, still standing.

As he had the acute form of the . illness, medics wanted to begin treatment immediately, his chances of . survival rated at 50-50. But he has been in remission since the start of . the season. ‘At the start I thought it was just a . cold, nothing serious — just something normal,’ he said. ‘When I was . told what exactly the diagnosis was I was a little bit shocked but I . accepted it and just wanted to start the treatment straight away. My . doctor, Richard Lovell, told me quickly that I had to start treatment.

A teenage farmer who spends her days getting muddy on her family farm is set to swap her Wellington boots for high heels and her overalls for a bikini in a bid to be crowned Miss England. Louise Bakewell, 19, from Somerset, says she is 'thrilled' after a win in her local pageant saw her reach the finals of Miss England. It will be a far cry from her day to day life: a regular day for Louise will see her dressed in dirty clothes tending to the cattle and sheep at her parents' farm in Somerset. She beat hundreds of other hopefuls to be crowned Miss Somerset - and was informed of her win in a phone call while delivering a lamb in a field. Louise Bakewell, 18, found out she was a finalist in the beauty competition while lambing sheep in a field at her family's farm in Somerset . Louise will swap her wellies and overalls for a bikini and heels in a bid to be crowned Miss England . Louise is a livestock farmer, car mechanic, medical student and now Miss England finalist . She was inspired to enter Miss England after being complimented by a shop assistant while trying on a ball gown. The medical student - who is also a trainee car mechanic - will now represent her county at the Miss England finals next month. She said: 'I was out lambing and the sheep had just given birth to a little lamb when I saw my mum sprinting down the field after me. 'She told me to run back up to the house because Miss England had phoned and wanted to talk to me. 'I had to sprint back up and only had time to wash my hands before I was on the phone to them for an interview. They told me I had got it. It was quite surreal. 'I don't think my friends and family will believe me really. They just see me as the farmer; I have never done any modelling before. Louise is a hard worker, being both a mechanic, helping out her family both on her parents livestock farm and at her mother's nursery . 'But the competition is about more than just looks - I'm just normal really.' Louise helps out with the Highland cattle and sheep at her family's farm in Henstridge, Somerset, where she lives with mother Amanda, father Jim and three older brothers, Matt, Rob and Chris. She also took up a job as a trainee mechanic a couple of weeks ago for extra income. 'I just do all sorts of stuff around the farm. It is mostly cleaning up after the cows - not very glamorous,' she said. 'I also help out in my mum's nursery looking after children. In fact, when Miss England called me again to ask me for some details I was telling a kid not to throw mud around - again not exactly glamorous.' Louise claims she is nothing special and has no idea why she was chosen to represent the county in the Miss England race next month . Louise was inspired to enter the contest when a shop assistant told her she had beauty pageant potential while she was shopping for a ballgown for her first year prom at Cardiff University last year. But Louise was forced to put her medicine degree - and beauty pageant ambitions - on hold shortly afterwards when crippling back pain meant she had to return home to Somerset. She endured a complex operation on the nerves surrounding her spine at Christmas and finally felt well enough to put herself forward to become Miss Somerset a couple of months ago. The Miss England competition takes place at the Riviera International conference centre in Torquay between June 13 and 16. Miss England bosses said they chose Louise because she has all the attributes of a Miss England winner . Around 50 girls will battle for the crown, a place at the Miss World competition and prizes worth £30,000 including a luxury holiday to Mauritius. Louise is hoping to reflect her Somerset roots during the creative rounds of the competition. 'There is a one round which is an eco round where you have to make your own dress,' she said. 'I think I'll think of Somerset and make mine from a potato sack. It will probably look really bad, but there you go. 'I'm really excited, but I'm not sure it has sunk in yet.' Miss England bosses said they chose Louise because she has all the attributes of a Miss England winner.

"By . David Rose . PUBLISHED: . 18:12 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:12 EST, 4 May 2013 . Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti says free speech is a basic right . A key adviser to Lord Justice Leveson is this week poised to electrify the debate on press  regulation – with a sweeping onslaught against the proposed Royal Charter agreed by the three main political parties. Shami Chakrabarti, director of the civil rights group Liberty,  will say the measures it contains would give too much power to  politicians – and that it poses grave threats to the freedom of speech. Her intervention will be seen as politically explosive – and as an attack on the celebrity-led campaign group, Hacked Off, which virtually dictated the charter’s terms. She is said to share mounting concerns that Hacked Off has become too influential and that it  is effectively demanding a right of veto on any post-Leveson plan. The impact of Ms Chakrabarti’s comments will be intensified by  her dual role. She leads the country’s main civil rights pressure group – but was also was one of six ‘assessors’ who guided the Leveson Inquiry, and helped to produce its report. She has said nothing about how the report should be implemented since it was published in November. But in an interview with this newspaper, she said one of its proposals – for compulsory, government-imposed regulation for newspapers which refused to join a ‘voluntary’ regulator –  would be unlawful under the Human Rights Act. On Friday the Government agreed to extend the period before the Privy Council makes a final decision on the planned charter until the middle of next month. Most of Britain’s national and regional newspapers, including The Mail on Sunday, have drawn up their own rival version, which would eliminate political control. Last night, speaking to this newspaper, Ms Chakrabarti also attacked the way some official bodies have ‘taken Leveson in vain’ by advocating repressive, authoritarian changes to the law in order to restrict information in ways the report never envisaged. Chief among them is the policy to refuse to name people charged with criminal offences – a policy now being followed by about a third of Britain’s police forces. Last week Warwickshire Police cited Leveson in order to justify refusing to name retired officer Paul Greaves, who has been charged with stealing £113,000 from the force. Ms Chakrabarti also condemned the rapidly spreading police policy of refusing to name people who have been arrested, though not yet charged – even though this measure was included in the Leveson report. Lord Justice Leveson carried out his inquiry into press standards last year . She said: ‘It’s too easy to take Leveson’s name in vain but what is the real motive for this new call for legislation? Do the police want to avoid making difficult decisions, or to seek a complete lock-down on information on how their powers of arrest are exercised? It is unnecessary and deeply worrying for traditions of open justice.’ It was wrong, she went on, for the police to disseminate untested information to the press about suspects in criminal cases and those under arrest. But she added: ‘So is any blanket  refusal to confirm the names of those detained or charged.’ However, it is her views on the shape of future press regulation which will have the biggest impact. The scope and constitution of a press regulator was Leveson’s central concern, and her intervention will mark the first public statement by those involved in the inquiry as to what should happen now. It is understood she is considering either a speech or a high-profile television interview in which to make her full criticisms public. The current ‘official’ version of the charter, which will govern how the new regulator is run, emerged from an all-night meeting in March between a four-man delegation from Hacked Off, Labour’s Ed Miliband, the Lib Dems’ Nick Clegg and Oliver Letwin, the Tory Cabinet Office Minister. If approved by the Privy Council, it could only by changed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of parliament – something which, in practice, would be almost impossible to achieve. Ms Chakrabarti is said to regard this clause as anathema – because it would give the current generation of politicians who serve on the Privy Council an effective stranglehold on the shape of press regulation and freedom of speech – far into the future. Under the newspapers’ rival plan – which Ms Chakrabarti and her  Liberty colleagues are said to be ‘seriously considering’ – the charter could be changed if the new regulator’s board and the newspaper publishers unanimously agreed to do so. In her interview in November, she said that journalism ‘must never become a state-licensed profession’. Some argued that because the State licenses drivers, it could therefore license the media. But in her view, ‘driving a car isn’t a fundamental human right. Freedom of speech is.’ She also said she was opposed to Hacked Off’s demand for ‘statutory underpinning’ of the new regulator. Media commentator Steve Hewlett's guide to the options for press regulation... What is being proposed? There . are two versions of the Royal Charter on regulating Britain’s press . under consideration. The first is a cross-party proposal formulated in . Labour leader  Ed Miliband’s office late on the night of March 18, with . representatives from the other two main political parties and four . members of Hacked Off present – but conspicuously, nobody from the . press.What is the alternative proposal? There . is a separate proposal  by the newspaper industry  for an Independent . Royal Charter which it insists will meet the recommendations of last . year’s Leveson report into media standards – without introducing . state-sponsored regulation. This proposal is supported by most  of the . country’s national, regional and local newspapers and magazines. The . Guardian and the Independent are the only two national newspaper titles . out of  11 that have not signed up.What are the areas of agreement? Both . proposals agree on  the need for a new press regulator to be recognised . by a genuinely independent body. Both acknowledge that a Royal Charter, . rather than statute, is the best way  to achieve this aim. They . both propose tough sanctions, including the new regulator having the . power to impose fines of up to £1 million for systematic wrongdoing. Other . areas in common include  up-front corrections, with inaccuracies . corrected fully and prominently, and strong investigative powers . enabling the regulator to examine wrongdoing and call editors to . account. In fact, the two parties have moved a significant distance over . the past few weeks in the degree to which they agree. Why will the newspaper industry not recognise the cross-party Charter? The . newspaper industry disagrees fundamentally with certain details of the . cross-party proposal. It believes a number of its recommendations are . unworkable  in practice, and could lead to unintended consequences. For . instance, there are fears that offering a free arbitration service to . anyone who feels unfairly treated by the press will lead to ‘fine . farming’, in which issues that would have been solved by compromise will . now be motivated by financial gain. It also believes it gives . politicians an unacceptable degree of interference in the regulation of . the press. How does the newspapers’ proposal differ from the cross-party proposal? The newspapers’ proposal would: . What’s happening currently? The . cross-party Charter has been temporarily withdrawn  as the Privy . Council examines the newspaper industry’s alternative document. Both . parties claim they will not surrender any ground. Have there already been consequences of Lord Justice Leveson’s report? Yes. Leveson suggested that unless exceptional circumstance applied, the . names of those arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released . to the press or public. Fourteen of the 43 police forces in England and . Wales are now keeping secret the names of suspects even when they have . been charged. Shami Chakrabarti, an adviser to the Leveson Inquiry, has . described this controversial practice as ‘chilling’. What’s the likely outcome? The . Government is well aware that there’s a serious risk the press will . refuse to seek recognition from the new body, which would render the . scheme totally unworkable. Then, politicians would have to impose . regulation upon the press by legislation – which nobody wants. It is in . everybody’s interests to come to an agreement, and to properly address . certain key points of the proposal. So it is likely negotiations will . continue until a compromise has been reached. ******************************************************************************************************************** . Lib Dem MP John Hemming is breaking ranks to back press self-regulation . Senior MPs last night swung their support behind the newspaper industry’s plan for self-regulation. Labour’s Kate Hoey and the Liberal Democrats’ John Hemming became the first MPs to break ranks with  their party leaders to oppose a Royal Charter scheme giving Parliament the power to dictate terms over the press. Their move came after the Privy council said the plan would not be considered until it had studied the industry’s proposal for a rigorous system of regulation – which would keep the press free from state interference. Last night, Ms Hoey warned the Royal Charter scheme would crush campaigning journalism. ‘If the Charter plan had been in existence  at the time of the MPs’ expenses scandal, the revelations would never have emerged,’ she said. ‘There is an element of revenge to this. Kate Hooey MP is also opposed to a Royal Charter . ‘I have always been uneasy about the huge influence wielded by a small, cliquey, elite. It is wrong to introduce legislation to cover up the misdemeanours and embarrassment of the high and mighty.’ Ms Hoey said the Royal Charter scheme could also have a ‘devastating effect’ on local newspapers: ‘The cost of dealing with large numbers of complaints, many trivial or vexatious, will be huge and could drive them out of business.’ She was supported by Lib Dem  Mr Hemming, who said: ‘I was worried about a Royal Charter  that would be controlled by the Government – but the newspapers are proposing one which is not subject to the whim of the Prime Minister of the day. ‘That is essential. Some people are not committed to free speech and to have them in a position of power over the press is like putting a fox in charge of the chicken coop.’","Liberty boss was judge's key assessor .

Neurologist Dr Wlodzimierz Szepielow, was suspended from a Dundee hospital after the death of a patient last year . A Polish brain surgeon who was suspended following the death of one of his patients scored a record low in a performance test. Neurologist Wlodzimierz Szepielow had been working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee until his contract was terminated last year. A panel in July 2011 had found Dr Szepielow’s fitness to practise was impaired as a result of his poor professional performance, but agreed he could continue to work under supervision for 18 months. Last year he sat a knowledge test and needed to achieve a mark of 52 per cent to pass. However, he could only manage 17.5 per cent, the lowest mark an assessor with more than 15 years’ experience could recall. His performance in the knowledge test and in medical exams was so poor that the assessment team decided it would be inappropriate for Dr Szepielow to continue to practise and he was suspended. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found his expertise was so poor that it felt Dr Szepielow could have brought the profession into disrepute. Tribunal panel chairman Dr Malcolm Phillips said: ‘Dr Szepielow’s performance has deteriorated since his previous performance assessment in 2010. ‘The panel finds little evidence of effective remediation by Dr Szepielow. It notes that he has attended some training but considers this did not appropriately address his deficient performance. ‘The panel finds that should Dr Szepielow be allowed to return to clinical practice, due to his lack of insight he may be liable to bring the medical profession into disrepute. ‘In the circumstances, the panel  has determined that Dr Szepielow’s fitness to practise is impaired by  reason of his deficient professional performance.’ Dr Szepielow’s performance was also found to be unacceptable in the areas of assessment, treatment, investigations, maintaining good medical practice and relationship with patients. The panel must now decide what sanction to impose on the doctor, the most serious of which would be to strike him off the medical register. Dr Szepielow arrived in the UK in 2005 and over the next two years received several complaints from patients, while concerns were also raised by colleagues. A review of a selection of Dr Szepielow’s outpatients led to his suspension by Tayside NHS Trust in 2007 after the death of a patient with status epilepticus, a prolonged seizure. Dr Szepielow was working at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee before his contract was terminated last year . But Dr Szepielow did not come to the attention of the General Medical Council until 2009, which led to an assessment of his professional performance. Dr Phillips said: ‘The assessors concluded that Dr Szepielow is beyond remediation. The panel has noted the timescale for remediation as judged by the assessors. Their view was that remediation would take an excessive amount of time with little possibility of success.’ The tribunal decided his performance was incompatible with being a doctor and his lack of insight posed a risk of serious harm to patients. Dr Phillips said: ‘The panel noted that there were a number of clinical scenarios in which Dr Szepielow’s performance was found to be  unacceptable, and some of which, if repeated, in a real-life scenario could lead to the death of patients. ‘Dr Szepielow’s serious departure from good medical practice, as concluded by the assessment team, demonstrates behaviour fundamentally incompatible with being a doctor. ‘His lack of insight into his deficiencies may result in serious harm to patients through incompetence.’ Dr Phillips added: ‘Erasure is the only means of protecting patients and the wider public interest, which includes maintaining public trust and confidence in the profession.’ Dr Szepielow was not present or represented at the hearing, which continues.","Dr Wlodzimierz Szepielow was suspended following the death of a patient .

"By . Sean Rayment . PUBLISHED: . 20:00 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:00 EST, 4 May 2013 . A ‘political storm’ is brewing over a rising tide of sex offending and domestic violence in the Armed Forces, top brass have been warned. The alarm is raised in a confidential  email, seen by The Mail on Sunday, from the Forces’ most senior lawyer in which he asks for a meeting with one of the Army’s top generals to discuss the problem. In the email, Bruce Houlder QC, head of the Service Prosecuting Authority, says he wants a meeting with Lieutenant General Gerald Berragan, the adjutant general and the officer with overall responsibility for Army discipline. Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, killed herself in 2011 after her complaint she was raped by two colleagues was dismissed . Mr Houlder says he wants to discuss how the Services’ justice system deals with domestic violence and sexual offending and advises that he considers the issues represent ‘future political storms’. The email was leaked to The Mail  on Sunday last week after Ministry of Defence figures revealed during a debate in Parliament last month indicated that there have been 39 cases of alleged rape and 129 cases of alleged sexual assault of female members of the Armed Forces since 2009. The records also show that more than 20 soldiers placed on the sex offenders register continue to serve. A separate report after a survey  of 6,000 Army personnel stated  that every one of the 400 female soldiers spoken to claimed to have been the subject of unwanted sexual attention. One of the most high-profile cases  to reach disciplinary stage involved Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement, 30, a Royal Military Police officer who hanged herself in 2011 outside her barracks after her complaint of rape against two fellow Redcaps was dismissed by an RMP inquiry. Bruce Houlder QC has warned the rise of violence could be a 'political storm' Another study, of 14,000 servicemen who had returned from combat, showed that one in eight had committed a violent act, a significant proportion of which were related to domestic violence. Recently former Royal Engineer Lewis Mackay described in graphic detail the kind of problems experienced by soldiers returning home from a tour of duty. He says that many soldiers who attack their partners are suffering from post-traumatic stress. Mr Mackay saw a search team commander lose both legs when he stepped on a home-made bomb in Afghanistan. He said that when he went home to his wife, Emma, he came close to hitting her. ‘I had a very short temper, I was punching doors and walls. I was very, very aggressive,’ he said. ‘If . Emma was doing something that I didn’t think was right, I wanted to . lash out. I had to try my hardest not to – by sitting on my hands or . biting my fist.’ Service charities such as the  Army . Families Federation (AFF) and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families . Association (SSAFA), believe that domestic violence is a far bigger . issue within the military than the MoD is prepared to accept. Catherine . Spencer, the chief executive of the AFF, said: ‘AFF believes that . domestic violence is taken seriously by the Army but there is a concern . that the victim may perceive that there is more reason to conceal it due . to the effect on the soldier’s career and potential loss of service . family accommodation.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Armed Forces have a zero-tolerance approach to all forms of bullying, discrimination and abuse. ‘All . allegations will be thoroughly investigated, either by the civil or . military police and, where appropriate, action will be taken.’ All of the 400 female soldiers contacted in a survey of 6,000 Army personnel claimed to have received unwanted sexual attention .","Bruce Houlder QC warns top brass to be aware of problems .

Locked up: John Reed, 65, the mastermind behind a drug smuggling gang which brought tens of millions of pounds worth of high-purity cocaine into the UK hidden in lorries, was jailed for 28 years today . The mastermind behind a drug smuggling gang which brought tens of millions of pounds worth of high-purity cocaine into the UK hidden in lorries was jailed for 28 years today. John Reed, 65, led the group which imported hundreds of kilograms of the Class A drug into Britain from the Netherlands over the space of at least 18 months, Kingston Crown Court heard. The convicted armed robber and four members of the gang were arrested in January last year when police found 24lb (11kg) of cocaine with an estimated street value of £1.5 million in a raid on a haulage firm. The Metropolitan Police have said they believe the gang was making £25 million per year. Reed and minor gang member Kevin Jones, 51, were jailed at Kingston Crown Court today for conspiracy to supply Class A drugs in what Judge Nicholas Price QC called 'an extensive and highly lucrative conspiracy' over at least 18 months. 'This conspiracy was so long-running and concerned so many kilograms of cocaine it was truly off the scale,' he said. 'It is important that you and the general public understand why the courts have consistently adopted an uncompromising stance in relation to sentencing for Class A drugs. 'It has become a scourge on society.' He told Reed he was satisfied he was the main player and financier of the scheme, which only ended because they got caught. 'It was always the prosecution case that you were the principal leader of the conspiracy at the London end,' the judge added. 'I’m satisfied that you were the mastermind behind this long-running and highly lucrative conspiracy.' Reed, of Southwark, London, led the gang with haulier Daniel Cheevers, the court heard, using Cheevers’s Northamptonshire business as cover for taking money to the continent and bringing back up to 11kg of the drug at a time. Gang:  Reed led the group with haulier Daniel Cheevers, right.  Kevin Jones, left, was also convicted and was described as a minor gang member . The court heard that significant amounts of money had been deposited in bank accounts in Dubai. A further £24,000 in cash was found at his home when it was raided by police. The gang brought back on average 7.5kg of uncut cocaine on each trip, the court heard. The drug was at 92 per cent purity and worth up to £70,000 per kilo. It would be worth more when it was cut down to a street strength of below 20 per cent purity. Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said that the group used two drivers to make multiple trips and bring up to 300kg of the drug back every year. 'These two defendants, with the others, were party to a conspiracy to import and distribute multi-kilogram consignments of very high purity cocaine,' he said. 'These consignments being imported from mainland Europe in transcontinental lorries were then distributed across London and the south east of England.' Reed’s barrister Ian Winter QC claimed there was no evidence that his client had played any more than a minor role in the drug smuggling but the judge rejected his argument. Jailed: Robert Greenhill, 62, left, was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment at Kingston Crown Court. Joseph McCorry, right, was jailed for 19 years . Reed and Jones remained impassive in the . dock throughout proceedings. Both nodded and silently mouthed their . thanks to the judge as they were led down. The court heard Reed was previously jailed for 17 years in 1987 for his role in an armed robbery in London in which police officers were shot at. Armed police were on guard in and outside the court building today as the sentence was passed. Former lorry driver Jones, of Welling, Kent, acted in an 'important role' as a go-between and messenger with the gang while on day or night release from a seven-year prison sentence for drug smuggling, the judge said. He was jailed for 15 years. Cheevers, 47, of  Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was jailed for 25 years last month. He was also the former team manager of the Pr1mo Kawasaki Superbike team. Two other members of the gang - Joseph McCorry, 52, of  Welling, and Robert Greenhill, 62, of Dartford, Kent - were jailed for 19 and 12 years respectively at the same time. All had denied conspiracy to supply cocaine but were found guilty at an earlier trial. Scotland Yard has also issued an appeal to trace three others who are still on the run. Jamie Spring, 40, also known as Jamie Hall, Christopher Mealey, 37, and Lee Smith, 40, have not been seen since the other gang members were arrested. Spring and Mealey are the sons-in-law of Reed and, along with Smith, have connections to Spain and Cyprus but police said this week they 'retain an open mind' as to their whereabouts.","Group led by John Reed imported hundreds of kilograms of Class A drug .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:55 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:26 EST, 4 May 2013 . Michelle Cound has taken to Twitter to support her partner Chirs Froome . As sporting feuds go, it is perhaps one of the most heated. The inter-team rivalry between Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome and the debate over who will lead Team Sky at this year's Tour de France has been setting the cycling world alight. However, the latest war of words is not being waged by the world class cyclists, but instead, by one of their partners. Mr Wiggins, who won the 2012 Tour de France with Froome finishing in second place, has claimed a decision on who will lead this team at this year's race will not be made until much nearer to the 29 June start date. But Froome believes he has already been given the nod by the Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford to lead the British team's challenge as Wiggins focuses on winning the Giro d'Italia, which starts this weekend. Mr Wiggins suggested during a recent interview Team Sky might run with both of them, hinting a possible co-leadership of the nine-strong Tour de France team. But this did not seem to sit well with Mr Froome’s fiancee, Michelle Cound who branded the comments 'blatant lies' in a tweet, which has since been deleted. Earlier this week she also told her near-10,000 Twitter followers: ‘Chris and Brad on the same start line, in the same kit? Mmm... doubt it. ‘To those claiming that this Wiggins/Froome thing is some sort of publicity stunt, you are wrong. I look forward to Team Sky clearing up this mess, asap. #fed up.’ Catherine Wiggins deleted her Twitter account. She had been defending her husband after he swore at paparazzi when he left hospital last November after being hit by a car. Cound’s intervention followed a public spat this week between the two riders. Wiggins triggered it on Monday by saying that he planned to win the Giro d’Italia — his main goal for 2013 — and then, contrary to expectations, to go on to defend his Tour title. Froome responded a few hours later, reiterating his belief that he expected to be team leader as his reward for riding in support of  Wiggins during last year’s Tour, in which he finished second. In a statement, Froome said: ‘There has been much speculation regarding the leadership for Team Sky at the Tour de France this year. I have made it clear  that winning the Tour would be my main objective for 2013. ‘I have been reassured by the management at Team Sky that I have their full backing and at no time has the leadership of the Tour been in question.’ It echoes a situation last summer when Mrs Wiggins and Ms Cound exchanged thinly veiled jibes online.

Former Page 3 girl Peta Todd, the partner of Mark Cavendish, another of Mr Wiggin's teammates weighed in to last year's row, apparently in support of Ms Cound . It came as Mr Froome was forced into a support role for his team captain. Tensions first arose during stage 11 of the race, when Mr Froome was instructed to hold back so that Mr Wiggins could catch up and retain the leader's yellow jersey. Ms Cound, a sports photographer tweeted: 'Team work is also about giving the people around you, that support you, a chance to shine in their own right.' Mrs Wiggins quickly shot a Tweet back in response which praised other members of the Sky Team Mick Rogers and Richie Porte for 'genuine, selfless effort and true professionalism' -  but omitted Mr Froome. This Tweet led to an immediate response from Ms Cound who replied: 'Don't think there are many other pro-riders who's partners know more about cycling than Chris's precisely & I know what happened just then.' 'If you want loyalty, get a Froome dog a quality I value although being taken advantage of by others!' Peta Todd, the partner of Mark Cavendish, another of Mr Wiggin's teammates then weighed in to the row, apparently in support of Ms Cound.","Chris Froome's partner Michelle Cound has taken to Twitter to join debate .

A mother who endured the agony of seeing one of her identical twins born with a crippling form of cerebral palsy has been given hope by a surgeon in the U.S. Dee Buchanan, 30, hopes a revolutionary operation will allow two-year-old Callum to finally keep up with his brother, Mitchell. The nursery nurse gave birth to the twins three months prematurely after a difficult pregnancy, and at eight-months-old Callum was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy – a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body. Identical twins Callum (right) and Mitchell Buchanan (left), pictured with their parents Scott and Dee, were born three months prematurely. Callum was then diagnosed with cerebral palsy . He now has a chance of walking thanks to American surgeons who will carry out a procedure to try and remove the abnormal sensory nerve fibres that cause his disability. The boys' parents, from Tidworth, Hampshire, were delighted when they were told they were expecting twins. But doctors at Salisbury District Hospital detected a problem with Mitchell's growth at Mrs Buchanan’s 20 week scan. She was admitted to Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton for round-the-clock monitoring when she was 26 weeks pregnant. The boys had to be delivered at 28 weeks because they developed a potentially fatal condition called twin-to-twin transfusion – this occurs when identical twins share a placenta and one baby receives more blood flow than the other. As they were so premature, they were given brain scans, which revealed that Mitchell was perfectly healthy but Callum had a 'flare' on the back of his brain. At eight months, Callum (left) was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body . The cerebral palsy means that Callum is unable to walk or crawl, so cannot keep up with Mitchell . It was diagnosed as periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a type of brain injury which may have been caused by their traumatic birth, and which can lead to cerebral palsy. Mrs Buchanan said: ‘Up until 20 weeks it had been a normal pregnancy but then they noticed a problem with Mitchell's growth. ‘He was not keeping up with Callum so they wanted to keep a closer eye on me.’ She added: ‘When Callum was diagnosed I took it in my stride because I was prepared. I knew he would need extra care and would need physiotherapy and possibly surgery. ‘It was PVL that caused Callum's cerebral palsy. It could have been triggered by lack of oxygen. They can't tell me what caused the PVL but it was a traumatic birth so it may have been that.’ The boys' parents are trying to raise £75,000 to allow Callum to have pioneering surgery in America . Paediatric neurosurgeon Dr T.S Park will carry out a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) procedure at the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri . Cerebral palsy affects the communication between the brain and the muscles, causing the muscles in Callum's legs to receive constant messages to tighten and contract. This means that he is unable to walk of crawl. However, in June he will travel to America for pioneering surgery to address the problem. Paediatric neurosurgeon Dr T.S Park will carry out a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) procedure at the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri. The operation will involve examining the sensory nerve fibres that enter the spinal cord from the muscles, and removing the abnormal 'rootlets' that cause his disability. The operation will involve examining the sensory nerve fibres that enter the spinal cord from the muscles, and removing the abnormal 'rootlets' that cause his disability . Mr and Mrs Buchanan found out about the procedure because another child at their local hospital had it and improved dramatically as a result . The procedure reduces the number of messages sent from the muscles and gives a better balance of nerve cell activity in the spinal cord. To pay for the procedure and the stay in America, Callum’s parents have launched a fundraising campaign raise £75,000. They have so far raised £35,000. Mrs Buchanan said: ‘Callum is already starting to notice the differences between what he and Mitchell can do. ‘Surgeons in the UK would not look at Callum until he was four and a half, and they wouldn't operate until he was five. In the UK, Callum (right) would not be eligible for surgery until he was five-years-old . ‘The younger they get the operation the better. I don't want him to grow up feeling different to his twin. ‘Mitchell can sit, crawl, walk, run, get himself up and down stairs. Callum has no mobility at all without being assisted. ‘He can sit on the floor if he is supported but he can't crawl or kneel. He has no balance. She added: ‘Sometimes he is cheeky with it. He will sit and tilt his head at you then throws himself back on the floor and start laughing. ‘He is such a good boy. Ninety per cent of the time he is happy. He can wake up during the night and have tightness in his legs. That's when he gets upset. It is thought that the boys' traumatic birth may have caused Callum to have periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) - a type of brain injury which can lead to cerebral palsy . Mitchell (pictured) is completely healthy despite being born so early . ‘As far as everything else goes, he's fine. His speech is actually better than his brother's.’ Callum has frequent hospital appointments and follows a strict regime of physiotherapy to build up his core muscles. His parents found out about the SDR operation when another young patient at the Princess Anne Hospital underwent it and experienced a massive improvement. They researched the surgery then contacted the St Louis hospital and sent doctors a video of Callum to see whether he would be a suitable candidate. He was approved, and the couple began a fundraising campaign called Callum's Walking Wish. They will travel to America for a pre-surgery assessment in June, followed by the operation three days later.","Callum and Mitchell Buchanan were born three months prematurely .

The makers of a baby bouncer chair launched an investigation today after a mother claimed her nine-week-old daughter was left with a black eye after an accident when she struggled to remove a bar. Charlotte Priestley, 19, says she was struggling to release the bar on the £49 battery-powered bouncer when one side suddenly came loose and struck her little girl in the face. The Pretty in Pink Blossomy Blooms  seat, which Charlotte, from Launceston, Cornwall, says was brand new, has a plastic toy bar with a hanging rattle and teddy which can be removed to lift the baby out. Injured: Nine-week-old Masie Castle was left with a black eye after she was hit in the face by a supposedly quick-release bar on her baby bouncer, it was claimed today . Its makers Bright Stars say the bar 'removes easily with one hand for easy access to baby'. But when Charlotte tried to remove the bar using the plastic slide clips one side became stuck - meaning she had to tug on the bar to work it loose. She says the bar then smashed into her baby's face as it flew out. The little girl's face swelled up, leaving her with a cut forehead and a black eye. Charlotte and partner Ryan Castle, 18, rushed Masie to a minor injuries clinic for a check-up. Doctors told them to watch for signs of brain injury, advising they take Masie home and wake her up every two hours in case she slipped unconsciousness. Charlotte, of Launceston, Cornwall, said: 'The bar is supposed to be removed really easily, and you have to move it to get her out, so it should be safe. 'But it stuck, and of course because you are trying to take it off you are pulling it and it just hit her in the face. She started screaming and screaming. Distraught: Mother Charlotte Priestley, 19, with daughter Masie, who she says has been crying and reaching for her eye since she was wounded . Heartbreaking: 'With a tiny baby you try to do everything right, now we have a baby with a black eye,' Charlotte says . 't was horrible. I felt so helpless. I certainly won't be using it again. I just want other mums to know about it so it doesn't happen to anyone else. 'I was up all night crying. It was horrible. And now we have a baby with a huge black eye, all black and red. 'She is crying all the time and trying to touch her eye, so it is obviously bothering her.It's heartbreaking. 'With such a tiny baby you just try to do everything right, and now we have a baby with a black eye and a cut on her head. Obviously she can't tell us how it feels. It's awful.' First-time mother Charlotte had used the chair for Masie while she sterilised bottles. According to the manufacturer's website the 'precious bouncer' produces 'soothing vibrations and sweet melodies sure to delight your little one'. Safety first: Kids II, the company who manufacture the bouncer, say they 'strive to make products that are enjoyable, but most importantly safe' The couple have since emailed Kids II, the U.S. company who manufacture the Bright Starts chair, to complain. An email to the parents said: 'We are sorry to hear of this report with the Bright Starts Swing. Please let me if your daughter is OK. We always want to ensure the safety of you and your child. 'We thank you for taking the time to notify us and we want to make sure that your child is doing fine and quickly get this resolved for you.' The company, who have contacted Charlotte for more information on the incident, said today that safety was always their prime concern when manufacturing baby products. 'At Kids II we not only strive to make products that are enjoyable but that are most importantly safe for parents and children,' a spokesman said. 'Kids II products meet or exceed all international safety guidelines and regulations.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:53 EST, 24 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:19 EST, 25 April 2013 . Scientists have described the new bird flu that has killed 22 people in China as one of the most deadly influenza strains as it spreads to Taiwan. The H7N9 flu has infected 108 people in China since it was first detected in March, according to the Geneva-based WHO. Some 6,000 Chinese tourists visit Taiwan every day, putting pressure on Taiwanese authorities to step up their screening at airports to contain the virus. The strain appears to spread more easily to humans than SARS, a virus that caused panic when it started killing people in Asia a decade ago. Deadly: A worker hanging chickens in the slaughter house of Huannan Market, the day after Taiwan reported its first case of the bird flu infection . Precautions: Taiwanese airlines will suspend chicken and ducks that come from China . Anxiety: Commuters wear masks at a subway station in Taipei, Taiwan in the hope of protecting themselves . Scientists are concerned as it transmits . more easily from birds to humans than another strain that has killed . hundreds since 2003. Taiwan's Health Department said a 53-year-old businessman had contracted H7N9 while travelling in China and was in a serious condition in hospital. Although it is not clear exactly how people are being infected, experts say they see no evidence so far of the most worrisome scenario - sustained transmission between people. An international team of scientists led by the WHO and the Chinese government conducted a five-day investigation in China, but said they were no closer to determining whether the virus might become transmissible between people. 'The situation remains complex and difficult and evolving,' said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security. 'When we look at influenza viruses, this is an unusually dangerous virus for humans,' he said at a briefing. Spreading: A farmer tends his ducks along in Quzhou, China, where one new case was announced on Wednesday . Screening: A temperature detector monitors passengers at Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan. A 53-year-old Taiwanese buisinessman is in a serious condition in hospital after contracting the virus while travelling in China . Transmission: A woman wears a face mask as she walks past a poster showing how to avoid the H7N9 bird flu virus, in Beijing . 'Serious condition': Two masked security guards patrol Hoping hospital in Taipei where the businessman is being treated . Another bird flu strain - H5N1 - has killed 30 of the 45 people it infected in China between 2003 and 2013, and although the H7N9 strain in the current outbreak has a lower fatality rate to date, Fukuda said: 'This is definitely one of the most lethal influenza viruses that we've seen so far.' Scientists who have analysed genetic sequence data from samples from three H7N9 victims say the strain is a so-called 'triple reassortant' virus with a mixture of genes from three other flu strains found in birds in Asia. 'Complex and difficult': Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general for health security speaks during a press conference in Beijing . Recent pandemic viruses, including the H1N1 'swine flu' of 2009/2010, have been mixtures of mammal and bird flu - hybrids that are more likely to be milder because mammalian flu tends to make people less severely ill than bird flu. Pure bird flu strains, such as the new H7N9 strain and the H5N1 flu, which has killed about 371 of 622 the people it has infected since 2003, are generally more deadly for people. The team of experts, who began their investigation in China last week, said one problem in tracking H7N9 is the absence of visible illness in poultry. Fukuda stressed that the team is still at the beginning of its investigation, and said that 'we may just be seeing the most serious infections' at this point. Based on the evidence, 'this virus is more easily transmissible from poultry to humans than H5N1', he said. Besides the initial cases of H7N9 in and around Shanghai, others have been detected in Beijing and five provinces. Samples . from chickens, ducks and pigeons from poultry markets have tested . positive for H7N9, but those from migratory birds have not, suggesting . that 'the likely source of infection is poultry', said Nancy Cox, . director of the influenza division at the U.S. Centers for Disease . Control and Prevention. John . Oxford, a flu virologist at Queen Mary University of London, said the . emergence of human H7N9 infections - a completely new strain in people - . was 'very, very unsettling'. 'This virus seems to have been quietly spreading in chickens without anyone knowing about it,' he told Reuters in London. Flu . experts say it is likely that more cases of human infection with H7N9 . flu will emerge in the coming weeks and months, at least until the . source of infection has been completely confirmed and effectively . controlled. Lethal: A duck vendor waits for customers at Huannan Market in Taipei. Scientists are concerned that the new strain appears to pass more easily from bird to human . Widespread problem: A farmer puts baskets of newly hatched ducklings in a hatch room at a poultry egg trading market in Wuzhen town, Tongxiang, in China's Zhejiang province . Anne Kelso, the Melbourne-based director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza said there has been a 'dramatic slowdown of cases' in the commercial capital of Shanghai, which has recorded most of the deaths, something she described as 'encouraging'. After Shanghai closed down its live poultry markets in early April, there was an almost immediate decline in new H7N9 cases, she said. 'The evidence suggests that the closing of the live poultry markets was an effective way to reduce the risks.' Even so, the WHO's China representative, Michael O'Leary, issued figures last week showing that half of the patients analysed had no known contact with poultry.","Taiwanese businessman in serious condition after contracting H7N9 in China .

Customs officials say 20 small black raw chickens were seized from a passenger arriving from Vietnam at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Officials say importing raw poultry from areas where avian influenza or other fowl diseases are known to occur is not allowed without a permit. Customs say the chickens seized last week have since been incinerated. Carry-on bag: U.S. Customs seized 20 raw Chinese Silkie chickens from a passenger¿s luggage at Dulles International Airport. Spokesman Steve Sapp says agents found two cooler bags containing the chickens in a cooler. The birds were whole, but without feathers and had dark bluish-grey and black skin. There are very strict restrictions on the animal products that travelers may bring into the U.S. The importation of fresh, dried or canned meats or meat products is generally not allowed. Officials say the chickens were fully intact, but de-feathered, with dark-bluish-grey to blackened skin and feet. Washington Dulles: The Vietnamese passenger was let off without so much as a fine because airport officials couldn't find a translator . The passenger from Vietnam didn’t speak English. And U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents at Dulles International Airport say they could not immediately find a translator. They let the contents of the traveler’s luggage speak for itself and ran it through an X-ray machine. They took the Chinese Silkies, which are black chickens, and incinerated them. The meat was the color of a bruise, a dark, blueish-gray. The Washington Post reported the very sight of it had some people reflexively clutching their abdomens. Strict: US Customs employ tough rules when it comes to allowing foreign food and meat into the country . Foreign flavour: Located just outside Washington D.C., Dulles airport has tens of international flights arriving each day requiring U.S. Customs officials to be on the lookout for any strange imports . The chickens are usually white and fluffy, known for being great pets and good to eat. They are imported legally and sold in Asian markets, said Department of Homeland Security spokesman Steve Sapp however, a permit is required to bring them into the U.S from the USDA. Fears were also raised of avian flu, which has recently sickened people in China, and claimed the lives of more than 20. Officials said in a press release on Thursday that 'raw poultry from regions where highly pathogenic avian influenza, Exotic Newcastle disease or other fowl diseases have been known to occur are prohibited from importing to the United States without a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) permit.' Customs officials say agents also seized items made from prohibited African elephant tusk ivory last week at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Officials say the items were found in the luggage of a 57-year-old Nigerian man.","Chickens were in a cooler bag belonging to the traveler .

Cities ranging from Monte Carlo to Medellin in Colombia, London to Fiji and Melbourne will get the parties going with a bang. Some wealthy guests have already indicated they will be flying by private jet to join parties on other continents. The extravaganza is the brainchild of former Conservative party donor and treasurer Lord Fink who is hosting a pre-party dinner for 120 VIP guests at London's Savoy Hotel. Among the likely invites are model Lily Cole, Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry, actress Uma Thurman and her partner, millionaire financier Arpad Busson.

Born in July 1908, Ralph Hoare has been gardening since the age of six and now dispenses his knowledge through Twitter . Ralph Hoare is sitting in his well-worn armchair, iPad on his lap, scanning through the Twitter page that he uses to share gardening tips with the public. A new question pings through: ‘Dear Ralph. What’s a good plant for a north-facing garden?’ ‘Well, that’s an easy one,’ he says, peering through his spectacles. ‘The pyracantha, a shrub with red berries and sharp thorns, or even the cotoneaster, from central Asia. Or what’s that other one? It’s name starts with an H . . .’ It’s a rare memory slip but one that can easily be forgiven. For Ralph, — born in July 1908,  is 104 years old. Given that he planted his first flower — a Japanese anemone — at the tender age of six, that means he has racked up a formidable 98 years’ horticultural experience. And gardening, as evidenced by the success of television shows such as Ground Force, continues to be a thriving industry. So much so, in fact, that Ralph is now dispensing his knowledge via the Twitter page set up for him by a home and garden furniture centre. Since #askralph was launched last week by the local branch of Furniture Village, questions have been flooding in. These range from ‘what are the easiest veg for young children to grow?’ — cress and lettuce, according to Ralph — to ‘when should you pull up potatoes?’. The answer: when flowering is over and the leaves start to go brown. One Twitter user, Brian Gable, asks: ‘When should vegetables go in the ground this year, given how cold it is?’ In Ralph’s view, late April will be best. Another, Heather Darling, asks why her money plant is wilting (it’s probably due to overwatering). Others ask which plant Ralph would like to see make a comeback — ‘Virginia stocks’ — and what his favourite climber is: ‘Clematis, as it’s very versatile and has beautiful flowers’. To all these questions, Ralph, a great-grandfather of six, seems to know the answers — and if he doesn’t, he can soon find them in his well-thumbed ‘bible’, The Small Garden by C.E. Lucas Phillips, his favourite reference book, first published in 1979. But despite his extensive knowledge, he modestly insists that he is no expert, merely a gardening-lover since childhood. His early years were spent mostly in Plymouth with his parents, Elsie and Charles, and two younger siblings, John and Margaret. ‘We had a small east-facing garden. Mother grew roses and Father grew huge marrows,’ Ralph recalls. ‘World War I began while we were young and Plymouth saw a lot of action. I used to hide under a table with a cushion over my head when the German Zeppelins were expected. But whatever happened, we always had flowers in the garden.’ Ralph is always able to find the answers to the questions which have been flooding in since his Twitter page was set up last week . After leaving school at 17 Ralph became a bank clerk, but when World War II broke out he joined the RAF and moved to Edinburgh, where he worked as an aviation candidate selector, interviewing potential pilots. In 1940 he married his sweetheart Dorothy, an accomplished piano player, and they started a family — Michael, now 63, and Kate, 57. Despite work, family commitments and a keen interest in sport — he played a round of golf and went canoeing at Slimbridge Wetland Centre in Gloucestershire on his 100th birthday — he always found time in the evenings and at weekends to garden. It was only in 1957, though, when the family moved to the detached house in Gloucester where he still lives, that he could  put down roots, both metaphorically and literally, and create the garden of his dreams. Ralph Hoare and his great-granddaughter in his garden. The green-figured centenarian is said to be Britain's oldest gardener . For decades, with Dorothy weeding by his side until her death in 2007 at the age of 94, he has lovingly tended his 70ft garden. Short of grape vines, which hold no interest for him, there is hardly any common planting he hasn’t tried to grow — and he has views on them all. Carrots and parsnips are the most difficult vegetables, he says. Parsley is also tricky, as it doesn’t germinate very quickly. But potatoes are easy, as too are onions, so long as the shoots are hidden under compost to hide them from birds. Tomatoes are best grown in pots but geraniums — or pelargoniums, as Ralph calls them, using the old-fashioned name — grow best in a trough. Petunias need a lot of sunshine and don’t like rain. Sweet peas, on the other hand, needs lots of water. The techniques and tools (spade, trowel and fork) — that Ralph uses are entirely traditional.The only big changes in his lifetime have been the introduction of specialist fertilisers and slug pellets — as a child, he used to peel off caterpillars by hand and stamp on any snails he found. He insists that there are no ‘magic secrets’ to gardening and that the most important ingredients are hard work and preparation. ‘People must de-stone the soil and sift it until it’s crumbly before they even think about sowing seeds,’ he says. ‘They must also weed constantly, especially at the beginning of the planting season.’ It was only in 1957, when the family moved to the detached house in Gloucester where he still lives, that he could put down roots, both metaphorically and literally, and create the garden of his dreams . Ralph follows his own advice. His garden is bursting with daffodils and the flowerbeds are stocked with purple hyacinths, winter jasmine, beautiful climbing plants and a flowering evergreen hedge of Berberis darwinii. A plum tree and two apple trees, all rigorously pruned to provide bumper crops, stand proudly in mid-lawn. Ralph Hoare as a baby with his mother in a garden . But it is the roses that fill Ralph with most pride. At the rear of his garden are some 200 floribunda and hybrid-tea bushes which in summer will produce flowers of many shades and a glorious scent. Despite his age and a creaky left knee, Ralph still does most of the work himself. He can still, with difficulty, plant potatoes, although he now uses a tall hoe for weeding and a grabbing tool for picking things up. His great-grandchildren help with dead-heading the roses  and weeding, but only under his close supervision. This year it’s been too cold to get out much. He is waiting until the end of the month to sow his onions and potatoes but doesn’t mind the delay. ‘Gardening is all about having something to look forward to,’ he says. ‘It gets me through the winter. If I’m ever depressed or lonely, I think to myself “never mind, the roses will be along soon”. It gives me the willpower to keep going.’ So too, it seems, does spreading the word on Twitter, though he sometimes needs help from family members to type the replies. ‘I’m not really into computers,’ he says. ‘I only use my iPad for email, Twitter and to place bets on horses. But if giving a bit of advice gets people into gardening, that can only be a good thing. They may all live past 100 then. As he walks steadily among the roses, leaning on his stick and breathing in the crisp, cold air, he says: ‘A-ha! I’ve remembered the name of the plant that begins with H and is good for north-facing gardens. It’s hydrangea.’ 1  Pour boiling water on parsley seeds once they are in the soil. It helps them to germinate. 2  Planting marigolds with tomatoes will stop the tomatoes getting greenfly. 3  Surround small plants with crushed up seashells or spiky gravel to keep slugs away. 4  If you have an unruly pampas grass, burn it down. The root will remain and regrow. 5  If your plant is an iron-lover, put rusty nails in water for a while, then use this as a fertiliser. 6  Prepare your soil in the moonlight, as this discourages weed growth. Seeds can’t germinate without sunlight. 7  Plants that spread rapidly, such as mint, can be contained by planting them in a long pipe, buried vertically. The roots have to go a long way down to spread. 8  Most plants like warmth, so water them with warm water. 9  To keep cut flowers fresh for longer, put a penny in the vase. The copper helps to kill bacteria. 10  Peeing on your garden can be beneficial. The urea contains nitrogen, which soil bacteria convert to ammonia so it can be taken up by plants. Peeing on tomato plants can apparently double their fruit production.","Ralph Hoare, 104, has been gardening since the tender age of six .

A runaway mom who went missing for 11 . years before walking into a police station last week did so because . there was an outstanding warrant for her arrest. Brenda Heist, who was eventually . presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going . missing from their Pennsylvania home, walked into the Alachua County Jail in Gainsville, Florida last Friday after violating her probation. The 53-year-old was released from jail a few weeks ago after being arrested for drug possession and driving with an expired tag in Pinellas County, Florida. Scroll down for video . Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police station last Friday . She gave police her alias Kelsie Lyanne Smith which alerted authorities that she was wanted in Pensacola for stealing a driving license. She was charged with forgery and giving a false name to police. Following her release, she did not report to her parole officer, according to WTSP leading to the warrant for her in Santa Rosa County. She will be transferred on Monday at the earliest to Santa Rosa County Jail. No bond has been set, authorities told ABC. It emerged this week that Heist had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind. Friends have spoken of their . shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her . runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out. For a time she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and living with friends. Pictures reveal her drinking, swimming and hanging out with her new acquaintances to whom she never told her real story. 'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her . friend's eyes, that are calling us today,"" Detective Sergeant Schofield, . who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online. Sondra Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.' Another friend who knew Heist as 'Lovie Smith' said she had no idea she was being deceived. 'I can’t believe she was being so dishonest… can’t believe she had . kids,' she told CBS Philly. Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania . Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants. She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce. When building her new life she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died. She never revealed she . had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been . murdered. 'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said. 'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.' It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - . lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients. When the deception was discovered she moved on again. Over the 11 years she is said to have three aliases.  She also went by Kelsei Smith and even served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered. For a time it seems she was homeless although where and when is unclear.  Her real identity didn't emerge until she turned up at a Florida police station this week. And as the news came out her family reacted in horror that they had been living a lie . Her daughter, Morgan Heist, 19, took to Twitter to reveal how angry she was after realizing her mother had willfully left. 'This doesn't . seem real. I feel like I'm in my own horrible nightmare and can't wake . up.' She also tweeted that she was glad her father was now exonerated of any blame or suspicion about his wife's disappearance. 'To every person who ever questioned my dads place in my moms dissapearance, (sic) take that.' Shock: New friends of Heist were shocked to hear of her real identity and that she'd left her family 11 years before . All grown up: Morgan Heist, pictured with her brother Lee, has said she wishes she had never cried for her missing mom who has finally showed up after eleven years . Morgan Heist's Twitter updates since finding out last Friday that her mom is still alive reveal a young woman whose joy has quickly turned to anger . On . Sunday she wrote: 'Tomorrow will be the day I will hopefully finally . get closure in my life. I need the truth more than anything.' But later that day she tweeted: 'My brother and I don't want contact with her as of now.' By the next day her tweets about her mom had become more negative: 'You were finally becoming less and less of a memory. Now? You're a horrible nightmare.' Since then they have continued in a similar vein. 'To think I would EVER want to talk to a woman like you.. I can't believe I wanted to possibly see you. F*** you ""mother."" Another read: 'You will never gain my love or respect. You deserve to rot in hell for what you have done to me.' Morgan also revealed to the media on Wednesday that knowing what she knows now, she wishes she never cried over her mom's fate. Heist’s ex-husband meanwhile has said he is angry but working on forgiveness. WATCH THE FULL PRESS CONFERENCE AT LANCASTERONLINE.COM . 'There were families who would not let our children play with theirs because of me,' says Lee Heist Senior. Heist's mother says she's since been released from police custody and is staying with a brother in northern Florida. Anger: Her children Morgan Heist, 19, and her brother Lee, 23, have reacted angrily to the news and say they want nothing to do with her . She was reported missing by . her husband on February 8, 2002. The then 42-year-old was last seen that morning dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, . Pennsylvania. Her car was found a few days later with no apparent sign of a struggle. Last Friday she walked into Monroe County Sheriff’s Office in Key Largo, Florida, and announced who she was. Heist has told detectives she left her family because the . pressure was too much and she snapped. She said she joined a group of homeless people that she met in a park who were hitch-hiking to Florida. Former home: Brenda Heist walked out on this house in Lititz, Pennsylvania on February 8, 2002 that she shared with her husband Lee and two children . Disbelief: Former neighbor Arlene Bingeman said she couldn't believe Heist could have left her children for such a long time, while Detective Schofield noted that she had never tried to call home . When she disappeared, Heist's daughter . was 8 and her son was 12. Her son recently graduated from West Chester . University and is applying to a police academy in New Jersey. Her . daughter is a sophomore at West Chester University. 'She said she thought of her family and her children every day, and her . parents. However, she never acted on that and never made any phone calls . – not one,' Lititz Police Detective John Schofield told 8WGAL. She told police that she had decided to turn herself in because she was at the end of her rope and was having health . problems. She now hopes to live with her mom in Texas. 'I can't believe that she would leave her two children,' former neighbor Arlene Bingeman told 8WGAL. 'I just can't, as a mother, I just can't believe that.' Local, state and federal authorities spent months investigating Heist's disappearance in 2002, interviewing dozens of relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers. She was entered into several national missing persons databases. Her husband eventually collected her life insurance policy in 2010.

The scales did not tip in favor of a man who was taking aerial video footage using  a drone helicopter and lost his equipment to a rooftop statue of Lady Justice. The $1500 camera ‘copped a feel of Lady Justice’s right breast’ said owner Terry Cline, before it found surer footing on the hilt of her sword. Cline, a freelance video producer, was taking unsolicited promotional footage for the city of Marion, Ohio April 27 when the flying camera was caught in some wind. Stuck: Video producer Terry Cline got his flying helicopter camera drone stuck in a rooftop statue in Marion, Ohio last week . It landed in one of the highest possible places, 100 feet up on the statue atop the Marion County Courthouse. Authorities were informed of the 7-pound, 9-inch remote–controlled drone the following Monday, at which point a small controversy erupted in the north-central Ohio town. Days of grumbling about who was responsible for retrieving the device, how it could be done, and how much it would cost ensued. ‘It may sit up there for a long time because we are not spending county dollars,’ Commissioner Andy Appelfeller told the Marion Star. ‘We’d certainly like to have it down, without a doubt, but I don’t think it’s the public, their obligation to get it down.’ Funny: Cline, pictured, joked that the piece of equipment 'copped a feel' from Lady Liberty before lodging into the hilt of her sword . High: The statue sits atop the Marion County, Ohio Courthouse and looks out over downtown Marion . While Appelfeller feared for the public’s wallets, Commissioner Dan Russell feared for their safety. 'In a worst case scenario, now, it could fall clear off the roof and hit something.' he said. And Commissioner Ken Stiverson was concerned about doing everything by the book and warned, ‘he needs to check with the prosecutor and our insurance company with his plan for retrieving his helicopter before he does anything.’ Even emergency workers threw their hands in the air. ‘I don’t know how to help him,' said fire chief Ralph Zwolle said. 'I wish I could. I would if I could, but it’s out of our reach.’ County commissioners said they certainly weren’t going to risk having someone lowered from a real helicopter to retrieve it, and the courthouse roof was too unstable for anyone to walk on it. Unlucky: Cline said a breeze blew the 9-inch helicopter into the statue as he took unsolicited promotional footage . It would have to stay where it was, they said. Cline even resorted to asking Sheriff Tim Bailey, a licensed pilot, if he would retrieve the helicopter and use the situation as a training exercise. Bailey said no. ‘Let’s put this in perspective,’ Bailey said. ‘He ran a helicopter into county property. It’s no different than if someone hit the courthouse with their car. We took a report. We’re done.’ After a week of back-and-forth, the dust-up ended unceremoniously. The helicopter was finally saved Saturday morning from the arms of Lady Justice by volunteer brothers Bart and Doug Hooper, who hung out a window with a long pole. Fortunately for Cline, he was able to keep his sense of humor all along. ‘All things considered,’ he told the Marion Star, ‘this is pretty funny.’ Cline said he was fearful he'd lose the equipment so integral to his photography business, so he ordered a new drone before he knew the first would come down. Now, he says, he has two. Saved: After a week-long bureaucratic dust-up, brothers Bart and Doug Hooper simply leaned out a window with a pole to snag the chopper . Pricey: Cline's camera cost $1500 and, before he knew it could be saved he bought another. 'Now I have two,' he said. The similar device pictured costs closer to $700.","Terry Cline was taking aerial footage in Marion, Ohio with the drone when a breeze lodged the $1500 flying camera into the rooftop statue ."

A 10-year-old thoroughbred racehorse forced to retire from the track has found a second career as an accomplished – and highly lucrative - painter. Slowed by bad knees, Metro Meteor was retired in 2009 and adopted by Ron and Wendy Krajewski in Rocky Ridge, Maryland. Unable to ride the crippled horse, Ron, a local artist, decided to teach Metro to paint in order to spend more time with him and it turned out the horse was a natural. After giving up the racetrack, Metro Meteor has found a new career as a successful painter who has sold more than $20,000 in abstract art . Once a successful turf sprinter, Metro Meteor is now making a name for himself as an abstract painter . Within just months of applying his first brush stroke to canvas, Metro has sold almost 200 paintings worth more than $20,000. Metro is now the best-selling artist at . Gallery 30, a small shop in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which started . selling his work four months ago. 'For his large paintings, there is a waiting list of 120,' Ron Krajewski told The Daily News. However he still has some way to go to match his winnings from his racing career which totaled $300,000. The Krajewskis donate half of Metro's earnings to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program and use the rest to pay his vet bills . 'Art scholars are not going to have long lengthy discussions trying to decipher the hidden meaning to Metro's paintings. He is a horse,' explains his owner . Metro paints his latest masterpiece while owners Ron and Wendy Krajewski look on at Motter's Station Stables in Rocky Ridge, Maryland . Before his injuries, Metro won eight races as a turf sprinter and was considered among the fastest at courses including Saratoga and Belmont Park. Metro's painting style features lots of colorful, sweeping brushstrokes, complete with specks of sawdust - not surprising as the horse paints by swinging his head with his paintbrush clenched between his teeth. 'Art scholars are not going to have long lengthy discussions trying to decipher the hidden meaning to Metro's paintings. He is a horse,' writes Ron on Metro's website. 'It is what it is. A painting you can hang on your wall and tell all your friends it was painted by a horse.' Horse and owner typically paint for an hour or two, maybe four times a week. Metro's painting style features lots of colorful, sweeping brushstrokes, complete with specks of sawdust . The Krajewskis donate half of Metro's earnings to New Vocations Racehorse Adoption Program, a charity that seeks homes and rehabilitation for retired racehorses. The owner of Gallery 30 also donates a portion of Metro's profits to a local animal shelter. 'We use the rest to pay for his medical bills,' said Ron Krajewski. 'The special treatment for his knees is very expensive.' Metro suffers from arthritis, cartilitis or frozen joints, and rapid bone growth, among other health issues. At first, his prognosis was bleak and if he continued to deteriorate, he could die within two or three years, his owners said. But recent X-rays showed that an experimental bone remodeling treatment had improved one knee, they said, and treatment on another knee will begin this month.

Antuna said Mata was charged with murder for an alleged gang shooting in Baldwin Park in 2010. However, the inmate was released before a clerk entered a hold for him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On the loose: Johnny Mata, 32, charged with murder in a 2010 gang shooting, was mistakenly freed from a Los Angeles jail last month and hasn't been seen since . 'Mata’s release should not have occurred because a murder charge had been filed by the District Attorney and a processing clerk had not yet entered it as a ""hold"" on inmate Mata,' a statement by the sheriff's department read. Authorities say they realized the mistake the next day. 'The detectives were actively searching for him and finally decided to ask for the public's help today,' Nicole Nishida of the sheriff's department told the Baldwin Park Patch. Antuna said authorities announced the error on Friday and sought the public's help after being unable to find Mata the past month. Wanted: Mata, described as a Latino man, 6 feet, 1 inch tall, 197 pounds, is also heavily tattooed as seen here . Antuna says that since 2012 the department, which processes 150,000 inmate releases annually, has had seven similar errors. 'The thing is that all were immediately apprehended but Mr Matas is still outstanding,' Capt Chuck Antuna of the LA County Sheriff's Dept told KCAL.

A British naval officer stands proudly displaying round his neck a pair of binoculars taken from a sullen U-boat commander moments after he surrendered. Now the German Zeiss binoculars have surfaced 68 years later as a valuable antique. Lieutenant Bill Elliott was pictured on the conning tower of the submarine wearing the newly-acquired binoculars while their defeated German owner glumly looks on behind him. End of the war: Lt. Bill Elliot wears the binoculars that were taken off the German commander (looking glum behind the British officer) after the U-boat surrendered in Dorset . He boarded the the U-249 after it sailed into Weymouth, Dorset at the end of World War Two. History: The German Zeiss binoculars which were seized from a U-boat commander after his surrender . Lt Elliott wrote in the vessel's visitor's book of his 'great pleasure' at being the first British seaman to board the captured U-boat. Both the binoculars and the book were handed down to his son Tony Elliot, who also went to to serve in the Royal Navy and became a commodore before retiring. Cdre Elliott used the trusty German binoculars throughout his navy career and even relies on them today while sailing his private yacht. He took them along with the book to BBC's Antiques Roadshow. and was told by Roadshow expert Graham Lay that the German Ziess binoculars were the best ever built. They were issued in 1943 to Oberleutnant Uwe Kock who was the commander of U-249, which shot down a British Mosquito plane in 1944, killing its navigator. On May 9, 1945 all German submarine commanders were instructed to surrender and U-249 arrived in Weymouth Bay, Dorset, the following day. Lt Elliott was ordered to take the surrender and command of the submarine. He signed the visitors' book: 'This submarine surrendered to the Royal Navy in Weymouth Bay on May 10, 1945. As first British commanding officer I have the greatest pleasure in signing the visitors' book.' Captured: Lieutenant Bill Elliott on the conning tower of the submarine. He wrote of his 'great pleasure' at being the first British naval officer to board the boat . Cdre Elliott, 68, from Monmouth, said: 'The first thing he liberated was this lovely pair of binoculars from Commander Kock as well as the visitors' book. 'He must have put them round his neck almost immediately as the photograph shows him and Kock on the conning tower in Weymouth Bay. 'He used the binoculars for the rest of his navy career and when he died I inherited them and used them for the remainder of my career at sea. Antique: BBC's Antiques Roadshow expert Graham Lay told Commander Tony Elliot that the German Ziess binoculars were the best ever built . 'I still use them today when I am out on my yacht. They are fantastic and have the most incredible optics.' Mr Lay said: ""' love Second World War binoculars because in my view they're some of the best binoculars ever built. 'They're incredibly bright. They're a fixed focus so you can't focus them. There is an adjustment for each eye piece. It is a very unusual find.' The binoculars are due to feature on the Antiques Roadshow this Sunday. Thirty-three German submarines surrendered in 12 days in a remote Scottish loch at the end of World War Two. The Highland fjord of Loch Eribol in the far north-west of Scotland was the only Scottish rendezvous point for U-boats. From May 10 to May 25, 1945, the 'grey wolves' as they were nicknamed, gave themselves up - their dream of starving Britain of food and raw materials over. For you the war is over: A German U-boat surrenders in the Thames in 1945 . They included U-1231, which was used as the fleet’s 'off-licence' and was laden with wine, and U-532 which had just returned from Japan and was carrying raw rubber, quinine and other supplies. Locals were sworn to secrecy and it has often been assumed that only 'two or three' crews gave themselves up in the sheltered inlet . The submarines were responsible for sinking or damaging 59 merchant ships and 14 warships — 300,000 tonnes of Allied shipping.","Naval officer Bill Elliott wore them on the submarine's conning tower .

Florida tycoon John Goodman, who founded The Palm Beach International Polo Club, has been granted a retrial after a juror at his first trail was adjudged to have lied to get on the jury. Goodman, 49, was convicted of DUI manslaughter and vehicular homicide last May and sentenced to 16 years in prison and a fine of $10,000. He was living under house arrest pending the decision of his appeal. Goodman's Bentley rammed into 23-year-old Scott Wilson's Hyundai and sent it into a canal in Wellington, in February 2010. Wilson, an engineering graduate, was strapped into the driver's seat and drowned. Polo tycoon: John Goodman now faces a retrial after his defense team successfully argued that a juror had lied during the selection process . Juror Dennis DeMartin, 69, was accused by Goodman’s defense of juror misconduct after not disclosing his ex-wife's DUI during jury selection. 'A juror who deceives to get on a jury in a high profile case for his own profit is a trial lawyer's worst nightmare,' Goodman's attorney Roy Black wrote in a statement. DeMartin had also been the subject of an April 2012 motion for a new trial based on a 32-page book he had self-published about the trial. In the book, DeMartin wrote about a trial-related drinking experiment in the midst of jury deliberations, where he downed three vodkas one night to determine if Goodman was drunk on the night of the crash.

The court decided that the book and . drinking experiment were inappropriate, but didn’t deprive Goodman of a . fair trial. The lying, however, changed the court's stance, reports ABC. Florida Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey . Colbath said DeMartin's antics had transformed an imperfect but fair . trial into a ‘constitutionally impermissible proceeding.’ In his book, DeMartin wrote about his . wife drinking, getting into an accident and being arrested for DUI. He . said he had a stroke soon after and divorced his wife after she met . someone else at a DUI program. ‘The Defendant contends, and this . Court finds, that DeMartin concealed highly relevant information, . namely, that his ex-wife had been convicted of a DUI,’ Colbath wrote. Goodman, the multimillionaire . founder of one of world's largest polo clubs, claimed in court that . his $200,000 car malfunctioned and lurched forward, slamming into . Wilson's vehicle. He has also denied being drunk at the . time of the crash, although other testimony has contradicted him and . his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit three hours . after the crash, according to prosecutors. Goodman fled the scene of the accident, authorities said. During his first trial, Judge Jeffrey Colbath condemned Goodman's actions, saying: 'He left to try and save himself.' Goodman reached a settlement with the Wilson family and will pay out $46million in compensation to them. Goodman also made headlines when he . adopted his girlfriend, Heather Hutchins, 42, in an attempt to preserve . part of his fortune for her while negotiating a civil suit settlement.

He added that the tragic case should serve as a warning to others as he said: 'Find a cab, find a friend. Don't drink and drive. 'This was a senseless, senseless accident because Mr Goodman chose to drive when he was too drunk.' According to Mr Colbath, the severity . of the original sentence had reflected the fact that Goodman knew what he was doing . when the fled the scene of the accident without calling 911. 'To avoid the liability, the criminal . responsibility, that he knew was going to visit him from the time of . the crash, he willfully left the scene of the crash,' the judge said. 'It was because he wanted to figure out a way to save himself.' Grieving: Lili Wilson, the victim's mother, wept when Goodman's 911 call was played in court .

'By dying at such a young age, he . will never get the opportunity to work as a professional after . graduating from engineering school. 'He will never have the opportunity to marry and have a family of his own.' Goodman also took the stand, saying: . 'I just wanted to say that from the day after the accident, all I've . wanted to do is reach out to the Wilsons and be with them and cry with . them. 'And I can't imagine or even pretend to imagine what it would be like to lose a son.' Impact: The crumpled car driven by Wilson, left, and the Bentley driven by Goodman, right.

Goodman was drunk when he rammed his black Bentley convertible into . Mr Wilson's car two years ago, causing it to roll into a canal. The millionaire disputed the claims and argued in court that the crash was the result of a malfunction with his brakes. Goodman left the scene and waited an . hour to call 911 while Scott drowned. He gave a dead cell phone battery . as the reason why he walked away from the crash scene. After the crash, Goodman's blood alcohol level was measured at .177 per cent, more than twice the legal driving limit.

The trend for baking has swept the nation of late, with cakes, cookies and confectionary fast becoming the 'It' food of choice. But while other bakers battle with candied flowers, butterflies or pretty pastel icing, one adventurous type has created an array of disgustingly realistic sweet treats - including fungal toe cookies (complete with your choice of corn or chilblains), severed ear cake-pops, or blackened lung cake. And if the Hertfordshire baker's cake covered in stubbed out cigarettes doesn’t whet your appetite, then how about a trashed trifle or a fish carcass cookie? Yummy: The severed toe cookies are incredibly realistic and come with either fungus, corns, or chilblain . Tempting? The ashtray cake may look like it has been attacked by chain smokers, but the cigarettes are in fact cookies covered in icing . For those with a strong stomach and a sweet tooth, there is a choice of three mini toe cookies - fungal nail, corn and chilblain - all of which look like they have been freshly severed from a body. The chilblain toe is even crafted to reveal a bone peeking out of the top. Similarly gruesome and realistic are the severed ear cake pops. Intricate: There is such a high level of  anatomical detail in both the severed toe cookies (right) and ear cake-pop (left) with wax inside the ears and harden skin on the underside of the toes . Originally designed for the Eat Your Heart Out:This Time It’s Anatomical 18+ pop-up cake shop last year, the ears even have wax visible inside. The ashtray cake comes complete with individual ‘cigarettes’ stubbed out all over it and in the ashtray on the top, some of which even have lipstick marks around the ends. The cigarettes are individually shaped biscuits that are then covered in icing and painted, while the tobacco around them is a mixture of crushed biscuits and dyed coconut. Also covered in the sweet cigarettes is the ‘Trashed Trifle’, which bizarrely has a (sweet) pork pie on it. Sorry for itself: The 'trashed trifle cake' perfectly emulates a cake in the aftermath of a party, with cigarettes, cheese on cocktail sticks and even a pork pie on it . Off-putting: The blackened lung cake shows the effects of smoking on the body (but still tastes delicious!) Deceiving: The fish carcass cookie might look like something you leave on your plate but it is a sweet treat . Designed to resemble a trifle left over after a party, it has canapé blocks of cheese on cocktail sticks abandoned on top - and it certainly accurately resembles a dish looking rather sorry for itself the morning after a big bash . One of the more foul offerings is the blackened lung cake, which, showing the effects of smoking on a pair of (sponge) lung, would put the most harden smoker off their next puff. These vile creations are the work of Nevie-Pie Cakes, a bakery based in Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire which usually sells less more attractive treats in the shape of handpainted wedding cakes.","Gross treats are the creation of Nevie-Pie Cakes, in Berkhamstead, Herts .

Most people associate going under the knife with backless hospital gowns and anaesthetic face masks, but that could be about to change. The patients of the future could be wheeled out of the operating theatre still humming the Dirty Dancing theme tune. Peterborough City Hospital is giving patients the opportunity to watch their . favourite film while in theatre to avoid them needing a general . anaesthetic. Iris Quirolo, 75, had hip surgery while watching The Sound of Music. She is pictured with anaesthetist Richard Griffiths who came up with the idea . Older patients undergoing certain orthopaedic procedures are being offered a film or TV programme as a way of keeping them relaxed and happy while their operation is carried out using local anaesthetic. The work is being led by consultant anaesthetist Dr Richard Griffiths who says this approach is proving to be of particular benefit to patients who carry an increased risk of reacting badly to a general anaesthetic. He said: ‘Patients really relax when they are watching their favourite films. Some have told us the TV can be so captivating that they are unaware that the operation has finished. ‘One patient watched the Sound of Music while undergoing a hip operation while another recently had a knee revision operation while watching the BBC nature documentary series The Blue Planet. ‘But the most popular movie at the moment, particularly among our older female patients, is Dirty Dancing.’ He added: ‘I am pleased that this idea is proving popular with patients as it means we can reduce the number of general anaesthetics given to older patients. ‘It is more common for this group of patients to experience unpleasant side effects coming round afterwards. ‘If they are happy to be awake and watch the TV, I am happy that they are going to have a better experience. The 1987 film Dirty Dancing is said to be the most popular choice among elderly female patients . Iris Quirolo, 75, from Werrington in Peterborough, was one of the first patients to benefit from the new technique. Ms Quirolo fell and broke her hip and required surgery to repair the fracture. She had previously had a bad reaction to a general anaesthetic so was offered the chance to be awake, and watching a film, during the surgery. She said: ‘I have had a general anaesthetic in the past and it took me ages to feel better afterwards. It made me feel terrible and I was dreading having to go through it again. ‘When Dr Griffiths told me that patients were being offered the chance to have a spinal anaesthetic and watch TV while the operation was going on I was really pleased and asked to have it straight away. ‘Dr Griffiths brought me a selection of DVDs to choose from and I decided to go for The Sound of Music as I love that film. ‘I wore earphones so that I could hear the film, although I did stop watching from time to time to have a chat with Dr Griffiths. ‘It was a good experience and a much better way to have an operation. I never expected this would be an option and I have vowed that if I ever need another operation like this I will ask to be able to watch TV again.’","Watching a film relaxes patients, so they only need local anaesthetic .

The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has found that people who live in the area are more likely to die from coronary heart disease than anywhere else in the UK. Their risk is more than three times higher than in Kensington and Chelsea in London - where people have the healthiest hearts, a BHF spokeswoman said. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has . found that people who live in Manchester are more likely to die from . coronary heart disease than anywhere else in the UK . Every year in Tameside, there are 132 deaths per every 100,000 people, while in the London borough the figure stands at just 39 per 100,000, she said. Ballymoney in Northern Ireland and Glasgow have the second and third highest death rates respectively, the charity said. The figures, which represent average death rates for the three years from 2009 to 2011, showed there were 129 deaths per 100,000 people living in Ballymoney and 128 per 100,000 people in Glasgow. Professor Peter Weissberg, the charity’s medical director, said: 'These latest figures expose staggering inequalities in deaths from heart disease across the UK. 'But it’s unacceptable that people continue to die from heart attacks, regardless of their postcode. 'Coronary heart disease is not beaten yet - it remains the single biggest killer in the UK.

The charity released the figures as part of its Fight For Every Heartbeat campaign.

A study of more than 5,000 civil servants found those who ate the most fried and sweet food, processed and red meat, white bread and butter and cream doubled their risk of premature death or ill health in old age. It adds to evidence that 'Western style food' is the reason why heart disease claims about 94,000 lives a year in the UK - more than any other illness. The findings published in The American Journal of Medicine are based on a survey of British adults and suggest adherence to the diet increases the risk of premature death and disability later in life.

Stuart Hall’s younger brother was cleared of indecently assaulting a 13-year-old girl after a three-day trial in 1991. Within minutes of the verdict, Keith Hall quit his job as deputy director of Essex Social Services, which he had held for 12 years. It was alleged during the trial that Mr Hall, then 56, fondled the girl in his office in Chelmsford and on another occasion while her mother, with whom he was having an affair, sat unaware in the same car. The girl alleged that Hall tried to kiss her up to 20 times between July 1989 and February 1990. Summing up at Norwich Crown Court, Judge Michael Hyam told the jury: ‘It is dangerous for you to convict on the evidence of the girl alone in the absence of corroboration. 'You have to decide whether it is likely a man of Mr Hall’s character would commit the offence.’ Mr Hall, of Stanway, near Colchester, who was chairman of the Essex child protection committee for two years, was unanimously acquitted. He had denied the allegations, describing them as ‘nonsense’. He said his relationship with the girl had been ‘normally affectionate’ and fatherly.

Justice has been done. 'I had the confidence of a man who was innocent and I was confident in British justice.’ He said he felt no bitterness to the girl and that his marriage was still strong. ‘I think most marriages have problems from time to time,’  he said. ‘My marriage has always been strong and will continue to be.’ Within minutes, the brother of Stuart Hall (pictured) quit his job as deputy director of Essex Social Services .

An MP had to be given life-saving treatment after eating a cake that contained nuts. Doctors had to intervene after Jo Swinson, 33, who has nut allergies, suffered a severe allergic reaction and began struggling to breathe. Miss Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire and a parliamentary aide to Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, suffered anaphylactic shock after attending the Colossal Cake sale, a Help for Heroes event at a Guide Hall in Bishopbriggs, near Glasgow. During the event on Saturday the politician, who has nut allergies, inadvertently ate a piece of cake that contained the ingredient. She began to feel unwell and took an antihistamine. However, around an hour later her condition worsened and she was taken to the Southern General Hospital. The MP was kept in overnight for observation and returned to work yesterday. Around one in 100,000 people in Britain have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 die annually. Foods such as peanuts, tree nuts  – including almonds, walnuts, cashews, and Brazil nuts – sesame, fish, shellfish, dairy products and eggs can all trigger a severe reaction, often referred to by the medical term anaphylaxis. Following her recovery Miss Swinson, who is Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Employment Relations, Consumer and Postal Affairs and a junior equalities minister, spoke of the frightening incident on Twitter. She said: ‘Thankfully now recovered from anaphylaxis episode yesterday: huge appreciation to the fab staff at Southern General for keeping me alive.’ Last night, a Lib Dem spokesman said the incident was ‘wholly accidental’. He added: ‘Miss Swinson spent the night in hospital as a precaution. She was back to work today as normal. She doesn’t like taking time off.’ Fellow politicians expressed their best . wishes. Tory health spokesman Jackson Carlaw tweeted: ‘All the best to . Jo Swinson following her near-death allergic reaction.’ Accident: Miss Swinson, MP for East Dunbartonshire, ate a piece of cake during a bake sale for Help for Heroes, unaware that it contained nuts . Anaphylaxis can affect the whole body, often within minutes of exposure to the substance that has caused the allergic reaction. Besides foods, wasp or bee stings, natural latex, penicillin or any other drug or injection can also trigger an attack. Symptoms typically include generalised flushing of the skin, a rash similar to that caused by nettle stings, a swelling of throat and mouth, and difficulty in swallowing or speaking. In the most severe cases, sufferers can collapse and fall into unconsciousness. Any allergic reaction occurs because the body’s immune system reacts inappropriately in response to the presence of a substance that it wrongly perceives as a threat. An anaphylactic reaction is caused by the sudden release of chemical substances, including histamine, from cells in the blood and tissues where they are stored. Hidden danger: Around one in 100,000 people in Britain have severe reactions to nuts and around 20 people die every year . This mechanism is so sensitive that minute quantities of the allergen can cause a reaction. The released chemicals act on blood vessels to cause the swelling in the mouth and anywhere on the skin. There is a fall in blood pressure and, in asthmatics, the effect is mainly on the lungs. Many people who know they have a serious allergy carry adrenaline auto-injectors. Adrenaline, also known as epinephrine, acts quickly to constrict blood vessels, relax smooth muscles in the lungs to improve breathing, stimulate the heartbeat and help to stop swelling around the face and lips. The Colossal Cake sale is an annual event run through Help For Heroes to raise funds for the country’s servicemen and women. Last year a total of 700 individual sales were held around the country to help the wounded. Scots TV star Lorraine Kelly is a patron of the charity. Speaking at the launch of the event, she said: ‘I am honoured to be a patron.

A British holidaymaker grabbed a six-foot shark by its tail and dragged it away from a group of toddlers as they played in shallow water off the coast of Australia. Paul Marshallsea, 62, was praised by the coastguard for his bravery after he rushed from a beach-side barbecue to keep the children safe. The drama unfolded as the father-of-three was cooking for his wife Wendy, 56, daughter Rachel, 21, and friends on Bulcock Beach on Queensland's sunshine coast when they heard screams of 'shark'. He raced down to the beach's shoreline to find a two-meter Dusky Whaler shark thrashing in the shallows, spreading panic among the dozens of youngsters paddling in the water. Scroll down to watch .

'I think it would be incredible to be able to do that [estimate the cost of compensation] now because first of all what needs to happen is that we need to be able to get a grip on what happened and of course, in the meantime, co-operate with the police.

At least eight professional footballers in English leagues have told their teammates they are gay but do not want to tell the public because they fear fans will turn against them. The first - and so far only - professional player to come out and continue playing was Justin Fashanu in 1990. He retired in 1994, blaming his downfall on prejudice in the English game and hanged himself in May 1998 at the age of 37. Seven of the eight footballers have told Clarke Carlisle, chairman of the Professional Footballer's Association, that they do not want to make their sexual orientation known because they are concerned about the reaction from fans and the media, reports The Observer. Robbie Rogers recently came out but left Leeds United after the announcement - saying staying in football was 'impossible' if it is known you are gay . In Britain, no professional players have come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990 . It comes in the week that basketball player Jason Collins became the first professional sportsman in the United States to reveal he was gay. Chris Basiurski, chairman of the Gay Football Supporters' Network, told the Observer that he knew of players whose sexuality was known within the game. He said: 'We have anecdotal evidence that players are out within their clubs and don't have a problem. We are trying to create an atmosphere for people to come out safely, but at the moment there is a big barrier. 'The danger is what happens when a player comes out and gets loads of support and attention, but then start playing badly. 'The worry is that fans will start getting on their backs and they may lose the confidence of their manager and it could be connected to their sexuality.' In February former Leeds United footballer Robbie Rogers, 25, revealed he was gay, but only after announcing his retirement from the sport. He said staying in football was 'impossible' if it is known you are gay. Last week it emerged the American footballer is considering a return with LA Galaxy. Rogers, who played for Leeds and Stevenage in England, has begun light work in his homeland with David Beckham's former team, but said he isn't ready to fully re-immerse himself in the sport. 'There's a good chance that I might come back to [football] but I need a few months to chill out, hang out with my family, go surf in California, just relax,' he told CNN. Collins, who played most recently for the Washington Wizards in an NBA career spanning 12 seasons and six teams, came out in an article with Sports Illustrated magazine. In the United States, basketball player Jason Collins used an article in Sports Illustrated to announce he was gay this week . The 34-year-old wrote: 'I'm a 34-year-old NBA centre. I'm black. And I'm gay. 'I didn't set out to be the first openly gay athlete playing in a major American team sport. But since I am, I'm happy to start the conversation. I wish I wasn't the kid in the classroom raising his hand and saying, ""I'm different."" 'If I had my way, someone else would have already done this. Nobody has, which is why I'm raising my hand.'",Nobody has come out in British football since Justin Fashanu in 1990 .

Upset: Paul Marshallsea, 62, saved some toddlers from a shark but has lost his job because he was off work with stress . When footage emerged of Paul Marshallsea wrestling with a shark to keep toddlers safe on an Australian beach, his bravery won global praise and admiration. But his seaside heroics failed to impress some back home – namely his employers. At the time, Mr Marshallsea, 62, was signed off from his job at a children’s charity due to stress and had taken a two-month break in the sunshine with his wife. However, after seeing the video of him grappling with the 6ft dusky whaler shark, his bosses have terminated his employment due to a ‘breakdown of trust’. He was informed of his sacking in a letter, which read: ‘Whilst unfit to work you were well enough to travel to Australia and, according to recent news footage of yourself in Queensland, you allegedly grabbed a shark by the tail and narrowly missed being bitten by quickly jumping out of the way. It continued: ‘The breakdown of the trustees’ confidence and trust in you and your ability to perform the role is so great that we find that dismissal is the only course of action we can recommend.’ Mr Marshallsea, from Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales, now fears he will struggle to find a new job. He said: ‘What am I going to do now? There’s not much call for shark-wrestlers in Merthyr Tydfil.’ Break: Paul, with his wife Wendy and daughter Rachel on holiday in Australia, but his decision to rush into the sea to wrestle a shark has cost him his job . Brave: With no thought for his own safety, Mr Marshallsea grabbed the shark by the tail, narrowly escaping its gnashing jaws, and and dragged it out to deeper water . Incredible: The moment Mr Marshallsea made dangerous contact with the shark was captured by an Australian TV crew filming in the area . He and his wife Wendy, 56, who has . also been sacked, were both given extended sick leave by the Pant & . Dowlais Boys and Girls Club where they have worked for ten years. He said the charity had become so . successful that he and Wendy, a senior youth worker, were working seven . days a week and ‘burned out’. They say they were simply  following medical advice by going to Australia. The couple were on Bulcock Beach when . a fin was spotted in the water. Hearing cries of ‘Shark!’, Mr . Marshallsea ran into the waves and pulled the shark away. Disappointment: Mr Marshallsea with a copy of the letter he received from the charity . Feeling down: Paul says he does not know what to do and has become an unpaid volunteer elsewhere . A TV crew nearby filmed the incident, . which was shown around the world. Yesterday the grandfather said: ‘If I . hadn’t gone in to save the kids on that beach that day my wife and I . would still have a job … to sack us both without any sort of discussions . first is just disgusting.’ Mr Marshallsea, who earned £18,000 . and his wife, who was on £12,000, said they will not be taking legal . action against their employer.

The BBC will compensate Stuart Hall's victims, it emerged yesterday as more women came forward claiming they were molested. Lord Patten, chairman of the BBC Trust, confirmed the corporation would be liable although he refused to put a figure on the payouts. But taking into account claims from Hall's victims, as well as Jimmy Savile's, the BBC's compensation bill is likely to run into millions of pounds. Lord Patten told The Andrew Marr Show that a review in to the Jimmy Savile scandal would also include questions over how Stuart Hall was able to abuse his victims . Stuart Hall was described as an 'opportunistic predator' at Preston Crown Court on Thursday . It came as a further six alleged victims of Hall contacted lawyers, as police said they had already spoken to a number of associates of Hall and vowed to investigate the fresh claims thoroughly. Several victims have already spoken out about the abuse they suffered at the hands of Hall, including Kim Wright, who sparked the investigation. And yesterday it emerged that in August 1986 – a few weeks after Hall abused an 11-year-old girl – police raided a pool party at the presenter's home after complaints by his neighbours. Officers discovered the presenter naked in the garden as a female guest swam in the nude in his pool. Police warned Hall to keep the noise down and left the party. Yesterday Lord Patten told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'Plainly there was something about the celebrity culture in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s which meant people were prepared apparently to turn a blind eye to behaviour that wasn't just eccentric but thoroughly unpleasant.' MPs and Hall's victims have called on the BBC to investigate the former commentator and news presenter after he pleaded guilty to assaulting 13 girls, the youngest of whom was nine, between 1967 and 1986. The review by Dame Janet Smith into Jimmy Savile with also investigate how the former It's A Knockout host gained access to his victims . Hall was awarded an OBE for his services to broadcasting and charity last year . Despite allegations some of Hall's victims were abused on BBC premises, Lord Patten ruled out a separate inquiry, saying the Dame Janet Smith review into the Savile scandal would be widened instead. He added: 'We have to provide answers which will satisfy people that we have been prepared to deal with our own dirty washing.' The National Association for People Abused in Childhood charity said: 'The BBC gave Hall unfettered opportunities to carry out his abuse, and owes it to his victims to open a new inquiry that can scrutinise his behaviour and the colleagues who may have helped him.' Jimmy Savile's time at the BBC is being reviewed by Dame Janet Smith . Conservative MP Rob Wilson said: 'My gut instinct is the BBC are not using the Smith Review to get to the truth and are instead using it to do the minimum necessary to carry on as before.' Yesterday, a former colleague, Linda McDougall, said BBC bosses must have known about his behaviour. She said she was sexually harassed almost every day during the  four years she worked with Hall  on regional programme Look North in the late 1960s, but was told  by watching staff 'not to make such a fuss'. She said: 'If I knew, if others knew, I cannot imagine those who were our bosses did not know. 'Never a day would go by that he did not touch me. 'He tried everything. He could stroke your knee or tweak your stocking top, put his hand on your breast or rub your back. For me – and my female colleagues – Hall was a damned nuisance. 'He was offensive and seemed unable to talk to a woman without touching her.' Lying low at his £2million mansion at the weekend, married Hall, 83, was feeling sorry for himself, saying: 'I feel so rough; I feel like death I am afraid. 'All you can do is wish me the best for the future.' He is being backed by his family, with son Daniel Hall, 50, a solicitor, paying tribute to 'a superb father and grandfather' who was awarded the OBE in 2011 for 'a lifetime of good work [which] should not be whitewashed in one brushstroke'.","Lord Patten, BBC Trust chairman, refused to put figure on payouts .

The men on a motorcycle killed Chaudhry Zulfikar as he left his home and headed to a hearing in the case. Chaudhry Zulfikar was at the helm of a number of highly controversial cases, including the 2007 Bhutto assassination in which Musharraf is accused of involvement. Killed: Gunmen have shot dead Chaudhry Zulfiqar Ali  the prosecutor investigating the murder of Pakistan's ex-leader Benazir Bhutto . He was also prosecuting militants linked to the 2008 terror attack in the Indian city of Mumbai. Zulfikar was on his way to a court in . Islamabad when gunmen fired at him from a taxi, hitting him in the . head, shoulder and chest, said police officer Mohammed Ishaq. Zulfikar then lost control of his car, which hit a woman passer-by and killed her, said another police officer, Mohammed Rafiq. Zulfikar's guard, Farman Ali, returned fire and is believed to have wounded at least one of the attackers, Rafiq said. Ali also was injured in the attack. Police official Yasin Farooq said the . attackers fled after killing Zulfikar, and that a massive search has . been launched to find them. Attack: Security officials inspect the damaged car, which prosecutor Chaudhry Zulfikar was travelling in, when he came under attack by unidentified gunmen . Murder: Zulfikar, the prosecutor investigating the 2007 assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, one of the most shocking events in Pakistan's turbulent history, was shot dead on Friday . A motive for the killing was unclear, . but Zulfikar's involvement in the two particularly high-profile cases . will likely be scrutinized closely. Government prosecutors have accused . Musharraf of being involved in the Bhutto assassination and not . providing enough security to Pakistan's first female prime minister. Musharraf, who was in power when was killed, has denied the allegations. At the time of the attack, he blamed the assassination on the Pakistani . Taliban. The Bhutto case has lingered for . years in the Pakistani court system. A number of alleged assailants are . on trial but no one has been convicted. The case burst into the . headlines when Musharraf returned in March after four years in exile. Zulfikar was also the government's . lead prosecutor in a case related to the 2008 terrorist attack on the . Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people. Investigation: Pakistani security officials inspect the vehicle of Chaudhry Zulfiqar this morning . Devastated: Qamar Abbas (seconf left) the son of slain government prosecutor Chaudhry Zulfiqar looks at the bullet-riddled car . The attack was blamed on the Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba. Pakistan has put seven men on trial . on charges they assisted in the Mumbai siege, but the trial has made . little progress. India has criticized Pakistan for not doing more to . crack down on the militants blamed for the attack. Hafiz Saeed, the head . of a group believed to be a front for Lashkar-e-Taiba, remains free, . and many believe he enjoys the protection of the government. Lashkar-e-Taiba was founded years ago . with the help of Pakistani intelligence to put pressure on India over . the disputed territory of Kashmir. Musharraf returned to Pakistan to . make a political comeback despite Taliban death threats and a raft of . legal cases against him. But his fortunes have gone from bad to worse . since he arrived. Judges barred him from running in the . May 11 parliamentary election not long after he arrived because of his . actions while in power. A court in the northwestern city of . Peshawar went further this week and banned Musharraf from running for . public office for the rest of his life - a ruling the former military . strongman plans to appeal. Musharraf is currently under house . arrest on the outskirts of Islamabad in connection with several cases . against him, including the Bhutto case. He also faces allegations of . treason before the Supreme Court. Zulfikar was headed to a hearing . related to Musharraf and the Bhutto case at a court in Rawalpindi, next . to Islamabad, when he was killed, said Ishaq, the police officer. Musharraf seized power in a military . coup in 1999 when he was serving as army chief and ruled for nearly a . decade until he was forced to step down in 2008 because of growing . discontent with his rule. Though Pakistan has experienced . repeated violence, it's rare for such an attack to happen in the . capital, which is home to high-ranking government and military . officials, diplomats and international aid workers. Friday's killing comes at a sensitive time for Pakistan, which is preparing for nationwide elections on May 11. The vote will mark the first time . that an elected civilian government has fulfilled its term and handed . off power to another civilian government in the country. Pakistan has experienced three coups, including the one led by Musharraf in 1999. President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the prosecutor's killing and called for a thorough investigation.","The men on a motorcycle killed Chaudhry Zulfikar as he headed to a hearing .

He added that he did not want to help Mr Cheney 'succeed in his political strategy’. ‘I just thought the Democrats ought to have as much fun on their side as we're having on our side,’ Mr Cheney said.

When David Knapp found out his son-in-law was set to pick up an eBay purchase from the home  where he was raised by his own parents, he was intrigued enough to go along for the ride. But the grandfather's curiosity turned to astonishment when the bungalow's owner, after learning of his history in the house, handed him a bracelet his late mother Emily had lost decades earlier. The 66-year-old grandfather-of-six admitted he was overwhelmed to be presented with the silver trinket stamped with his mother's initials - that he didn't even know she had lost. What are the chances? David Knapp, 66, holds up the silver bracelet which belonged to his mother that he was reunited with after a chance encounter with the new owner of his childhood home . Mr Knapp's parents lived at the bungalow in Costock, Nottinghamshire, which was built by his grandfather, after they got married in 1936 until they sold it and moved to Nottingham in 1985. 'It's overwhelming to be honest,' Mr Knapp said. 'The owners held up a bracelet which they said they found while they were gardening outside the bedroom window. 'The bracelet had the initials ER on it. My mother's maiden name was Richards and her first name was Emily. 'I must admit I didn't even know mum had the bracelet, let alone lost it, until I was shown it.'

Mr Knapp grew up at the property with his two sisters and lived there until he got married when he was 28-years-old. So he was already stunned when his son-in-law Andrew told him that he had to visit the property to pick up a sofa that he'd bid for an the auction site eBay. And the retired computer worker had another shock when the owner of the bungalow gave him a silver bracelet which his mother had lost. 'I think it must be her engagement bracelet because there's a shape of a heart on it,' he added. 'Mum must have lost the bracelet when I was very young, probably while she was gardening. 'We'll keep it. It's of more sentimental value than monetary value.' Heirloom: Mr Knapp says he'll keep the bracelet, which he thinks must have been given to his mother as an engagement present because it has a heart on it . The bracelet's finder Annie Sherman, who has since moved out of the bungalow, said she was delighted she was able to reunite the jewellery with its owner. She said: 'I dug it up while I was making a flower bed and I kept it because I thought it was rather sweet. 'I had a lump in my throat when I gave him the bracelet. It's now back with its rightful owners.'","David Knapp, 66, was already stunned when son-in-law told him he was set to pick up purchase from his childhood home .

The National Rifle Association has launched an iPhone app that lets users fire 'true to life firearms'. The powerful gun lobby's app, NRA: Practice Range, includes a shooting range feature and can be used by children. The timing of the release is controversial in light of the ongoing debate in America about gun control following the Sandy Hook massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Scroll down for video .

Reload: The game can be downloaded from Apple's ios store and can be used by children, coming with a rating of 4+ . In the wake of the incident, the NRA linked the shootings to violent video games, leading some to label their new venture as hypocritical. Wayne LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, pointed to 'vicious, violent video games' in remarks last month. The powerful gun lobby's new app, rated 4+, has been described as the group's 'new mobile nerve centre'. The app's description says it 'offers a 3D . shooting game that instills safe and responsible ownership through fun . challenges and realistic simulations'. It also states: 'It strikes the right balance of gaming and safety . education, allowing you to enjoy the most authentic experience . possible.' The app is free to download from Apple's ios store, but users can pay a $0.99 fee once downloaded to access more advanced weapons. Hypocritical: Some commentators have described the app as hypocritical after the NRA previously criticised violent computer games . In the game users are provided with three levels in which to shoot: an indoor range, an outdoor range and a skeet shoot. The app also features gun safety tips and information about firearms laws. Throughout the game various tips flash upon the screen, including the advice 'Use only the correct ammunition for your gun' and 'always keep the gun pointed in a safe direction'. NRA officials travelled to the White House only days ago to discuss gun control. Vice President Joe Biden is currently heading up a taskforce looking at gun control in America, while the New York senate today passed a gun control bill. Safety: The app also offers users advice, information on gun laws and safety tips about firearms . After the Washington meeting, the NRA's Wayne LaPierre said: 'We were disappointed with how little this meeting had to do with keeping our children safe and how much it had to do with an agenda to attack the Second Amendment.' 'While claiming that no policy proposals would be 'prejudged,' this Task Force spent most of its time on proposed restrictions on lawful firearms owners — honest, taxpaying, hardworking Americans. 'It is unfortunate that this Administration continues to insist on pushing failed solutions to our nation's most pressing problems.

It wouldn't be too surprising to many if New York were to be declared the most exciting city in the coutry, but when it doesn't even make the top 5, eyebrows are raised. The city that never sleeps was beaten by the city of Oakland, in a list compiled by real estate blog Movoto. Oakland, California beat all other major American cities however the website didn't ask for people's opinions but instead claims it used a more scientific method. Scroll down to see the full list... Appearances: It might not look it, but Oakland is a really 'exciting' place to be . Despite the fact that New York City is large and crammed with people and things to do, Movoto instead decided to work out which city was best by using ten criteria that they believed make a city 'exciting.' The calculations took into account park acreage, percentage of young adults, low concentrations of big box stores and fast food restaurants, diversity of its population as well as bars, museums and movie theaters per square mile. Movoto blogger David Cross wrote: 'This isn't a perfect definition, but you can think of our list as ways to fight that ever-present boredom everyone faces at some point or another.' The Big Apple ended up coming in at number six whilst the city whose nickname is Oaktown came in at number one. Too much of a good thing: The survey found that too many fast food restaurants make NYC less 'exciting' Oakland, CA . Boston, MA . San Francisco, CA . Seattle, WA . Washington, D.C. New York, NY . Milwaukee, WI . Atlanta, GA . Philadelphia, PA . Portland, OR . Oakland is often the subject of bad press because of its high crime rate. The city is usually seen as the poor sister to the city across the bay, San Francisco. It came third in Movoto's list. 'When we think of an exciting place to live, we think about places where there is always something to do — whether it’s eating at new restaurants or jogging through a park. Depending on the category we looked at a criterion on a per-person or per-square-mile basis,' the blog states. 'To be very clear, we looked at each individual city’s size; this excludes suburbs or nearby cities. In other words, it’s not covering an entire metro area.' Oakland did best on it's population diversity, museums per square mile and hip theater scene. Even the New York Times suggested Oakland ranked amongst the 'Top Five Places to Visit' last year. However, not everyone is impressed with Oakland's new found fame. Oakland-born playwright Chinaka Hodge told local hip hop blog 38th Notes. 'I take issue with the idea that Oakland is worth visiting only because new has supplanted old...That notion supposes that everything I’ve loved about my city for the last 27 years is void, The [New York Times] blurb invites those who would not otherwise be interested in the cultural backbone of my city to descend and take, as opposed to respectfully visit and interact.'","New York ranked 6th on the list of America's 'most exciting cities'

From Anne Boleyn's iconic pearl choker to her daughter Elizabeth I's enormous lace ruffs, fashion in the Tudor and Stuart periods was just as creative, outrageous and fascinating as it is today. Most glamorous of all were the denizens of the Royal court, whose sumptuous garments are the subject of a new exhibition at Buckingham Palace. In Fine Style: The Art of Tudor and Stuart Fashion includes some of the most famous artworks from the Royal Collection, as well as some examples rare surviving garments from the period. Fashion fit for a king: This portrait of Henry VIII, painted during his marriage to Anne Boleyn, has been attributed to Joos van Cleve . Lovely in lace: Anne of Denmark, left, the wife of James I, and Mary of Modena, right, second wife of James II . Beginning with the early 16th century, the exhibition traces the changing tastes of the royal courts and the spread of fashion through Europe. Although fashion wasn't wholly confined to the upper echelons of society, it was increasingly important for the aristocracy whose duties included reflecting the glory of the monarchy through splendid attire. As a result, competition for the best designs was fierce, and led to an insatiable search for novel and outlandish creations. Tragic wife: Queen Henrietta-Maria of France was the consort of Charles I, who was executed in 1649 . But courtiers didn't get their own way on every sartorial matter. Both Henry VIII and Elizabeth I enforced laws dictating the fabrics, colours and types of garments that could be worn at each level of society. The most luxurious - including gold cloth, textiles dyed crimson red and certain types of fur such as ermine - were reserved exclusively for use by the monarch and his or her highest-ranking courtiers. Purple velvet, the most expensive of all fabrics, was reserved for the monarch alone. Whatever the fabric, Tudor clothes were all made by hand, and as a result far more expensive than their modern equivalents. Monarch: The second Stuart to reign, King Charles I, and the last of the Tudor dynasty, Elizabeth I . Handmade lace, clothes that utilised real silver and gold, and linen that took several months to produce were all regularly used. Perhaps the luxury of Tudor and Stuart clothes isn't so surprising when you consider that the taste-makers of the day were the King and Queen themselves. Henry VIII's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, is credited with popularising both Spanish blackwork embroidery and the farthingale, a hooped underskirt. His second, the glamorous Anne Boleyn, made daring French hoods, long, pointed sleeves and neat chokers fashionable, while her successor Jane Seymour championed the heavy - and modest - gable hood. Boleyn's daughter Elizabeth supported the trend for long-fingered gloves, which elongated the wearer's hands and showed they did not do manual labour. Men also left their mark. In 1666, Charles II invented the precursor of the three piece suit, which included a long vest worn under a coat instead of the traditional doublet and coat. The fashion spread quickly, and diarist Samuel Pepys was among the dandies to adopt it. Rare pieces: Few jewels and even fewer garments dating from the Tudor and Stuart period survive . Although few of the period garments themselves have survived, paintings in which they take pride of place have done. Among . those on show are several of Elizabeth I, including a Nicholas Hilliard . miniature and the famous William Scrots portrait of the future queen as . a teenager. Other . highlights include Marcus GheeradtsThe Younger's portrait of Anne of . Denmark, wife to King James I, and a Sir Anthony van Dyck triptych of . the doomed King Charles I. In .

Prison: Khalid Missouri now works as a solicitor at Southampton Crown Court where he was sentenced for robbery in 1993 . A man jailed for his part in an armed robbery is now working as a senior lawyer in the very court where he was sent down, sparking an extraordinary legal row. The criminal-turned-solicitor was even asked by one of his robbery  co-defendants to act for him in a subsequent sex assault case. Khalid Missouri, 42, was jailed for seven years for his role in a raid in which staff at a Post Office branch were threatened by masked thugs wielding a gun and a knife. Mr Missouri, the getaway driver, waited outside in a car while two other gang members burst into the branch at Calmore near Southampton. But despite his conviction for robbery in 1993, Missouri has been allowed to qualify as a solicitor after his release from prison – and now works in the same Southampton Crown Court where he was sentenced. The lawyer insisted yesterday he had been completely open about his past with the Law Society, the solicitors’ professional body, before he qualified as a lawyer in 2005. But The Mail on Sunday has learnt that his career change has sparked astonishment in legal circles. Concerns were laid bare when one of Mr Missouri’s former co-defendants in the robbery, Fouad Benabbou, who wielded the knife, applied to have the lawyer help defend him on a sex assault charge. Court records from 2011 – which  can only now be published – reveal that Southampton Crown Court’s senior judge, Derwin Hope, blocked Benabbou’s application for legal aid for the defence work because he  was ‘extremely concerned’ about the arrangement. The request was eventually allowed on appeal, but only after another judge appeared to make clear his surprise that the lawyer could represent his former co-defendant. Mr Missouri last night said that one of his law firm’s colleagues – not himself – went on to act for Benabbou, who was jailed for four years last August after being convicted on two counts of sexual assault. In a statement yesterday, Mr Missouri said: ‘With regard to my conviction some 20 years ago, I can only reiterate how deeply sorry and ashamed I still am for my actions. I was rightly punished and have since tried my utmost to make amends. Surprise: News of Khalid Missouri's previous conviction was said to be the talk of the robing room at Southampton Crown Court, Hampshire . ‘I disclosed my previous conviction to the Law Society well before my admission to the roll of solicitors. I have been a solicitor for some eight years and have an exemplary record of professional conduct.’ In a statement, the Law Society said that a criminal conviction was not a complete bar to practise in every instance. A spokesman added: ‘The Society would have looked closely at all the facts before allowing entry to the profession.’ But one fellow Southampton lawyer expressed his surprise at the situation, saying: ‘This is the talk of the robing room in the court. ‘There is surprise that someone with such a serious offence can be working as a solicitor-advocate in court – especially the same one he was sent down in.’","Khalid Missouri was jailed for seven years after Post Office raid .

Defence: Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, from South Millford, Leeds, was 'mentally unwell' at the time of the bottle-throwing incident, his legal team have claimed . A father of two who hurled a bottle onto the track moments before Usain Bolt’s iconic 100m Olympic victory was 'mentally unwell' at the time, his legal team have claimed. Ashley Gill-Webb, 34, is accused of barging to the front of the stadium and hurling a barrage of abuse before throwing the green, plastic bottle at the sprinters. Gill-Webb, from South Millford, Leeds, was due to stand trial over the incident in September after pleading not guilty to using threatening words or behaviour with intent. However, this was later abandoned after he was sectioned under the mental health act. An alternative charge was added during the hearing at Thames Magistrates' Court today which alleges that Gill-Webb did cause the . distress but without the intent. He indicated a not . guilty plea. District Judge Jacqueline Comyns agreed to put Gill-Webb's trial off until January to give the defence time to gather  psychiatric report. She said: 'He (Gill-Webb) is admitting that he did the act but . it is a question of whether he was aware of what is in the charge or . whether he intended it in the other charge.' 'All it comes down to in effect is whether he knew what he was doing.' The judge also warned: 'I am not having this trial vacated, if he is not ready then that is unfortunate.' Gill-Webb, who was banned from all Olympic . venues after the incident, is still receiving mental health treatment at the Bootham Park Hospital, in York, the court heard. Today, wearing a black suit with white shirt and blue tie, he sat blinking and looking nervously around the courtroom during the short hearing. Defending, Thomas Barley said: 'The trial issue is essentially at the time of the offence Mr Gill-Webb’s mental state.' 'It seems now that this is plainly to be a case where the actual physical behaviour of Mr Gill-Webb isn’t going to be in dispute, the defence are not going to be asking for any prosecution witnesses to be called.'

The 32-year-old judoka tweeted at the time: 'A drunken spectator threw a bottle onto the track! I HAVE BEATEN HIM... unbelievable.' Explaining the message, she later described how she saw a man who was having 'behaviour problems' and 'pushed him away hard'. 'I did like any other person would have done, I corrected it. I just said, ""Man, you’re crazy, what are you doing?"",' she said. 'We are here for Olympic heroes, people who are performing on the highest level, and we have to honour them, not disrespect them.' She added: 'The one thing I’m most sad about is, due to all the commotion, due to this guy, I missed out on the 100m.' Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who won the race in 9.63 seconds, said he had been unaware of the incident. U.S. sprinter Justin Gatlin, who took bronze, said: 'It was a little distraction and I didn’t know what it was. But when you’re in those blocks and the whole stadium’s quiet, you can hear a pin drop.' He said the incident had not affected the race: 'You just have to block it out and go out there and do what you got to do.' And Jamaican sprinter Yohan Blake said: 'I was so focused I didn’t see anything. I was so focused on just running to the line.' Gill-Webb was bailed to live at his home address or the hospital, and a condition not to enter any Olympic venues was removed. Unfazed: Usain Bolt, left, who won the 100m race, said he had not noticed the bottle, while his countryman Yohan Blake, right, said he was 'so focused' on the finish line he hadn't seen the bottle either .

A frail pensioner died from pneumonia after being trapped under a cupboard in his home for four days, an inquest heard. Stanley West's horrified neighbour Jane Craufurd found the 83-year-old in agony after the large piece of kitchen furniture fell on him. Mr West had several days of beard growth on his face and had not taken his epilepsy pills for four days. Tragic: Stanley West's horrified neighbour found the 83-year-old in agony after the piece of kitchen furniture fell on him at his home near the village of Tadley, Hampshire (pictured) Mrs Craufurd, who had popped round to take Mr West a flask of hot water following a power cut, could only see his hand protruding from beneath the bottom of the cupboard, which was blocking the kitchen doorway. She rang the emergency services before reaching through a tiny gap to hold the dying pensioner’s hand as he whimpered in agony. Police and emergency crews arrived at the house on Pamber End, Hampshire, and hauled the heavy cupboard off Mr West before rushing him to hospital. He died the following day in Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital from pneumonia and hypothermia despite medics' efforts. Mrs Craufurd told the inquest at Alton Magistrates’ Court, that she returned from a holiday in France on August 19, and went to see Mr West on August 21. Horror: Mr West was rushed to Basingstoke and North Hampshire Hospital but died the following day . She said: 'I had a back door key but wouldn’t need to use it because he left the door unlocked. I always knocked on the door but wouldn’t expect a reply and would go straight in. 'I saw the kitchen cupboard was on the floor, could see a small part of his arm and could hear him groaning.' PC Ian Wonnacott, from Basingstoke police station, was called to the incident at 10.40am. He said: 'He was lying on his back with a large piece of furniture on him. 'He was conscious and breathing, although it was hard to understand what he was saying.' Mr West’s brother, David West, also from Basingstoke, told the inquest that he saw the tragic pensioner only occasionally, but the 20-year age gap between them meant they were never close. Speaking about the cupboard, he said: 'If he [Stanley] had fallen and leant on it, the weight would have made it fall.' David told the inquest his brother had spent some time at a care home in 2010, following a collapse, but lived on his own in the neighbourhood where he had spent his entire life. North East Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley described the circumstances of Mr West’s death as 'a very sad matter.' He recorded a verdict of accidental death, adding: 'He had been trapped for four days by a cupboard that had fallen.' Friends and neighbours today paid tribute to Mr West as a 'lovely' but 'private' man. Mr West, who was known to friends as Joe was born and lived his entire life in the large detached house where he was found. He was a Labourer at the Atomic Weapons Establishment, in Aldermaston, Berkshire, until he retired. Mr West never married but had a 'lady friend' who lived in Southampton. Neighbour Derek Joseph, 74, said: 'He was a lovely man and what happened was such a tragedy. 'But he was quite private and quite reclusive - he kept him self to himself. 'He loved his Independence and would never have moved into any sort of care home. Joe liked to do things his way.' He added: 'Joe lived in a big house with a very large garden it must be at least over half an acre. 'What happened was just very sad and very unlucky way to go.'","Neighbour discovered Stanley West after popping round with hot water following power cut .

Tory MP Adam Afriyie has described the racist abuse that he suffered while growing up on a rough council estate in London . Rebel Tory MP Adam Afriyie has told how he was called a ‘n****r’ and a ‘monkey’ on the rough London estate where he grew up. Mr Afriyie, the party’s first black MP, said he was regularly ‘spat at and sworn at for being black’ as a youngster in the Peckham area of  South-East London. The comments come in an interview and photoshoot for a glossy political magazine to be published later this week. Mr Afriyie’s remarks will be seen as the latest move by the ambitious, multi-millionaire MP, who regards himself as a potential successor to David Cameron. His profile has rocketed since his leadership plan was revealed by The Mail on Sunday earlier this year, although Mr Afriyie, 47, himself denies any such ambitions, . In the interview with Total Politics magazine, he is pictured on the front cover in a carefully choreographed pose with eyes closed. The headline reads: ‘Adam Afriyie. Is he dreaming of being PM?’ The MP, whose mother is white and whose father came from Ghana, tells how he was the victim of racist abuse while growing up in Peckham in the Seventies and Eighties. ‘I remember being spat at and sworn at in the street – often with my mother, as a seven-year-old, for being black,’ he says. The multi-millionaire MP regards himself as a potential successor to David Cameron . ‘It was quite common to be grumbled at on public transport and to be called a monkey or n****r.’ In the interview, Mr Afriyie tells . fellow Tory MP Rob Wilson how he developed a ‘second skin’ to cope with . the abuse, adding: ‘Thank goodness society has moved on.’ But he says he still regards himself as ‘a bit of an outsider – certainly not part of the establishment’. Mr Afriyie is to participate in the Common's budget debate and argues that this is the last one that can deliver growth before the 2015 election . However, the MP makes it clear he does not see himself as a representative of black people in general. ‘I start businesses, I do stuff,’ he says. ‘If people out there are encouraged I’m the first black Conservative MP, I’m really happy about that.’ Mr Afriyie insists he has ‘no desire’ to become Prime Minister, saying: ‘David Cameron is Prime Minister and he’s doing a good job in incredibly difficult circumstances.’ But he does betray an interest in Downing Street dating from childhood. ‘We [Mr Afriyie and his brother] would sometimes go to No 10 Downing Street and see what was going on and I remember when Harold Wilson came out and waved at us,’ he recalls. This week, the IT entrepreneur, worth up to £100 million, will step up his campaign to kick-start the economy with lower taxes by speaking in the Budget debate. In the interview, Mr Afriyie argues that this is the last Budget statement that can deliver growth before the 2015 Election, with temporary cuts in capital gains tax one of his key demands. But the MP, who has not so far served in the Coalition, denies he is angling for a Ministerial job. ‘I’m genuinely not ambitious for any particular position and never have been,’ he says. ‘I’m concerned about the Conservative Party, that it’s united and able to win elections.’","Adam Afriyie has described the hardship he experienced growing up .

"By . Brendan Carlin, Mail on Sunday Political Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:06 EST, 30 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:46 EST, 31 March 2013 . Under pressure: David Cameron is facing more revolt from his backbenchers over Europe amid mounting speculation of a leadership challenge . David Cameron faces a revolt by more than 100 Tory MPs this week amid renewed reports his backbench critics are coming closer to mounting a leadership challenge. In a letter to the Prime Minister, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, the MPs demand that he toughens up his vow to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU if the Conservatives win the next Election. They state he must hold a Commons vote on the issue before the Election in 2015 to prove he means it – and to expose Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg, who have made clear they oppose it. The latest EU referendum revolt comes after an opinion poll suggested Mr Cameron’s Eurosceptic rival Boris Johnson would wipe out Labour’s six-point lead if the London Mayor was Tory leader. And well-placed sources say 25 of the 46 MPs needed to trigger a leadership contest have now written to Graham Brady, chairman of the party’s 1922 Committee of backbench MPs, asking for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister. In the letter to Mr Cameron, written by Basildon MP John Baron but understood to bear the signatures of one in three Tory MPs, the rebels tell him to enshrine his referendum pledge in law now – or be accused of ‘broken promises’. Mr Cameron had hoped to silence his Tory Eurosceptic critics in January by vowing to hold a referendum on UK membership of the EU if he wins the next Election. However, Tory malcontents say he has not gone far enough and want ‘enabling legislation’ setting out a timetable and details of the referendum now, even if it takes place after the Election, arguing that otherwise voters will not trust him. MP John Baron, left, has written a letter to David Cameron calling for him enshrine his pledge for a referendum on Britain's EU membership in law. Sources say other MPs have also written to Graham Brady, right, chairman of the 1922 Committee, asking for a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister . The rebels discount the likelihood of a Commons defeat by pro-EU Labour and Lib Dem MPs, on the grounds that voters, who according to polls favour a referendum, would turn against them. The letter, due to be delivered to Mr Cameron on Tuesday, says: ‘There is a strong argument in favour of bringing forward the enabling legislation into this Parliament. ‘It would address the fundamental lack of public trust when people hear politicians making promises about Europe. Too many have been broken in the past.’ Sources said last night that the letter bears the signatures of more than 100 Tory backbenchers, including several ex-Ministers. Moves to win support for the letter were conducted in cloak-and-dagger style – MPs who signed were not told who else had put their name to it. One said: ‘If the whips had found out, they would have scuppered the whole thing.’","Letter demands he toughens up vow to hold referendum on EU membership .

"By . Simon Walters And Brendan Carlin . PUBLISHED: . 17:48 EST, 16 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 17 March 2013 . Figurehead: High Grant is Hacked Off's most high-profile campaigner . A cynical ploy to use rebel Tory MPs to force through punitive new press laws was exposed last night. An explosive leaked document reveals how campaigners from the Hacked Off group are secretly targeting Tory MPs ‘who want to bring David Cameron down’ in the hope they will sabotage Mr Cameron’s plan to block state regulation of the media. It makes it clear Hacked Off despises the Conservative MPs they are wooing, but are under orders to suppress their loathing and exploit divisions within Tory ranks to muzzle the press. The leaked memo says that supporters must swallow their natural ‘distrust and dislike’ of Right-wing Tory MPs and take advantage of their determination to ‘evict’ Cameron from No 10. The document also reveals how Hacked Off ruthlessly capitalised on what it calls ‘the Dowler test’, a reference to murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler, whose phone was hacked. It says: ‘The expression “the Dowler test” has pushed its way into the popular lexicon, when in fact it doesn’t exist. Not yet that is. We need to define what the Dowler test is and make it binary.’ The claim that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on Millie Dowler’s mobile phone, giving her parents false hope that she was alive, provoked a national outcry and led to the closure of the paper. It later emerged that the claim was wrong and that the newspaper did not delete the messages. The leak is the first full account of the inner workings and methods of Hacked Off, set up after the Millie Dowler phone furore. Launched by the Media Standards Trust, and with actor Hugh Grant as its highly effective frontman, it has demanded full transparency of connections between the press and politicians. Scroll down for video . Outcry: The claim that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on Millie Dowler's mobile phone, giving her family, pictured, false hope that she was alive, led to the closure of the paper . But it refuses to give details of its own funding or contacts with MPs. The Mail on Sunday can also disclose that the Hacked Off strategy is receiving secret help from a Labour-leaning lobby company in which a former spin doctor to Peter Mandelson and John Prescott is involved. The document, leaked on the eve of tomorrow’s crucial Commons vote on media ethics, discloses how Hacked Off planned to draw up a list of ‘30-40 hand-picked dissenters’ including those with grudges against Cameron, whether political or personal. Senior Tory MP David Davis said last night: ‘For an organisation that represents itself as standing for honesty, transparency and high ethical standards, this shows astonishing hypocrisy and cynicism. Testing: The document reveals how Hacked Off capitalised on what it calls 'the Dowler test', a reference to murdered schoolgirl Millie Dowler . ‘It is precisely the manipulative tendency we were led to believe that they deplore.’ The document has been leaked to this newspaper by a Hacked Off whistleblower appalled by the group’s manoeuvrings. Speaking on condition of remaining anonymous, the whistleblower said: ‘I am shocked by their underhand approach. ‘It is time the public knows what they are really like. I feel very uncomfortable about the approach of their campaign.’ The leaked ‘strategy document’ was discussed at a Hacked Off meeting attended by the group’s founder, Brian Cathcart, and its directors, Grant and lawyer Charlotte Harris, who has represented phone hacking victims. The meeting took place at the London offices of Ms Harris’s law firm, Mishcon de Reya, on September 19. Ms Harris has represented several phone-hacking victims. Labour leader Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will join forces in the Commons tomorrow to try to force through state regulation of the press in the wake of Lord Justice Leveson’s report into media ethics, set up after the News International phone-hacking scandal. The outcome could hinge on how many Conservative MPs defy Mr Cameron and back the Lib-Lab alliance. The leaked memo says it has only ‘one aim – an independent statutory regulator with punitive powers’. It says: ‘Within the Government there is a cabal of discontents, Right- wing outliers and mavericks unwilling to toe the party line, happy to ignore the Whip and keen to evict the tenants of Downing Street.’ The memo identifies rebel Tory MPs with every kind of grudge against Cameron, and explains how Hacked Off can recruit them as allies. The document, written by Ella Mason, Hacked Off’s head of campaigns who was a Tory aide in the 2010 Election, was approved at the September meeting. Revealed: Secret dossier telling campaigners how to exploit Dowlers' misery - and a translation of what it means . This newspaper has also established that Hacked Off has also been advised by BBM, a lobbyist firm set up by two of Tony Blair’s former campaign chiefs. BBM boss Alan Barnard is helping Hacked Off and BBM director Gez Sagar was present when the Hacked Off plan to target Tory MPs was discussed. The BBM website says media director Mr Sagar was press secretary to Lord Prescott and ‘campaign writer’ for Mr Blair. It omits to say he was also spin doctor for ex Labour Minister Lord Mandelson during the Millennium Dome fiasco. There is no reference on the websites of Hacked Off or BBM to their connections with each other. The Hacked Off insider said: ‘BBM is kept in the background. People say, “It’s best if Hacked Off stuff is not seen to be coming from them.” ’ In a statement, Hacked Off said last night: ‘Hacked Off was looking to recruit MPs of all political persuasions from an early date. 'It was never our approach to target one group or another: we thought that all sides would see that victims of press abuse had a right to be heard. 'Hacked Off do not employ BBM but we have worked alongside them.’ The spokesman confirmed that Mr Sagar had advised them on an unpaid basis.","Leaked document shows campaigners are under orders to exploit Tory splits .

Vintage steam trains powered their way through the English countryside today to put the wheels in motion for ten days of celebrations of the world's busiest heritage route. The magnificent locomotives were on show as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway began celebrating its 40th anniversary. The historic line first ran trains along its route in 1836 but was closed following the Beeching report into Britain's railways in 1963 which saw 2,300 stations taken out of service. This 45407 Lancashire Fusilier is among the visiting engines at the first weekend of the 40th anniversary celebrations in North Yorkshire . A K1 Class locomotive pulled out of Goathland Station as the North Yorkshire Moors Railways began its 40th anniversary celebrations with the annual spring steam gala . Today a 62005 K1 Class and a British Rail LNER were seen side-by-side on the line in the North Yorkshire Moors . It was among 5,000 miles of track closed, but it wasn't long before the line was revived as a thriving tourist attraction, pulling in up to 350,000 visitors a year. The sight of trains steaming along the 18-mile line will thrill railway enthusiasts, many of whom are expected to flock to the area to celebrate the anniversary in the expected sunshine of the bank holiday weekend. Visitors will be able to take rides on visiting locomotives between Whitby and Pickering as well as the North Yorkshire Moors Railway's own fleet. The 75-year-old 60007 Sir Nigel Gresley engine, painted in British Railways blue livery, recently underwent a year of restorative work by the railway's trust, and was back in fine form as it pulled away from Goathland station. The railway's Green Knight locomotive was also on show alongside a visiting Lancashire Fusilier engine. The locomotives steamed along one of the world's busiest steam heritage routes to mark the anniversary . The North Yorkshire Moors Railway was among 5,000 miles of track and 2,300 stations closed as a result of the 1963 report by Dr Richard Beeching . A driver looked ahead as the K1 Class locomotive, with a wagon full of coal, pulled out of Goathland Station near Scarborough today .

The timetable of celebratory journeys begins today until May 12. About 300 volunteers help with the running of the railway alongside 130 paid employees. The first journeys of the weekend were seen pulling away from Goathland near Scarborough, halfway down the line. The pictures from the station will provoke memories for many, not just train fans. It was where the Hogwarts Express arrived for the start of the school year in the Harry Potter films, while Goathland itself was the setting of Aidensfield in Sunday night ITV drama Heartbeat. The majestic steam trains returned to the line ten years after the railway was closed following the Beeching report in 1963 .

A bitter ex-boyfriend posted topless pictures of his former lover online as punishment when she started a new relationship. James Aldous, 22, let himself into Cassie Fearnley’s house while she was sleeping and copied 20 pictures of the university student posing topless and in her underwear which were saved on her laptop computer. He then uploaded the intimate pictures to websites to humiliate her. Revenge plot: James Aldous, right, admitted posting intimate pictures of his ex-girlfriend Cassie Fearnley, 22, left, on the internet after taking them from her laptop. This is not one of the images posted online by Aldous . When Miss Fearnley, also 22, found out about the plot, she confronted Aldous and he deleted the images. But they had already started to circulate on the internet and had spread to many more websites. As a result, it could be almost impossible to find and remove all the pictures – meaning they could potentially come back to haunt Miss Fearnley for the rest of her life. Aldous has been given an 18-week suspended prison sentence after admitting a charge of harassment at Colchester Magistrates Court. Guilty: James Aldous, 22, was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work . Chairman of the bench Martin Stutchfield told him: ‘It was a particularly heinous crime and the principle is a disgraceful one. ‘The humiliation which the victim has suffered is so great that we can not properly compensate her.’ The court heard Aldous, who works as a chef, and Miss Fearnley began a relationship in 2008 and had a  two-year-old daughter together. They split after a series if rows in October last year and Aldous moved out of the house they shared in Clacton, Essex. In the early hours of one morning the following month, Miss Fearnley woke up to hear someone leaving her house. Philip Pearson, prosecuting, said: ‘She looked out of the window and could see the defendant getting into his car and driving away. ‘She phoned him straight away and he confessed he had been in the house and had the key to the property.’ It was not until February that Miss Fearnley discovered that Aldous had been posting her images online. Mr Pearson said: ‘Aldous was angry and wanted to get back at her for having a new partner and he chose a grossly offensive way to do so.’ Aldous, who had no previous convictions, was arrested and confessed setting up two websites with images of Miss Fearnley. Anna Perera, mitigating, said: ‘He did feel angry and posted the photographs she had shown to him previously. ‘As soon as she found out, he took them down immediately.’ But the court heard that the images were likely to remain on other sites. Aldous was ordered to complete 150 hours unpaid work in the community and told to pay £105 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Outside court, Miss Fearnley, who is a student at Essex University, said: ‘It has been really traumatic for me. 'There have been days when I have not felt up to going into  college because of the shame. ‘It was a massive betrayal of trust. Perhaps he was just jealous, but for him to post the pictures of me online was so hurtful. ‘He told me he had a problem and needed to seek professional help.’","James Aldous, 22, downloaded the pictures from his ex-girlfriend's laptop .

Ed Miliband last night faced an angry backlash from Labour MPs after it emerged he held a secret meeting with George Galloway, who was thrown out of the party ten years ago. The Labour leader invited Respect MP Mr Galloway to his Commons office, where they had a ‘cordial and friendly conversation’ for nearly an hour. It has sparked rumours that Mr Miliband is considering allowing Mr Galloway to rejoin the party. But Labour MPs warned their leader . against taking such action. ‘Galloway is a traitor,’ said one. ‘It’s . naive lunacy for the leader to have anything to do with him. I thought . he wanted to get rid of the Red Ed tag. He will rejoin Labour over my . dead body.’ Mr Galloway was expelled from Labour . after he was accused of inciting foreign forces to rise up against . British troops invading Iraq – military action he strongly opposed. Last year, Mr Galloway humiliated Mr . Miliband by triumphing over Labour in the Bradford West by- election by a . thumping 10,000 votes. If he returned to his former party, it could give Mr Miliband an extra seat at the next General Election in 2015. Mr Miliband believes that winning seats in Labour’s northern stronghold is key to him ousting David Cameron from No  10. Controversial character: George Galloway MP, formerly of the Labour Party . Senior Labour sources denied there were plans to let Mr Galloway rejoin the party, saying it was ‘merely a get to know you’ meeting. But friends of Mr Galloway said he was ‘taken aback’ to receive the invitation. ‘Obviously it was an olive branch,’ said one. ‘It is hard to imagine why Ed would want to see him unless he is thinking of letting George back in. They had a very friendly chat and agreed to stay in touch. At one point in the meeting, Mr Miliband asked Mr Galloway why he had left the party. He replied, ‘I didn’t leave, I was thrown out.’ Both men laughed. News of the meeting, said to have taken place a few weeks ago, was leaked days after Mr Galloway greeted Margaret Thatcher’s death by saying: ‘May she burn in the hellfires.’ In 2006, he was ridiculed after taking time off from his MP’s duties to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. During one episode he pretended to be a cat. Labour last night confirmed the meeting took place but insisted there had been no attempt to bring Mr Galloway back into the party as many of his views were ‘unacceptable’.","Revelation will do nothing for Labour leader trying to shake 'Red Ed' tag .

A Chinese internet bride left to care for her elderly mother-in-law while her British husband was on  a month-long holiday has been  convicted of neglect. Chun Fung Johnson, 41, moved to Britain hoping for a better life after meeting Brian Johnson, 56, online, but instead she became an ‘unpaid carer’ for his frail mother. Elsie Johnson, 90, moved into the couple’s home in Benfleet, Essex, and when Mr Johnson went on a month-long holiday in the Philippines – during which he could not be contacted by telephone – his wife was left to look after her. Chun Fung Johnson, 41, moved to Britain hoping after meeting Brian Johnson, 56, online, but instead she became an 'unpaid carer' for his 90-year-old mother Elsie Johnson . When he returned, he found his mother had a broken pelvis, bruising and a 4in  cut on her arm. His wife had not called for a doctor or taken her to hospital. When Mrs Johnson was finally taken to hospital, doctors called  the police. Appearing at Basildon Crown Court, Chun Fung pleaded guilty to neglecting her mother-in-law. Holiday: Husband Brian Johnson took a month-long trip to the Philippines during which he could not be contacted by telephone . The court heard the injuries did not conclusively suggest that  Chun Fung had mishandled her mother-in-law and could have  been accidental. Judge Owen Davies described her care of Mrs Johnson as ‘devoted, compassionate and caring’, but said she did not do enough to  summon help for her when she was injured. Chun Fung, who has little grasp of English, now faces deportation back to China. Jacqueline Carey, defending, told the court that Chun Fung had been used by her husband as an unpaid carer to his frail mother after she moved to the UK in 2009, and it was not the life she had been promised. Mrs Johnson moved in with her son and daughter-in-law after she suffered a stroke and developed dementia. Sentencing, Judge Davies said: ‘Your care of Elsie was devoted, compassionate and caring.  Your husband left the country  and for a substantial length of  time could not be contacted by telephone. ‘To be fair to you, I am able  to accept that you were in  difficulties in knowing how to summon help. ‘But the fact that you pleaded guilty shows that you know that you did not do enough – even knocking on a neighbour’s door would have been sufficient.’ Chun Fung was handed a  six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. She is being detained by immigration . services after she overstayed her visa, which was not renewed when she . and Mr Johnson ended their three-year marriage following the . allegations. Mr Johnson was also accused of neglect but was acquitted by a jury last month. Judge Owen Davies described Chun Fung's care of Mrs Johnson as 'devoted, compassionate and caring', but said she did not do enough to summon help for her when she was injured . He was not in court to see his  ex-wife sentenced, but speaking after the hearing, he claimed that Chun Fung had wanted to look after his mother. ‘Chun Fung has doted on my mum for years,’ he said. ‘She has done everything to look after her. They love each other.  They had a good relationship, they had a good time. ‘I’m devastated. I’ve lost my  mum and now I’ve lost my wife. The stress of this has torn my  family apart.’ Mr . Johnson said that his mother had sustained her injuries falling  in the . shower while he was on holiday. ‘Chun Fung could not catch her,’ he . said. 'Unpaid carer': Chun Fung Johnson pleaded guilty to neglecting her mother-in-law who had injured herself in the shower . Mr Johnson, who has a child from a previous marriage to another  foreign-born wife, said he met Chun Fung on the internet. He said: ‘I didn’t want to be in a relationship with an English woman. I’m 56 now. I’d had enough of that and I just wanted something different.’ Mrs Johnson has been moved to a care home in Rochford, Essex.","Chun Fung Johnson pleaded guilty to neglecting Elsie Johnson, 90 .

A couple found dead in a swimming pool at a luxury hotel could have drowned after a failed rescue attempt, according to police. A man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s were found underwater in a ten-metre indoor pool at Down Country House Hotel. Provisional results from a post-mortem examination found both their deaths were consistent with drowning. A policeman stands guard at the Down Hall Country House Hotel in Essex, where a man and a woman were discovered dead in the swimming pool on Saturday night . The pair, a man in his 30s and a woman in her 20s, were discovered by a guest at about 7.30pm. Their deaths are so far 'unexplained' by police . A picture posted to Twitter by a hotel guest showed the cordoned off swimming pool today . Officers are investigating the . possibility that they died after one swimmer ran into trouble and the . other one tried to rescue them. Detectives are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths, but have described them as ‘very unusual’. They have ordered toxicology tests to see if the couple had been drinking or taking drugs. The couple, both in swimsuits, were pulled from the pool by hotel staff on Saturday night. Emergency services were called to the hotel in Hatfield Heath, Essex, but they were both pronounced dead at the scene. Officers initially thought the pair came from London and were staying together at the hotel. However, last night police were still unsure if they had been in a relationship. They are expected to be named this afternoon when the coroner opens an inquest into their deaths. A police spokesman said: ‘Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances leading up to their deaths. ‘But they are treating them as non-suspicious.’ It was later revealed that investigators did not believe they had been poisoned by gas or chemicals. The incident has not been referred to the Health and Safety Executive, which investigates concerns over faulty equipment or safety practices. The hotel is situated in more than 100 acres of woodland . Hotel manager Chris Falcus said: ‘We . wish to reiterate our condolences to the friends and families of the . lady and gentleman concerned. ‘Both myself and the team at the hotel are deeply upset by what has happened. ‘The results of the post mortem examination have concluded that the deaths of the two people were consistent with drowning. ‘This puts an end to any inappropriate speculation about our hotel’s facilities.’ The hotel regularly hosts murder . mystery weekends and some guests reportedly believed that the arrival of . police was part of the package. Jo . Carter, 49, and Frankie Heritage, 56, checked in yesterday afternoon . for their first ever murder mystery and believed the whole crime scene . had been staged. Miss Carter, a personal assistant from Brentwood, Essex, said: 'We just thought it was all part of the build-up. 'We have never done a murder mystery before so we just thought they’d gone to a lot of expense. 'It all just seemed to be part of the weekend with a policemen and a van at the gate. 'It . was only when we spoke to him (the police officer) and he explained . that it would be much too expensive to stage with real police cars that . we realised.' Mr Heritage, a builder from . Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, added: 'It is absolutely terrible what has happened . as that’s someone’s daughter and son. 'Last night we still had dinner but the murder mystery didn’t take place. 'All the guests were talking over dinner about how it could have happened as it is a real life mystery.' The hotel, on the Hertfordshire border, is a popular wedding venue. Jade Goody tied the knot there in 2009 . The couple say that guests expecting . to attend last weekend’s cancelled event have been offered a free murder . mystery at the hotel at some point in the future. The emergency services were called to . the country house hotel in Hatfield Heath, on the border of Essex and . Hertfordshire, at 7.35pm on Saturday. The air ambulance helicopter was summoned to the 110-acre estate, but paramedics could not resuscitate the man and woman. Police said the pair from London checked in at the £150-a-night hotel together, but could not confirm if they were a couple. The . ten-metre pool was open to hotel guests but was unsupervised. Another . guest said she had used the pool just 30 minutes before the bodies were . discovered. Essex Police interviewed guests from the two wedding parties on Saturday. Lucy . Sparks, 21, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, was at one of the wedding . receptions when police arrived at the hotel. She said: ‘We saw two . police officers rush through reception with a member of staff. There . were about five or six police cars outside and we saw the air ambulance . land. ‘The hotel just pulled a curtain to separate us and the party still went on as normal.’ Yesterday . detectives said they were not looking for anyone else in connection . with the deaths, which they are treating as ‘unexplained’. Chief Inspector Nick Lee said  his officers had found two people ‘submersed’ in the pool. Jade Goody and Jack Tweed on their wedding day at the hotel in 2009 . He . added: ‘Despite a valiant attempt from  the hotel staff and ambulance . service, unfortunately it was not possible to revive those individuals . and they were pronounced dead at the scene. ‘Next . of kin have been informed about this tragic incident and I can tell you . at the moment Essex Police are not looking for any other people in . connection with this investigation.’ Police ordered toxicology tests . to check if the pair had been drinking, although a senior officer said . the tests were a routine part of the investigation.

For 1,088 days they have braved storms, floods, snow and torrential rain to prevent the spread of an illegal gipsy camp on the edge of their village. But yesterday the villagers of Meriden celebrated victory after the Romanies who threatened to destroy their rural idyll were finally forced to leave. The triumph is a hard-fought win for the hardy band who have maintained a round-the-clock vigil to stop further development at the camp since April 2010. Defiant: A traveller fuels a fire at the site in Meriden yesterday as villagers triumphed over the Romanies . At the same time, the residents have faced a long and arduous legal fight to remove the travellers, who have repeatedly used delaying tactics to stay on the site. Some of the villagers have also faced death threats, had their homes vandalised and been labelled racist. Last month the gipsies lost their three-year legal battle to stay on the land. A judge at the High Court in Birmingham gave them until the weekend to move and ordered they must restore the West Midlands site to its former state within a month. The last travellers to leave, in a final act of defiance, started a fire and torched a caravan. Today the villagers will end their blockade of the site and mark their victory with a minute's silence at 10am. David McGrath, spokesman for Residents Against Inappropriate Development, said: 'There is a great sense of relief that they are leaving.' The determined residents - some of whom are now in their eighties - have taken turns to huddle under a tarpaulin with little more than a fire for comfort in temperatures as low as minus 18c every day and night since the Romany gipsies arrived. Time to leave: A caravan is towed from the site at the end of a 1,088 day year battle in the courts . In a bizarre twist, the residents at one point found themselves ordered by planning officials to remove their rudimentary protest camp, while no action was being taken to remove the travellers. The residents' nightmare began when the Meriden gipsies paid £100,000 to buy the paddock and, in time-honoured fashion, moved on to the land at the start of a bank holiday weekend - when the council was powerless to stop them developing the site. But they had not reckoned on the determination of villagers to preserve the Meriden Gap green belt which separates the village from Coventry and Solihull. As word spread, residents swung into action, descending on the eight-acre site and forming a human barricade to prevent a convoy of lorries from delivering 1,800 tons of hardcore rubble to the site later that evening. Ever since, around 200 residents have manned their camp around the clock to make sure the site is not developed any further, working to a rota with shifts lasting anything from an hour to overnight. Until now the travellers have repeatedly managed to stop their eviction in a tortuous legal process that has involved 19 court appearances. Damage: The field, which has been occupied by travellers since April 2010, was left torn up by vehicles . After moving on to the site, the travelling families lodged a retrospective planning application, which was turned down by the local authority, but they managed to stay as they lodged an appeal. In 2011, Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, upheld a planning inspector's recommendation that the appeal should be dismissed - but the travellers continued to remain. Last month, the travellers finally . lost their three year legal battle to stay on the land, when they lost . their appeal against Mr Pickles' decision at the High Court. Mr McGrath said that they would now . campaign to make sure the site, turned into a muddy quagmire by the . travellers, was returned to its former state - a paddock once covered in . wildflowers. He said: 'They still need to return the camp to the way it was the day before they moved in, exactly the way it was. 'That . means not just leaving but removing all the sewerage and water pipes . under the ground that they installed and reseeding the ground. Vigil: Villagers (l-r) Ken Lapworth, Maggie Ledbrook and David McGrath, four days before their victory . 'We will keep up with targeted protests until that is done.' He added: 'We need to make sure they don't just bulldoze everything, they must return it to exactly how it was before they came. Smoke: Firefighters were called to the site after the Romanies set fire to a large shed last week . 'We'd like to stay until they have, but we know that the council have taken legal action against both sides so we will leave on Monday. 'We will hold a minute's silence when we leave for those members of the protest who didn't make it.' Mr McGrath added that the group had helped to lobby for new laws introduced which give councils greater power to deal with 'bank holiday' invasions and illegal developments. Previously, councils couldn't take action against occupants of caravans once they had moved on to a site, but they now have new powers which allow them to halt illegal developments to send temporary stop notices. He said: 'The legacy of the campaign is not only in the lane in terms of the battle for the land being won. 'Our country's laws have changed. It's far wider than the little local battle. It's been a case of local actions with national implications.' Mr McGrath, who has received multiple death threats, reflected on the personal sacrifices he had made whilst leading the campaign and vowed to spend more time with his family. The training consultant said: 'I'll be able to spend more time with my 82-year-old father who's not very well. I regret not spending as much time with him as I should have. 'I can also spend more time on my business, as I'm self-employed.' Landowner Noah Burton, who calls himself the 'Bin Laden of Meriden' and is a spokesman for the travellers, yesterday joked about how the camp had damaged the village's reputation as he repeated claims that the residents' campaign has been racially motivated. Hard-fought: Travellers speak to firefighters who were called to put out flames at the site . He said: 'There are no winners here, we have been left homeless and the residents have been left with the stigma of the gypsy site having been there. 'The head of RAID's house is still barely worth £5,000 even when we have gone, the history of us being there is all over the place. 'This was never about green belt land, it was only about not wanting gypsies on their doorsteps, they told me that many times.' He added: 'I can't tell you where the families have gone because many of them are forced to stop at the roadside now and the police have moved them on a few times already. 'We will still be around, you just won't be able to see us any more on the land. 'The council could have helped us, found a new site and moved us in straight away. Then everyone would have been happy.'","Last of the travellers have leave site in Meriden following High Court battle .

His front right leg and back left legs are black - while the other two are white. Battenberg, a four-week-old Texel cross lamb, would not have been found among the snow if it weren't for his unusual markings . Battenberg, with farmer Richard Griffiths, has two black legs and two white legs and is especially unusual because both his parents are white sheep . Now Battenberg's face could save him for a second time. The Griffiths hope he will be adopted to be someone's pet instead of ending up on a dinner plate. Marianne Griffiths, 44, said: 'We haven't seen a lamb like it before. 'You either get a white lamb or a black one - but not a half-and half one.' 'Battenberg is a real mixture which is a surprise because both his mother and father are white. Mrs Griffiths, married to 49-year-old farmer Richard, said: 'He was born while we were having a tough time of it during the terrible snow that fell in March.

Paul Crowther, 53, was jailed alongside his neighbours Jamie Hooper and Sarah Ellis for the attack on Claus Reinauer's flat in January . A gang who broke into a German nurse's flat, trashed it and scrawled Nazi slurs on the walls has been jailed. Claus Reinauer returned from an aid mission to find his bedding covered in faeces and urine, his clothes cut up and covered in bleach, broken furniture, food thrown around, the heating left on, and important documents destroyed. The words: 'Nazi c***, f*** off back to Germany' and 'Kraut Nazi b******' had been daubed on the walls in pencil. An 'irreplaceable' penknife that was his only memento of his grandfather was stolen and all of his electrical appliances were left on, using up the remaining money on Mr Reinauer's meter. Paul Crowther, a neighbour with a longstanding grudge against the nurse, broke in to the flat in January with Jamie Hooper and Sarah Ellis, a couple who lived in the same block in Exeter, Devon. The trio went 'berserk', Exeter Crown Court heard. Other neighbours called police and Mr Reinauer was summoned home, arriving at 5am to find his home trashed and without power. The full extent of the damage only became known once it was light. Mr David Bowen, prosecuting, said: 'Mr . Reinauer is a German national. He left his home in good order. While he . was away these three broke in and ransacked the flat. 'They broke furniture, threw food . around the flat and bleach over his clothes, cut up some clothing and . cut the buttons off shirts and cut up documents including his birth . certificate, exam certificates and a nursing certificate. 'They also took an irreplaceable . penknife which had great sentimental value because it was his only . memento of his grandfather and cut up an English Language certificate . which cost £100 to replace. 'We say this was deliberate targeting based on hostility to the victim's race.' Mr Reinauer suspected the attack had been carried out by his neighbours and officers found finger and shoe prints linking the defendants to the scene. Crowther, 53, Hooper, 23, and Ellis, 24, all of Exeter, admitted burglary with intent to commit criminal damage. Judge John Neligan ruled that the offence was racially aggravated and the trio cried as they were jailed for a year. Jamie Hooper, left, and Sarah Ellis lived in the same block as Mr Reinauer and Crowther. They joined their neighbour Paul Crowther in what a judge called a racially aggravated attack on Mr Reinauer's home . Judge Neligan said: 'They knew he was away . and they went berserk and scrawled hate graffiti on the wall. It is a . very serious offence. All three effectively trashed the flat.

This was the question posed by two high school students of Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield. Fortunately, as he currently lives on board the International Space Station orbiting Earth, he was able to demonstrate the remarkable answer. Scroll down for video . Another world: Some of the water droplets look like bubbles as they float away but most of the liquid stays together . Amazing: As Commander Hadfield squeezes the cloth, the water forms a strange 'tube' around his hands . Space science: The experiment was the idea of two Candian high school students . In the absence of gravity, water does not fall downwards and in effect forms a floating water 'tube' around the cloth. Commander Hadfield's live experiment on board the space station was beamed back to 1,200 pupils at Lockview High School in Fall River, Nova Scotia. The Canadian Space Agency had asked pupils to come up with a simple science experiment that he could perform in space. Teenagers Kendra Lemke and Meredith Faulkner came up with the 'ring it out' experiment to test how a microgravity environment might affect and experiment using items which would already be available on board the station. Speaking into a floating microphone, Commander Hadfield first soaked a wash cloth in water. Then, as it floats in front of the camera, he attempts to squeeze out at the liquid. Incredible results: The water takes on a jelly-like form a clings to the astronaut's hand . Mind-boggling: Commander Hadfield has performed hundreds of simple scientific experiments in space and posted the results online . Demonstration: Earlier Commander Hadfield had sprayed ordinary drinking water onto the cloth . But without the force of gravity, it simply surrounds the cloth or attaches itself to Commander Hadfield's hands like a gel. Pupils can be heard gasping with excitement as they witness the mind-boggling reality of life in space from their school's gymnasium. Science teacher, John Munro, said: 'The Canadian Science Challenge was a great tool to teach about . space, science and weightlessness in my class. In addition, having this . opportunity to speak live to Commander Hadfield from space was a . special treat the students will remember for a long time and may . influence their future career paths.' Commander Hadfield said: 'The space station is an orbiting laboratory where we work on unique experiments that may eventually improve life on Earth.' Addressing the schoolchildren back in Canada, he said: 'I was about your age when I decided I wanted to become an astronaut. I hope that you remember today and continue to be curious about science and space. You are the space explorers of the future and the sky is no longer the limit'.","Commander Chris Hadfield performs science experiment in space .

France has banned street protests against cartoons denigrating Islam's Prophet Mohammad that were published by a French satirical magazine this week. The crackdown comes as part of a security measure while prayers took place across the Muslim world. The country's Muslim population, drawn largely from ex-colonies in North and West Africa, shrugged off the controversy as imams in mosques denounced the pictures but urged their followers to remain calm. Libyan Muslims hold a demonstration against a film and a cartoon denigrating the Prophet Muhammad in Benghazi, Libya. France has ordered a ban on protests following the widespread uproar . The drawings have stoked a furore over an anti-Islam film made in California that has provoked some violent protests in several Muslim countries, including attacks on U.S. and other Western embassies, the killing of the U.S. envoy to Libya and a suicide bombing in Afghanistan. Interior Minister Manuel Valls said prefects had orders to prohibit any protest and to crack down if the ban was challenged. 'There will be strictly no exceptions. Demonstrations will be banned and broken up,' he told a news conference in the southern port city of Marseille. The main body representing Muslims in France appealed for calm as the weekly Charlie Hebdo put a new print run of the cartoons featuring a naked Prophet Mohammad on the news stands. Mohammed Moussaoui, head of the French Muslim Council, described both the film and the cartoons as 'acts of aggression' but urged French Muslims not to protest in the streets. 'I repeat the council's call not to protest. Any protest could be hijacked and counterproductive,' he told radio RFI. An estimated 8,000 Muslims gathered peacefully for Friday prayers at a temporary prayer hall in northern Paris set up in a former fire department depot. So many turned out that hundreds had to pray in the rain in the adjacent parking lot. Brazilian Muslim children shout slogans during a protest against an anti-Islam film made in the U.S. and also against the French-published cartoon mocking the Prophet Mohammad . 'This demonstrates that the vast majority of the Muslim community is not made up of extremists,' said Abderahmane Dahmane, spokesman for the local association that runs the prayer hall, one of the largest in the Paris region. 'The majority will not play the game of the hotheads.' At prayers in the northeast Paris suburb of La Courneuve, delivery driver Hakim Ardjou, 42, also rejected violence. 'We just want our message to be heard: this sort of insult is a disgrace, but we will keep calm.' French embassies, schools and cultural centres in some 20 Muslim countries were closed on Friday, the Muslim day of prayer, in a precaution ordered by the French government. French media showed footage of an embassy protected by soldiers and barbed wire in former French colony Tunisia, where the Islamist-led government has also banned protests over the cartoons. The Syrian and Muslim Jihad flag is held in front of a mosque in Beirut against a cartoon mocking the Islamic prophet Mohammad in a rally held by Sheikh Ahmed al-Asirin in protest against the anti-Islam film and offensive cartoon . Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said there had been anti-French demonstrations in Afghanistan, Egypt and Indonesia, but there were no incidents against French nationals. 'In a certain number of countries, the measures (closures) will be kept in place as a precaution on Saturday and Sunday,' Fabius told journalists. Police were on alert in the French capital after protests planned by some Muslim groups were banned. Charlie Hebdo, an anti-establishment weekly whose Paris offices are under police protection, defied critics to rush out another run of the publication that sold out on Wednesday. It says the cartoons are designed simply to poke fun at the uproar over the film and on Friday hit back at critics accusing it of deliberately stirring controversy to sell newspapers. 'If Charlie Hebdo wanted to make a quick buck, it would not produce Charlie Hebdo,' it said on its Twitter feed. The publication has a print run of around 70,000 but its Mohammad cartoons have made front-page news in a country which has both the largest Muslim and Jewish populations in Europe - an estimated five million Muslims and 600,000 Jews. President Francois Hollande's government has sought to balance a cherished tradition of freedom of expression with security concerns, denouncing Charlie Hebdo as irresponsible. 'When you are free, in a country like ours, you always have to measure the impact of your words,' French European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said. A survey by TNS Sofres for i-Tele news channel showed 58 percent thought freedom of expression was a fundamental right, and that 'freedom to caricature' was part of that. Yet an even higher 71 percent of the roughly 1,000 people interviewed on Thursday approved of the ban on protests against the cartoons. France has a proud tradition of street protest.","Uproar around the Muslim world as satirical magazine publishes offensive cartoon .

Carrots are the new weapon in the war against prostate cancer, scientists have claimed. A study led by Professor Norman Maitland at the University of York says a diet rich in Vitamin A could be the key to beating the disease because it makes it more treatable. The researchers have discovered that retenoic acid, a chemical made from Vitamin A, can reduce the ability of the cancer to invade surrounding tissue. Vitamin A can be found in foods such as carrots, sweet potatoes and leafy green vegetables such as kale. Prof Maitland said: 'If the cancer is confined to the prostate it’s much more treatable with conventional medicine. This is about prevention rather than cure but it can stop the spread of cancer. 'We have found that specific twin genes are turned off in malignant prostate cancer stem cells. When we turn them back on using retenoic acid, the cancer becomes less aggressive. 'It has been known for many years that low vitamin A in samples of men’s blood is associated with prostate cancer, but nobody knew the mechanisms involved. 'This is an exciting new development which links an element from our diet to prostate cancer stem cells.' Each year 41,000 men in the UK are diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 10,000 die of the disease. Carrots contain Vitamin A, which scientists believe could make the disease more treatable .","Acid in Vitamin A can stop cancer spreading to surrounding tissue .

The dramatic picture, which was captured over Saddleworth Moor in the Peak District National Park, appears to show the undercarriage of the fighter jet close to touching the rotating blades of the helicopter. Aviation experts believe that the two aircraft may have passed within 2,000 - 3,000 ft of each other - putting them just 650 yards apart. Close call? A Tornado jet comes within yards of what is believed to be a Bell 206 helicopter above the Peak District . No reports: Despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near-miss, the UK Airprox Board, which investigates such incidents, has not received any reports relating to this sighting . The fighter jet is believed to be a Tornado while the helicopter is said to be a Bell 206 which was possibly spraying the moors at the time. But despite what appears to be photographic evidence of a near-miss, the UK Airprox Board, which investigates such incidents, has not received any reports relating to this sighting. And, according to the CAA, the picture suggests that the two aircraft are too far apart to be classified as a close call. Richard Taylor, from the CAA, said: 'My initial impression is that this is not an airprox - near miss - incident and that the two aircraft are in fact several miles apart. 'In reality, the helicopter is less than half the size of the jet, but it appears bigger in the photo. 'This would lead me to think that the jet is actually 2,000ft to 3,000ft in the distance from the helicopter.' Fighter jet: The plane involved in the incident is believed to be a Tornado (stock image) An airprox, or near-miss, is classed as a situation where a pilot or air traffic controller feels the distance between aircraft as well as their relative positions and speed has compromised the safety of the aircraft, according to the UK Airprox Board. There are around 200 reported airprox incidents each year. Around 10 per cent of those reports are said to involve gliders. A passenger jet pilot reported in December that his aircraft came within just 300ft of colliding with an unidentified flying object.

Authorities in Florida have arrested a British national who they say traveled to the US hoping to get an underage girl pregnant and then sexually abuse her children. Shuhel Manhboob Ali, 39, was taken into custody over the weekend in North Brevard County. He now faces a charge of using a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce to attempt to persuade a minor to engage in sexual activity. 'It is truly unimaginable that monsters exist and walk among us with the purpose of victimizing our most precious citizens,' Sheriff Wayne Ivey said. 'I want this message to be absolutely crystal clear: We will use every lawful resource we have in our possession to find and remove you from society if you try to harm a child, no matter where you may be on this planet.' If convicted, the British citizen could face a minimum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $250,000, Florida Today reported.

Tragic: Newborn Jessica Strong was one of two newborn babies who died at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire after contracting a rare killer bug . Two premature babies died because staff on an NHS hospital ward did not wash their hands properly, an inquest heard. Jessica Strong was just 11 days old when she died after contracting a bug spread from another child also being treated at the hospital. A ‘breakdown in hand hygiene’ meant six babies became infected, with Jessica and one other killed as a result. Jessica’s mother Annette this week told an inquest of her heartbreak at losing her daughter because of the ‘disgraceful’ staff at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. The new, £400million ‘super hospital’ has now admitted negligence contributed to the deaths of the two babies. The inquest heard how an outbreak of the bacteria Serratia Marcescens swept through the hospital’s neonatal ward in June last year, after it was introduced to the ward by a baby transferred from a hospital in Wales. The first infant who had the bug and three others developed no symptoms but Jessica and another baby, who has not yet been named, died after becoming infected. North Staffordshire coroner’s court heard how Jessica was transferred to the hospital in Stoke-on-Trent after she was born three months prematurely at George Eliot hospital in her parents’ home town of Nuneaton. She was making good progress but her condition suddenly declined and doctors found traces of the bug just 12 hours before she died. She was immediately given a stronger antibiotic but it was too late to tackle the infection. Much-loved: Jessica's parents Annette and Craig Strong hold their daughter before she died after an outbreak of the Serratia Marcescens infection . Outbreak: The inquest heard how an outbreak of Serratia Marcescens swept through the neonatal ward in June last year affecting six premature children . Despite two blood transfusions, it swept through to her spleen, lungs and brain. Annette Strong, 43, told the hearing: ‘She had been doing so well staff were trying to transfer her home. ‘Then I got a call that she had deteriorated and they had resuscitated . her. I rushed back to the hospital and the day before she died I had her . baptised. ‘I was at her cot-side and she had her eyes wide open and seemed to recognise my voice. ‘But by then it was clear she would not make it so I gave her a last cuddle. She was my beautiful little dot.’ Staff at the hospital claimed the infection could have been spread . either by staff or parents.  But Mrs Strong believes staff at the . hospital are to blame. ‘There is no way one parent could’ve contracted it and passed it on to six other babies,’ she said. ‘I believe that the infection has been spread by a member of staff. It’s disgraceful and upsetting.’ Infection: Doctors said the Serratia Marcescens infection had been brought in by a baby which was transferred a month earlier to one of the unit's 23 cots from a hospital in Wales . The mother-of-two later revealed the family have instructed solicitors to take legal action against the trust. Mrs Strong and her husband Craig are expecting another baby girl in June this year. Speaking about her pregnancy she said: ‘It’s absolutely fantastic but . Jessica will never ever in our hearts be replaced,’ she added. The University Hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust has admitted clinical negligence over Jessica’s death. Since the deaths it has started a new cleaning regime and has employed three nurses to ensure better standards of hygiene. Staff from the hospital’s neonatal unit told coroner Ian Smith they were devastated they may have contributed to the deaths. Neonatologist Dr Kate Palmer said: ‘This has very much hurt the staff . but it has been a wake-up call and brought a sea change in attitude and . culture to infection which now permeates everything we do.’ Lead infection control nurse Emyr Phillips added: ‘While previous audits . on the unit going back years showed excellent results, there was a . clear breakdown in hand hygiene practice which could have been caused by . staff or parents.’ Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Smith said Jessica’s death was caused . by ‘extreme prematurity and infection spread by hand contact’. An inquest has yet to be held into the death of the other baby on the ward, who died at 22 days old.","Jessica Strong was 11-days-old when she died from infection at the hospital .

The former student said that it had started when she was 15 and that Rajkumar would hug her and run his hands down her back when she was stressed about big tests. The girl told police that the situation developed and that she and . Rajkumar had sex several times during some weeks. They had sex . in a closet in his classroom. According to an arrest warrant . affidavit released on Tuesday, a guidance counselor at the school . learned about sexually inappropriate conversations and text messages . between Rajkumar and at least five students ages 15 to 18 and alerted . the state Department of Children and Families. Police began investigating March 6, two days after he was fired. Rajkumar declined to comment after a . brief appearance in Hartford Superior Court on Tuesday and hung up the . phone when contacted at his Farmington home on Wednesday. 'Taking advantage': Physics teacher Joseph Prem Rajkumar, 42, was charged with sexual assault on Monday after he allegedly had inappropriate contact with a girl at Miss Porter's school in Farmington, Connecticut . He has posted $500,000 bail and is due back in court April 22. Rajkumar told police that he had a . sexual relationship with the one girl and sent other students emails . that authorities say were sexually inappropriate, the affidavit says. Rajkumar signed a statement for police after confessing to his wife, according to the document. Messages seeking comment were left with a spokeswoman for Miss Porter's School on Wednesday. Miss Porter's is a girls-only, college preparatory school where tuition costs up to $52,000 a year. Miss Porter's day and boarding school . was established in 1843 and is a small, private establishment with 306 . girls currently enrolled. There are 52 teachers of which half live on . the campus. It takes pride in a vast array of . extracurricular activities including 18 sports teams, dance and theater . programs, pottery, painting and textile classes. American dreams: The social elite including a future first lady Jacqueline Bouvier (pictured at the school in January 1947) attended Miss Porter's . Famous alumna: Heiress Gloria Vanderbilt, pictured in 1937, also attended Miss Porter's preparatory school . Tuition for this year costs $48,510 for boarding students and $38,510 for girls who attend day classes. Miss Porter's was founded by education reformer Sarah Porter, who, in contrast to finishing schools of the day, insisted on a rigorous education for young women including chemistry, physiology, botany, geology, and astronomy in addition to the regular subjects of Latin, foreign languages, history and geography. The school is known for its close-knit community. According to the official website: 'Miss Porter's School educates young women to become informed, bold, resourceful and ethical global citizens. 'We expect our graduates to shape a changing world.' Former students include Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis who attended Miss Porter's from 1944 to 1947. Another notable alumna is Gloria Vanderbilt, a member of the legendary American dynasty and mother of CNN's Anderson Cooper. Other former students, who call themselves 'Ancients' include socialite and fashion designer Lilly Pulitzer who passed away on Sunday.

Soaring numbers of students are smoking shishas - but experts are warning that the Middle Eastern water pipe is not a safe alternative to cigarettes. A study carried out by University of California San Francisco has found that whilst smoking a shisha exposes you to different chemicals, they are still harmful. Research chemist Peyton Jacob said: . ‘People want to know if it is a lesser health risk if they switch from . cigarettes to smoking a water-pipe on a daily basis. 'We found that . water-pipe smoking is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking, nor . is it likely to be an effective harm-reduction strategy.’ Trendy: Enjoying a fruit-flavoured shisha has become very popular with students . By measuring the levels of toxins in the blood, breath and urine after smoking, scientists found that those who smoked shisha exposed themselves to high levels of carbon monoxide - especially dangerous to those who suffer with heart or lung problems -  and benzene, which has strong links to leukaemia. The amount of bars and cafes offering the exotic pipe have rocketed in in recent years, with the number of people enjoying a smoking session increasing by 210 per cent in just half a decade. Smoking shisha is . common in many Middle Eastern countries and is growing in popularity in the UK and U.S. in particular. But . a 2009 survey found that almost a third of university students had . smoked tobacco from a water-pipe on at least one occasion, with its use being disproportionately popular among white students, males, and . fraternity and sorority members. Last year the World Health Organisation warned that a one-hour shisha session can be as harmful as smoking 100 cigarettes. A cigarette smoker typically takes between eight and 12 puffs, inhaling 0.5 to 0.6 litres of smoke. But during a typical hour-long shisha session, smokers may take up to 200 drags, ranging from 0.15 to 1 litre of smoke each. Tradition: Shisha has been enjoyed for generations in the Middle East . The new study, published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, followed eight men and five women, all of whom had smoked both cigarettes and shisha in the past. Individuals vary in how their bodies metabolize and excrete toxic substances, so for the most accurate results, the researchers had the same person smoke cigarettes and a water-pipe on different days. The volunteers then smoked an average of three water-pipe sessions or 11 cigarettes per day. The results found that a benzene . byproduct doubled in the urine of volunteers after using a shisha in . comparison to after smoking cigarettes. Occupational exposure to benzene . has been shown to increase the risk of developing leukemia. Furthermore, the researchers measured carbon monoxide in the breath over 24 hours and found levels 2.5 higher after water-pipe use in comparison to cigarette smoking. Contrary to the idea that shisha is purer or less toxic than cigarettes, Neal . Benowitz, a tobacco researcher who carry out the study, said: ‘You’re . basically burning a charcoal briquette on top of the tobacco. And most . of what you’re smoking is a moist fruit preparation, which is mixed with . the tobacco. It smells good and it tastes good.’ The American study has shown that shisha is no less damaging than smoking . However, Jacob added: ‘In addition to delivering toxic substances from the charcoal and tobacco, the heat causes chemical reactions which produce toxic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Some PAHs are highly carcinogenic and can cause lung cancer.’ And compared to non-smokers, Benowitz said: ‘If you are smoking shisha daily, you are likely to be at increased risk for cancer.’ The good news is that shisha is less addictive because it contains lower levels of nicotine. Among those not yet addicted, the most common pattern of shisha use in the United States – about once per week – is not likely to cause addiction, Benowitz said.","Number of people using the Middle Eastern smoking pipe has more than doubled over past five years .

A husband killed himself after a botched plot to give his wife a lethal overdose - instead causing her to slip into a three-year coma, an inquest heard. Serial liar Tony Lindstrom, 44, had researched using insulin as a ‘silent killer’ and had tried to take out an insurance policy on his 56-year-old wife Diana's life before injecting her with the medicine. But when he failed to administer enough to kill her, he panicked and decided to take his own life by injecting himself with insulin, the inquest at Alton Magistrates' Court in Hampshire was told. Both dead: Serial liar Tony Lindstrom (left), 44, had researched using insulin as a 'silent killer' and had tried to take out an insurance policy on his wife Diana's (right) life before injecting her with the medicine . After he was found dead in his car, his wife was discovered unconscious in her bed and although she was taken to hospital doctors had no choice but to declare that she was in a vegetative state. She remained in a coma for three years after Mr Lindstrom's death in February 2010, until her family and doctors decided to withdraw her life-sustaining treatment. Mrs Lindstrom died peacefully earlier this year in February, with her cause of death being given as an insulin overdose and a hypoxic brain injury - caused by a lack of oxygen. Detective Sergeant Simon Casey told the inquest into her death that after administering the drug, possibly overnight in late January 2010, Mr Lindstrom had panicked. ‘He injected Diana with insulin but he didn't put enough in to kill her and not knowing what to do he took the coward's way out in the end,’ he said. Det Sgt Casey told the inquest that Mr Lindstrom had researched insulin on the internet, including checking if it would show up on an autopsy and ‘insulin as a silent killer’. Scene: Mrs Lindstrom was found unresponsive at her home in Church Crookham, Hampshire (pictured) The dog behaviourist had ordered the drug from a pharmacy in Canada and Det Sgt Casey said he believed Mr Lindstrom had tested his weapon on a family pet. ‘With the research done on the computer he thought death would be instantaneous - the body would close down,’ he said. ‘I believe he tested the insulin on a dog the week before. The healthy dog died of a seizure while he was at work. It may have been a test case and looking into his past he was not a truthful man.’ Mr Lindstrom's own inquest in April 2010 revealed he had invented a fantasy life for himself - claiming he was an ex-National Hockey League ice hockey star, a Canadian, and a successful author. Mr Lindstrom, who had changed his surname from Bannister by deed poll, had even told his father Michael Bannister that he had a wife and three children in his American home. He also showed him doctored pictures of the ‘family’ that he had downloaded from the internet. He had moved to France to serve with the French Foreign Legion as a 21-year-old before becoming a dog behaviourist in America and moving back to the UK when he was deported for fraud. The inquest heard how Mr Lindstrom had tried to take out life insurance for his wife, getting a neighbour to pretend to be her so that he could buy it ‘as a birthday present’. Mrs Lindstrom, who worked as an accountant in London, already had life insurance through work  - but the inquest heard that Mr Lindstrom was short of funds as his business had failed. ‘He needed to make money and Diana, his wife, got in the way,’ Det Sgt Casey said. He added that he believed that Mrs Lindstrom was already in a coma when her husband rang her workplace to say that she was ill. He even invited a neighbour to see a ‘sleeping’ Mrs Lindstrom in her bedroom and told her that he was going to ask a doctor for help - only to tell the GP that his wife of 10 years was depressed, rather than reveal that she was in fact unconscious. 'This is a calm, calculated man who designs things for his own ends to the extent where he is prepared to kill his wife' North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley . ‘He was a Walter Mitty character,’ said North Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley, in reference to the character in James Thurber’s eponymous short story, published in 1939. He added that Mr Lindstrom had ‘manipulated everything to his own advantage.’ ‘I deal with all kinds of appalling things, people who stab each other and hit each other over the head, but this is a calm, calculated man who designs things for his own ends to the extent where he is prepared to kill his wife,’ said Mr Bradley. Mr Bradley recorded a narrative verdict over Mrs Lindstrom's death, explaining that she was found unresponsive at her home in Church Crookham, Hampshire. ‘She remained in a permanent vegetative state until life support was withdrawn at Northwick Park Hospital in Harrow,’ he said. ‘I find this a particularly sad matter for Diana and her family. It has come to a conclusion now and I am sorry it has been this way.’","Serial liar Tony Lindstrom, 44, researched using insulin as 'silent killer'

"By . Alex Brummer, City Editor . PUBLISHED: . 17:00 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:32 EST, 8 March 2013 . Justine Greening, International Development Secretary, wants British businesses to help build up 'responsible trade' with developing countries . Foreign aid is to be diverted through British companies to prevent it falling into the hands of corrupt and wasteful regimes. Firms will use the money to win infrastructure contracts and boost struggling economies in Africa, Latin America and Asia. The radical move, to be announced by International Development Secretary Justine Greening next week, is being seen as a victory for common sense in the bitter controversy over the £11billion international development budget, which has been ringfenced while other departments face cuts. It follows years of criticism that the nation’s ballooning aid budget is being squandered by Third World governments on ineffective projects, or lining the pockets of corrupt officials. Prime Minister David Cameron was said to be ‘hugely enthusiastic’ about the shift of emphasis from simply fighting poverty with handouts to economic development. In future, a significant portion of the aid budget – adding up to billions over the years – will be used to secure contracts for British firms to build roads, railways and key buildings such as schools and hospitals. Miss Greening will tell the London Stock Exchange next week: ‘I want to see British business joining the development push with [the Department for International Development]. We all have a huge opportunity to help build up responsible trade with the emerging economies of developing countries. ‘DfID will work not just across government with the Business Department and the Foreign Office. For the first time we will be teaming up with the CBI, industry and others to see how we can help UK businesses make a difference for developing countries. ‘We’re not doing anyone a favour leaving the economic coast clear and I believe British companies can have a real role in growing developing economies through trade.’ Haitians receiving foreign aid - the Government is promising an overhaul of the way Britain's aid budget is handed out . One of the problems Miss Greening will face is the UK's self-imposed ban on so-called ‘tied aid’. This ban means development projects using foreign aid money have to go out to an open bidding process. For the last 12 years, the Government has followed rules that stop UK firms directly benefiting from contracts funded by British aid. 'Tied aid’ has been frowned upon by the World Bank and the development community, which insist on international tenders. But this hasn’t prevented Britain’s competitors, such as France, from insisting only their firms can benefit from their cash. Since replacing Andrew Mitchell, pictured, Justine Greening has said she wants Britain's aid money to be spent more usefully . The move is certain to be resisted by the aid lobby and Labour, which led the Millennium Development goals designed to end poverty and hunger in poor countries by 2015. Miss Greening wants investment money to be available to typical British firms – not just the multinational giants – which wish to take advantage of Africa’s emergence as the fastest growing continent in the world. Aid . The Government has faced huge . hostility for sticking with its target of spending 0.7 per cent of . national output on foreign aid, while departments at home are cut. But . since replacing Andrew Mitchell in the post last September, Miss . Greening has made it clear that if Britain is to maintain its commitment . to international aid, the money must be spent more usefully. She . has cancelled future assistance to India, where there are more . billionaires than in Britain, and earmarked part of the budget to . support Ministry of Defence peacekeeping programmes. And . now she proposes to make UK investment overseas the main priority. The . department will continue existing spending in ‘crisis countries’ such as . Afghanistan, where the Government believes that ‘soft’ help in the . shape of aid can help Britain’s broader foreign policy objectives. To support the new policy, Miss Greening plans to use the expertise of the free market London Business School to help design and implement projects. The Government is acutely aware that while China has been paying for and building infrastructure across Africa, Britain is being left behind. Companies such as Balfour Beatty, one of the best road and rail contractors in the world, are being left at the starting blocks because there is no real government support for investment projects. Kenya and Uganda have told Britain that it is now growth, infrastructure and prosperity that need cultivating. And the Government has formed the opinion that countries across the Commonwealth no longer need general development assistance, and can work on their own or with experts in the field to address health and poverty issues. Ideas to implement the new policy include creating some kind of British Development Bank to organise and scrutinise investment programmes and joint ventures. It would work alongside existing institutions including the British-based Commonwealth Development Corporation and the African Development Bank. Ideally, the Government would like the policy to reach Britain’s smaller companies, which do not currently have expertise in Africa.","British companies will use money to win infrastructure contracts .

The right of anybody in France to bullfight has been upheld, infuriating animal rights campaigners across Europe, including Britain. It follows calls from high-profile showbusiness campaigners including Brigitte Bardot and Jean-Paul Belmondo to see the bloodsport made illegal.

Spanish bullfighter Jose Tomas shown here at the Arles bullring, recently killed five bulls in the city of Nimes . The judges said an ‘uninterrupted and long tradition of  bull-fighting’  should not be ignored simply because of animal rights protests in certain regions where bullfighting is still practiced. These are mainly southern departments, where bullfighting events are well attended and attract some of the best matadors. On Saturday Jose Tomas, a Spaniard, killed five bulls and spared one for his ‘brave fight’ in the city of Nimes.

Criminal activity could be all in the brain, meaning offenders cannot control their behaviour and need treatment to help them stay on the straight and narrow, according to a British academic. Many repeat offenders, killers and psychopaths share abnormal patterns of activity that could help to explain why they turn to crime, neuroimaging of their brains by Adrian Raine has previously found. Psychopaths and murderers also have low activity in the front parts of the brain related to processing emotions, self-awareness and being sensitive to violence. Abnormal brain activity could be the cause of criminal behaviour for some . Now, in his new book The Anatomy of Violence, Raine, a criminology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, says that those who commit domestic violence, aggressive teens or lesser offenders also share those abnormalities and keep doing 'the same wrong things'. He says: 'The seeds of sin are brain-based' but could be tackled with the right treatment. 'The finding suggests that many people currently being punished for their crimes cannot actually control their behaviour, and should be seen as suffering from a disorder that needs treatment,' he told the Sunday Times. Offenders studied by Adrian Raine had low activity in parts of the brain associated with emotions . Raine and a team of neuroscientists found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex - a part of the brain associated with decision-making - is found to be shrunken in habitual criminals with psychopathic tendencies. In repeat impulsive offenders, the part of the brain related to learning from your mistakes - the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - has been found to be underdeveloped. Previously, research has shown that low activity in the anterior cingulate is linked to a higher risk of reoffending while shrunken amygdalas, related to emotions and morality, have been found in teenagers with conduct disorders - described by doctors as aggressive and anti-social traits. These include burglary, violence and pathological lying. Graeme Fairchild, a clinical psychology lecturer at Southampton University, told the Sunday Times: 'If the parts of your brain involved in feeling guilt or empathy are damaged, then there is an issue of diminished responsibility. It is too early to use this research in courts, but we have to ask if they are truly to blame for their behaviour.'","Adrian Raine, of the University of Pennysylvania explains findings in The Anatomy of Violence .

The Reddit thread was inspired by the story of Florida teenager Kiera Wilmot, who was expelled for a science experiment because the school had to stick to its rules . Thought your office had strange rules? Some of these tales of from the workplace may have you counting your blessings. From regulations for the length of beards to bans on food, it seems some bosses have created rules - and refused to budge - just because they can. A thread discussing dumb workplace rules on Reddit attracted nearly 14,000 contributions from disgruntled employees, prompted by the story of Florida teenager Kiera Wilmot. Kiera, 16, said by her high school principal to be a good kid, was expelled and charged with explosives offences for an experiment that went wrong last week. She was mixing aluminum foil and toilet cleaner in an 8oz water bottle before school when the elements reacted and caused an explosion. Although she said she was just curious to see what happened  - and had the good school grades to back this up - she was expelled from Bartow High School in Polk County because they had to stick to school rules over unsupervised explosives. With Kiera's story in mind, Reddit users shared their worst experience of 'rules are rules' being taken to the extreme by jobsworth managers. The most popular tale regarded cell phones at a laser tag arena, trying to combat the problem of younger workers finding creative ways to get round the cell phone ban. 'No cell phone shaped objects in your . pockets at work,' wrote one employee. 'At first I thought it was a typo, then they started to . write people up for wallets, packs of gum, and other rectangular shapes . in our pockets.' One user shared a story about someone reacting badly to a show of social niceties. 'Someone at work sneezed and another . one said ""Bless You!"" A third party heard it and complained to HR about . it. 'Guy who said ""bless you"" was given a warning and had to take a . course in professionalism. 'That's something most people . say as without thinking and they mean it in a good way.' One worker was given a warning for saying 'bless you' to a sneezing colleague . One attorney told how they are not allowed to bring in soda to share with other employees because the office has a vending machine. They also said that they have to tell their receptionist where they are going when they leave the office and inform her of their return. 'I'm an attorney for christ's sake, I had more autonomy in undergrad,' they wrote. One user, who said they worked for the United States federal government, said staff are not allowed to move their own furniture. They wrote: 'Want to slide a desk across the room? Can't. That is violating union rules, and taking work away from the facilities team. You have to call and schedule the movers. Then they charge you for it.'. Another government rule on food and personal items was proved to be bananas. 'People used to keep snacks . on their desk while working, because we're human. 'The employer . implemented ""lean working"" so every desk had to be totally empty, except . for select items that had to be arranged in a certain way (pens had to . be to the upper left of the keyboard, I think). 'This . rule forbid food items, but allowed one ""personal item"". One staff . member had a banana in a banana case as her personal item. She was told . to put it away. One woman tried to get round the 'no food' rule by claiming an 'inactive' banana in a banana case was a personal item . 'She . refused and took it further until it was ruled that because she wasn't . eating it and the skin hadn't been broken, it was an ""inactive banana"" and thus a personal item. It only became active during the act of . eating, at which point it became food.' A 'ritzy cafe' had five 'separate and distinct' rules for men wanting to wear beards, according to one user. 'Beards had to be between a certain length or you had to shave it. No mutton chops. Rules about moustache/beard combos. If you wanted to grow a beard, you were not allowed back into work for two weeks until you grew it out to a ""respectable length"".' Facial hair was clearly problematic for more places than the cafe. Another user said: 'At my former job we weren't allowed to ""grow"" facial hair. 'So we were allowed to either have no facial hair at all, or have a FULLY grown moustache. 'Our manager told us if we wanted to have a moustache, we would have to go on vacation, grow a stash, and come back from our vacation with a fully grown moustache. One warehouse won't relax the 'no hats' rules for its bald workers . 'So on the next day we all showed up wearing fake moustaches.' One warehouse took its dress code too far, according to another Reddit commenter. 'I work in a warehouse. No hats. It's cold here in the winter and the poor bald guys can't wear hats.' Stationery proved problematic, too, said one contributor. 'We have to wear safety goggles when using a stapler at work due to an idiotic employee.' While one office doesn't trust its employee with water bottles - possibly because they think they will fill them with alcohol. 'My place of employment only lets staff drink water from small cups, and you must drink the whole cup immediately, then dispose of the cup,' said another Redditor. 'You are not allowed to have water bottles on shift, no matter which part of the store you are working in. If you are on break (unpaid time) you cannot purchase a bottle of water, even if you drink all of it and dispose of the bottle before you come back on shift.' An insurance company took punctuality to extremes: 'You are allowed one fifteen minute break at 10:30. You are allowed your lunch at 1:00, and you are allowed one more . fifteen minute break at 3:30. 'If you are ONE MINUTE late coming back . from any of those three things, you are immediately written up' Naturally technology presents its own problems. 'At my work there are signs on the printers that say the warranty will be void if the printer is turned off,' said another comment. One office banned water bottles - only allowing workers to drink from a small cup . While the simple act of supplying the printer and fax machines had its own rules, too. 'Moving a single box without a dolly was breaking the rules. Well, since I am not a tiny girl (unlike all my coworkers) but rather a giant rugger, I would carry several boxes of paper around with me when resupplying the copy and fax machines,' said one user. 'They eventually fired me over it.'","Reddit thread attracted nearly 14,000 comments from disgruntled workers .

Long-term exposure to air particles from traffic pollution can cause clogging of the arteries, known as atherosclerosis, according to a study.

Massive underground ice explosions on Mars have created a unique set of twin craters, it has been revealed. A passing European Space Agency spacecraft captured the 50km wide craters, named the Arima twins, in January. They contain a unique central 'pit' formed by underground explosions, the space agency says. Double take: The 50km wide craters, contain a unique central 'pit' formed by underground explosions, the European Space Agency says . The ‘twin’ craters are in the Thaumasia . Planum region, a large plateau that lies immediately to the south of . Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the Solar System. 'Multiple terraces slump from the crater . walls onto a flat floor, but perhaps the most striking feature is the . central pit, a feature it shares with Arima crater to its north,' said the agency. Dramatic underground explosions, perhaps involving ice, are responsible for the pits inside these two large martian impact craters, which was imaged by ESA’s Mars Express spacecraft on 4 January. Researchers say impact craters like these can provide windows into the past of a planet’s surface. 'In this case, they . provide evidence for the Thaumasia Planum region having once hosted . plentiful subsurface water or ice that was liberated during impact . events both small and large,' it is claimed. A perspective view of one of the two 50 km diameter craters in Thaumasia Planum. The image was made by combining data from the High-Resolution Stereo Camera on ESA's Mars Express with digital terrain models. This colour-coded overhead view is based on an ESA Mars Express High-Resolution Stereo Camera digital terrain model of the crater, and reveals the relative depth of the craters . The craters were formed when an asteroid hits the rocky surface of a planet, and both it and the surface are compressed to high densities. Immediately after the impact, the compressed regions rapidly depressurise, exploding violently. In low-energy impacts, a simple . bowl-shaped crater results. In more dramatic events, larger craters are . produced with more complex features, such as uplifted central peaks or . sunken pits. 'One idea for central pit formation . is that when rock or ice melted during the impact drains away through . fractures beneath the crater, it leaves a pit,' said ESA.'Another theory is that subsurface ice is rapidly heated, vapourising in an explosion. 'As a result, the rocky surface is excavated forming an explosive pit surrounded by rocky debris. 'The pit is in the centre of the main crater, where most of the impact energy was deposited.' Where is it? The area imaged on 4 January 2013 lies just south of the Coprates Catena region of Vallis Marineris, in the Thaumasia region of Mars . Though the large craters in this scene have similar diameters, their central pits are different in size and depth, as is clearly evident in the topographical map. Compared to the Arima crater, perhaps more subsurface ice was present and more readily vapourised in the southern crater, punching through slightly thinner crust to leave a larger pit, ESA says. Many neighbouring small impact craters also show evidence for subsurface water or ice at the time of impact as evidenced by their ‘rampart’ ejecta blankets. Ejecta blankets are debris deposits surrounding the crater, excavated from inside the crater during its formation. They have petal-like lobes around their edges: these result from liquid water bound up in the ejected material, allowing it to flow along the surface and giving it a fluid appearance.","Each giant crater is 50km wide and contains a central 'pit' formed during the explosions .

If there’s one thing people with irritable bowel syndrome don’t want to hear, it’s that their condition is ‘all in the mind’. Yet that’s what many doctors believe. It has caused a great deal of debate in the medical community, but while some GPs imply sufferers are a bunch of malingerers or hypochondriacs, it is a very real and very miserable condition. Symptoms – tending to first appear when patients are in their early 20s to 30s – include bloating, cramps, heartburn and endless embarrassing or uncomfortable situations. Life-changing: Joanna Cowdrey, 31, has rebuilt her life after she received hypnosis treatment for her Irritable Bowel Syndrome - read her story below . It is thought that up to one Briton in ten suffers from IBS, but we still don’t know what causes it. It is a diagnosis of exclusion given only when other, more sinister diseases – such as cancer, diverticular disease and stomach ulcers and gallstones – have been ruled out and we can’t find anything physically wrong with the gut. As a doctor specialising in the health of the digestive system, I know all too well how debilitating IBS is. So I don’t say this lightly: a great number of patients must accept that their state of mind may be the root of their problem. Of course I don’t mean patients are simply neurotic, but that we must stop looking at the brain and digestive system as separate entities. Complex interactions occur between the two, with each being able to influence the other through a connection known as the autonomic nervous system. For example, when we are nervous or stressed we often feel ‘butterflies’ in our stomach or an urgent need to go to the toilet. And it is increasingly believed that our minds may also play an important role in digestive disorders such as IBS. Gut reaction: Digestive health can be influenced by personality traits . Studies in the early Nineties showed that people with IBS often suffer from anxiety and depression. The natural extension of these findings was to prescribe medications to IBS sufferers similar to those used in these psychological disorders, but they do not work in all patients. In order to understand further the interaction between our brains and our bowels, I teamed up with colleagues to design a study looking at the difference in pain responses between healthy people and those with long-term digestive pain. A groundbreaking study from Manchester University has found that hypnosis may be an effective treatment for IBS. Improvements in symptoms were seen in more than 75 per cent of men and women who had the therapy – and the effects lasted for five or more years. Professor Peter Whorwell, who has pioneered the treatment at Manchester, says: ‘Hypnotherapy offers patients a 60 to 75 per cent chance of substantial reduction in their symptoms that can last many years.’ One IBS sufferer to have benefited is Joanna Cowdrey, a 31-year-old supermarket manager, who began to have bowel problems six years ago. ‘I put it down to diet,’ says Joanna, who lives near Southampton. ‘Then I started getting attacks of diarrhoea which lasted for two weeks or so. I was also getting a lot of abdominal pain. At times I was too sick for work. It was impossible to travel on public transport because of the sudden need to go to the loo.’ Her GP ordered tests, which showed nothing physically wrong – and Joanna was diagnosed with IBS. After medication had no effect, she was invited to participate in the Manchester trial. ‘There were no swinging watches and people saying “Look into my eyes” as they do in films and on TV. You sit down on a sofa at the start of the sessions and the therapist starts to talk to you in a very relaxed way. ‘You start to feel half-asleep, but you can still hear what they are saying. During the sessions, they make positive suggestions about what to do about the IBS and symptoms. I had 12 sessions in all, and started to see benefits in the symptoms around the third and fourth sessions. ‘It really has changed my life.  My symptoms are far less intrusive, and life now is really great.’ First of all we assessed their personality, by asking questions such as ‘Are you talkative?’, ‘Do you find fault with others?’, ‘Are you calm in tense situations?’ to measure whether they were moody and depressed or outgoing and sociable. We also measured physical markers – their heart rate, blood pressure and responses of the autonomic nervous system to pain. To cause this pain, we inserted through the nose and into the gullet a tube with a small balloon attached that could be inflated to cause discomfort until the subject could not tolerate any more. Subjects then had to rate the pain. The results were fascinating. We found that both the healthy and those with chronic gut pain fell into two groups. The first group were more neurotic and anxious and they tolerated less pain. The second group were more extrovert and less anxious and tolerated more pain. So what does this mean? Well, accepted wisdom has been that all people have a ‘fight or flight’ response to pain. In other words, every person’s heart rate and blood pressure increase when they are in pain so they can either run away or fight back. But we found that subjects who were more neurotic, according to their questionnaire results, did not have this response. Instead, their system ‘froze’ when confronted with pain. Those who were more anxious had a lower tolerance to pain but also saw their blood pressure and heart rate drop, something that hadn’t been seen before. We found that while in healthy people 60 per cent had a fight or flight response and 40 per cent had the freeze response, in people with chronic gut pain the response was reversed. Only 30 per cent had a fight or flight response and 70 per cent had the freeze response. This is physical evidence that those who are more anxious are more likely to suffer digestive discomfort. Our results also provide some explanation as to why some IBS sufferers may respond to cognitive behavioural therapy – a kind of talking therapy – or hypnotherapy rather than drugs like anti-depressants. We already know that psychological therapies work for some with IBS, but there are not many centres that offer them for gut pain on the NHS. That could change if we can show the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, so we are now recruiting volunteers for a larger, stage two study. IBS sufferers have a poor quality of life and are often shunned by medical professionals. The anxiety and depression that exists alongside the pain is common, but it is a chicken-and-egg situation. With the right treatment, we might be able to help these people get back to enjoying life.","Hypnosis can be used to treat Irritable Bowel Syndrome, according to study .

Emotional: Gabriel Nagy, now 69, smiles with daughter Jennifer, now 34, some 23 years after he lost his memory and disappeared . A father who disappeared from his family has finally been reunited - 23 years after he lost his memory. Gabriel Nagy, now 69, suffered amnesia after a car crash while driving home from work in Newcastle, Australia, in January 1987. His wife Pam, daughter Jennifer, then nine, and son Stephen, 11, were devastated after finding the burned-out wreckage of his car - but no sign of him. Two weeks before an inquest into his disappearance was due to record Mr Nagey as being dead, a quick-thinking policewoman discovered his medial records. Mr Nagy has now made an emotional reunion with his family. 'I'd been living under a pseudonym for a long time but I'd been having flashes of my proper name; things were slowly returning,' Mr Nagy told the Courier Mail. Mr Nagey had been a doting father and husband before the accident. His last movements recorded him buying camping equipment at a store in Newcastle, New South Wales. It is believed that he used the items to live out in the wilderness. He spent the next few years sleeping rough and drinking. He went through a succession of jobs on fishing boats, farms and building sites. Mr Nagey says his only memory was of bleeding profusely from a wound on the back of his head, which still bears a scar. But he was given a life-line after Pastor Barry Hayhoe from the River of Life church offered him a job as a caretaker and a room. His life continued with no memories of the tragedy. With no sign of their relative, his family had all but given up on ever hearing from him again. But Senior Constable Georgia Robinson, who was involved in the inquest, scanned medicare records and discovered somebody with the same name. She tracked Mr Nagey down and asked him a series of questions. Slowly, the memories of his earlier life began to return and his family were informed that he was still alive. How it used to be: Mr Nagey looks every part the happy family man with wife Pam, daughter Jennifer, aged nine, and son Stephen, 11, before the accident which caused his memory loss . 'It was like a cartoon where . flashbulbs go off on top of people's heads,' Mr Nagey said. 'She gave . me a letter from Jennifer, a letter from Pam and letters from my Dad and . stepmum.' Mr Nagey said he posted 'the longest letter of his life' to his family. Three days later his daughter sent him a text message which read: 'Hi dad'. Mr Nagey broke down in tears. Jennifer, now 34, wrote that she still loved her father and wanted to meet up with him. 'He met me at the airport with a big bunch of flowers,' she said. 'It was like it was all in slow motion and we ran through the airport into each others arms.' Jennifer and mother Pam look through family photographs reminding them of the life they used to live. They moved away from the former family home but are still in touch with Mr Nagey . Mr Nagey also had an emotional phone conversation with his former wife until the 'battery on the mobile died'. Jennifer believes that her father suffered from Dissociative Fugue. The condition is associated with memory loss and leads to people wandering away from their families. She said that she has now decided to tell her story because she wanted to give hope to other people, that 'miracles can happen'. She urged anybody who was away from their family or had left home to let somebody know as the 'not knowing can really affect you'. Mr Nagey has not moved back in with his family, who relocated to Queensland's Sunshine Coast after the tragedy, but he is regular contact with them.","Gabriel Nagey lived in the wild after losing memory and family moved away .

A three-year-old Asiatic black bear has been hailed a medical pioneer after becoming the first of her kind to undergo brain surgery. Champa, who lives at a sanctuary in the mountains of northern Laos, had always stood out after she was rescued as a cub due to her protruding forehead and difficulties socialising with other bears. When her behaviour became more erratic and her vision faded, vets and staff at the Free the Bears sanctuary, situated about 20 miles south of Luang Prabang, started to suspect hydrocephalus, or 'water on the brain', which is described as similar to having a 'constant migraine'. Champa the bear underwent brain surgery after staff suspected she was suffering from a condition which is like having a 'constant migraine' Champa's operation took six hours and was carried out by an Edinburgh Zoo vet . Staff from Free The Bears say Champa is already showing signs of improvement since the procedure . While in most Western countries an animal with the condition would be put down, the strong Buddhist traditions in Laos, and the technicalities of its wildlife protection laws, meant this was not an option, the National Geographic has reported. Champa underwent six hours of keyhole surgery, carried out by South African veterinary surgeon Pizzi, who works at the Edinburgh Zoo, in Scotland. During the procedure, in February, the vet drilled a small hole behind one of the bear's ears and used an ultrasound probe to confirm she was hydrocephalic. He then inserted a thin tube into the brain and threaded it under her skin to her abdomen. It will remain in place to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid into the abdominal cavity, where it can be easily absorbed. Matt Hunt, chief executive of Free the Bears, told National Geographic that by the following morning Champa was awake and 'looking like a very different bear'. He said: 'There was a lot more recognition. We can't know if her vision is fully recovered, but everyone certainly believes her vision has improved.' The Asiatic black bear lives at a sanctuary in northern Laos . Champa has spent most of her life at the Free the Bears sanctuary, situated about 20 miles south of Luang Prabang (pictured) The sanctuary protects bears rescued by Lao officials from wildlife traffickers. The Asiatic black bear, or moon bear, is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Its bile is considered a valuable ingredient in traditional Chinese and Korean medicine. National Geographic has reported how six weeks after the operation, Champa is gaining weight and is more active and social.","Champa underwent the six hour operation after hydrocephalic diagnosis .

They examined data covering 125,000 . properties run by 10 local councils and housing associations to try to . detect potential fraud. They also looked at tenancy lists, and then compared the registered tenant's credit activity and which address it was associated with.

A teenager who suffers from constantly changing allergies has told how she dices with death every day. Nicole Gray, 19, has been rushed to hospital more than 100 times in the past three years after suffering life-threatening anaphylactic reactions to common foods and household products. Because her allergies constantly change she never knows what is safe for her to eat or handle. For months she was told to avoid all . nuts after a severe reaction to hazelnuts - but then accidentally ate a . meal containing peanuts and suffered no adverse effects. Nicole Gray, 19, suffers from constantly changing, life-threatening allergies. She has had severe reactions to pears, maple syrup, painkillers, nuts and chocolate . The charity Anaphylaxis Campaign believes that the unusual reactions could be caused by Nicole having a variable allergy threshold. The allergy threshold is the amount of an allergen that a person can consume before they have a reaction. This could explain why she can sometimes eat certain foods but why at other times she cannot. She experienced similar reactions to shellfish and chocolate - a swelling of the throat and a severe rash - but can now eat both safely. The list of foods and household items she is currently allergic to includes cheese, maple syrup, pears, ibuprofen, aspirin, face wipes and some soaps. Nights out are also dangerous for Nicole because people often assume she is drunk if she collapses with an anaphylactic reaction. She said: ‘If I don't receive the correct treatment then it can kill within five minutes. ‘It is not a game. It is life or death, and it is really difficult to deal with.’ She added: ‘When I go to a bar or club I have to make sure that they know I suffer from allergies and asthma. ‘The automatic assumption if they see a teenager ill or collapsed is that it is drink-related. She has been rushed to hospital more than 100 times in the past three years after suffering life-threatening anaphylactic reactions . ‘I always say to my friends to assume it's the allergies and phone me an ambulance.’ Experts at the Anaphylaxis Campaign, a charity which supports sufferers, said her unusual reactions may be caused by her having a variable allergy threshold – a variation in the amount of the allergen required to cause a reaction. Nicole, who lives with her mother Grace, 49, in Musselburgh, East Lothian, has no family history of severe allergies and enjoyed a normal childhood. When she was 15, she was diagnosed with asthma, and at 16 had her first anaphylactic reaction after eating ice cream topped with hazelnuts. Doctors diagnosed her with severe allergies - or anaphylaxis - and she has since had reactions to numerous foods and household products. Because her allergies constantly change, Nicole never knows what is safe for her to eat or handle . When she has a reaction she develops an itchy rash, swollen throat and breathing difficulties. She has to carry an 'EpiPen' - which delivers a shot of life-saving adrenaline – at all times. When she has a reaction she also has to dial 999 so doctors can administer adrenaline, anti-histamines and steroids. Nicole said: ‘When I had my first anaphylactic reaction I was told to avoid every nut. ‘It was really, really hard, and food shopping would take an age. Even things like pure fruit juice could be off limits because it might have been packaged in a factory with nuts. ‘My allergy was so severe that I could not risk anything at all.’ She added: ‘My nut allergy has since gone away and I've gone through phases of being allergic to other things like shellfish and cocoa. ‘Normally it starts with a really itchy, red, blotchy rash. I can get throat swelling, tongue swelling and my eyes can swell up. I have breathing difficulties a lot of the time and I often feel really dizzy. ‘Depending on what it's a reaction to, it varies how long it takes to come on. Food is really, really quick, but medication can take hours. ‘I had a really bad reaction to stilton, so they have said that at the moment I have to avoid all cheese. It sucks that I've got to avoid pizza. ‘Face wipes also have something in them that I can't use. When I'm out I carry hand gel, as I have had reactions to soap in the past.’ Over one 14-week period, Nicole was rushed to hospital at least once a week and missed so much school she had to stay on to take her final exams. When she has a reaction she develops an itchy rash, swollen throat and breathing difficulties. She has to carry an EpiPen at all times . Moira Austin, of the Anaphylaxis Campaign, said: ‘Allergies to foods such as nuts, peanuts, fish and shellfish, are less likely to be outgrown and are likely to be lifelong. ‘Allergic individuals have a “threshold level”, the lowest amount of the food they're allergic to that can trigger a reaction and below which the individual would not be expected to react. ‘Threshold levels can differ between allergic individuals and in one individual from one day to the next depending on a number of factors that may include the person's state of health, whether they have asthma and whether the asthma is well controlled. ‘Factors such as exercise and stress may also alter an individual's threshold level.’","Nicole Gray has been rushed to hospital in anaphylactic shock 100 times .

Women in the UK know more about intimate beauty treatments than they do about serious sexual health conditions, a new survey suggests. While 67 per cent claim to have heard of Brazilian bikini waxing and 48 had heard of vajazzles - made famous by The Only Way is Essex - just 39 per cent know about Bacterial vaginosis (BV). This is a condition that can lead to fertility problems, miscarriage and increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. BV affects one in three women, making it twice as common as thrush, and if untreated during pregnancy it can lead to serious complications. Women in the UK know more about intimate beauty treatments than they do about serious sexual health conditions . The condition can put women at risk of contracting STIs such as gonorrhoea and chlamydia . Pregnant women with the condition are six times more likely to miscarry and twice as likely to give birth prematurely. BV occurs when the balance of internal bacteria is disrupted, leading to an unpleasant odour. It can be treated with antibiotics. The survey, carried out by Balance Activ – producers of a BV treatment – also revealed that the condition often goes undiagnosed as 38 per cent of women only feel comfortable getting intimate health advice from online forums while 19 per cent are too embarrassed to talk to their GP. The research comes shortly after experts warned that women who use shower gels and soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing sexually transmitted infections. Researchers at the University of . California, Los Angeles, said that soaps and lubricants can damage . sensitive tissues and raise a woman’s chance of becoming infected with . herpes, chlamydia and HIV. Women who use soaps in intimate areas are putting themselves at higher risk of developing sexually transmitted infections . Study leader Joelle Brown said there is ‘mounting evidence’ that using these products internally can also increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis. Dr Brown's team recruited 141 women in Los Angeles who agreed to answer questionnaires about their product use and undergo lab tests for vaginal infections. The researchers found that 66 per cent of the women reported using lubricants and cleansers internally. The most commonly used products were sexual lubricants - 70 per cent of the product-using group used commercial lubricants, while 17 per cent reported using petroleum jelly and 13 per cent used oils. Test results showed that the women who used products not intended for internal use, such as oils and Vaseline, were more likely to have yeast and bacterial infections. For instance, 40 per cent of the women who used petroleum jelly as a lubricant had bacterial vaginosis - an infection that can be caused by a number of common bacterial species - compared to 18 per cent of women who did not insert petroleum jelly.","67% of women polled had heard of Brazilian bikini waxes, but only 39% knew of bacterial vaginosis (BV)

A former sunbed addict has issued a terrifying warning after it was revealed that more men than ever are dying of skin cancer. Freddie Bishop, 49, from Neston, Cheshire, had ignored the signs for two years before being diagnosed after his partner nagged him into seeing his GP. He needed life saving surgery to remove a tumour the size of a golf ball from his face after contracting the deadly disease. He will remain scarred for life despite skin grafts from his thigh to rebuild the hole left in his temple. Sunbed addict Freddie Bishop had a golf ball-sized tumour removed from his forehead after developing skin cancer . Self-confessed sunbed addict Freddie is now calling for greater restrictions as new figures from Cancer Research UK reveal more men than women are dying from the disease. While more women continue to be diagnosed, the charity believes more men are dying because, like Freddie, they are less likely to report symptoms to their GP. Nursing assistant Freddie said: ‘I knew about the risks but I’d been using them for so long with no problems I thought I was safe. ‘To be honest, I was addicted to having a year round tan and just assumed it wouldn’t happen to me. I hate going to the doctor and didn’t want to make a fuss so when I first noticed a scab I just ignored it until it disappeared. 'It was only when my partner got really cross and demanded I see the GP that I finally went. I wish I had gone earlier.' Recent research has shown that the risks of using sunbeds are far higher than previously thought. Unhealthy glow: Freddie says he loved having a tan and used sunbeds several times a week . Scientists at the University of Dundee recently revealed that sunbeds are twice as likely to cause skin cancer than a holiday in the Mediterranean sun. The World Health organisation states sunbeds are as lethal as cigarettes and list them as one of the most dangerous cancer causing habits. The Government banned them for use by under-18s last year. But thousands of Brits like Freddie continue to risk their lives for a tan. He said: 'I started using sun beds to get a bit of a tan before a holiday so I looked good on the beach and stop me burning. ‘Then when I got back from my holidays I kept using them so my tan didn’t fade. I looked healthier and felt good. Soon it become a habit.’ He went from using sunbeds once a week to four times a week for the then maximum permitted 12 minutes. ‘I only had one holiday a year but liked the way I looked and felt with a tan so kept using the sunbeds all year round. Freddie's girlfriend Denise was attracted to him because of his tan, but soon became worried about his excessive sunbed use . After being diagnosed with skin cancer, he had a golf ball-sized tumour removed from his forehead and a skin graft taken from his thigh (right) ‘Back then not much was said about using them but even when they started warning people I took no notice, because I didn’t think it would happen to me . ‘To be honest I didn’t want to look pasty white all year. If I looked healthy and tanned on the outside I felt good on the inside.’ Freddie admits he became addicted to tanning sessions and was regularly complimented on his deep glow. ‘I loved it. When I went on holiday I never burned and people were always telling me I looked young and fit for my age. Why would I stop? 'I’m a modern man so using the sunbed never bothered me. As the years passed I started to notice more men at the salon than women. I think men started to take more care of how they looked.’ In fact it was his healthy looking tan that first attracted girlfriend Denise Greatbanks. The couple met on a dating website in 2011. Denise said: ‘I liked Freddie’s profile picture because he looked so fit and well and I suppose part of that was his tan.’ But the beautician was shocked to find out his glow was down to sunbeds. Denise repeatedly begged Freddie to get his mole seen to, but he refused. When she found blood on the pillow, she insisted he get checked out . ‘He was quite open about using the sunbed but it was the frequency that really worried me. ‘He was at the tanning shop at least four or five times a week. My job means I know how bad it is for your skin and I tried to warn him but Freddie just laughed. ‘Like many men he thought he was immune to the risks and had been using for so long he hated the way he looked when he wasn’t tanned. ‘I told him to use a fake tan but he wasn’t interested and just carried on.’ But months before the couple met Freddie had noticed a blemish on his right temple. ‘It kept appearing and fading away so I never gave it much thought,’ he explains. But these were the vital first warning signs of Basal Cell Carinoma (BCC). Over the following months the blemish began to scab and Denise nagged him to see a doctor but Freddie refused. ‘I felt great and I didn’t want to make a fuss and waste time over nothing. Beside the scab would fall off and everyone would forget about it.’ Undeterred, Freddie kept using the sunbed. Then last year Denise started finding blood on the pillow and once again nagged Freddie to see a doctor about the scab. Once again he tried to avoid his GP by turning to the Internet where he self diagnosed a harmless skin condition. Regrets: Freddie now wishes he had never used sunbeds and hopes his story will deter other people . He said: ‘The pictures looked the same so I told Denise I knew what it was and not to worry. I was sure if I had skin cancer I wouldn’t have felt so well.’ In September 2012 the couple holidayed in Turkey where Freddie’s tan gave him confidence on the beach. But . the scab was growing and clearly visible in their holiday snaps on . their return. This time Denise insisted Freddie see a doctor. The following month in October 2012 he was referred to a dermatologist who took one look and asked Freddie if he used sunbeds. ‘I . knew straight away it was bad news. I couldn’t believe what a fool I . had been,' he said. The consultant suspected skin cancer and arranged a . biopsy. A month later, the devastating news was confirmed. BCC is one of the most frequently occurring types of skin cancer and usually associated with exposure to UV light. Freddie . said: ‘It doesn’t normally spread but I had left it for so long without . seeing a doctor that it didn’t look good at all.’ He was admitted for surgery in January this year. ‘When . I came round I was told the cancer had spread even more than they had . expected. It was right down to the bone. I nearly lost an eye and ear. ‘I was shocked when I saw the size of the hole left behind. It looked like a crater left by a golf ball. ‘They’ve done a great job with the skin graft but I’ll still be scarred for life. I’m just lucky to be alive. ‘It goes without saying that I wish I had never started using sun beds and I will never use them again. ‘My fear is that despite the warnings people still want to look like the cast of TOWIE and will keep using sunbeds to get a tan. ‘Men can’t use fake tan because it’s messy and gets stuck in your stubble. The sunbeds are an easy option. ‘Tougher regulations would help but it might be easier just to ban them all together. ‘In my experience it seems to be the men still using them and men hate going to the doctor so are perhaps more at risk. ‘I hope my story stops even one person from using the sunbed.’","Freddie Bishop, 49, used sunbeds several times a week for many years .

Back in the saddle: A fall from his bike revealed that Keith Ssewamala had a life-threatening condition that required him to have five operations in a year . A teenager who fell off his bike ended up needing five heart operations in a year - after his accident alerted doctors to a life-threatening condition. Fourteen-year-old Keith Ssewamala,was just like any active teenager when he fell off his bike while playing with friends. What should have been a routine tumble ended up with with Keith suffering chest pains and the discovery of an aneurysm on his heart. While the aneurysm was successfully removed from his left ventricle, his health problems continued when he began coughing up blood and losing his eyesight. Keith, from Brixton, south London, was then rushed to Evelina Children's Hospital after suffering a seizure. Medics discovered he suffered from Takayashu arteritis - a condition that usually affects middle-aged women. It's so rare in young boys that the chances of getting it are just two million to one. The condition causes inflammation that primarily damages the aorta and can lead to blockages or narrowed arteries, high blood pressure and eventually to . heart failure or stroke. As a result of his condition, Keith had to undergo five open heart surgeries and keyhole procedures in just a year. He said: 'I wasn't expecting to have five open heart operations in a year - one was bad enough, but I knew I could get through it and they were making me better. 'Going through it all has made me all the more determined to do something with my life. 'They discovered I had the illness when I fell off the bike and say maybe it even triggered it.' Keith, who lives with his mother Monica, 36, said he had a lot to thank his family and doctors for. Now recovered, he has set up a foundation to . help other children with heart problems. Keith fell from his bike in 2008 and is still receiving treatment with injections every week at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

He . said: 'I'm blessed to have parents who are so devoted to my happiness. I . realise that not all children have family and relatives like mine and . I'm so grateful for all their support. His mother said she was proud of how her son kept smiling throughout all the operations. She said: 'In hospital, Keith would be getting out of bed and going to see other children - he wanted to see how they were and talk to them. 'He has been so brave since the fall from the bike and I think it was that fall that triggered the heart problem. 'Keith does have to take steroids now but his condition is still improving. 'He is so determined now to help other children so that is why we set up the foundation.' 'Evelina Children's Hospital has been fantastic in helping Keith battle his heart condition. The doctors and nurses are amazing every time we are there. Consultant . paediatric cardiologist Professor Qureshi, who has been in charge of . Keith's care, said: 'Keith has been diagnosed with Takayashu arteritis - . a rare form of heart disease that more frequently affects adult women.

'It involves inflammation in the walls of the largest arteries in the body, the aorta and its main branches. 'It has taken four years to diagnose this rare condition but his condition continues to improve. Keith is now hoping to tour other schools and hospitals nationally to inspire others as well as pursuing his dream of becoming an actor.

In Takayasu's arteritis, the aorta and other major arteries, including . those leading to your head and kidneys, become inflamed. Over time, the . inflammation causes changes in these arteries, including thickening, . narrowing and scarring. The result is reduced blood flow to vital . tissues and organs, which can lead to serious complications and even . death. Sometimes arteries become abnormally dilated, leading to . aneurysms that may rupture. Just what causes the initial inflammation in Takayasu's arteritis isn't . known. It's likely that Takayasu's arteritis is an autoimmune disease in . which your immune system malfunctions and attacks your own arteries as . if they were foreign substances. The disease may be triggered by a virus . or other infection.

Help: Sordell is being supported over his prodigious use of Facebook and Twitter, which has seen him targeted by online trolls . A footballer who received abuse on Twitter after reporting racist chanting is getting advice after becoming hooked on social media. Wanderers' manager Dougie Freedman revealed that Bolton Wanderers striker Marvin Sordell  was being advised about his excessive use of Twitter and Facebook, which he said bordered on 'an obsession'. Freedman, speaking on BBC Radio Manchester this morning, added that the 21-year-old had found it difficult to settle since moving to the Lancashire club from Watford last February. Bolton were alerted to Sordell's problems after he tweeted how he and team-mates had been racially abused during a match at Millwall in October. The London club later banned a 13-year-old boy, prompting Twitter trolls to target Sordell with more racist abuse. In November he was allegedly called a 'jungle ape' by Twitter user Steve Lawrence, who also reportedly criticised Mr Sordell for 'crying like a sissy' following the abuse he received from the Millwall fan. He also tweeted:'blacks and whites: obviously not the same because whites do not cry like sissies and fairies when they are booed by pre-teens'. In response, Mr Sordell tweeted: 'racism and homophobia all in one tweet. Well done, does that make you feel important or big?' After Sordell reported the abuse to police, six Millwall fans were arrested at their home game with Derby in November for unfurling a banner bearing the words ""Sordell is a c***."" In November Bolton captain Kevin Davies urged him to quit Twitter. He said: 'If it was me, I would advise not to go on it. 'What are you gaining out of it as a 21/22-year-old? I don’t know.

"By . Damien Gayle . UPDATED: . 20:14 EST, 18 February 2012 . The World Health Organisation has said that research into a dangerous new man-made mutant form of the bird flu virus will be made public in full at some point. However, the publication will not come until scientists have had time for 'a much fuller discussion of the risk and benefits . of research in this area, and risks of the virus itself,' according to an official. The agreement in principle to release the details of the deadly virus breaks days of deadlocks over whether the dangers of it being used as a weapon outweigh the advantages for researchers trying to find a vaccine. Deadly: The new man-made genetic mutation of the lethal H5N1 virus can be transmitted by coughs and sneezes . Scientists, health officials and . science journal editors have this week been locked in talks on whether . the study should be released amid fears it could be exploited by . bioterrorists. The . controversial research shows how to make a mutant strain of the H5N1 . virus, which kills roughly half of those who contract it, more . contagious. Earlier, the editor of a leading science journal had said that it is his duty to release the information. Dr Bruce Alberts, editor of Science, . did not publish after officials from the U.S. National Science Advisory . Board for Biosecurity intervened, in an unprecedented move, warning of . the risks if the virus fell into the hands of 'those who would seek to . do harm.' Dr Alberts said: 'Our position is we have to publish in complete form.' 'In the absence of any . mechanism to get the information to those scientists who need to protect . their populations and to design new treatments and vaccines, our . default position is that we have to publish in compete form.' Bring out your dead: A Pakistani health official removes chickens from an H5N1 infected farm in Gadap, Pakistan . Scientists believe that publishing . the details of the research is essential to developing flu vaccines. Dr . Alberts says creating a vaccine is essential in case the strain evolved . in the wild. 'This is likely to happen at some point in the wild because these viruses are mutating very actively in the wild,' he said. A World Health Organisation summit in Geneva this week is discussing the problem. Experts . warn that whatever the outcome of the meeting, censorship will not stop . scientists getting the tools to create and release a pandemic H5N1 . virus if they were intent on doing so. 'It . doesn't matter how much you restrict scientists from doing good, bad . people can still do bad things,' said Wendy Barclay, an expert in flu . virology at Imperial College London. The . WHO called the 'closed door' meeting, set to begin Friday in Geneva, to . break a deadlock between scientists and U.S. biosecurity chiefs. American . officials want to censor the work of two research teams, one in the . Netherlands and one in the U.S., who have found that just a small number . of mutations would allow deadly H5N1 to spread between mammals like . ordinary flu. The United . Nations health body has said it is 'deeply concerned about the potential . negative consequences' if the findings were to make their way into the . public domain. On January . 20, flu scientists from around the world declared a 60-day moratorium on . any research involving H5N1 that could produce more contagious forms of . the virus. At this week's . meeting, the researchers who made the findings and the editors of . Science and Nature, the two journals asked to withhold publication, will . meet officials from the U.S. National Science Advisory Board for . Biosecurity (NSABB) which asked for the papers to be censored. Keiji . Fukuda, the WHO's Assistant Director-General for Health Security and . Environment, who will chair the meeting, says he would like to secure . agreement on whether the studies should be published, in full or part, . and who should have access to them. The . findings are seen as vital for scientists to be able to develop . vaccines, diagnostic tests and anti-viral drugs that could be deployed . in the event of an H5N1 pandemic. 'It . is important that research on these viruses should continue,' Mr Fukuda . said. 'They do pose a risk. There's a lot of things we don't know about . them. 'The question is not . really should we continue to do research ... but under what conditions . can we do it so we don't unnecessarily create fears and risks.' First . detected in Hong Kong in 1997, the H5N1 virus remains entrenched among . poultry in many countries, mainly in Asia, but so far remains hard for . humans to catch. It is . known to have infected nearly 700 people worldwide since 2003, killing . half of them, making it far more deadly than the H1N1 swine flu which . caused a pandemic in 2009/2010. Ron . Fouchier, the scientist leading the Dutch team that gave H5N1 various . genetic mutations and made it transmissible in mammals, argues the . research must be published. He says it could help public health . officials better prepare for a scenario where the virus mutates and . becomes more deadly, spreading from person to person via coughs and . sneezes. He has also said . other research teams around the world are close to the same findings, . some of them inadvertently, and should be warned in advance how the . virus could become airborne. In . the short term, most scientists agree the moratorium is 'a good . gesture,' as flu expert and former WHO health security adviser David . Heymann describes it, one that offers the research community space to . think. Still, Mr Heymann, Ms . Barclay and many other scientists argue that stopping this type of . research into flu viruses and other potentially lethal pathogens would . set a dangerous precedent. Although adding and deleting genes can create super-strains that put the entire world at risk, Heymann said, the work is vital to developing effective vaccines and diagnostic tests which will be needed quickly if a pandemic hits. Stopping the research would prevent researchers from using all possible scientific options to prepare for naturally occurring, or deliberately caused, outbreaks. John Edmunds, head of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says studies on mutations of H5N1 are 'important work' that must go on. 'This flu strain has the potential to cause such enormous damage, and it's important to know how far away we are from a horrible event like that,' he said.","H5N1 bird flu virus kills half of humans that contract it .

Fraught 911 recordings have revealed the aftermath of the massive explosion at a Texas fertilizer plant last week, as residents plea for help, scramble for answers and beg for more medical staff. The chilling calls have been released as President Obama announced that he will attend a memorial service for those who lost their lives in West, Texas on Thursday, joined by Mrs Obama. Fourteen people were killed when the West Fertilizer Co. exploded on Wednesday night, including 10 emergency responders. As many as 37 blocks of the town of West were destroyed in the blast. Recordings from the night reveal how the calls quickly moved from brief reports of smoke to frantic pleas for more emergency responders. Tragic: Firefighters battle the flames at West Fertilizer Co. on Wednesday night after a deadly explosion. 911 calls have now revealed the desperate pleas for help in the aftermath of the explosion . When the first call came in, it was just a fire. Smoke was coming from West Fertilizer Co. and an alarm was sounding, so a woman at a park just across the railroad tracks called 911. She was calm and matter of fact. The dispatcher responded in kind: 'OK, I'm going to get them to put out the fire.' It was 7:29 p.m. April 17, and the last routine moment in West, Texas, since. Within 20 minutes, the park was strewn with two-foot chunks of concrete from the exploded fertilizer plant. The apartment complex behind it was ripped apart by the wave of energy that climbed the railroad bed and slammed into the building, shredding its roof and blowing out windows. Dispatchers were swamped with hysterical reports. Nearly all 50 calls that flooded in during the next 35 minutes came from within a mile of the plant. Some knew what happened, others knew only that windows had suddenly shattered on them and houses several blocks from the site were on fire. Chilling: A chemical trailer sits among the remains of a fertilizer plant burning after the explosion last week . Aid: 911 calls reveal the panic of emergency responders that they are running out of people to help them . Firefighters and EMTs would account for 10 of 14 people killed, and more than 200 people in the town of 2,800 would be counted as injured. State and federal investigators continued combing the site Monday looking for the cause of the blast so powerful it registered as small earthquake. They had found the center of the explosion a day earlier, but not the fire's starting point. Recordings show fears ran rampant among those who called 911 last Wednesday night. One woman who glanced outside and saw the mushroom cloud that erupted from the blast could be heard shouting: 'Get out of the house. Get out,' to those around her. 'There's a freaking cloud. Look at that!' An off-duty firefighter concerned about the air called a second time to say he was leaving with his family. A man wearing an ankle monitor told a dispatcher as he drove that he was fleeing the chemicals. Paying his respects: Obama, pictured last Friday, will attend a memorial service in Waco for the victims . Investigators later assured residents the town's air was not toxic. Calls from those further away relate terror of the unknown. Dispatchers asked callers to take deep breaths and repeat the unintelligible. 'Something happened out here,' a . crying 83-year-old woman tells the operator, her voice quavering. 'Our . house exploded or something. There was a big explosion and then our . house is just destroyed. 'We're all ok, but my God, what has happened?' she said. 'I'm scared to death.' Residents and dispatchers soon realized the enormity of the situation. One woman who called about a house burning on her street was asked if she lived close to the fertilizer plant. But she said she was several blocks away. Less than five minutes after the first explosion call, dispatchers also knew West's own emergency resources were severely hampered. Mourning: A tear rolls down Vanna Wainwright's face as she hugs her daughter Breanna, 9, during an open air Sunday church service four days after the deadly explosion in West, Texas . Destruction: This aerial photo shows the remains of the fertilizer plant destroyed by the explosion . 'Listen to me, my ambulance station . just completely exploded,' a West EMS supervisor can be heard saying on . one call. 'I've got a nursing home and an ambulance station and an air . evac. I need as many ... trucks as you can send this way.' 'The . roof completely collapsed on the building. I'm doing a walk through . now. I think we got everybody out,' he said. 'I don't have radio . communications, I have lost my repeater.' The blast left the city with one functioning ambulance. An EMT training class was in the building that evening. The trainees already had passed their practical exam, so they left the class to go help, said Dr. George Smith, West EMS's medical director. Four of the 18 in that class died. 'Every one of them were friends of mine,' Smith said. Smith now carries a photo on his phone that shows a huge pile of debris, part of what used to be the West Rest Haven nursing home, where he also is medical director. The home sat between the ambulance building and the fertilizer plant. Burned: An apartment complex is destroyed; many residents called 911 to ask what had happened . Ruined: Scores of homes were destroyed in the huge blast, and 14 people lost their lives . 'I was under that,' Smith said of the collapsed roof in the photo. His face bears scrapes and scratches from the night. Smith and others managed to get all of the about 130 residents out. One man later died, not from injuries but his existing medical conditions, Smith said. A woman whose mother-in-law was a resident told a 911 dispatcher they needed flashlights to help find the injured. 'We've got old people, they're bleeding, they've got glass,' she said. 'This rest home is completely demolished.' Injured residents of an assisted living facility next door were moved to the front porch. 'My people are at the assisted living, three workers and my 11 residents and they're all bleeding,' another 911 caller said. 'They're trying to take care of the bleeding but nobody has any medical attention over there right now.' Struggle: Churchgoers huddle to pray after a service for the First Baptist Church in a field on Sunday . On the mend: Five days after the fertilizer plant explosion, a flag flies from a damaged home as the damaged West Intermediate School is seen in the distance . One man who called twice from about a 1/2-mile south of the plant said he had dug three women out of a collapsed house. 'Hurry, they're bleeding bad,' he said. Help was coming, but from a distance. Dispatchers told callers they were bringing in fire trucks from elsewhere. One dispatcher had the pleasant surprise of being offered medical professionals. 'I have several people that are willing to go help, medical personnel, nurses and such, do you all still need help?' one woman offered. 'Can they go help with the triage and such?' 'That would be perfect,' the dispatcher said. 'We need as many medical people as we can get.'","Recordings reveal how calls quickly changed from brief reports of smoke to frantic pleas for more emergency responders .

Angry: Sharon Ellis said the attack on her son Ryan was a direct result of the example Suarez had set . A boy of 11 was suspended from school yesterday for biting another child after telling him: ‘I’m going to do a Luis Suarez.’ The pupil sank his teeth into his classmate after copying the shamed Liverpool footballer who bit another player on Sunday. Suarez, 26, who earns £100,000 a week, is facing a long ban after biting Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic. But despite the global revulsion caused by the incident, Liverpool FC has refused to sack their £23million player – who has now been offered ‘anger management’ by the players’ union. Last night mother Sharon Ellis said the attack on her son Ryan, 11, was a direct result of the example Suarez had set. She said: ‘Suarez’s actions on the football field have led to my son being bitten. The boys were at the school’s breakfast club and there had been some altercation because someone had stood on someone’s foot. The other boy turned round to my son and said, “I’m going to do a Luis Suarez, I’m going to bite you”. ‘And then he went ahead and bit his upper right arm. He then went around bragging to the other children that he had “done a Suarez”.’ Miss Ellis, 45, from Connah’s Quay, North Wales, said Ryan –  a Liverpool fan – was left with a bruised upper arm. ‘He was a bit shaken. The bite went through two layers of clothing and left a mark,’ she said. ‘These aren’t nursery school children, you don’t expect 11-year-olds to go around biting each other. They looked at what Luis Suarez did, he did not even get sent off.’ The moment: Suarez, 26, who earns £100,000 a week, is facing a lengthy ban after biting Branislav Ivanovic . Miss Ellis, who works as a Royal Mail administrator, said the other boy had now been suspended from school. ‘I haven’t heard this child’s name before as being a naughty boy in school, I think it’s just a copycat situation. Suarez should not have done what he did, he’s an adult at the end of the day.’ The Football Association has charged Suarez with violent conduct and the Professional Footballers’ Association have offered him anger management counselling. Yesterday Liverpool FC refused to sack the Uruguayan, instead choosing to fine him an undisclosed amount, possibly two weeks’ wages. Last night the Prime Minister stepped into the row. His spokesman urged the FA to take into account Suarez’s position as a role model when deciding on the length of the ban. He said: ‘It’s rightly a matter for the football authorities to consider. As part of their considerations, I think it would be very understandable if they took into account the fact that high-profile players are often role models.’ Under fire: Suarez was seen in Liverpool yesterday (left) after scoring in Sunday's Premier League game (right) Asked whether Mr Cameron felt that Suarez had set a ‘bad example’ to young children, the spokesman replied: ‘I think the implication is fairly clear.’ The footballer, who is married to his childhood sweetheart Sofia Balbi and has a two-year-old daughter, will not face police action after Ivanovic said he did not want to press charges. 'I haven’t heard this child’s name before as being a naughty boy in school, I think it’s just a copycat situation. Suarez should not have done what he did, he’s an adult at the end of the day' Sharon Ellis . But his sponsor Adidas took the unusual step of speaking out on the incident. A spokesman for the sports company said: ‘Adidas does not condone Luis Suarez’s behaviour and we will be reminding him of the standards we expect from our players.’ An FA spokesman said: ‘The incident was not seen by the match officials and has therefore been retrospectively reviewed. ‘It is alleged that the conduct of Suarez constitutes violent conduct and it is the FA’s contention that the standard punishment of three matches that would otherwise apply is clearly insufficient in these circumstances.’ Suarez has been in trouble for biting players before. He was nicknamed ‘The Cannibal of Ajax’ in 2010 for drawing blood from the shoulder of PSV Eindhoven’s Otman Bakkal while playing in Holland. Bite: Mother Sharon Ellis, 45, from North Wales, said Ryan - a Liverpool fan - was left with a bruised upper arm . Last season he was suspended for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United’s Patrice Evra. 'He’s a fantastic player, top scorer and everything we’d want in a striker, so there’s no change there. This is more about getting him back on the right track' Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre . Former Liverpool captain Graeme Souness said the latest incident made it ‘very difficult’ for Suarez to stay at the club. Immediately after the match, the club’s manager Brendan Rodgers insisted that any player was replaceable, ‘no matter how good they think they are’. But yesterday Liverpool, who were criticised for defending Suarez over the racial abuse incident, again stood by their star player. The club’s managing director Ian Ayre said: ‘Luis is a very important player to the club. As we keep saying, he signed a new four-year contract last summer and we’d all love to see him here throughout that contract. No comment: The headteacher at the bitten boy's school, Golftyn Primary, declined to speak about the incident . ‘He’s a fantastic player, top scorer and everything we’d want in a striker, so there’s no change there. This is more about getting him back on the right track.’ Suarez is among six players nominated by his fellow footballers for the PFA Player of the Year award. 'We have to work hard on anger management now. We have trained counsellors in this field and we will be offering their services to Liverpool and the player to try to improve matters' PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor . Last night, Nicola Cooper, headteacher at the bitten boy’s school, Golftyn Primary, declined to speak about the incident. No one was available to comment at Flintshire County Council. Professional Footballers’ Association chief executive Gordon Taylor said Suarez would be offered anger management counselling. He said: ‘There is no doubting his football ability, that’s why it is so disappointing and embarrassing when he lets himself down. ‘We have to work hard on anger management now. We have trained counsellors in this field and we will be offering their services to Liverpool and the player to try to improve matters.’","Boy of 11 was suspended for biting another child at North Wales school .

"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 07:33 EST, 7 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:56 EST, 7 February 2013 . Facebook is developing a new smartphone app to track the location of users in an effort to target them with localised adverts, according to reports. The app will help users to find friends who are nearby, alert them when it detects one in close proximity even when the app is not open on the handset, it is claimed. It will be just one of a whole suite of mobile apps Facebook is building up to help it profit from the increasing proportion of its users who access the social network on the go. But privacy campaigners warned it was another example of 'profit trumping privacy' and called the function 'intrusive'. The loading screen of the Facebook mobile app: The social network is developing a new smartphone app to track the location of users in an effort to target them with localised adverts . European regulators have already warned Facebook over the way it handles users' personal data, forcing the company to turn off its facial recognition feature for European users. The new app would help Facebook target advertising to users based on their location and their daily habits, helping corporate clients to reach the audiences they feel are most likely to want their products. Plans for the app were leaked to Bloomberg by two people 'with knowledge of the matter', the financial news service said. Development of Facebook's location software is being led by Peter Deng, a product director who joined the company from Google in 2007, one source said. Mobile first: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week told investors that the company would focus on generating revenue from mobile apps . The team also includes engineers from Glancee, a location-tracking company Facebook bought out last May, and Gowalla, a location-based social network snapped up in December 2011, Bloomberg reported. Facebook's privacy policies already warn users that the social network may use location data to 'tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in.' Mr Zuckerberg last week boasted that the company had redirected itself to focus on becoming a truly mobile company, in a move that he feels is paying off since their mobile ad revenue is growing. ‘2012 was a big year for us,’ the 28-year-old social media entrepreneur said in a conference call following the release of the Q4 earnings report a day earlier. Facebook's biggest challenge - and its greatest opportunity - lies in mobile devices which is an area that the company did not pay much attention to until just last year. Most Facebook users access it using a mobile phone or tablet computer, yet the nine-year-old company only started showing mobile ads about nine months ago. The company said it generated 23 per cent, or $306million, of advertising revenue from mobile, marking an increase from 14 per cent in the third quarter. 'When we get your GPS location, we put it together with other location information we have about you (like your current city),' says the social network's data use policy. 'But we only keep it until it is no longer useful to provide you services, like keeping your last GPS coordinates to send you relevant notifications.' Matrix: Facebook's privacy policies already warn users that the social network may use location data to 'tell you and your friends about people or events nearby, or offer deals to you that you might be interested in' Consumer efforts to protect personal data and remain 'invisible' online is leading to a 'data blackhole' that could adversely impact digital advertisers, according to a new report. The move to seek 'new tools that allow them to remain ‘invisible’ — untraceable and impossible to target by data means' will impact advertisers who rely on that information to target their audiences, technology research firm Ovum said yesterday. Surveying consumers in 11 countries around the world, the research firm said 68 per cent of respondents said they would select a 'do not track' feature if this was easily available. Mark Little, a principal analyst at Ovum, said Internet users were increasingly getting more access to new tools to 'monitor, control and secure their personal data as never before'. The recent scandal involving privacy breaches by mobile messaging service WhatsApp and lingering concerns over data use policies on Facebook and Google are prompting Internet users to be more guarded, Ovum added. The new tracking device-style application has already raised concerns among privacy campaigners. Nick Pickles, director of privacy . campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: 'Data about where you are at any . one time is hugely sensitive and should only ever be shared when users . are fully aware of how the data will be used and remain in full control . of who can see it. 'Yet again it seems the case that the . demands of advertisers trump consumer’s right to privacy, and Facebook . needs to be very careful with these plans otherwise users will rightly . be up in arms again. 'The reality is that smart phones are . capable of tracking our movements in real time, however consumers are . largely kept in the dark about who can access the data and how it is . used. 'This has to change and the law needs . strengthening to protect consumers from overly intrusive attempts to . monitor our behaviour.' There is already a range of other apps which constantly track user locations to help them find friends or places of interest. However, privacy concerns and the heavy toll they place on smartphones' battery life mean that they have failed to gain wide audiences.","App intended to alert users when Facebook 'friends' are nearby .

Dental nurse Ravinder Kaur, 34, is facing charges relating to accusations that she poisoned two . colleagues with mercury while working at a dental practice in . Bedfordshire . A dental nurse took revenge on her boss by  poisoning her coffee with the mercury used in fillings, a court was told. Ravinder Kaur, 34, was in danger of being dismissed from her job after a string of formal warnings about her behaviour when she allegedly poured a capsule of mercury amalgam into a cup of coffee and served it to her boss Laura Knowles in March last year. Just three days earlier she had been given a final warning for her ‘generally poor performance’ at work after she left a patient in the dental chair while she went out to have her lunch. Samantha Cohen, prosecuting, told the jury that the attack had been one of ‘spite and revenge’ after Kaur felt she was given the ‘cold shoulder’ at work. Blackfriars Crown Court heard yesterday that prior to the incident Mrs Knowles, who was the practice manager at Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, had been off work for two days following the death of her father. On March 16 last year she had arrived at work and was talking to the receptionist when Kaur, known as Ravi, entered and offered to make her a cup of coffee. Mrs Knowles, 36, told the court that when she was given the drink she tasted a strange texture and believed that it had been spat into. She went to the staff room to pour the rest of the drink down the sink, and as she did so discovered a metallic sludge at the bottom of the mug and a silver powdery residue. Mrs Knowles, who has worked in dentistry for 20 years, said she ‘immediately’ recognised it as mercury. ‘Mercury moves very differently to other liquids,’ she said. She was taken to hospital where she suffered nausea and severe stomach cramps, which she  likened to ‘early labour pains’. X-rays of her stomach showed ‘speckles of metal’ in her lower intestine consistent with having consumed mercury. Mrs Knowles told the court that at the dental practice, part of the Shefford Health Centre, the mercury used for fillings is stored in capsules which also contain a metal alloy of tin, silver and copper. More than half of the amalgam filling is made up of mercury, with the other metals forming a durable combination to lock it in. Kaur was hired as an assistant dental nurse in November 2011, and had been given training in the safe handling and storage of mercury. She was, the court heard, well aware of the deadly effects of mercury. The defence claims that Miss Kaur is the victim of a set-up by her colleagues, having recently made a complaint against one of the other dentists to the Care Quality Commission. Confronted by her boss and owner of the practice, Dr Shams Moopen, on the evening of the incident Kaur claimed she ‘was not capable’ of spiking the drink ‘on purpose’. Stomach pains: Laura Knowles told the court that when she was given the drink she tasted a strange texture and believed that it had been spat into . She said she put the instant coffee along with sugar and milk substitute Coffee-mate into a mug and left to prepare for the day’s appointments while the kettle boiled, only returning to add the water and deliver it to Mrs Knowles. Prosecutor Mrs Cohen added that although initially the two women had a good working relationship, this soured over time. She said: ‘To begin with she [Mrs Knowles] believed Miss Kaur was meticulous and professional but later she formed the view that she was inflexible and not regarded as a team player.’ In January 2012 Kaur was given a verbal warning over her behaviour and a month later, three days before the poisoning, she was given a second written warning after she left a patient in the dental chair when she went out to have her lunch break. The court also heard that another dentist at the practice, Dr Shah, had requested that Kaur assist someone else as he found her ‘difficult to work with’. Kaur previously appeared at Luton Crown Court where she denied administering a poisonous or noxious substance with intent to cause harm. The trial continues. Patients in Britain have about eight million mercury fillings a year. Alternatives such as white fillings or glass resin composites cost more and are said not to be as strong. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Ravinder Kaur, 34, accused of lacing drink in act of 'spite and revenge'

Hugo the bulldog eats, sleeps and plays with little white lion Igor and white Bengal tiger, Ice, who he has adopted as pups of his own. The two-year-old bulldog even disciplines the lion and the tiger when their play fights get out of hand. The three animals live together with former vet assistant, 26-year-old Or Lazmi, who is hand rearing the cubs. Scroll down for video . Bulldog Hugo is dragged by white lion cub Igor which he raised as one of his own pups in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . Or Lazmi is the owner of English bulldog Hugo who raised white tiger cub Ice and white lion cub Igor in Port Elizabeth, South Africa . Miss Lazmi, 26, said: ‘When Ice . first got here she was about the size of a sausage so she didn't play . with Hugo because he was too rough. ‘When . she was about five or six weeks old she was able to hold her ground and . we started to let them interact on a regular basis and they have been . good friends ever since. ‘Igor . is a bit of an odd baby and mostly does his own thing but they also . play together. Hugo will stalk him and then jump on him.’ 26-year-old Or Lazmi, has hand reared several litters of lion cubs like Igor as well as baby tigers . The young cubs stay at Seaview Predator Park during the day and live with Miss Lazmi and her dog Hugo in the evenings . The young cubs spend their days at . Seaview Predator Park in Port Elizabeth, SA, before returning to the . nearby house in the evenings. The . bizarre relationship between father-figure Hugo and his adopted . children has grown overtime thanks to regular family outings to go . walking and swimming. Sometimes Igor will drag Hugo by his lead - but like the any good father makes sure to assert his authority. ‘At this point Hugo can still bully them around,’ said Miss Lazmi, a former vet assistant from Israel. ‘But . in about a month's time they will definitely be bigger than him - so we . will have to see how much of a bully they turn out to be.’ Miss . Lazmi, who moved to Africa to follow her dream of working with . wildlife, has previously hand-reared eight tiger cubs and several . litters of lion cubs. The cubs are bottle fed three times a day and eat ribs now but when they grow up they will eat horse legs . English bulldog Hugo has taken on a fatherly role with white lion Igor Ice the tiger and disciplines them at times . The cubs' owner Or Lazmi said if the pups start to see Hugo as prey they will have to be kept apart from him . The cubs have been home-reared to help them safely interact with park vets when they are older and bigger. Igor and Ice weigh two-and-a-half stone now but Igor will eventually tip the scales at 28-stone and Ice at almost 40-stone.

'Caused unprecedented harm': Jake Birchall walked free from court today after his part in the cyber attacks dubbed Operation Payback . A man who hacked into PayPal and other major websites causing multi-million pound losses, has walked free from court today. Jake Birchall was just 16-years-old when he was part of a computer gang called . Anonymous that launched a series of devastating cyber attacks dubbed . Operation Payback that ‘caused  unprecedented harm’ to Visa, MasterCard . and the online payment firm PayPal. Birchall, who used the nickname FenniC, ran computer servers for the gang for three months while attacks took place in 2010. They ran a sophisticated and orchestrated campaign of online attacks that paralysed computer systems. The . gang brought down PayPal for ten days causing losses totalling £3.5 . million by flooding the website with messages and requests.

Last . month fellow hackers Christopher Weatherhead, 22, and Ashley Rhodes, 28, . who used the online names ‘Nerdo’ and ‘NikonElite’ were jailed for . their part in the attacks. Judge Testar said of Birchall today: . ‘Young as he was and with the disadvantages in life that he has and had . he did actually play an important role. ‘He did play a prominent and . important part in this and I think he’s got to learn to get out of bed . in the morning and go and do unpaid work. ‘Many . would say that because you played a prominent role in this conspiracy . which caused damage, nobody really knows quite how much damage it . caused, and which potentially could have caused a lot more damage you . ought to be serving a custodial sentence and a substantial one at that.

Avoided jail: Co-defendant Peter Gibson, 24, of Hartlepool, Durham, was deemed to have played a lesser role in the conspiracy, which he also admitted, and given a six-month suspended sentence . Jailed: 'Hactivist' Ashley Rhodes (pictured on his wedding day to wife Shirley) was nicknamed 'NikonElite' ‘But . I have to sentence you on the basis that you were under 18 when . convicted and therefore I’ve to sentence you as a young person.’ In . jailing Weatherhead and Rhodes, Judge Testar said: ‘It is intolerable . that when an individual or group disagrees with some particular entity’s . activity they should be free to curtail that activity by way of attacks . such as those that occurred in this case.’ Anonymous . originally targeted music industry bodies in retaliation for their . anti-piracy stance, but evolved after the backlash against the leak of . classified data by Julian Assange’s WikiLeaks.

Birchall all pleaded guilty to the offence.Birchall was said to enjoy a ‘high level of control’ over attacks and operated two servers used by the hackers. He boasted he was the ‘second most anon’ after Weatherhead. When . police went to arrest him he posted on an internet chat room used by . Anonymous: ‘F***, the cops. I’m shutting everything down.’ Gibson, a University of York graduate, was described as a ‘technical specialist’. Mr . Smith said: ‘[He was] involved in the running of servers, it was his . understanding and expertise which assisted in maintaining servers from . which attacks could be launched.’ He . said it was Gibson who suggested the attack on Lily Allen but had . second thoughts when he had ‘concerns about attacking artists’. Rhodes was heard to have had a ‘hands on’ approach in attacks and was regularly caught chatting online about targets. Star: At one point Gibson suggested the website of singer Lily Allen, now known by her married name Lily Cooper, as a possible target to Rhodes, who agreed with the idea. But the attack never went ahead . The . court heard Rhodes even used his work computer to launch attacks and . was involved in ‘doxing,’ a form of online research or spying to gather . information on possible targets.

'It's been hard for me to manage my weight since I retired,' she admitted. 'As an athlete I was used to eating big portions and my body craved sugary stuff like chocolate all the time because of all the calories I had burnt off.' No desire to be skinny: Rebecca Adlington said she's happy to have developed hips and boobs since she's stopped swimming professionally . But the 24-year-old said she has no intention of going on a strict diet to keep the weight off and still wants to be able to indulge her sweet tooth occasionally. 'I don't want to starving or be hungry all the time, . that's not what life is about,' she said. 'I have no desire to be a size zero. I want to be healthy in the right way and keep a balance.' To keep this balance of a healthy weight, Rebecca said she has been cutting down on her portion sizes and taken up Quorn's 'make one change challenge' - swapping one of her meat dishes a week to one using the low fat meat substitute. No dieting: The Olympian said she would rather eat healthily and exercise than starve herself to stay in shape . She also continues to exercise regularly, going to the gym, for the odd run or cycle, and of course, swimming recreationally, when she can.

'All women can feel insecure so it's about finding what makes you feel confident,' she said. For her, this means continuing to wear a costume instead of a bikini because 'I don't like having my belly on show', eating well and exercising regularly. She said: 'I love to exercise and I hate feeling bloated. I always feel better when I'm eating right . and doing exercise.'

Backlash: David Cameron has been criticised by aid charities for his decision to divert millions of pounds towards military operations . Aid money should be spent on ‘schools, not soldiers’, charities said last night – as David Cameron faced a backlash over moves to divert hundreds of millions of pounds to the Armed Forces. Charities reacted with alarm after the Prime Minister revealed he wants to use part of the vast aid budget to help pay for military peacekeeping operations. But former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth hailed a ‘welcome first step’ and said security was an ‘essential precursor to the provision of aid’. The move will help protect the Armed Forces from further spending cuts and also help the Department for International Development (DfId) spend a 30 per cent budget increase due in April. Mr Cameron’s plan was warmly welcomed by Tory MPs who have raised increasing concern about the policy of cutting back defence spending while pouring billions more into foreign aid. But aid charities warned diverting money was potentially a major backward step. Oxfam’s head of policy, Max Lawson, said the aid budget should be spent on ‘hospitals and not helicopter gunships’. He went on: ‘The millions of people up and down the country who support the fantastic stance the Government is taking, protecting the aid budget when every other G8 nation is not doing that – they expect this to be spent on schools and not soldiers. ‘So we cannot see any penny diverted into the military.’ However Sir Gerald Howarth said: . ‘Britain’s armed forces contribute enormously to the provision of . security and capacity building, which are essential precursors to the . provision of aid and it is entirely appropriate to make those changes. ‘I have not come across a single . Conservative who is in favour of increasing aid at a time when we are . cutting the Armed Forces so this is a very welcome first step.’ Spending: The Prime Minister revealed yesterday how he wants to use part of the aid budget to offset cuts to the defence budget . Clash: The head of policy at Oxfam Max Lawson, left, criticised David Cameron's plan but the move was welcomed by former defence minister Gerald Howarth, right . And Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army officer, said security and overseas aid were ‘inextricably linked’. Downing Street insisted the switch would not affect Mr Cameron’s controversial target of spending 0.7 per cent of Britain’s total income on aid. Money will be spent on peacekeeping and conflict prevention work rather than weapons, so should still count towards the target. The new approach means aid cash could be used to pay for troop training in Mali, demobilisation in Afghanistan and providing assistance to rebel fighters in Syria. Much of the money could be channelled through the ‘conflict pool’ - a joint initiative between DfId, the MoD and the Foreign Office. Overall aid spending will rise in April as the percentage of Britain’s income spent on foreign aid rises from 0.56 per cent to hit the 0.7 target. Meeting the target will require an increase from £8.65billion to £11.3billion in the coming year – a rise of more than 30 per cent.","Money should be spent on 'schools not soldiers' says head of Oxfam .

She explains that they empty the chamber pots in the gutter on the street in the early morning, then rinse them down with water. Chamber pots did take some getting used to though, Ryan admits. 'Let's just say it was summer when we moved in,' he recalls. 'We . don't have or ideologically support air conditioning, so nights could . get a little rough, especially when you don't know what to expect when . you lift the lid...

The first gay couple granted a civil union in Colorado said their vows before hundreds of people early this morning at a downtown Denver municipal building where couples and members of the public gathered. The new law legalizing civil unions took effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, and both Denver and Boulder began issuing licenses immediately. Fran and Anna Simon were the first to receive a civil union certificate. Wearing the white wedding dresses they wore at their commitment ceremony seven years ago and joined by their five-year-old son Jeremy, Fran and Anna received their license from a clerk at 12:02 a.m., following an expectant countdown to midnight led by other couples. Scroll down for video . You may kiss the bride: Fran (right) and Anna Simon kiss while holding their civil union license in Denver, Colorado, alongside their son Jeremy . Family celebration: As Colorado joined eight states that recognize civil unions or domestic partnerships in lieu of gay marriage, and Fran (right) and Anna Simon were first in line to celebrate alongside their son . Minutes later they were joined in a ceremony officiated by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock. 'Our commitment doesn't change, but we will have a burden lifted off our shoulders,' Anna Simon said. 'Loving and committed couples need legal protections.' Colorado's civil unions law allows unmarried couples, both gay and heterosexual, the ability to form civil unions and get rights similar to those of married couples. They include transferring property, making medical decisions, adopting children and qualifying for health insurance and survivor benefits. The statewide advocacy group One Colorado hosted the festivities, and the Denver clerk's office remained open until 3 a.m. to issue civil union licenses to couples eager to take advantage of their rights under the new law. Couples were ushered into the clerk's office in small groups. They filled out paperwork and received their certificate, a moment that for many came with a quick kiss, a squeeze of hands or a few tears.

Media frenzy: Anna (left) and Fran Simon both wore white bridal gowns at Denver Office of the Clerk and Recorder, at the Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building . Signed certificates in hand, couples were then joined in official ceremonies performed before supporters and other couples in the atrium of the Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building. U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette joined Hancock and local judges and magistrates in officiating civil union ceremonies. DeGette, a long-time supporter of gay rights, said she earned her clergy status online specifically to participate in Wednesday morning's festivities. 'Members of the GLBT community are the same as everyone else — they want loving, permanent relationships,' she said. Hancock said he was honored to be part of the landmark event. 'I've been a part of the effort to legalize civil unions in Colorado now for several years. I feel a tremendous amount of pride for the people of Denver to work with their legislators to finally pass this piece of legislation to allow people to love and live as they so choose,' he said. The Denver Clerk and Recorder's Office said 130 couples checked in before Wednesday morning's 3 a.m. deadline. The office planned to resume issuing civil union licenses at 8 a.m. Midnight ceremony: The couple gripped each others' hands and emotionally embraced as their civil union ceremony took place in Denver .

Elsewhere in Colorado, the Boulder County Clerk and Recorder remained open until 2 a.m. to offer licenses, though no figures were available from that county. Other counties waited until after daybreak to start issuing civil union licenses. El Paso County will begin issuing them at 8 a.m. without any fanfare, while some Pueblo County officials and advocates plan an 11 a.m. rally on the steps of the county courthouse followed by a mass civil union ceremony. Colorado is the eighth state to have civil unions or similar laws. Nine states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriage. Something old: The couple wore the white wedding dresses they wore at their commitment ceremony seven years ago . Doting couple: Fran (right) has her lipstick fixed by partner Anna Simon just after midnight after being the first to get a civil union in Denver . Gov. John Hickenlooper signed the bill in March, marking the culmination of a dramatic shift in Colorado, where in 1992 voters approved a ban on discrimination protection for gays and in 2006 made gay marriage illegal under the state constitution. But for many gay couples and gay rights advocates, the fight is not over. Anna and Fran Simon, for example, who testified numerous times in favor of the civil union legislation, said they hope to get the chance to wear their wedding dresses one more time. 'Like most people growing up, you have a dream of falling in love and getting married, not getting a civil union,' Anna Simon said.

Hospitals should be policed by an army of inspectors that include doctors and nurses to prevent major scandals and unnecessary deaths, a landmark report will warn next week. The long-awaited  public inquiry into the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust is expected to recommend more experienced inspectors and an overhaul of the regulatory system. The report will recommend drastic reforms of how hospitals are policed in an attempt to stop a repeat of events at Stafford hospital where up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four-year period,  reports The Guardian. Up to 1,200 patients may have died needlessly over a four-year period at Stafford Hospital, where patients were found to have been treated 'appallingly' The £11million inquiry, led by Robert Francis QC, is examining . what went wrong at the trust between January 2005 and March 2009. Between . 400 and 1,200 more people died than would have been expected over that period, the Commission said. Mr Francis' first report in 2010 found there was often 'shocking' care at Stafford hospital. Many patients were 'neglected', with . calls for help to use the bathroom ignored, food and drink left out of . patients' reach, pain relief administered late or not at all, 'awful' hygiene, and much more. Some staff showed 'a disturbing lack of compassion', while 'fear and bullying' dissuaded others from flagging up their concerns. The long-awaited inquiry by Robert Francis QC (pictured) is expected to recommend a new army of hospital inspectors . Doctors were diverted from critically . ill patients to deal with less serious cases that were at risk of . breaching a central target to discharge all patients from Accident & . Emergency units within four hours. Vulnerable patients were left so thirsty that they were forced to drink water out of flower vases; others were left starving and . in soiled bedsheets. Last month, the scandal-hit hospital . paid out more than £1million in . compensation for 'inhumane and degrading' treatment. The new army of inspectors is thought to be in response to the fact that such serious failings occurred despite there being various regulatory bodies in place. Huge questions remain over how such appalling standards of care continued for so long and why the relevant authorities did not intervene. Francis is expected to call for hospitals to undergo more regular and thorough inspections. A key move will be to get more experts with clinical experience, such as doctors and nurses, to join the . 955 inspectors currently used by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in NHS . hospital visits. Many of the current inspectors are thought to have a background in care homes and social work rather than the NHS. In future, Monitor, which regulates NHS trusts, will be expected to share concerns about financial problems so the CQC can check if patient care is being affected. And to tackle problems earlier, a recommendation will be made that the CQC's use of intelligence about hospital care is bolstered, using information from patient complaints, media reports and the results of clinical audits.","Long-awaited public inquiry into the scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust to be published next week .
