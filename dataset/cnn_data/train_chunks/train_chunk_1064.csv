"Ex-Rose Tattoo drummer Paul DeMarco's estranged wife knew his battle with depression had become desperate. But she's testified she had no idea the ageing rocker had developed a crippling ice habit until police swooped on their northwest Sydney home. DeMarco, who is accused of running guns alongside former bikie boss Sam Ibrahim and his younger sister Jazz Dior, launched a bid for freedom on Thursday in the NSW Supreme Court so he can check himself into a year-long drug rehabilitation program. Former bandmate-turned-politician Angry Anderson and Paul DeMarco's wife Deirdre, were both at the New South Wales Supreme Court on Thursday in a show of support . But Acting Justice Anthony Blackmore refused the 55-year-old's bail application. 'In the circumstances, his release back into the community would involve very serious dangers,' Justice Blackmore said. Former bandmate-turned-politician Angry Anderson and DeMarco's wife Deirdre were both in court in a show of support. DeMarco's wife spoke of the toll his poor mental health had taken on their relationship. The pair separated briefly after more than 20 years as a couple, she said. DeMacro was arrested in April and charged with supplying, possessing and distributing weapons . She gave evidence that while she had taken on three jobs and was working 12 or 14-hour days, DeMarco had been unable to find work and had taken to locking himself away in the double garage, which had been converted into a music studio at their Windsor home. 'I thought his depression was really getting to a point of desperation for me as a partner and for the family,' she said. 'I'd see him maybe during the morning for a cup of coffee or something like that.' She had no idea DeMarco had been self-medicating with crystal methamphetamine, she said, or that he was suspected of gun supply offences, until police raided their property in April. The former Rose Tatoo drummer requested bail on Thursday so he could attend a year-long drug rehabilitation program for his addiction to crystal methamphetamine . She said she was at work when she got the news officers were at their home, and immediately feared DeMarco had taken his own life. 'I was teaching yoga when it had all gone down,' she said. 'I thought the depression had got him, and that was it.' She said DeMarco's enforced detox during five months behind bars had brought him back from the brink. Some of the guns seized by NSW Police: DeMacro was denied bail . 'He's looking very well, his mind's really clear, which is amazing,' she said. 'It's just sad that it's taken this to bring him back towards his usual self.' Despite suggestions from DeMarco's lawyer Ibrahim was the real player in the alleged gun racket, Justice Blackmore said the crown case appeared to be strong. 'The evidence is that the firearms, or some of them, were sold to an undercover officer,' he said. Bail was refused.

"Dwyane Wade accepted a one-on-one challenge from a lovable opponent. Illuminada Magtoto was turning 90 this year and she had one birthday wish. The nonagenarian was a big fan of Wade and the Miami Heat fan and she recorded a video for YouTube challenging Wade to a little head-to-head basketball. Throwdown: Grandma Nelly got her wish for a head-to-head challenge against Dwyane Wade, before the two played a few friendly minutes of ball . 'Dwyane Wade, on my 90th birthday, I want to play one-on-one with you,' she challenged the Heat guard with a matriarchal wag of her finger. She sealed the deal with a sneak preview of her skills, sinking a basket on her backyard court. Wade took up the challenge on his own turf, and in spite being starstruck, Grandma Nelly drew some praise from Wade. 'You throw better lobs that Mario Chalmers,' point guard for the Heat, Wade said after Magtoto sets him up for an alley-oop. Though it's not clear who won the game, the two finished it with a hug. Swagger: Grandma Nelly, for her 90th birthday, called out Dwyane Wade for a one-on-one competition to test out his skills . Court: The 90-year-old had no problem taking it to the hole and showed Wade what he'd be up against on her backyard court . Bucket: Wade gave his competition a leg up, taking her alley-oop and knocking in the basket in a competition that ended with a hug . Afterwards, Grandma Nelly and her family were treated to a Heat game against the Houston Rockets and palled around with Wade Sr. Grandma Nelly had no bitter feelings about her rivalry with Wade after the contest. 'I always pray for you,' she told Wade. 'Now, I feel like I'm very, very happy.'","Illuminada Magtoto, who goes by Grandma Nelly, challenged Wade for her 90th birthday over YouTube .

"A new line of men's underwear promises to block radiation waves from cellphones with a layer of silver shielding. Belly Armor, which has for years manufactured clothing to protect pregnant mothers' bellies from non-ionizing radiation from mobile devices, will release their men's boxers Thursday. The RadiaShield boxer briefs use silver threading in the crotch, which the company says will help 'protect men’s reproductive organs and maintain fertility health.' Protection: Belly Armor's boxers, with a shielded crotch, are said to protect a man's fertility from the non-ionizing radiofrequency . The New York Post reports that the sophisticated drawers were developed to address concerns raised in an American Society of Reproductive Medicine study suggesting a correlation between active cellphone use and decreased sperm count. Spokesperson Katherine Niefeld said that men weren't demanding protection from their phones because they didn't know they needed it. The study used by Belly Armor is based on talk time, not on men carrying cellphones in their pockets, so it may be the bigger danger is posed to the noggin and not the nuggets. Researchers are less certain about the dangers that radiofrequency waves post to fertility and body tissue. While the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health declares that ionizing radiation from X-rays and radiation therapy pose a cancer risk, no connections to health risks have been found for non-ionizing waves. Dr Laura Riley, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital, told Time that products like those sold through Belly Armor are exploiting unproven health scares to sell clothing. Discreet: The shorts use silver threading in the pouch to protect a man's family jewels from cellphone waves, though no connection to health risks have been found . 'There are no conclusive studies that have shown that low radiation from everyday devices is harmful to anyone, much less to a pregnant woman,' Riley said regarding the company's maternity line back in 2010. There are even skeptical sperm scientists, such as Dr Allan Pacey, from Sheffield University, who isn't changing his cellphone habits any time soon. Reacting to an Exeter University metastudy of 10 research trials looking at cellphone use and infertility, he called for 'properly designed' before conclusions could be drawn. Speaking to the BBC, he says 'Until that time, I will be continuing to keep my iPhone in my right-hand trouser pocket!'","RadiaShield boxers use silver threading to reduce radiation waves from cellphones .
Non-ionizing waves, such as those of cellphones and mobile devices, are not proven to have adverse health effects, according to the National Institutes of Health .

"Falklands veterans who arrived  to 'clean up' after the war ended have finally been given their campaign medals after 32 years. David Cameron handed the servicemen the South Atlantic Medal in Downing Street today after a long-awaited review  found they should have been recognised for their service in 1982. The men all arrived on the islands more than a month after Argentine forces surrendered Port Stanley on June 14, 1982. Long-awaited:  Falklands veterans who arrived to 'clean up' after the war were finally given campaign medals . Lining up: The Prime Minister made the presentations in 10 Downing Street, including to Nigel Morris (right) Long gap: Warrant Officer Sean Clench is presented with his South Atlantic Medal today by the Prime Minister . Although the war was over, their work was not without its dangers. They had to deal with landmines and the graves of the war dead, and one  soldier, Gurkha Lance-Corporal Budhaparsad Limbu, died when his spade hit a grenade two weeks after the surrender. For decades the only veterans who could claim the South Atlantic Medal were those who had been on the islands up to July 12, 1982. But this year a long-awaited independent review ruled that time should be extended by three months to October 21, 1982. It now covers veterans who served up to when an airfield at what is now RAF Mount Pleasant, opened in 1985, was completed as part of Britain's efforts to strengthen the islands against future attacks. Service: Ian McVitie receives his medal. A long-awaited independent review made the change earlier this year . The controversial review was by  former British Ambassador to France  John Holmes. Pictured: Tony Anderson . Add to the collection: Many other veterans, such as Greame Fordham (pictured), have other campaign medals . One veterans' co-ordinator said the ceremony was 'a long time coming'. Pictured: Mark Morris meets the PM . Gap: Colleagues of Kevin Browne (pictured) earned their medals when Margaret Thatcher was in Number 10 . The review by the former British Ambassador to France, Sir John Holmes, was controversial with many other servicemen - because it left out veterans of conflicts including Aden, Suez and Korea. It declared new medals would be awarded to those who served in Cyprus and the Berlin Airlift - when the Allies flew supplies to people in West Berlin in 1948 and 1949. Other conflicts were not mentioned in the review, whose aim was 'to draw a definitive line under issues which in some cases had been controversial for many years'. Falklands veterans welcomed today's ceremony. Kev Greathurst,  Dorset and Somerset co-ordinator for the South Atlantic Medal Association, told MailOnline: 'It's been a long time coming. Honour: Derek Selwood with his medal. One veteran said: 'The jobs these guys had to do were horrendous' Campaign: Mark Willoughby with the Prime Minister. The veterans were of varying ages and experience . Michael Rawding receiving his campaign medal. Some servicemen missed out on the honour by just a day . Dirty work: Clive Smith (pictured) was one of those who had to clear areas of mines after the surrender . Return: Steven Rue. The review was designed to 'draw a line' under all historic claims on campaign medals . 'There was still danger in the form of minefields which are still there to this day. A Gurkha was killed after the conflict ended doing trench clearance.' The 56-year-old added: 'Some of the jobs those guys had to do afterwards were horrendous. 'They had to clean up the mess left by the invasion. They were digging up and finding the dead. In Stanley, some of the Argentine forces had defecated in drawers and on plates.' Midlands co-ordinator Les Palmer, 61, added: 'Although the conflict had stopped there was still significant danger. A lot of ships still went down. 'My mate was one of those who missed out. He didn't get the medal because he got there one day too late. At the time they certainly felt like they weren't being recognised'. Criteria: The medal is now given to soldiers who served until an airfield at RAF Mount Pleasant (above) was built . Hidden danger: There are still minefields in the islands feared never to have been cleared, veterans said .","Former soldiers had arrived on the islands after the conflict ended .

"Each November, revellers at northern Thailand's Yi Peng festival, launch thousands of lanterns, known as khom loy, lighting up the night sky like a swarm of jellyfish. It's a spectacular sight, but this year, authorities have expressed safety concerns over the lanterns and festival goers have been asked to avoid setting off them off near airports. There is growing worry about what could happen if one of the fiery khom loy lanterns gets sucked into a jet engine. Around 1,400 lanterns landed near Chiang Mai’s airport last year. Thousands of lanterns, powered by oil, rise into the  sky in Chiang Mai province, during the Loy Krathong Festival . And more than 150 flights in and out of Chiang Mai have been cancelled or delayed during the peak of the holiday, from November 5 to November 7, affecting around 20,000 passengers. The air traffic control centre in Chiang Mai province has declared a three-mile zone around the airport where people are advised not to launch lanterns from Wednesday to Friday, when celebrations will take place, said Kiattisak Rienvatana, the centre's director. 'We are asking the people to cooperate because only one lantern can bring down a plane,' he said. Several airlines, including Thai Airways, have adjusted their flight schedules to give way to the lantern floating . Khom loy lanterns are made from a thin fabric stretched over a bamboo or wire frame, to which a candle or fuel cell is attached. When the fuel cell is lit, hot air is trapped inside the lantern and creates enough lift for the lantern to float up into the sky. 'Our officials are also keeping an eye on any lanterns that might be blown into the airport parameters during that period.' Authorities in nearby Chiang Rai province have issued a similar request. Several airlines, including Thai Airways, have adjusted their flight schedules to give way to the lantern floating, which takes place mainly after dark. The festival coincides with Thailand's Loi Krathong festival, during which Thais float small rafts on rivers to ask for forgiveness from the goddess of water. They also believe that launching lanterns will rid them of bad fortune. Revellers have been advised that they may float lanterns near the airport after 9pm, when the air traffic is cleared up.","Each year revellers at  Thailand's Yi Peng festival launch swarms of lanterns .

"A police employee who killed himself was a suspect in the 1984 murder of a 14-year-old girl, it emerged - and he had been interviewed by officers over the crime. Kevin Charles Brown, 62, was a criminalist with the San Diego police department during the time that Claire Hough was found dead on a Californian beach in August, 30 years ago. Investigators at the time could find no leads, but thanks to new DNA techniques, Brown was linked to the girl's brutal death. But as police were preparing to arrest Brown, he was found dead. Suspect suicide: Criminalist Kevin Charles Brown, left, was found dead as police were preparing to arrest him over the murder of 14-year-old Claire Hough in 1984 . Crime scene: Archive footage above shows the beach where Claire Hough was found dead in 1984 . Brown had been interviewed in connection with the crime before his apparent suicide, UT San Diego reported. Claire was found strangled in late August 1984, and was found dead under a bridge at Torrey Pines State Beach which crossed the sands. Her left breast had been cut away and her body was covered in marks from fingernails. Reports from the time suggest that Claire had slipped out of her grandparents' house nearby so she could smoke and listen to music cassettes. New evidence: Modern investigative techniques have linked Brown's DNA to the murder. Pictured above are police investigating in 1984 . Crime scene investigator: Brown was a criminalist with San Diego police for 20 years. He is pictured here at a crime scene in 1991. He retired in 2002 . Her body was discovered by a walker at 5am. Claire's grandparents raised the alarm when she had not returned by morning, and the body was identified as hers. San Diego police, which employed Brown between 1982 and 2002, has said he never had anything to do with investigating Claire's case. Other suspect: Ronald Tatro was also linked to the murder. He died in 2011 . A second suspect who was identified is also dead, leaving the case with no leads. Ronald Tatro died in Tennesse in a boating accident three years ago. However, Brown's widow denied that he was anything to do with the murder, and suggested that his DNA could have become mixed with the evidence sampled because he worked in the same lab. He had been questioned several times over the death, Channel 10 News reported, and preparations were being made to arrest him. Rebecca Brown said: 'The police have hounded my husband all year, and he ended up having a nervous breakdown and killed himself. 'They kept hounding him on something he didn’t do. He’s a good, kind, sweet, gentle man.' The police department has dismissed the notion that accidental contamination could be the reason for Brown's DNA being present.","Kevin Charles Brown, 62, found dead as police 'prepared to arrest him'

"A Connecticut homeowner was shocked to discover a naked neighbor performing sexual acts on her 'aggressive' female pit bull in her backyard while raving about ISIS and Ebola. The disturbing incident took place last Thursday at the Waterbury home of Alice Woodruff, who came to her dog's defense by grabbing her gun and pointing it at the 22-year-old intruder. But the man, who is believed to be mentally ill, was not impressed by Woodruff's show of force. Scroll down for video . Four-legged victim: Layla, a 12-year-old rescue pit bull, has been sexually assaulted in the yard outside her owner's home by a mentally disturbed, naked man . Harrowing ordeal: Dog owner Alice Woodruff (left and right) tried to scare off the intruder with a gun, but he continued prancing around and screaming that he was a member of ISIS and the anti-Christ . Instead of beating a quick retreat, the suspect allegedly started prancing around while screaming that he was a member of the Islamist terror group ISIS and that he had Ebola. At one point, Woodruff told the station WTNH the naked intruder declared himself to be the anti-Christ, spread out his arms and started coming at her. A police officer eventually responded to the scene and chased off the suspect. He was later captured and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation. Speaking to the station, the shaken mother of two said when she first spotted a stranger lying prostrate under her 12-year-old pit bull, her initial thought was that the aggressive rescue dog had killed someone who had wandered into the yard. But when she came closer to the animal, who is kept tethered to the porch by an 800-pound tow chain, she discovered that a naked man was raping the pooch inside a circle of his discarded clothing. ‘I had a citronella candle and I threw it at him, screaming, ‘Get off my dog, you have to get out of here.’ He said, ‘no! Today is the day we are going to spend the rest of our lives together,”’ Ms Woodruff recalled. Disturbing: The 22-year-old suspect claimed he had infected Layla with Ebola . Inapproachable: Woodruff marveled at how the neighbor was able to come near the pit bull, whom she described as very aggressive . The 22-year-old suspect was described as prancing around the yard in the buff and making incoherent statements. ‘”Today is the day!” and “I am the anti-Christ and you’re going to die with me,”’ Woodruff told the Waterbury Republican American. ‘He kept saying he was with ISIS and he had Ebola, that he gave the dog Ebola.’ Ms Woodruff ran inside the house to grab her gun, which she leveled at the intruder in a bid to scare him off. ‘He kept saying this is the plan, that we were going to die today in a massacre. He didn’t seem to care that I had the gun, and I kept it down,’ she said. ‘Then I gave him a warning and shot the gun to the right into the dirt.’ On the road to recovery: The pet has been giving antibiotics and is said to be doing fine. But the gunfire did nothing to deter the crazed neighbor, who proceeded to advance on Woodruff with his arms outstretched, urging her to kill him but warning her that as soon as he was dead, everyone else would follow. ‘Honestly, the whole time I thought there was a bomb or gun and he was going to take it out and do a massacre,’ Woodruff said. As someone who has worked in the mental health field for many years, Woodruff said she was scared for her life but also filled with compassion for the intruder who clearly needed help. All the while, an emotional Alice Woodruff said she had one thought running through her mind: 'Lord, don't let me shoot him… Don't let me take somebody's life.' When a police officer arrived on the scene, he spotted the 22-year-old suspect lurking in the bushes and ordered him to come forward, but the man bolted 'like a gazelle' and took off running barefoot. He was apprehended after a two-hour search and taken to a hospital. The man now faces charges of animal cruelty, sexual assault and breach of peace. When police searched the man's discarded belongings, they found bizarre notes that read, 'now, now, now,' police ‘ external’ and ‘internal.’ Alice Woodruff said she had never met the man in person until last Thursday, but she knew his family and even cared for one of his relatives at one time. As far Layla, the plump 12-year-old canine has been given antibiotics as a precaution and is said to be doing fine.","Connecticut homeowner Alice Woodruff  found her neighbor in her yard performing sex acts on 12-year-old rescue pit bull named Layla .

"New Yorkers are not particularly known for their hospitality, but Mayor Bill De Blasio thinks some have crossed a line in their treatment of the brave Bellevue Hospital staffers who have been caring for the city's first Ebola patient. The mayor held an afternoon press conference on Sunday to discuss the mistreatment of Bellevue health care workers who he says have been denied service at restaurants, and had their children treated differently, just because they work at the same hospital where Dr Craig Spencer is currently being treated for the deadly disease in an isolation ward. Dr Spencer, 33, was admitted to the hospital on Thursday - just six days after returning from Guinea where he was working with Doctors without Borders to aid in the largest outbreak of the virus in history. Scroll down for video . 'Unacceptable': New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio held a press conference on Sunday to address reports that Bellevue health care workers were being mistreated for working at the hospital where the city's first Ebola patient is being cared for . Now in New York: Bellevue Hospital received its first Ebola patient on Thursday, after Dr Craig Spencer reported to the health care center just six days after returning from Ebola-stricken Guinea. Brave volunteer: Dr Spencer returned to New York from Guinea on October 17, and admitted himself to the hospital six days later after noticing symptoms of the deadly virus . Mayor De Blasio and his wife Chiraline McCray visited the isolation ward at Bellevue where Dr Spencer is being treated and said the volunteering health care workers they encountered there were 'calm, cool, collected and purposeful'. However, he was shocked to hear reports about how some of these doctors and nurses were being denied food and treated differently when strangers learned they worked at the hospital. Mayor De Blasio called these instances 'absolutely unacceptable', adding that 'there will be consequences for those individuals' found disrespecting nurses or other medical personnel. He did not specify what kind of punishment could be handed out. Mr De Blasio went on to describe the Bellevue workers treating Dr Craig Spencer as the 'the first responders in this crisis' and like 'the Marines of our health care system'. The mayor also addressed a nurse who was being monitored this weekend in New Jersey, under new rules in both New Jersey and New York requiring health care workers returning from West Africa to submit to a 21-day quarantine. Nurse Kaci Hickox talked to CNN about her 'inhumane' containment at the airport, saying she is confined in a tent with limited contact to the outside world, no flushable toilet, TV or reading material. Mayor de Blasio appeared to hit out at New Jersey officials, by calling the conditions of Ms Hickox's quarantine 'inappropriate'. 'The problem here is that this hero coming back from the front, having done the right thing, was treated with disrespect and was treated as if she had done something wrong when she hadn't,' Mayor de Blasio said. 'We owe her better than that.' However, the mayor added that he respects the right of other governments to make their own decisions in how to handle this outbreak. 'Inhumane': Mayor De Blasio also spoke about Nurse Kaci Hickox, who is currently under quarantine in New Jersey. The nurse spoke to CNN, calling her quarantine 'inhumane' for having no access to a flushable toilet, TV or reading material.

"Hunters in Eurasia developed an innovative way of crafting stone tools 325,000 years ago – at the same time as it was being developed in Africa. The find suggests Eurasians were more innovative than previously thought and contradicts the widely-held belief that innovation spread as a result of humanity's migration out of Africa. The discovery centres on a stone tool production method known as Levallois technology, which involves breaking different sizes of flakes off a larger lump of stone. Pictured are tone tools found at the site of Nor Geghi, Armenia. The top stones were created using biface technology, which is more primitive than Levallois technology (bottom). The find suggests ancient Eurasians were more innovative than previously thought . The resulting flakes were then used as knives or other tools, which would have been relatively easy to carry by the fast-moving hunter-gatherers of the time. Stone tools using this method were found in sediments at a site in Armenia between two ancient layers of lava dated to a period between 325,000 and 350,000 years ago. More primitive stone tools were also found at the same site. They were created using 'bifacial technology' where tools were created through the removal of flakes from a rock. The flakes were discarded as waste and the mass of stone used as the final tool. Archaeologists claim the Levallois technology was more economical because fewer raw materials were thrown away in the process. 'The combination of these different technologies in one place suggests that, about 325,000 years ago, people at the site were innovative,' said Dr Daniel Adler (pictured), from Connecticut University who led the study . They previously believed that Levallois technology was invented in Africa and spread to Eurasia with expanding human populations. But the fact that the two technology were found the Nor Geghi site in Armenia provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed Levallois technology on their own. Levallois technology is a name given by archaeologists to a method of creating stone tools developed  during the Palaeolithic period. The technique involves breaking different, pre-determined sizes of flakes off a lump of stone. The resulting flakes are then used as knives or other tools, which would have been relatively easy to carry by the fast-moving hunter-gatherers of the time. Levallois technology was named after the site where it was first discovered in France . 'The combination of these different technologies in one place suggests to us that, about 325,000 years ago, people at the site were innovative,' said Dr Daniel Adler from Connecticut University who led the study. As well as this, chemical analysis of several hundred stone tools shows that humans at the site used material from rocky outcrops from as far away as 75 miles (120km). This suggests hunters must also have been capable of exploiting large, environmentally diverse territories. This conclusion challenges the view held by some archaeologists that technological change resulted from population expansion during this period. 'If I were to take all the artefacts from the site and show them to an archaeologist, they would immediately begin to categorise them into chronologically distinct groups,' said Professor Adler. The stone tools found at Nor Geghi, however, reflect the flexibility and variability of a single population during a period of major behavioural and biological change. The fact that the two technology were found the Nor Geghi site in Armenia provides the first clear evidence that local populations developed Levallois technology on their own .","Stone tools between 325,000 and 350,000-years-old were found in Armenia .

"It all started with BB (Blemish Balm) creams - a multi-functional product that harnesses smart new technology so you can replace your serum, moisturiser, primer, foundation and sun block with just one product. The creams became one of the hottest trends in the beauty industry and are one of its fasting growing product areas with sales hitting £23m last year. Clearly catching onto the alphabetization theme, then came CC and even DD cream, but don't bother getting to grips with them because EE creams are already hitting shelves. But what on earth are they? Scroll down for video . Alphabet beauty: We've witnessed BB, CC and even DD cream but the beauty industry is always looking for innovative new science, technology and products and Estee Lauder believe they've found it with the Enlighten Even Effect Skintone Corrector SPF 30 (EE cream for short) Estee Lauder has unveiled the world's first EE cream - an abbreviation for the more long-winded Enlighten Even Effect Skintone Corrector SPF 30. The £34 cream, which lands in stores on October 1, has been designed to give wearers naturally glowing, even-toned skin. The product aims to help break the cycle of daily assaults and irritation that lead to hyperpigmentation and dark spots. Understanding that discolouration is a top, universal concern for women, Estée Lauder Scientists have been  researching the day/night rhythm of pigmentation. They discovered that our skin becomes aggravated by UV rays and pollution in the day and dark spots, discolouration and other types of hyperpigmentation are exacerbated whilst we sleep. How does it work? The product is packed with an ingredient called Baicalin, which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots . They therefore developed a cream packed with an ingredient called Baicalin, which aims to minimise the visible effects of irritation from pollution that can trigger the formation of excess pigment and dark spots. To give skin an overall more even effect, this smooth, fluid creme includes color-correcting pigments that promise to give skin a naturally luminous finish. Speaking about the new product, celebrity make-up artist Mikey Phillips said: 'As a great foundation alternative this new  cream is a buildable illuminating skin perfecting base. 'It's packed with powerful ingredients to protect and nourish your skin with long lasting results. As a makeup artist I was never convinced by all the BB, CC and now EE creams but I'm now converted and that's down to Estee Lauder and Bobbi Brown who do it best.

"A man who shot dead a young father  days after the birth of his baby daughter has been found guilty of murder. John 'Boy' Ward, 33, shot Thomas Ward, 21, who was the son of his cousin, at a caravan site in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, over a long-standing family feud. The court heard the murderer had phoned his victim in 2011 and told him: 'It's me, your enemy. I'm going to wait until you are at your happiest - then I'm going to get you.' Thomas Ward's wife Theresa gave birth to his daughter five days before he was killed on 23 April 2013. Scroll down for video . Thomas Ward, 21, (left) was shot at a caravan site in Stevenage by John 'Boy' Ward (right) over a family feud . A window of his caravan was smashed while the couple and their daughter were asleep. Opening the door with just a piece of kitchen cutlery for protection, Thomas was confronted by three masked men, one armed with a 12 gauge shotgun in April last year. With his wife standing behind him, he was shot in the chest and died less than an hour later in hospital. John Price QC, prosecuting, told the jury at St Albans Crown Court: 'Thomas Ward was the victim of an execution.' Clips of the funeral were shown on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening in October 2013. On the programme, his father, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'They shot him in a cold blooded murder. The police officer said at the time that it was an assassination. He never had a chance.' The funeral of Thomas Ward was featured on Channel 4's My Big Fat Gypsy Christening . The trial heard the feud began when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin Micky Ward in a car crash in 1987. Six years later James Ward shot dead Micky's brother James 'Bimbo' Ward and was jailed for manslaughter. John 'Boy' Ward was the younger brother of the two dead men. On the Channel 4 programme, James 'Young Fox' Ward said: 'I had an argument 20 odd years ago with a cousin and he died subsequently in the fight and I went to prison for it. 'Why did they not kill me, I don't understand.' Thomas had not been born when the feud began, but Mr Price, prosecuting, said: 'To John Ward, it was immaterial - Thomas Ward shared the sins of his father.' The trial heard the feud started when Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward (pictured left) was held responsible by some family members for the death of his cousin in a car crash in 1987 - his father said he did not understand why his son (pictured right) was killed instead of him . Following the shooting John 'Boy' Ward, from Hatfield, used a fake passport to travel on Eurostar to Brussels. His wife Joeleen, who was five months pregnant, then flew out from East Midlands Airport to meet him in Paris. They went on the run, travelling around France and Spain before settling in Helsingor in Denmark. Giving evidence during his trial, John 'Boy' Ward said he had panicked and fled after the shooting because he knew he would be blamed. He said he was scared to return to the UK because he'd heard there was a £100,000 'contract' out on him. He said: 'I heard there was a contract put on my head. £50,000 to find where I was and £50,000 to kill me.' Hundreds of travellers attended the funeral of Thomas Ward, who was shot by John 'Boy' Ward . Joeleen Ward, 22 – who was also on trial with her husband accused of helping him to escape – said her child had been born while they were on the run together in Europe. In the witness box she sobbed and spoke of her fears for her son's future safety because of the family feud. 'I'm still scared for my son growing up,' she told the jury. She was found guilty of a charge of assisting her husband to flee the country following the shooting and will be sentenced in November after reports have been prepared. John 'Boy' Ward's brother, Francis Ward, 36, and his sister Winifred, 47, also pleaded not guilty to assisting his escape from the UK. Francis Ward, from Kensington was convicted of assisting an offender and his sister – of  Hounslow – was convicted of an identical charge. They, too, will be sentenced with Joeleen in November. Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, pictured with his mother, Lily, was sent to jail for 13 months in July for trying to avenge his son's death . In July this year, Thomas's father, James 'Young Fox' Ward, was jailed for 13 months after he flipped his BMW sports car while drunkenly driving around in a revenge mission to find his son's killers. James Ward flipped the car on to its roof after ploughing into another vehicle when he got behind the wheel while drunk, uninsured and disqualified from driving. He crashed into another vehicle, causing serious injuries to a woman and child who were inside the car, who had to be airlifted to hospital.","John 'Boy' Ward, 33, shot Thomas Ward, 21 over a bitter family feud .

In the 4-minute clip, the fluffy mammal is dipped into a small rectangular pool on her back under the watchful eyes of experts. The video also shows the infant otter being carefully dried with a towel, cuddled and fed from a bottle like a new-born baby. The abandoned orphan currently weighs under 6lbs and measures 22.6 inches in length. For now, Pup 681 will be kept away from other otters housed in the visible section of the aquarium as she learns to groom herself, forage for food and eat on her own, Washington Post reported. She is kept on a strict diet of formula and small solid foods like shrimp and chopped clams. In due time, the pup will be moved to Shedd's Regenstein Sea Otter Nursery. The pup was discovered on Coastways Beach in central California by a jogger four weeks ago, and immediately taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for care. The southern sea otter was  severely underweight and had been abandoned by her mother at least 16 hours prior to being discovered workers there said, so it was immediately a rush to get her fed and healthy. A sea otter that was discovered all alone on a California beach when it was just 1 week old has been nursed back to health . Workers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium spent four weeks getting the pup healthy again . After four weeks of intensive care and stabilization in Monterey Bay's Sea Otter Program, the now 5-week-old pup, whose name is currently Pup 681, was transferred to her new home - in Chicago. Monterey Bay Aquarium reached out to aquariums in search of a facility that could provide necessary care for the pup, and the Shedd Aquarium in the Windy City answered their call. 'It truly takes a village to rehabilitate a young sea otter,' Tim Binder, the aquarium's vice president, told the Chicago Tribune. 'Our animal care team is teaching the pup how to be an otter.' Now, the 5-week-old otter is heading to her new home at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago . She spends her days swimming, playing with felt and drinking formula filled with minced clams . And Pup 681 seems to love her new surroundings, swimming around, playing with felt and enjoying meals of formula with minced clams. She is also learning how to feed and bathe herself. Best of all however, staff at the aquarium is hard at work picking out a name for the new lady in their lives.","An otter orphaned by its mother was discovered malnourished on a beach in California four weeks ago .

"Former Tory MP Louise Mensch has finally confessed she has had a facelift, saying: 'I like the way I look and like to keep it that way'. The outspoken chick-lit novelist made the admission speaking on BBC2’s Newsnight from New . York, after nearly three years of repeated speculation about her appearance. Mrs Mensch, 41, had previously refused to say that she had cosmetic surgery while she was working at Westminster, but told Jeremy Paxman last night: 'I had a little tightening in my face' for 'maintenance'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Before and after: Louise Mensch (pictured in 2008) joined Parliament in 2010 before having a facelift, which she admitted having on Newsnight last night (right) Jeremy Paxman asked her: 'You are a highly successful, highly intelligent woman who achieved power and yet you choose to do this to you body. Aren't you worried about what example you set?'. Responding to the compliments by saying 'carry on', Mrs Mensch then denied she was a bad role model adding: 'The desire to look good is not entirely negative'. The author had refused to answer the . question when a journalist spotted her facial scarring in 2011 because she felt it was ‘trivialising women politicians based . on their appearance’. But now she is no longer a politician, she said she felt she could talk about the procedure, which she claims she did ‘just for maintenance’, because she likes the way she looks and was ‘very happy’ with the result. Plastic surgery addict Alicia Douvall was also on the programme, who admitted having 500 procedures and going into rehab as a result. She said her obsession had left her physically and mentally scarred. Debate: Mrs Mensch was on Newsnight to debate cosmetic surgery, but refused to accept an accusation by Jeremy Paxman that she had set a bad example . Problems: Plastic surgery addict Alicia Douvall was also on the programme (left) and said her years of surgery and procedures had been damaging mentally and physically . In 2011, Mrs Mensch, now 41, was asked . if she had had a facelift. A reporter later wrote of seeing ‘incisions . in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh, they . still have tiny lines of scab’. The writer thought it may be evidence of a ‘Chicago facelift’, a procedure that is known for its short recovery time. At the time, Mrs Mensch responded: ‘My God. Um. . . OK. .. I’ve always wondered what I would say the first time somebody asked me this question. And without denying it, I’m going to refuse to answer.’ But last night she told Jeremy Paxman: ‘I refused to answer that question, not because I was embarrassed about the procedure but because people are always trying to trivialise women politicians based on their appearance. ‘But as I am no longer a politician ... I had it done just for maintenance. It was something that I had carefully researched, I picked a very qualified surgeon, I was fully aware of the risks and the rewards'. Refusal:  A reporter wrote of seeing 'incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet and last night the Tory told Jeremy Paxman: 'I had a little tightening in my face' Marriage: Louise Mensch with her husband Peter Mensch, who she moved to New York with after quitting as MP for Corby . When Mr Paxman said he still didn't understand why she did it, Mrs Mensch replied: 'I like the way I look and I wanted to keep it that way. And I'm very happy with the results. 'I had a very, very good surgeon. The difference is subtle if you get somebody who knows what they are doing.' After the show Mrs Mensch got in a row on Twitter when a member of the public accused her of lying when she was in Parliament. 'That's libellous b*******. A real slander and a slur. Refused to answer question,' she wrote. 'Refusing to answer a sexist question is not a denial.' Row: After the show Louise Mensch got involved in a row on Twitter after this user accused her of lying while an MP . Response: The former MP called the statement 'libellous b*******' denying that she had lied or denied it . Final statement: The chick-lit author again claimed the original questions asked about her facelift were sexist so she refused to answer it . In her column in The Sun this morning she said that women should be able to 'make their own decisions about their own bodies', adding she admired 59-year-old supermodel Christie Brinkley. 'My Anti-ageing idol is Christie Brinkley. If she's had work done, you know, so what? The girl looks absolutely amazing'. Last year she condemned the ‘trivialisation’ of women politicians judged on their appearance. The . former backbencher, who rose to prominence during Rupert Murdoch’s . grilling on phone-hacking by the Commons culture committee, used a . glamorous photo shoot and interview with GQ magazine to make the claim. Younger than her years: Christie Brinkley looked youthful and toned as . she filmed a workout video . on Santa Monica beach last month, and Louise Mensch calls the supermodel her 'anti-ageing idol' 'You don't trivialise a woman politician based on her ap­pearance, ' she told GQ. 'As the pieces flowed in the next day, everything I had said was washed away under the fluffy-bunny thing of looks'. In August last year she sensationally quit as an MP, saying she could not represent Corby in Northamptonshire because she could not juggle her political and family life. Mrs Mensch moved to New York with her three children to live with her second husband Peter, who manages rock group Metallica. After years of refusing to reveal if she had a facelift, Louise Mensch has at last admitted she had one. But there is still speculation about the exact procedure the former MP had. It is believed she had a version of the 'Chicago Facelift', which is well known because it is done under local anaesthetic and causes less bruising and noticeable scarring than a full facelift. A procedure of this speed, which takes just a few days to recover from, could have allowed Mrs Mensch to have had one during the summer Parliamentary recess in 2011. After meeting her that year Guardian interviewer Decca Aitkenhead said she saw 'incisions in the creases where her ears and cheeks meet that look so fresh... they still have tiny lines of scab'. Mrs Mensch replied to her at the time: I'm going to refuse to answer your question, because if I did that I'd become the ""minister for mascara"". She added: 'My beauty secrets are between me and my various, er, therapists. I'm refusing to answer your question. But you should note that I'm not denying anything.' She may have had something similar to the procedure known as the One-Stitch Lift. Under local anaesthetic, a small semicircle of skin is cut away where the hair-line meets the ear, exposing the cheek muscle. The muscle is then pulled tight and the skin is sewn shut with a running stitch. Another common version of the quick Chicago Facelift is something called . the 'silhouette lift'. Very fine threads, almost like fishing wire, are . inserted under the skin and used to pull up the face via a series of . incisions on the scalp. There is also the Short-Scar . Facelift, where incisions are made above and around the ear before the flesh is pulled tight. It is carried out under general anaesthetic and takes about two weeks to recover from, with patients banned from any strenuous exercise, including sex and housework.","Refused to comment to journalist in 2011 who asked her about facial scars .

"Airlines have warned that fares will inevitably rise as a result of a Supreme Court decision upholding compensation payments to passengers who have suffered delays. Two million passengers a year whose flights are delayed by technical faults could now be entitled to hundreds of pounds each after judges found such problems are the sole responsibility of the airline. However, airlines and aviation experts have warned that the cost of funding compensation payments will have to be handed back to the consumer. One previous estimate, by an airline industry expert, estimated that fares could rise by £5 per ticket. Landmark Jet2 and Thomson's applications to appeal against two flight delay compensation cases have been rejected, paving the way for thousands of new claims . Thousands of claims against airlines over flight delays had been put on hold until the Supreme Court rulings . Jet2 and Thomson had appealed against the Court of Appeal's decision in two cases about the consumer. Both Jet2 and Thomson had appealed against previous court decisions. In the Jet2 case a passenger successfully challenged the airline's view that a 27-hour delay to an October 2011 flight amounted to an 'extraordinary circumstance'. The upholding of the Thomson Airways case, which goes back to 2006, confirms consumers in England and Wales have six years to bring a claim for flight delay compensation. A spokesperson for Monarch told MailOnline that the current system was not sustainable. 'Like the rest of the industry we are disappointed by today’s ruling by the Supreme Court. The current application of Regulation EU261 has been extended beyond its original scope and does not offer a fair model for low cost, leisure airlines. 'Ultimately, the customer will end up bearing additional costs through increased fares across the industry. 'We would encourage the EU to revisit and reform the Regulation to reflect the true nature of operating a European airline. 'We don’t yet know how much fares will increase. We are focusing on settling the outstanding claims now that there is clarification around the application of the regulation in relation to technical issues.' Martin Lewis, creator and founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The clarity of this ruling is crucial for thousands frustrated by the airlines' stubborn attitude on this issue. 'Quite simply, the ruling states airlines are responsible for technical faults in all but extraordinary circumstances and that you can reclaim back at least six years. Cheshire-based law firm Bott & Co said the Jet2 case could lead to claims of around £876 million a year from passengers while the Thomson case could lead to an estimated £3.89 billion in compensation. 'This is a landmark day for passengers everywhere,' said David Bott, senior partner at Bott & Co. DAWSON V THOMSON . James Dawson, 41, of Peterborough, can keep the £975 plus interest (a total of £1,488.73) that he was awarded from Thomson Airways after his flight with his wife from Gatwick to the Dominican Republic on Christmas Day 2006 was delayed six hours 26 minutes. Thomson appealed the order for payment made by Judge Michael Yelton at Cambridge County Court on the grounds that it was outside the two year limitation period for claims under the 1999 Montreal Convention. But Lord Justice Moore-Bick unanimously agreed that claims can be made up to six years after the event under European law, and that Mr Dawson was just inside that limit. Solicitors Bott & Co says decision affects more than 11m passengers. HUZAR V JET2 . Ronald Huzar, 58, of Stockport, won his battle with Jet2.com after his flight from Malaga to Manchester in 2011 was delayed for 27 hours. The airline claimed a technical fault was 'unforeseeable' and they shouldn't have to pay compensation. But the judges ruled the fault was not an 'extraordinary circumstance' and they must pay. After his victory Mr Huzar said: 'I am absolutely delighted with the decision. After everything I have been through to get to this point it's a fantastic day. 'I always hoped that we would get a positive outcome and it's nice to get to this milestone. The result in my favour should help passengers throughout the country who have experienced similar difficulties to me.' Nathan Stower, the chief executive of the body representing UK airlines, the British Air Transport Association, said: 'The Supreme Court decision is both surprising and disappointing. 'UK airlines support the principle of passenger protection and always meet their legal obligations. However, the rules should be clear, affordable and proportionate for the sake of passengers and airlines. 'The current system fails those tests and this decision will further increase costs which ultimately are borne by all passengers.'","Cases means money claimed back could be as much as £4.8 billion .

"Twelve suspected illegal immigrants have been detained by police after being found at a food preparation factory in Dover. Officers were called to Tilmanstone Salads factory at an industrial estate on the outskirts of Dover at 9.22am following reports of a 'suspicious group' in the area. A police helicopter was also scrambled and could be seen hovering overhead as ground officers entered the site. Scroll down for video . Officers were called to Tilmanstone Salads factory (pictured), at an industrial estate on the outskirts of Dover, at 9.22am following reports of a 'suspicious group' in the area. They detained 12 suspected illegal immigrants . It comes after a group of suspected illegal immigrants were found in the back of a refrigerated yogurt lorry in Whitfield, near Dover in Kent, less than a week ago. They were found after banging on the door in a bid for help . Kent Police said 12 people were detained and handed over to the Home Office immigration enforcement team. Bakkavor, which owns the food preparation site, was unable to confirm how the group of people came to be on the site. A spokesman said: 'Bakkavor confirms that a group of unauthorised individuals entered its Tilmanstone Salads site today. 'The matter is now being managed by local police services.' The Tilmanstone Salads factory, which opened in 2001, employees around 750 workers and supplies in freshly prepared salads and vegetables to market leaders. On its website, Bakkavor says it ‘specialises in making and developing private label prepared foods for the top global grocery retailers and well-known international foodservice operators’. It lists Marks & Spencer, Waitrose, Tesco, Asda and Sainbsury’s among its clients. Earlier this month, crowds attempted to overpower officials and machine-gun wielding police in an attempt to board a Britain-bound P&O ferry in Calais, France. Ferry crews eventually had to pull a fire hose on them to stop . The detainees are the latest group to be held recently amid concerns from the British freight industry about migrants' ever-more-desperate attempts to reach the UK from Calais. The Freight Transport Association (FTA) has called for the European Union to bring in stricter border controls to deal with what it describes as a 'worsening situation'. Meanwhile, more than 3,000 people have signed an e-petition demanding the UK Government help solve the problems faced by British truckers. They want fines of up to £2,000 per migrant, which are imposed on lorry drivers and hauliers if stowaways are caught hiding inside their vehicles, to be scrapped.

She then sends the sound clip wirelessly to a smartphone app, which translates it into text and searches the internet for an answer. Some parents don’t seem convinced, with one writing on forum Mumsnet: ‘Personally I find it a bit freaky... I’m sure it’s going to drive me bonkers!’ But manufacturer Vivid insisted the toy, which costs £58.99, is educational. A spokesman said: ‘They can talk about their likes and dislikes and hobbies. Cayla can even answer questions about maths, general knowledge and the weather.’ Vivid added that Cayla’s web searches are controlled by Google’s SafeSearch technology to protect children from unsuitable material and block some words. Brand manager Catherine Scott said: ‘If swear words or nasty words come up, she will say: “That’s not very nice, we are not talking about that”.’ The top 12 Christmas list, compiled by a panel from the Toy Retailers Association, also includes two dolls inspired by the hit Disney movie Frozen, a clear sign of the mania still surrounding the film almost a year after it was released. Toy shop owner Gary Grant said there is still huge demand for Frozen merchandise, adding: ‘Quite frankly, you could sell empty boxes if they had Frozen written on them.’ The list is dominated by futuristic toys this year, including a smart watch for children as young as five. The £39.99 Kidizoom watch includes a camera, a voice recorder and games. The most expensive toy on the list is an interactive pet dinosaur called Boomer, at £99.99. But while children’s toys are becoming ever more high-tech, traditional brand Lego still holds on to a spot in the top 12 with a model of Benny’s Spaceship from this year’s Lego movie. Increased interest in low-priced and collectable toys such as Panini stickers and Lego mini figures had also spurred healthy growth in impulse-buying, and also meant the average price for toys dropped from £7.69 to £6.95. Meanwhile, three toys related to Frozen are among the year's top 10 sellers, with sales currently stronger than they were after the film's initial release, NPD said. From the 72 toys in the list the panel selected 12 Top Toys that they believe will be dominating the . wish lists this Christmas; they are, in alphabetical order: . NPD Group toys analyst Frederique Tutt said: 'The British toy market is leading resurgence in toy sales in Europe. 'The innovation that the industry has invested in has also started to pay back. Impulse sales of collectibles and lower-priced toys are up as well as licences from movies including Frozen, and this year's craze, loom bands. 'These two factors combined delivered the fastest growth rate in toy sales since 2010 which suggests that Christmas 2014 might be the best for some time.' Best of friends: Sam and his penguin friend Monty in this year's John Lewis Christmas advert . Last year it was the enduring friendship of a hare and a bear that melted our hearts. Twelve months on, John Lewis hopes the bond between a boy and a penguin will similarly capture the public’s imagination. This year’s two-minute festive commercial tells the story of seven-year-old Sam and his friend Monty. The boy gradually realises Monty is longing for a penguin companion. And so on Christmas morning Sam surprises Monty with the gift of a new penguin friend named Mabel. The soundtrack is John Lennon’s song Real Love, performed by Tom Odell.

"A woman who went for a routine smear test was astounded to be told she had two wombs and two cervixes. Jane Woodhead, 38, had no idea she was suffering from a condition called uterus didelphys. It means a woman can be born with any combination of two wombs, two separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas. It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb. Jane Woodhead, 38, went for a smear test and was astounded to be told she had two wombs. The condition can cause complications during pregnancy, but baby Grace, now 12 weeks old, was born healthy . When the female foetus is developing, two tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ - the uterus (top picture). But in a minority of women, including Ms Woodhead, the tubes don't join - allowing two hollow organs to form instead. This means the woman is born with two wombs (bottom picture) After being diagnosed with the condition - which carries risks of complications during pregnancy - Ms Woodhead was told she would need IVF treatment if she ever wished to have children. But weeks later, she found out she was already pregnant - and  later gave birth to her 'miracle baby', Grace. Ms Woodhead, from Barry, South Wales, said: 'When I was told about the uterus didelphys it was a huge surprise, as I'd been having routine smears for years and no one had picked it up. 'They said it was possible alternate ones had been checked, which was obviously a bit of a shock. 'To think it's something I was born with, but never knew, was bizarre.' Doctors explained she had a rare condition called 'uterus didelphys', also known as a double uterus, where a woman is born with two uteri, two separate cervixes and can sometimes even have two separate vaginas. Only three per cent of women are born with an abnormality such as having two wombs every year. The condition is normally diagnosed during an examination, a smear test or in a scan during pregnancy. It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ. Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case. It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes. As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus. Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs. It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan. In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb. It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb. Some women are also born with two vaginas, which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation. Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy. Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications. There is no treatment or cure for the condition. However sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ - so the woman is born with two wombs. The condition often only becomes noticeable after puberty. Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, said  women can go for years without realising they have an extra womb. She told MailOnline: 'Sometimes it's discovered in a physical exam, or when they have cervical smears. 'If the lady is pregnant and they have an early scan it can be picked up then. 'But if they don't have any tests, then it's not noticed - and they can go for years and years without knowing.' In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb. Two different pregnancies are also possible at the same time. ‘Although women normally produce only one egg a month, sometimes they can produce two,' explained Dr Hanna. ‘If they have sex at the right time, they can have a pregnancy in each womb -  non-identical twins. ‘It’s a rare thing, but it can happen once in a blue moon. Some women are also born with two vaginas, which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation. Dr Hanna said: 'Some have a septum in the vagina. If they have two vaginas they will need to wear two tampons. 'If they've got one vagina it doesn't affect sex. But if they have two vaginas then there can be some difficulties with sex.' And to properly check they are healthy, smear tests should be carried out in both cervixes. She reiterated that having two wombs can lead to complications during pregnancy. Ms Woodhead and partner Paul Herridge were delighted to find out she was pregnant with baby Grace, as doctors said the condition meant she would need IVF to have a baby. The condition is linked with higher risks of miscarriage, premature births and bleeding during pregnancy . 'They're more likely to have a baby breach position and require a Caesarean. These woman are also more likely to have miscarriage.' She added: 'If they've got a small uterus, they're more likely to have a pre-term birth.' After being diagnosed with uterus didephys, Ms Woodhead was told she would need IVF to have a baby. She signed up for the treatment, which has a waiting list of up to 18 months. But after feeling unwell, and doing a urine test for the GP, she was told she was seven weeks pregnant. She said: 'What worried me the most was that I wondered if I'd ever be able to become a mum as they told me my chances of getting pregnant would be slim.' 'She's our lovely, beautiful miracle' Ms Woodhead said about her daughter . 'I certainly didn't think it would be possible naturally. But just a week before we were about to have our first IVF appointment I was given the bombshell, brilliant news. 'I had to wait four days before having a scan which I needed for reassurance that everything was okay. 'They needed to check it wasn't ectopic and, sure enough, there was a baby in my left womb and I was very much pregnant. 'They did check the other womb and there was a chance I had been carrying another baby as they could see  something there... but there was definitely no heartbeat. It took a long time to sink in.' The  risks for pregnant women, include early or late miscarriage, premature or early labour, low birth weight. Doctors normally opt for a Caesarean to avoid these complications. Ms Woodhead admitted the risks worried her. She said: 'I had got through the first challenge of getting pregnant and I just wanted a successful outcome. 'We had to keep a close eye on everything and I had 17 scans in 39 weeks. 'It was there that we found out we were having a little girl at 15 weeks and we were just so overwhelmed and excited.' She said: 'I never felt able to relax during the 39 weeks as I was aware of the risks and I was so grateful to be able to tick every week off the calendar and move closer to my due date.' Grace Violet Herridge was born on July 18. 'She was born 11 days after my 40th birthday and was the best 40th birthday present I could ever have asked for or dreamed of. She's my little miracle. 'I still stare at her for hours even now 12 weeks after she was born and can't believe she is really mine. 'She is our lovely, beautiful miracle.'","Doctors found that Jane Woodhead, 38, had two uterus and two cervixes .

"This is the moment a wildebeest is dragged away from its herd by a ferocious African wild dog before it fell prey to the rest of the pack. Despite its victim being more than twice its size, the dog was able to launch an attack on the wildebeest, sinking its teeth into its muzzle. The carnivore then managed to haul its struggling prey back to the rest of its pack at the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa. Scroll down for video . Struggle: This is the moment a wildebeest is dragged away from its herd by a ferocious African wild dog before it fell prey to the rest of the pack at the Madikwe Game Reserve in South Africa . Francois Van Heerden, a guide at the reserve - located around 165 miles from South African capital Pretoria - captured the dramatic moment on camera. He said that the wildebeest had fought hard, but in the end did not have the stamina to overcome the strength of the pack of wild dogs. Often confused with hyenas, the dogs are highly endangered and were introduced to the park in 1994 as part of a conservation effort to protect the species - often known as the 'painted dog' due to the markings on the animals coats. Game reserve: Francois Van Heerden, a guide at the reserve (pictured) - located around 165 miles from South African capital Pretoria - captured the dramatic moment on camera . Conservation: The dogs are highly endangered and were introduced to Madikwe (pictured) in 1994 as part of a conservation effort to protect the species . The original pack were faced with a host of dangers such as rabies outbreaks, territorial clashes and the odd run in with the park's lions but are now thriving. Three hunting packs currently roam the 289 square mile reserve, which is located close to the border with Botswana. The dogs live and hunt in packs, and can pursue their prey at speed of up to 40miles an hour for anything between ten minutes to an hour. Nearly 80 per cent of wild dog hunts end with a kill, compared with lions which manage to kill around 30 per cent of their prey. Wild dogs often kill their larger prey, such as wildebeest, impalas, gazelle and springbok, by firstly immobilising the victim and then disemboweling them. After a successful hunt, the dogs will regurgitate meat for the members of the pack that remained at the den during the hunt, such as the dominant female, older animals and pups.

"Ed Miliband has spent the week being told to get out of his comfort zone and show he is in touch with normal people. So a chance meeting with the star of one of Britain's biggest soap operas was a perfect opportunity to prove he is in tune with the zeitgeist. Chatting with EastEnders' star Danny Dyer the Labour leader rattled off detailed facts about the cast, before admitting he had not watched the show but had been reading about it online. Scroll down for video . Discussion: A chance meeting with Danny Dyer (left), the star of one of Britain's biggest soap operas, was a perfect opportunity for Labour leader Ed Miliband (right) to prove he is in tune with the zeitgeist . Mr Miliband tried to impress EastEnders' star Dyer with his knowledge of obscure facts about EastEnders at the Attitude awards this week . Some opinion polls have suggested as many as four in 10 people think Mr Miliband is 'weird' or very 'weird'. After the Tories inched ahead in the polls last week, Labour MPs urged him to 'get out of his north London comfort zone'. So the Attitude magazine awards in London this week were a chance to shake-off his wonkish image and rub shoulders with stars of stage and screen. But an encounter with Dyer, who plays Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, appears to have only reinforced the impression of a leader who is a bit of a geek. The pair had been introduced the shows' producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins. An onlooker told The Sun: 'He immediately made a big point of saying he knew a lot about the show. 'Then he started saying how the character of Martin Fowler has had three different actors playing him and how Ben Mitchell's character has had five. Singer Boy George also met Mr Miliband a tweeted this selfie, declaring that the Labour leader was 'not creepy in any way' Dyer plays Mick Carter, landlord of the Queen Vic, in the BBC One soap, but Mr Miliband admitted he does not watch it . 'Danny was a bit confused so asked him if watches the show. Ed shook his head and said, ""No, I don't have time any more but I've been doing a lot of research about it online"".' Since 1996 Ben Mitchell, son of veteran hardman Phil, has been played by Matthew Silver, Morgan Whittle, Charlie Jones, Joshua Pascoe and most recently Harry Reid, who joined the show this year. Similarly, Martin Fowler has been played by Jon Peyton Price and James Alexandrou, with James Bye taking over this year. In a minor boost for Mr Miliband, 1980s singer Boy George posed for a selfie with the Labour leader and later tweeted: 'Ed Milliband, totally cool, no attitude, not creepy in any way. Very genuine and the nicest politician I have met. Period!' However, Dyer remain unimpressed, telling the newspaper: 'It was all a bit too heavy for me. I had to sit the f*** down.'

"Kim Jong-il's former bodyguard, who protected him during the 1980s, believes that the former dictator's son Kim Jong-un is far more dangerous that the departed 'Dear Leader'. Lee Young-Guk was chosen to protect Kim in 1979, while his father Kim Il Sung still ruled North Korea. Lee said he had to train fanatically to become an elite bodyguard, including having the ability to smash roof tiles with his fists, using martial arts techniques. Scroll down for video . Lee Young-Guk spent ten years working as a bodyguard for Kim Jong-Il, left, during the 1980s where he witnessed significant terror among senior officials, he believes the situation is worse under Kim Jong-Un, right . He said the Kims required absolute loyalty and any suspicion of treachery would be dealt with incredibly harshly. Speaking to CNN, Lee admitted that he was brainwashed by the regime while he was still working for Kim Jong-Un's father during the 1980s. He said: 'When Kim Jong Il would arrive in his vehicle, advisors would run away and throw themselves onto the grass. They had dust on their clothes but they wanted to hide from him. 'They are scared because even when he was happy he would be rude and could chop off their heads.' One advisor who used Kim's private elevator and ashtray was deported to a concentration camp where he died. However, Lee said the North Korean people have more reason to be afraid of Kim Jong-Un than his father. 'Kim Jong Un ended up killing his uncle, who even Kim Jong Il could not kill. As power was handed down to the third generation, it became crueler. Kim Jong Un has created loyalty, but it is fake and based on fear.' Lee believes that Kim Jong-Un, pictured, is even more ruthless than the dictator's late father Kim Jong-Il . Lee ceased working for Kim when one of the bodyguard's relations became a driver for the dictator. Only one family member was allowed to work for the Kim's according to their paranoid rules. Upon returning to his home near the China border, Lee was despondent when he saw the state the country was still in and tried to escape. He was captured and sent to a concentration camp but was able to escape and moved to South Korea where he became a duck farmer. He has also written a book on his experiences working for Kim Jong-Il. The family have become infamous for their extreme examples of exacting revenge for any perceived offence. Jang Song-thaek was executed in December 2013 after he was accused to treason against the North Korean regime. Jang was one of the most powerful men in North Korea and was seen as hugely important in the transition of power between Kim Jong-Il and his son. Following his execution, Kim described his uncle as 'factionalist filth'. One of Jang's supporters O Sang-hon was 'executed by flame-thrower' according to North Korean officials. After Kim Jong-Il's death in 2012, people who were deemed not to have mourned intensely enough, were sent to a labour camp for six months. In October 2013, it was reported that Kim Jong-Un ordered the execution of his ex-girlfriend Hyon Song-Wol, who had a popular hit song in North Korea. However, she appeared on North Korean state television in May delivering a speech. Days after she reappeared in public, Kim ordered the execution of engineers and architects involved in the construction of a Pyongyang tower block which collapsed days earlier. More than 500 people died in the collapse which was blamed on 'shoddy workmanship'. Kim ordered the executions because he was 'unable to sleep after learning of the tragedy'. Kim himself went missing from public view in early September, prompting claims that he may have been overthrown. However, it is understood he underwent ankle surgery and reappeared in public after six weeks carrying a black cane. Upon his return, it is believed he ordered the execution of six senior officials.","Kim Jong-Il executed his advisors if they displeased him in any manner .

"A baby boy has been left with livid scratches on his head after a vulture attacked him during a bird display at a safari park. The huge bird of prey attacked Cruz Conway, who is just six months old, as he was lying in his pram during the show at Knowsley Safari Park in Merseyside. His parents Phil and Sherina had taken Cruz and his older brother Zak, four, on a day out to the park. Six-month-old Cruz Conway, right, from Bebington, Wirral, suffered scratches to his head after a vulture swooped on him as he lay in his pram during a birds of prey display (file image of American Black Vulture) Cruz, who had hospital treatment after the incident, is now recovered at home, but his brother has nightmares . Mrs Conway, 34, who is a nurse, said: ‘He was lucky he wasn’t blinded.’ Mr Conway, 35, recalled the moment the American black vulture swooped down to land on the pram and began scratching at his son, and said that he had felt nervous earlier in the display. ‘There were two vultures and a smaller bird – I think some kind of crow – and when we went into the show they warned us not to get any food out as the vultures were going to be flying quite close. ‘They started flying around, but they were getting really close to the spectators’ heads. It made me really nervous. ‘The vulture flew over our heads, and Sherina ducked down, but then I didn’t see it take off. ‘When I turned around, it was on Cruz’s head scraping him. Its claws were all over his head and he was crying hysterically. ‘I panicked and had to strike the bird to get it away.’ He added: ‘I was really concerned because staff had just been saying how the vultures often pick up fox carcasses. Cruz only weighs less than 20lbs, so it’s a good job he was strapped in. It could have easily picked him up.’ The vulture did not draw blood but left Cruz with many scratches on his head. He was given first aid at the safari park and his parents decided to take him to be checked at hospital. Staff at the safari park, which lies between Liverpool and Manchester, warned spectators to put food away . Mrs Conway, from Bebington, said: ‘They cleaned the wound and told us to keep an eye on his sleeping pattern to make sure he was OK. They’d never seen anything like it but they said that he was lucky he wasn’t blinded.’ She added: ‘We are just grateful that he got away with just scratches and nothing else.’ Mr Conway, who is an electrical engineer, said that their elder son was also shaken up and has had nightmares about the incident. ‘Zak has been really affected by it,’ he said. ‘He loves animals and wanted to be a zoo keeper before this happened. ‘The night after, he woke up screaming saying the bird was going to take him away.’ Knowsley Safari Park, which has been holding its bird of prey show for 19 years, said it was an isolated incident but has put measures in place to ensure it doesn’t happen again. The name 'vulture' comes from the Latin word for 'tearer' and refers to the bird's aggressive feeding habits. American Black Vultures, also known as Black Vultures, have a poor sense of smell and so often follow less aggressive Turkey Vultures to carcases, before driving them away and feasting on the meat themselves. They eat carrion, or rotting corpses, but also may kill or injure newborn mammals, for example, pecking a newborn calf's eyes out before killing it.  Black vultures also feed at rubbish dumps. In the wild they are found in southern parts of the United States, Mexico, Central America and most of South America, as well as on the Caribbean islands. An adult black vulture can grow to have a wingspan of 5ft 5ins (167cm) and a weight of around 6lbs. Richard Smith, head of visitor services at Knowsley Safari Park said: ‘Gauntlet, who run the Birds Of Prey display, reported that their hand-reared vulture had hopped on to a soft-topped pram during the free-flying display ... In the thousands of free-flying displays that have taken place at Knowsley Safari, this is a first-time occurrence. ‘Following this incident, we have revised our procedures and now babies are requested to sit on their parents’ knees, and pushchairs are not allowed in the area.’ Mr Conway said: ‘We don’t want anything to happen to the bird or for the bird shows to stop. ‘We just want extra precautions put in place such as not allowing prams.’ American black vultures have broad, powerful wings that reach a span of around 5ft. They also have short, hooked beaks that they use to tear apart meat – and although they mainly eat carrion they have also been known to kill and eat young or injured animals. They have a reputation for aggression and often hunt in flocks. It it is one of the few species of vultures that prey on cattle, swarming and overcoming new-born calves.","Cruz Conway was on a day out with his family at Knowsley Safari Park .

"He is an adrenaline junkie who loves nothing more than scaling high structures to get great views. And freerunner James Kingston decided to take viewers with him on his latest challenge, filming himself climbing a 250ft crane in Southampton. The 24-year-old climbs to the top of the crane, which is the highest point in Southhampton, and then stands at the highest point whilst holding the GoPro camera on a stick to capture the surrounding view. The thrill seeker is hundreds of feet in the air and his lack of fear, poise and determination to get to the top is remarkable. Mr Kingston smiles and he looks excited to capture the remarkable selfie. Speaking about his crane climb last year Mr Kingston explained what motivates him to take such extreme risks. During the recently released video, which has already been viewed over 145,000 times since it was uploaded on October 23, Mr Kingston completes another audacious stunt. Grip: The adrenaline junkie holds on tightly as he makes his way up the tower . View: Mr Kingston has a magnificent birds-eye-view of Southampton when he reaches the top . Standing attempt: The fearless young man then attempts to stand up next to the beacon at the top of the crane . The footage was captured by Mr Kingston on a GoPro camera and the adventurer has stated that he always likes to take advantage of high structures in his city. He said: 'I stayed at the top for around an hour enjoying the view, jumping around and capturing it all. I didn't plan to do anything really. All I wanted to do was get up there in time for sunrise.' The risk-taker said he is not scared when he stands at the top of a crane. He said: 'You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your finger tips. I did it for the adventure. Life's too short to be sat around worrying about your future. You have no time to waste!' No Support: Mr Kingston then takes a huge risk by standing up unaided . A vertigo-inducting selfie: Mr Kingston captures the moment, by taking a photograph using a selfie stick . It's not the first time Mr Kingston has scaled a crane in his home city. Last year he hung form a 250ft structure with just one hand as he captured the terrifying challenge on camera. It took him twenty minutes to climb to the dizzying heights and the video was subsequently viewed by over three million people. More of James' daring climbs can be found on his YouTube channel and stunning pictures on his Instagram. James can also be found on Facebook and Twitter.","James Kingston describes himself as a 'professional adventurer'

"A mother who had her daughters pose for sexually explicit pictures and videos before sending them to a Sydney dance teacher has been jailed until at least 2016. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, wept in the dock as Judge Peter Zahra described how she felt ""stymied"" by her own failed dance career, which began with promise but ended with strip shows and lingerie waitressing, and fell under the spell of her children's dance instructor Grant Davies. She has pleaded guilty to producing and disseminating child abuse material, including pictures of her children in sexually suggestive poses and video of them dancing semi-naked. Grant Davies was arrested in May last year and charged with more than 60 child abuse offences . Grant Davies was a co-director of a now defunct dance school based in Sydney's inner west . The Sydney District Court heard how the woman became engulfed by stage ambitions for her daughters, both gifted dancers, who had been accepted into Grant's exclusive Sydney dance school. Judge Zahra said she complied with his alleged requests to supply increasingly daring images of the girls, then aged between 10 and 13. The woman has been jailed for at least one and a half years. Judge Zahra said the adult scenes depicted in the foreground of the images contrasted starkly with the soft toys strewn through the little girls' bedrooms, where many of the photographs were taken. 'The imagery of the complainants in sexually explicit poses against this background is confronting,' Judge Zahra said. Some videos involved poses from dance routines while other imagery focused on the girls' genitals. 'They were particularly helpless in their own home, where the perpetrator of the abuse against them was their own mother,' the judge said. 'Because of her own obsession with fame, the offender knowingly exploited her own children.' The court heard that after the images were discovered, the two sisters initially tried to protect their mother by pretending they had taken the photos themselves, or of one another. The offences where allegedly committed against 10 of his dance students . But images that captured their mother's foot exposed her role in taking at least some of the pictures. She has told the court she was scared of Davies, whom she described as domineering and aggressive, and feared that he would punish her children by kicking them out of starring roles in his company's dance productions or remove them altogether. 'I knew it wasn't right - I didn't know how to stop,' she told investigators. 'My problem is I'm not very strong.' Yet Judge Zahra said there was evidence the offender had traded sexual banter with Davies. 'She was crazy tonight, I wish you could see them both when they are not shy,' the woman said in one text message. 'Oh my gosh, what a turn-on,' Davies is alleged to have replied. Throughout it all, her husband has stuck by his wife, pleading with the judge during sentencing hearings not to send his wife away. He told the judge the couple's young children were 'devastated' and ""yearning"" for their mother. The woman's lawyer told reporters outside court: 'She is his wife and the mother to his children, it's a very regrettable entirely difficult situation, and yes, he stands by his wife.' The woman was given a total sentence of three years and six months .

"Jordan Begley, 23, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000-volt charge from a stun gun when police were called to his home last year . Five police officers want their identities kept secret at an inquest into the death of an innocent man who was shot with a Taser. Police were called to Jordan Begley’s terraced home by his mother during a row with a neighbour last year. But the ice cream factory worker, 23, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000-volt charge from the stun gun. Now a group of officers involved in the tragedy in Gorton, Manchester, have sparked outrage by asking for anonymity when they give evidence at the inquest, which is expected to take place early next year. Critics have warned the case risks damaging public confidence in the police if officers accused of potential wrong-doing are allowed to hide behind a shroud of secrecy. Lawyers representing the five Greater Manchester Police officers have refused to say why they believe their identities should be protected. No information was given during a hearing last month. Firearms officers are usually granted anonymity during court cases and inquests because of the extreme sensitivity of their jobs and fear of reprisals – or in cases involving terrorism or national security. But it would be highly unusual to mask the identities of ordinary officers trained to use Tasers, which are supposed to be non-lethal weapons but have been linked to at least ten deaths since 2004. Coroner Nigel Meadows acknowledged a ‘significant issue regarding the ordinary principles of open justice’ but has granted an interim anonymity order. However, the order is set to be challenged by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, lawyers acting for Mr Begley’s mother Dorothy and news organisations at a pre-inquest hearing taking place as early as this month. James Dipple-Johnstone, the IPCC Commissioner for Greater Manchester, said withholding the names of the GMP officers ‘will not help foster public confidence’. He added: ‘At the end of the independent IPCC investigation, when our work is complete, we hope to publish a report in a transparent way.’ The Begley family are also understood to be pressing for full details of the incident to be made public. Police – some of whom were armed – were called to deal with a disturbance at Mr Begley’s home on the evening of July 10 last year and were initially told he had a knife. Lawyers representing the five Greater Manchester Police officers have refused to say why they believe their identities should be protected. Above, the force's headquarters . He collapsed after being shot with the Taser and was pronounced dead in hospital less than two hours later. Six weeks before the incident, he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests. Police have also vehemently denied claims that Mr Begley was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name. The case has already been referred by GMP to the IPCC, but its findings will not be published until after the inquest. Greater Manchester Police and legal firm Slater and Gordon, which is representing the five officers, declined to comment yesterday. It comes after a former Metropolitan Police marksman charged with murdering a robbery suspect in 2005 was last week named as Anthony Long. Reporting restrictions were lifted because Long has been charged with a crime.

"House price growth has finally peaked and will tail off this winter, new figures show. Halifax said house price inflation appeared to have hit a ceiling over the summer and would continue to slow over the coming months. The lender reported prices grew by 9.6 per cent in the three months to September, compared with the same period a year ago. This compares to 9.7 per cent in August and 10.2 per cent in the three months to July. The mortgage lender said the market ‘may have peaked’ during July’s double-digit rise – the largest since before the economic crisis. House price growth has peaked and will tail off this winter, with prices in some areas now 'unsustainable', according to new figures . Economists said the data suggested prices had hit an affordability ceiling, with prospective buyers ‘baulking’ at the prices being demanded. In parts of London, houses have risen by almost 30 per cent in the last year, pushing home ownership out of reach for millions of people. Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, suggested that such prices may have now become ‘unsustainable’ in the capital. He said: ‘The recent rapid rise in house prices in some parts of the UK, earnings growth that remains below consumer price inflation and the possibility of an interest rate rise over the coming months, appear to have tempered housing demand. ‘A moderation in growth looks likely during the remainder of 2014 and into next year as supply and demand become increasingly better balanced.’ But while prices in London may have become unaffordable, the market could cope with further growth elsewhere in the UK, he said. He said: ‘In parts of London and the south-east, we may have hit a ceiling because that is where we have seen prices rising dramatically. ‘In the rest of the country, we are seeing more solid house price growth, which could be sustainable for longer.’ Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘It is unlikely buyers will be willing or able to accommodate yet another burst of house price inflation, which suggests we are set for a prolonged period of far more subdued house price gains. ‘Potential buyers are baulking at the prices sellers are now demanding’. This graph shows the huge difference in house prices between London and the rest of England and Wales . In August, Halifax, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, found more than half of homeowners believed it would be a good idea to sell within a year. They reported a growing ‘sentiment towards selling’ as people realised the market may have peaked. Jonathan Hudson, founder of West End estate agent Hudsons Property, said: ‘There are now certainly better hopes for buyers out there. ‘No longer are there huge numbers fighting over the same property forcing quick and sometimes rash decisions. ‘For serious buyers looking to get on the ladder, now is the time to buy while the market catches breath.’ The findings came as a report from property website Zoopla found that home owner confidence in the continued growth of UK house prices has fallen to its lowest levels in 15 months. A survey of more than 6,700 home owners for Zoopla found that 88 per cent of people expect property prices to increase in their area in the next six months, falling from 92 per cent three months ago.

"The daughter of a teacher who was killed in the Columbine High School massacre 15 years ago has slammed a new play written from the perspective of the teen killers. Coni Sanders' father Dave Sanders, 47, was gunned down by Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold on April 20, 1999. The duo also killed 12 students at the Colorado school. Ms Sanders, a forensic therapist, has now written a furious op-ed in the New York Post lambasting the decision to allow a play from the killers' perspectives to show off Broadway. Nathaniel Sam Shapiro's play 'The Erlklings' will open at the Beckett Theatre this month. Scroll down for video . Anger: Coni Sanders, left, has written an op-ed lambasting a playwright for his play about the Columbine shootings from the killers' perspectives. Her father, Dave Sanders, right, was shot dead in the massacre . 'I heard he'd written the play several years ago, but thought it was too appalling to ever make it to the stage, let alone to the nation's leading theater district,' she wrote. While she admitted that she admires the playwright's aim to try to understand the killers' psychological states, she questioned how much good it was going to do. 'If Shapiro sought to write a play to raise awareness about America's pervasive gun violence, he should have started by omitting the killers' identities, stripping them of the fame and notoriety they so desperately sought - the same notoriety that so many gunmen before and after Columbine wished to attain,' she wrote. She explained that experts have recommended omitting identities to reduce copycat violence. Killers: Eric Harris, left, and Dylan Klebold, right, shot 13 people at their high school in Colorado in 1999 . Missed: Sanders, a business teacher, was helping students get cover in classrooms when he was shot . 'Many killers idolized the very boys who killed my father, and used their journals and notes to perpetuate their own plans to victimize and murder others - the same materials that Shapiro used to draft his script,' she wrote. Playwright: Nathaniel Sam Shapiro said he thinks 'this is a conversation the country needs to have' She added that Shapiro's play will only be accessible to a 'privileged few' in New York - and therefore will not fulfill its aim of hoping to educate people on gun violence. 'This play will sadly only perpetuate our culture of violence and feed into society's larger fears about mass shootings,' she wrote. Shapiro has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. He has previously been unapologetic about his subject choice. 'I believe that art and especially theater should try and tackle those difficult and troubling subjects,' he told KDVR last month. 'The common perception of [the killers] was largely inaccurate.' New York-born Shapiro, who was nine at the time of the shootings, said he understands that victims' families or friends could find his play distasteful. 'But I think in a larger context this is a conversation this country really needs to have,' he said. He insisted that the play isn't about making money - and will likely make no profit at all - but he simply wants to educate people. 'I would hope audience members could come away from this play with a new perspective and a desire to maybe reach out to individuals who are troubled,' he said. On stage: The play will be on for five weeks at Theatre Row in New York, starting this weekend . Dave Sanders, a popular business teacher, was shot from behind by one of the gunman as he tried to get students safely into classrooms. He managed to get to a science lab but bled to death. He left behind his wife, four children and five grandchildren. Thirteen students were killed in the massacre and more than 20 were injured. The two teenage gunmen, who were said to have been inspired by the Oklahoma Oklahoma City bombing, then took their own lives.","Coni Sanders' father Dave Sanders, a business teacher, was shot dead during Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold's shooting spree in April 1999 .

"Danny Wilson can be found burrowing happily around the corridors of a stand built with the proceeds of Barnsley’s single season with the high rollers in the Premier League. The previous evening had been spent in Kidderminster watching Scunthorpe beat Worcester in an epic FA Cup penalty shootout. The morning had been spent in the squall on the training pitches, beside the academy, behind Oakwell’s North Stand, all funded as part of the £4.5million development which transformed one end of the ground and provides a legacy from one year in the top tier. Danny Wilson is preparing to take charge of his 1,000th league game during a second spell with Barnsley . The Tykes manager's career has seen him in charge of clubs including Sheffields United and Wednesday . Wilson has experienced the full range of emotions from Oakwell supporters . It was Wilson who led Barnsley to promotion in 1996-97 to the soundtrack of delirious supporters who sang: ‘It’s just like watching Brazil.’ It was his first managerial role and much has happened since but it feels like the perfect place to celebrate 1,000 games as a boss. ‘Coming here from Sheffield Wednesday (where he played), I wasn’t embraced by everybody,’ he recalled. ‘There were tough times. We were struggling financially. They had to close three sides of the ground to put in seats and crowds were down to four or five thousand at times. ‘We were 1-0 down at Bromsgrove in an FA Cup-tie with a few minutes to go and defending a corner in front of our own fans and they’re venting their frustration at me. ‘They were chipping bits of stone off the top of a wall and pelting me with it. Then we broke from that corner and equalised. Within a minute, Owen Archdeacon got the winner.’ Wilson is congratulated by his players after winning promotion with Barnsley in 1996-97 . A Barnsley fan plants a kiss on the manager after securing promotion to the Premier League . Wilson took Barnsley to the top division for the first time in their 125-year history . Wilson poses with Sir Alex Ferguson after winning the Managers' Manager of the Year award in 1997 . By the time he returned to Barnsley for a second spell, this time last year, Wilson had adapted to the wild oscillations of managerial life. He went from being stoned to being feted and then hated again when he left to take over back at Wednesday. And so the wheel of fortune turns. ‘You need a mental toughness,’ he said. ‘You need to be resilient. If you’re up and down on every decision or opinion, you won’t last. ‘People say, “Oh, nice guy Wilson”, but they wouldn’t say that if things were going wrong and I was in their faces in the week. You have to have that ruthlessness. That’s what keeps you going. ‘My ambition has never diminished. I still believe I can coach in the Premier League. I’ve always believed that. I want to be at the top. But opportunities up there are rare for British coaches from the lower leagues. Maybe we’re just not sexy enough. That must be it, because we have the ability and the knowledge. It’s one thing I’d like to see change. ‘The way I feel at the moment, I could carry on for the next 10 years. I’m 55 in January. I feel fit as anything but that decision is always in other people’s hands, isn’t it?’ Wilson (left) spent three seasons as a player at Sheffield Wednesday, one of nine clubs he played for . The Barnsley manager wipes a tear from his eye as the Tykes are relegated after one season in the top flight . Wilson returned to the Owls as manager after leaving Barnsley for the first time . More than a steely determination, disguised by a friendly nature, he dedicates his landmark to the support of his wife Karen and children Laurie and Carrie through a career spanning 37 years since joining Bury as a teenager from Wigan, then a non-League club. He has worked almost without interruption through the opinion boom, when managers pray for a year in the job and chairmen are pressurised by vocal minorities on radio phone-ins and social media. ‘We must have lived in 16 different houses in all corners of the country but Karen has never complained. Without that I’d have thought twice,’ said Wilson. ‘You need support, not only from your family but also those you work with. When you are asked for influences, you are expected to pick out a well-known manager who took you under his wing, but I’ve been influenced more by those who have always been close to listen or offer advice. They know who they are.’ As a player he skipped through nine clubs, winning the League Cup twice and 24 caps for Northern Ireland. In that time some big names left a mark. ‘There is one thing I’ve always remembered,’ said Wilson. ‘When I played for Ron Atkinson, he’d say, “When I sit in that stand I want to be entertained. I don’t want to go home after 90 minutes thinking, what was the hell was that?” ‘We’re entertainers. That’s our duty and that’s what we try to do. ‘We want to win — if you don’t it will cost you your job — but if you’re grinding one-nils out every week and you’re s***e, that doesn’t give me any satisfaction. There has to be enjoyment for the fans.’ Barnsley players celebrate after beating Chester 3-0 to set up a FA Cup tie with Middlesbrough . Wilson has listened to Ron Atkinson's advice that entertainment is as important as winning . He recalled the ‘fantastic enthusiasm’ of Chris Cattlin, his manager at Brighton, and few people work with Brian Clough without taking something from the experience. This is the LMA’s official 1,000 Club list: . Len Ashurst, Ron Atkinson, Dave Bassett, Alan Buckley, Sir Matt Busby, Brian Clough, Steve Coppell, Sir Alex Ferguson, Dario Gradi, Roy Hodgson, Brian Horton, Lennie Lawrence, Lawrie McMenemy, Harry Redknapp, Sir Bobby Robson, Joe Royle, Denis Smith, Jim Smith, Alec Stock, Graham Taylor, Graham Turner, Neil Warnock, Arsene Wenger. Wilson, who joined Nottingham Forest for £150,000 in 1983, said: ‘Chesterfield were desperate for £70,000, so Cloughie asked on the quiet if any of the excess money would go on the team. When he found out it wouldn’t, he threw a couple of players into the deal: Calvin Plummer and Steve Kendal. That’s how he was. ‘I had only a short spell with him but I’m very proud that he thought I could contribute to his team. He was fascinating. I couldn’t take my eyes off him. When he spoke, you listened to every word and took it on board. “Hello, well done”, and that was me sky-high for a week. ‘You want to be successful, of course. There have been times when I’ve won promotions and it’s great to find players and see them develop like Charlie Austin (QPR striker signed by Wilson at Swindon) but that’s not always what comes to mind when you reflect. It’s your connections with different clubs and their fans, and people you meet and work with. ‘There’s not one club I regret going to. MK Dons were playing in the hockey stadium and it was the worst ground I’ve ever been to. There was no atmosphere, hardly any fans, but Pete Winkelman’s dream was there. No money, just a dream. ‘Irrespective of whether you think it’s right or wrong, it’s one of the best things that’s happened to Milton Keynes.’ Barnsley will face Legue One opponents Leyton Orient in Wilson's 1,000th game as a manager . Wilson’s return to Barnsley was met with mixed feelings. He was unable to prevent relegation in May and consistency has eluded them as they approach Saturday's League One fixture against Leyton Orient. ‘You can’t always go out in the public domain and say, “If we finish fifth bottom we’ll be all right”,’ he said. ‘What does that give the fans to look forward to? You have to be as bullish as you can but realistically, in the next two or three years, we’d like to be in the Championship again. ‘Whether I’m part of it, I don’t know. I’d never look that far forward. Are they capable of doing it? Yes, but maybe not this season, although this league is tight. ‘If we get there, can we sustain it and stay up? Yes, I think we would because we have an owner who would back us, but everything is more realistic at this club than it has been.’","Danny Wilson will take charge of 1,000th game during his second spell with League One club Barnsley .

Commanding Officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alison McCourt, of 22 Field Hospital which is based at Normandy Barracks in Aldershot, said her troops want to help provide a safe environment for medics. 'We need to provide sufficient reassurance to healthcare workers that will encourage them to come and help defeat this disease,' said Lt Col McCourt. Before setting off the army personnel, who will be based at Kerrytown, around 30 miles from the capital, Freetown, had nine days of intensive training in treating those affected with the disease, which has killed more than 4,000 people. Lt Col McCourt said: 'This unit has been the 'Vanguard' medical regiment for the past 20 months which means we are on high readiness to deploy at short notice to anywhere in the world - although this is a bit different and provides us with a challenge we are perfectly suited to this kind of task. 'I firmly believe we can make a significant difference and it will be professionally rewarding for those taking part.' The medics will staff a field hospital in Sierra Leone established specifically to treat other doctors, nurses and health workers who have caught the disease. Pictured here  training . A health worker uses a thermometer on a man outside government buildings in Freetown, Sierra Leone . This woman was so overcome by grief after a death in their family in Waterloo, some 30 kilometres south-east of Freetown, Sierra Leone, she fainted while her relative had to be held . They have been undergoing an extensive training exercise in preparation for their deployment to West Africa. As part of the training they have been wearing full protective suits, treating simulated casualties in make-up. The exercise at Strensall Barracks, York, saw a hangar converted into a mock-up field hospital. It is part of Britain's wider response which will see a medical ship deployed to tackle Ebola in West Africa. A team of 750 military personnel will reach Sierra Leone by November, with a Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship leaving Falmouth Docks in Cornwall on Friday. RFA Argus will set sail at high water, loaded with three Merlin helicopters and a crew of around 350, including 80 medics and 80 Royal Marines. Strict rules to keep the ship ‘sterile’ from Ebola include banning personnel from going ashore on leave during up to three months of deployment.

Royal Marines who leave the RFA Argus for operations in the local community will go through a decontamination process upon their return. Medics will take their temperatures twice a day and anyone who shows signs of Ebola will be flown to a British treatment clinic in Kerry Town. Yesterday Ebola survivor and volunteer nurse Will Pooley said he is preparing to go back to west Africa to help deal with the epidemic because it is 'something I need to do'. The 29-year-old, from Eyke in Suffolk, said he knows that his family and friends will be worried but stressed that there was an urgent need for strong medical support to tackle the virus.","92 doctors, nurses and consultants will treat other medics who have Ebola .

"A task force has been formed to investigate the disappearance of three girls  in the same area of Connecticut 40 years ago. Thirteen-year-old Debra Spickler of Mystic disappeared in 1968, while walking to a swimming pool in Vernon. Janice Pockett was 7 when she was last seen riding her bicycle in nearby Tolland in July 1973. And, 13-year-old Lisa White was last seen walking near a Vernon park on November 1, 1974. Now, more than 40 years later with no leads on any of them, police have decided to reopen the cases - insisting they are 'certain' somebody has information that will solve them. Search: Police have reopened the search into the disappearances of 13-year-olds Debra Spickler (left) and Lisa White (right) who went missing within six years of each other in the same area of Connecticut 40 years ago . Missing: This is a reward poster issued the year Janice Pockett, then aged seven, went missing . 'This is huge, because I truly believe that there is somebody out there who knows something,' said Aprille Falletti of Ellington, who was 10 years old when her sister, Lisa White, disappeared. Vernon Police Lt. William Meier said part of the task force's job will be to determine if the girls' disappearances are linked and if the investigation should be expanded to include other missing persons cases from the area. The task force also will try to solve the mystery surrounding skeletal remains that were found in Vernon last year. The discovery sparked renewed interest in the missing girls before tests determined they belonged to a woman in her 40s or 50s. 'We have to care about our people; we especially have to care about little girls who are lost and their families,' said Chief State's Attorney Kevin Kane. 'We owe it to them to do our best and take another crack at these cases.' The state is offering $150,000 in rewards for the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the girls' disappearance. 'Extensive investigations have been conducted already, which include thousands of pages of police reports and supporting documents,' Meier said. 'However, with modern advances in technology and police procedures, we are hoping that a fresh look at these cases will produce new leads.' Never stop looking: Pockett's sister, who is now 47, said there have been many leads over the years . The team is made up of investigators from state and local police and the state attorney's office. Former state police Detective Michael Foley, who investigated one of the cases as a member of the Eastern District Crime Squad, has been hired as a consultant. Pockett's sister, 47-year-old Mary Engelbrecht of Manchester, said there have been many leads over the years, including the confession of a carnival worker, Charles Pierce, who was convicted of killing a 13-year-old girl in Massachusetts in 1969. Pierce, who died in prison in 1999, claimed he had killed several children, including Pockett, but was never charged. A 1980 search of an area where he claimed to have dumped Pockett's body turned up nothing. 'A day doesn't go by when I don't think about my sister and it can be overwhelming sometimes,' Engelbrecht said. 'But I do have hope that her case can be solved and we can get some answers.'

"Lisa Flynt, daughter of Hustler Publisher Larry Flynt (pictured above in April 2013), is in critical condition after a Friday car accident. The daughter of controversial Hustler Publisher Larry Flynt is currently in critical condition after a car crash Friday evening. Lisa Kay Flynt, 47, left a local bar with 24-year-old friend Cierra Mallory before 5pm when she  swerved in front of a semitrailer and rolled her Oldsmobile on Valley Pike in Riverside, Ohio. The Huber Heights resident was ejected from the vehicle in the crash, and rushed to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Riverside Police said . On Saturday, police executed a search at the bar where Flynt and Mallory had just left before the crash. Malley was taken to the hospital after the accident as well where she was released after receiving treatment. Ms Flynt is one of 71-year-old Flynt's five children. Her younger brother Larry Flynt Jr, 41, drove to Dayton from his home in Columbus on Saturday to visit her in the hospital. He told WPXI that doctors are trying to determine the extent of cranial injuries. Larry Flynt Sr, 71, is the publisher of Hustler and the chairman of a large adult entertainment empire. However, he is best known for being part of the landmark Supreme Court Case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Flynt's magazine was sued by Evangelist Jerry Falwell after they published an ad which joked about the first time Falwell had sex. Falwell tried suing the magazine, but the Supreme Court ruled that since he was a famous person, he couldn't receive damages for emotional distress - strengthening the First Amendment right to free speech. The story about the infamous legal battle was turned into a movie called The People vs. Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson as the pornographer. Two Riverside, Ohio police officers stand near Ms Flynt's crashed Oldsmobile sedan. It's believed she was driving away from a bar at the time of the crash . On Sunday, Ms Flynt was listed in a critical condition at Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. Her brother Larry Flynt, Jr drove there from his home in Columbus on Saturday to visit her .

"Thrifty consumers with an eye for a bargain can score a pair of jeans for as little as seven dollars. Australia’s leading retailers such as Big W, Kmart and Target have all engaged in a mighty battle to offer the cheapest denim at rock-bottom prices. But how are these three major discount giants able to make and sell jeans so cheaply? Scroll down for video . Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran put the cheap jeans to the test. Pictured from left to right: Kmart Classic Jeans $7, Target Everyday Jeans $10 and Big W Emerson Jeans $7 . A Target Spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that customers can buy a pair of jeans 'safe in the knowledge that they've been produced in an ethically sustainable manner'. 'Our $10 jeans are produced by a single factory in China, which has been audited to meet all our ethical sourcing requirements around worker pay, safety and conditions,' he said. 'Placing large order volumes with a single factory means the supplier benefits from economies of scale, and can give our customers a great quality product at a terrific price, without compromising Target’s ethical sourcing standards.' Kmart's classic jeans are on special for $7 after a price drop from $8 on July 13th 2014 . Big W's Emerson jeans $7 offer a slight kick at the ankle, yet fitted through the hip and thigh . Target were the most expensive of the three retailers, with a price tag of $10 . Daily Mail Australia contacted Kmart and Big W for comment but they have not yet responded. Fashion expert Stephanie Cunningham, from Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia that the seven dollar jeans are of low quality and a representation of wasteful 'fast fashion'. 'They will not last long and you get what you pay for,' she said. 'The idea of ‘fast fashion’ is that the product will only last a short amount of time, sending you back to buy their cheap jeans over and over again. 'In the long run you may end up spending more money on lots of cheap jeans, compared to buying two pairs of more expensive high quality jeans. 'If the jeans are made in Australia, they are more likely to be a higher price due to higher wages, but it is also easier to monitor quality. Overseas, it varies greatly, depending on company standards.' Daily Mail reporter Cindy Tran found the Kmart Classic Jeans $7 offered the perfect fit and were the most comfortable to wear . Daily Mail reporter Cindy Tran found Target's Everyday jeans $10 offered a good fit and a versatile style that work any time of the year . Daily Mail reporter Cindy Tran found Big W's Emerson jeans $7 fitted from the waist to the knees before breaking into a slight flare for a balanced, feminine profile . Fashion designer Betty Tran, from Western Australia, told Daily Mail Australia that consumers should do more research. 'People need to be careful about the quality because you don't know if it's going to damage your health,' she said. 'We don't know what's going through in the process and how the dye is being treated. 'I know it's hard to find things made in Australia but if dye starts coming off after you soak your clothes in a bucket of water - you know it's not really good for you. 'It's important that consumers be active and ask questions from their retailers and know where they're made from before purchasing.' Every woman needs that perfect-fitting pair of jeans and it goes without saying that being comfortable in your jeans is the most important thing. But when it comes to cheap jeans costing from $7, which pair should you settle on? Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran put the cheap jeans to the test. Kmart Classic Jeans $7 . Kmart ticked all the boxes and were the best pair of jeans out of all three retailers. I was surprised at how amazing they felt. They offer the perfect fit and sit well from my waist down to my legs. They're probably by far one of the most comfortable jeans I've ever worn and it made my legs look and feel slim plus the material was gentle on the skin. They're definitely a pair that would go well with everything and a must-have for your wardrobe. Target Everyday Jeans $10 . Target were the most expensive and offer a good fit and a versatile style that work any time of the year. I did find them a bit  tight around my knees because they sit so snugly around my legs. But you can't go wrong with a pair of $10 jeans and they got my vote for the best coloured denim out of the three. Big W Emerson Jeans $7 . Big W's jeans were my least favourite. They fit from the waist to the knees then break into a slight flare for a balanced, feminine profile, which is great for that chic 70s look. But they made my legs look and feel wider. A Current Affair tested the durability of all three jeans by putting them through 10 cycles in the washing machine. Look Smart Alteration tailor Rabie Mtanos, from Bondi Junction, told A Current Affair that a slight colour fade and some shrinkage was found on the Big W pair. Target jeans shrunk a lot more but kept their colour the best. While the Kmart pair had obvious results - they faded slightly, as well as shrinking after 10 washes. Oxfam spokeswoman Kelly Dent told Daily Mail Australia that consumers need to ask themselves whether workers are paid enough to produce garments this cheap. ‘It’s concerning to see garments at such a low price. It’s not the prices that we should be worried about but it’s whether these companies are respecting workers' rights, conditions and their safety,' she told Daily Mail Australia. ‘If you look at a country like Cambodia, 33 percent of their workers are malnourished because they’re not paid enough to live on and can’t eat properly. ‘I’m not talking about an extravagant lifestyle but how can these workers afford a roof over their head, nutrient foods, as well as small savings for weddings, funerals and even a holiday. ‘It doesn’t necessarily mean that when we pay $80 for a pair of jeans that workers are paid more but when it comes to $7, the chances of exploitation do increase.’ Kmart ticked all the boxes for the best and cheapest pair of jeans out of all three retailers, according to Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran . Target Australia has published a list of its supplier factories in Bangladesh to ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories . Big W's Emerson Jeans offers a great chic 70s look, with a slight flare for a balanced, feminine profile, according to Daily Mail Australia reporter Cindy Tran . Ms Dent said the minimum wage in Cambodia is $100 per month but the living wage is $450. ‘Just recently, there was a striking protest from these garment workers who wanted an increase to $170 per month but it’s still not enough to live on. ‘Consumers who ask themselves “can I make a difference?” need to know that they should never doubt if they can make an impact on people because companies do listen.' K-mart, Big W and Target have signed up to the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety to ensure that all garment factories in Bangladesh are safe. The accord  was established in 2013 after the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh collapsed in April last year, killing more than 1100 workers. ‘These are all small steps and they lead to results but more needs to be done,’ Ms Dent said. The Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety was established in 2013 after the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh collapsed last year, killing more than 1100 workers . K-mart, Big W and Target have signed up to the accord to ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories . Target Australia has also released a statement that the list will ensure transparency and safe working conditions in its overseas supplier factories. Target Managing Director Stuart Machin said supply chain transparency was key to Target’s commitment to improving working conditions and safety standards in Bangladesh and other sourcing countries. ‘We have a responsibility to ensure that everyone who works for our business, whether directly or indirectly is safe in their workplace,’ Mr Machin said. ‘This is also a key concern for our customers who want to know that the products they purchase from Target are sourced and produced ethically.’ Target was one of the first Australian retailers to sign the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, and also one of the first Australian retailers to publicly commit to publishing details of its factory suppliers. ‘We hope that our presence in Bangladesh and other developing countries can be a catalyst for improving the lives of workers,’ Mr Machin said.","Australia’s leading retailers such as Big W, Kmart and Target have all engaged in a mighty war battle to offer jeans from $7 .

"Women can now instantly find out where to get a gorgeous outfit they've spotted, thanks to a new app. The so-called Inspo tool can identify designer jewellery, handbags and clothing by matching a photograph with a huge database of items. It scans the clothing a user has just seen on somebody else, and pairs it with the exact or closest matches. Inspo scans the clothing, and presents a link to an online store where it can be bought . The free app then presents a link to the online store(s) where the user can get connected to purchase it if they wish. The company behind the project currently has a database of around 10,000,000 products and links to over 600 online shops. Inventor of the app Yvonne Tesch, 34, from Berlin, who has a team of 20 staff constantly updating and developing it, said it was being given away as a free app for mobile phones and tablets. She said: 'We get paid every time a user clicks on a product and the online stores give us between 10 percent and 30 percent of each sale.' Yvonne Tesch, 34, (r) is the inventor of the app (l) It also works not just for real-life people spotted walking down the street, but also for photographs seen in magazines or even paintings.

"Dozens of loaded firearms, inert military grenades, a mobile phone disguised as a stun gun and a tiny lipstick knife were among the prohibited items seized from travellers at US airports last month. In the latest round-up on its blog, the Transportation Security Administration announced that it had confiscated 196 guns at security checkpoints in October. Almost all of the firearms - 171 in total - were loaded and over a dozen had rounds chambered. Nearly 200 guns were seized from travellers at security checkpoints at US airports in October, the TSA says . Packing heat: Of those seized, 171 were loaded and over a dozen had rounds chambered . Virtually all cases involve a pistol-packing passenger who had no ill intent and forgot to remove the firearm from their hand luggage before it was submitted for screening. But even forgetful passengers risk being arrested and assessed a penalty of $7,500 (nearly £5,000). In addition to guns, TSA agents continue to find inert or replica grenades and other weaponry in passengers’ luggage on a weekly basis, despite repeated warnings. Last week alone they seized ammunition, a cane sword, a box cutter blade concealed in the lining of a carry-on bag in Boston, 16 stun guns and four inert or realistic replica grenades at airports in Atlanta, New Orleans, Des Moines, Iowa, and Springfield, Missouri. Confiscated: TSA officers say they continue to find inert and replica grenades in passengers' luggage . A 13-inch cane sword was found in a passenger's luggage at Charlotte Douglas International Airport . A passenger attempted to board a plane in Honolulu with a military training kit, including inert C-4 explosives . TSA officers intercepted an unloaded cannon barrel at Kahului Airport in Hawaii . And it appears many travellers are unaware that novelty items that look like bombs or grenades are also prohibited. The discovery of such items can lead to significant delays because bomb experts must be brought in to make sure the objects do not pose a threat. Earlier this month a passenger at Honolulu’s airport checked a bag containing a military training kit with inert C-4 explosives, blasting caps, detonators and a detonating cord. The airport’s baggage room had to be evacuated while bomb experts inspected the kit, resulting in a delay for screening. One of the more unusual items to be discovered by TSA officers was an unloaded cannon barrel at Kahului Airport in Hawaii. Last week, 34 of 41 guns seized at American airports were loaded, according to the TSA . A lipstick knife was discovered in luggage at Detroit Metro Airport . Shocking: TSA officers seized a stun gun that was disguised as a mobile phone . A collection of knives seized at US airports in October . In its blog, the TSA urged passengers to leave the items at home to avoid being arrested or causing delays. The government agency said: ‘Just because we find a prohibited item on an individual does not mean they had bad intentions, that's for the law enforcement officer to decide. 'In many cases, people simply forgot they had these items.'","Transportation Security Administration says it seized 196 guns last month .

"Tragedy:  Clare Munro, 47, died from 'serious injuries' in her home in Cheshire . A 47-year-old mother-of-three has died from 'serious injuries', believed to have been sustained in her home in a leafy Cheshire village. Police have launched a murder investigation after the body of Clare Munro was found in a property in Culcheth, north-east of Warrington, shortly before 3pm on Sunday. The death of Ms Munro, a childminder, has shocked the quiet village, where neighbours described her house as 'a hub for the local community'. A 50-year-old man is currently being held in custody on suspicion of murder while the address on the quiet suburban street remains cordoned off by police. Today, shocked neighbours paid tribute to the mother-of-three and described her as being well known and instrumental to the local community. Geoff Pickin, 69, who has lived in the street for 17 years, said: 'I was on the phone when I saw a load of police cars turn up. 'All in all there were nine police cars and three ambulances. 'The next thing a man was being taken out of the house in handcuffs. 'Clare's daughter came out of the house with police and it looked like she had blood on her shirt - it was horrific. 'It must have been a terrifying experience for the children. 'Clare was a very nice and pleasant lady - I'd often see her walking up and down the street. 'She was a child minder and did a lot of dog walking so there was always a lot of people with her. 'I've lived here for 17 years and I've never seen anything like this - it's the most shocking thing I've seen in all my life.' A spokesman for Cheshire Police said officers were called to the address shortly before 3pm on Sunday. Mrs Munro was alive when police arrived, but had sustained serious injuries and died at the scene. The spokesman said Cheshire Police have launched a murder investigation and that a 50-year-old man remains in custody in connection with the investigation. Mrs Munro is believed to have shared her home with her three children. It is not known if her husband lived at the address.

'Clare was a lovely lady and very well known in the local area she did a lot of dog walking, we used to talk to them a lot. 'They have arranged a lot of community events since they moved here around 10 years ago and everyone spoke highly of her and husband. 'And they were instrumental in organising a community party for the diamond jubilee in June 2012. 'It is a very quiet area and this is a desirable street to live on. You don't expect something like this happen in an area like this. 'Clare's house was a hub for the local community - she will be sorely missed by everyone that knew her.

"Mother-of-three Sarah Mallon, 38, stole £7,000 from her grandparents' savings and spent it on Xbox games, takeaway pizza and a holiday . A Ministry of Defence security guard stole £7,000 from her grandparents' savings and spent it on Xbox games, takeaway pizza and a holiday. Mother-of-three Sarah Mallon, 38, funded her gaming habit with her grandparents' money after they gave her access to their bank account so she could run errands. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years, after admitting fraud by false representation at Portsmouth Crown Court. Mallon's grandparents, Margaret and Peter Cantrill, had brought her up as their own child in Clanfield near Waterlooville, Hampshire. But she ran into financial difficulty after splitting up with her partner and became homeless for four months. She started taking their cash and even accepted a £600 loan from them so she could buy a car. The security guard spent £7,000 over 100 separate transactions online at websites like bookmaker Ladbrokes and retail giant Amazon between August 2012 and October 2013. Her solicitor, Anne Brown, said Mallon had taken to online gambling in the hope of winning the money back and that she was horrified when she found out the total. Banking records revealed she spent as little as 15 pounds on takeaway pizzas but she also funded a holiday with their money, the court heard. The thefts only to came to light when grandfather Peter died, aged 89, prompting other family members to look at the bank account. Tammy Mears, prosecuting, said: 'The money was spent on things they had not even heard of. Mrs Cantrill said she does not even know what an Xbox is.' Recorder Andrew Maitland said: 'There are few offences more abhorrent in these courts than where a member of a family has abused the trust and love given from an ageing relative. 'The one thing that convinces me against custody is the product of your offending had the ability of breaking up your family with catastrophic results. 'You have put at risk, through your actions repeatedly over an extended period of time, the whole family that in the past you have struggled to keep together.' The security guard spent the money on Xbox games, takeaway pizza, betting websites and a holiday . Mallon's grandparents, both in their 80s, were living on teachers' pensions. Mr Cantrill also had two pensions from his time serving in the army and the Royal Navy when the thefts took place. The transactions pushed them into their overdraft, something that had never previously happened.","Sarah Mallon, 38, funded her gaming  habit with her grandparents' money .

"British soldiers will continue to patrol with Afghan troops – even though Nato has scaled back joint missions following a series of deadly attacks by rogue soldiers and policemen. The recent spate of ‘green on blue’ killings – in which allied troops are killed by the Afghan soldiers they are training – has prompted Nato commanders to reduce the number of joint patrols. But Defence Secretary Philip Hammond insisted the announcement by the International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) would have ‘minimal’ impact on operations by UK forces. Scroll down for video . Tributes: Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province . He appeared to have been unaware of . the change – and was hauled to the Commons to explain why he had briefed . MPs a day earlier that there would be no change in strategy. Rogue security forces have killed 51 . coalition troops this year – including nine British servicemen, a . quarter of the 35 killed in 2012. On Saturday, father-of-two Sergeant . Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Tom Wroe, 18, both of the 3rd Battalion . the Yorkshire Regiment, were murdered by an Afghan policeman at a . checkpoint in Nahr-e Saraj. Labour MP Denis MacShane, left, today sought to force Mr Hammond to appear before MPs and answer an urgent question about the decision to scale back Nato joint patrols with Afghan soldiers . IUS General John Allen said only large . strike operations will now be conducted jointly, with smaller patrols . evaluated on a case-by-case basis by a senior regional commander. Isaf said the measure was ‘prudent, but temporary, to reduce our profile and vulnerability to insider attacks’. But Mr Hammond appeared to be . blind-sided by the announcement and was dragged before the Commons to . clarify the UK’s approach to mentoring and training. He was only . informed of the shift in a video conference with military chiefs on . Monday afternoon – fuelling concerns that the policy of training Afghan . forces was in chaos. Speaking to the Commons yesterday, Mr . Hammond insisted there was ‘no significant change’ for British troops. He said they would continue to train, mentor and fight alongside Afghan . soldiers and policemen in small groups after approval had come from US . Major General Mark Gurganus, the commander in charge of Helmand. He added: ‘There is no change of . strategy. We will continue routinely in Task Force Helmand to partner at . lower levels. 'The United States have never, or not in recent years, . routinely partnered at levels below the battalion. 'So there is no . practical impact on operations.’ But elsewhere in Afghanistan, commanders suspended all joint operations except large ones involving more than 800 troops. Killed: Sgt Bradley Atwell, 27, left, and . Christopher Raible, 40, were the two Marines killed in an insurgent . attack on Afghanistan's Camp Bastion on Friday . It raised fresh questions why smaller . groups of British servicemen and women were being placed at greater risk . by living and working shoulder-to-shoulder with the Afghan army and . police. The latest decision strikes at the heart of Nato’s exit . strategy. The main justification for troops . being in Afghanistan is the training of Afghan security forces to handle . the situation once UK forces withdraw in 2014. But the policy has been . fraught with danger as the Taliban has encouraged recruits to kill their . international mentors. Anger among Afghans has been fuelled . by the recent anti-Islam film in the US. Mr Hammond admitted the stream . of ‘green on blue’ attacks were ‘sapping’ morale. ‘That is why we are . determined to solve this problem, to nip this trend in the bud and make . sure we get on top of this,’ he said. Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy . said: ‘It does appear to be a really significant change in the . relationship between UK, Isaf and Afghan forces. ‘If the approach is we won’t . automatically partner smaller Afghan forces at company level on a . routine basis, what impact will this have on training of individual . Afghan recruits by UK forces?’ Tory MP John Baron, who called the . urgent debate, said Isaf’s announcement ‘threatened to blow a hole’ in . Britain’s exit strategy. Labour MP Paul Flynn Labour was . suspended from the Commons for accusing defence ministers of lying. alling for an immediate withdrawal of UK troops, he said: ‘The role of . our brave soldiers at the moment is to act as human shields for . ministers’ reputations. Dangerous: A protest in Kabul over the film that mocks the Prophet Muhammad turned violent Monday, with hundreds of men torching tires, cars and shipping containers and lobbing rocks at a U.S. base on the edge of the capital . Injured: More than 20 police officers were injured by rocks before the protesters were finally dispersed by officers shooting in the air . 'Isn’t this very similar to the end of the First . World War, when it was said that politicians lied and soldiers died and . the reality was, as it is now, that our brave soldier lions are being . led by ministerial donkeys.’ Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former colonel, . said: ‘I would say totally scale it back so that none of our troops are . mentoring anyone below battalion level. ‘We’ve had more deaths this year from . that revolting phrase “green on blue”. It’s called murder, murder by . people who are meant to be our friends. Enough is enough. We should get . our troops out as fast as possible.’ Looking ahead: U.S. soldiers from the 4th Brigade, 82nd Airborne arrive to a yard where they will turn in their vehicles and equipment as part of drawdown of 23,000 U.S. troops by Sept. 30 .

"Tristram Hunt, Labour education spokesman . Labour was accused of hypocrisy last night after attempting to redefine itself as the party of the family. Tristram Hunt, the party’s education spokesman, said Labour needed to lose its ‘fear of the “F” word’ and talk more about the importance of ‘bonds and relationships’. Rather than allowing the Tories to dominate the subject, he said Labour had to ‘shed its leftist qualms’ about appearing patronising when tackling dysfunctional families. Mr Hunt criticised Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s governments for not doing enough through the tax and benefit system to help families stay together. Tory backbenchers said no one would believe Labour’s volte-face because many of its welfare policies while in power had made the position of married couples worse. They poured scorn on Mr Hunt’s intervention, pointing out that his party still opposes the Tories’ marriage tax break. In an interview with The Independent, Mr Hunt said Labour needed to change its tune on the family if it wanted to tackle the problem of social immobility. He confirmed that Labour would keep David Cameron’s Troubled Families Programme, which intervenes in families with problems such as anti-social behaviour, worklessness and truancy. The former TV historian admitted that previous Labour administrations had relied too much on transferring money to disadvantaged households through tax credits, and suggested it had shied away from talking about the importance of stable relationships because of qualms about dictating family structures. Mr Hunt said: ‘We’re talking to Labour colleagues about shedding any vestige of fear about talking about the importance and significance of the family, and how important stable relationships and stable parenting environments are for children’s attainment. ‘We shouldn’t let the Right and the Conservatives have that. There has been a fear of the “F” word and I think the balance is to say that families do take different forms and it’s really, really important that we focus on quality of relationships and what breakdown means as barriers for children succeeding. ‘It is important from the position of shadow secretary of state to stress just how significant nurture, attachment, parenting and support for the family as a vital component of social mobility and educational attainment is going to be for the next Labour government and shedding any leftist qualms about how significant and valuable the family is.’ Mr Hunt criticised Tony Blair (right) and Gordon Brown (left)’s administrations for not doing enough through the tax and benefit system to help families stay together . Mr Hunt said Labour had to ‘reflect upon’ academic evidence which shows that supporting families is not just a matter of giving them benefits. ‘Too much of the Labour project was closely associated just with fiscal transfers rather than stressing the importance of bonds and attachments and relationships and the broader cultural importance and value,’ he said. ‘This wasn’t often stressed as much as it could have been.’ He added: ‘These families are troubled, and it’s multiple levels of trouble, and it would not be solved by more tax credits. We don’t have the money for that and we know the limitations of that project.’ Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘Words are cheap, but it’s action that counts. If you look at their record during 13 years in power, you see that they did nothing to bring families together. ‘These words are just Labour propaganda with six months to go till the election. ‘People will think it’s ludicrous. No one is going to believe Labour on this. They’re opposed to the marriage tax allowance, and they did nothing but sign cheques for disadvantaged families when they were in charge. ‘Hypocrisy and Labour seem to go hand in hand.’ A source at the Department for Education said: ‘Families will not be lectured by Tristram Hunt. The last Labour government ruined the economy, adding pressure on families up and down the country. Families know that is what they will do again if they get a chance.’","Tristram Hunt said Labour must talk about importance of 'relationships'

"A catholic school in Edmonton, Canada is investigating the 'unprovoked' beating of a six-year-old boy by a fellow classmate that left him bloodied and bandaged. Joshua Goulet, 6, is afraid to go to school or go to sleep by himself after one of his classmates attacked him on the bus home from St. Maria Goretti School on Friday even while an adult was present. 'He was repeatedly punched. He was kicked. And his head was banged against the bus window until finally it was banged hard enough that it caused a cut in the back of his head, and he bled quite badly,' said the horrified boy's mother Sheila Goulet to Global News. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Victim: Joshua Goulet, 6, was attacked by a fellow classmate while he was on the bus home from school . Badly beaten: Joshua Goulet was bandaged by the school bus driver who had to pull over and administer first aid after Joshua was beaten up by a fellow classmate . The bus was delayed for 35 minutes and neither Sheila Goulet nor her husband knew what was taking so long for their boy to come home from school. The bus was later than usual because the bus driver had to pull over to administer first aid. 'He punched me in the face, punched me on the mouth, he kicked me in the face, then he whacked my head,' Joshua told Global News. A manager from the bus company, First Student, met the parents at the bus stop to explain what had happened to their child. Goulet didn't hear from the school until 5 p.m. The boy who attacked Joshua has been suspended for a week and is not allowed back on the school bus. Both of the boys are in the first grade but they are not in the same class. The attack is thought to have been completely unprovoked and the bus company is trying to decide how to provide better safety on the bus. 'I’m not sure how they’re going to do that,' Sheila Goulet admitted. 'Do we need to put supervisors on the buses? The bus drivers have to be able to drive.' The Bus Company has said they will review their policy to make sure students re safe on the bus. 'The safety and security of the students we transport is our top priority at First Student. We were able to determine that this is a matter of student conduct. Our driver responded in accordance with the policies set forth by First Student and the school district,' said the company. The boy's mother has said she doesn't blame the bus company and that they did everything right but that perhaps there also need to be supervisors on the bus to ensure the safety of children.

"A mother-of-nine who claimed £38,000 in benefits and demanded a bigger council house has had twins, adding an extra £1,400 to her taxpayer-funded income. Cheryl Prudham, 32, gave birth to Lacey-May and Lexi-Rose seven weeks ago, and was given a £200,000 five-bed council house to make room for her 10th and 11th children. Mrs Prudham now has five children with her husband, Robert, and six more from previous relationships. Scroll down for video . Mrs Prudham has previously admitted that her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception . One of the . family's neighbours in Gravesend, Kent, said: 'It's disgraceful how they . keep having children and expect taxpayers to foot the bill. 'Hard-working families struggle and only have a couple of kids because they can't afford any more. 'No doubt their new house will be too small now,' they told the Sun. Speaking . when she was pregnant with the twins, Mrs Prudham said she would 'not . be made to feel guilty' for having children as she and her husband both . work part-time. They claimed £38,000 in benefits last year, but the extra child benefit will take the figure much nearer to £40,000. She also admitted her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception. Mrs Prudham's nine older children are: George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, Madison, five, Leon, four, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one . Before the twins were born, the Prudhams had Leon, four, Lenny, two, and Lainey, one. Mrs Prudham also has George, 14, Jack, 13, Caitlin, nine, Maisie, eight, Millie, six, and Madison, five, from former boyfriends. Speaking after her bid for a new house last year, she said: 'In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me. 'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it. 'I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.' And she admitted: 'I was surprised by the cost of our kids in the end.' The couple both started working 20 hours per week a week as carers before the baby is born. Neither pays any income tax because their earnings fall below the minimum threshold - earning them just under £1,400 a month. They then receive £400 child tax credits, topped up by £70 working tax credits, and their £123 a week rent is footed by the council. They already reportedly receive £7,326 a year in child benefit. Andy Silvester, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'There has to be a point where the state stops paying for people's children.' Last night the Prudhams refused to comment.","Cheryl Prudham has given birth to twins - her 10th and 11th children .

"Thomas Eric Duncan was remembered Saturday as a big-hearted and compassionate man whose virtues may have led to his infection with Ebola in his native Liberia and subsequent death as the first victim of the disease in the United States. Family and friends gathered at a small Southern Baptist church with a primarily Liberian flock near where Duncan's mother and other family members live. Duncan's neighbors in Liberia believe he was infected by helping a pregnant woman who later died from Ebola. It was unclear if he knew about her diagnosis before traveling to the United States. Duncan denied helping his Ebola-sickened neighbor, but it would be consistent with the caring nature he always showed, said his nephew Josephus Weeks of nearby Kannapolis. Scroll down for video . Overcome: Garteh Korkoryah, mother of Thomas Eric Duncan, has her tears wiped by her great-grandson Josephus Weeks III at a memorial service for her son on Saturday in Salisbury, North Carolina . Heartache: Garteh Korkoryah is comforted during a memorial service for her son, who died from Ebola in Dallas on October 8 . Grieving: Thomas Eric Duncan was suspected of contracting the disease while helping a pregnant woman in Liberia . In Memoriam: Josephus Weeks, nephew of Thomas Eric Duncan, speaks during a memorial service for Duncan on Saturday, October 18, 2014 . 'He cared for everybody, it doesn't matter who you were': Josephus Weeks remembers his uncle, Thomas Eric Duncan, during the funeral on Saturday . 'There's no doubt in my mind that what's described in the news is something that Eric would do,' said Weeks, who like Duncan is 42 and grew up in the same households as his uncle. 'Eric would have been out there and helped that woman. 'And he would have done everything that he needed to do for that woman to make sure she was fine.' Retired United Methodist bishop Arthur Kulah said Duncan attended a high school the cleric helped establish in neighboring Ivory Coast for refugees from the Liberian civil war that raged through the 1990s. To generate much-needed income, Duncan jury-rigged a telephone connection allowing fellow refugees to contact family abroad for help, Kulah said. 'People would go there without any money and appeal to him, and he was willing to give them time to talk to their people. There were some people who paid and some people who didn't pay,' Kulah said. 'He was such a compassionate young man, respectful young man.' About 40 friends and family members — many women wearing colorful headscarves — collected inside the 100-seat church and listened as speakers remembered Duncan accompanied by an electric piano and bongos. His weeping mother sat in the front row. Weeks' 3-year-old son dabbed at the elderly woman's teary eyes with a tissue. Deceased: Thomas Eric Duncan, the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the U.S., died in Dallas on October 8 after unknowingly contracting the virus in Liberia . Duncan left Ivory Coast and learned auto mechanics and welding at a United Nations school for refugees in Ghana, relatives said. He came to the United States hoping to work multiple jobs, save money and build a future, said his relative, Harry Korkoya of Woodbridge, Virginia.

Weeks remembered the Duncan he last saw 22 years ago as an athletic youth who was their neighborhood's best at soccer played with a tennis ball, the only kind available. He drove motorcycles so fast it scared Weeks, and named their pet dog Superstar to reflect the pride he had in the animal. Duncan commonly gave away money, then asked Weeks for a loan, he said. 'He cared for everybody, it doesn't matter who you were. If he was driving he saw you over there, he wouldn't splash you with dirty water. He'd pull over and let you in his car,' Weeks said.","About 40 people gathered for the funeral of Thomas Eric Duncan, 43, in Salisbury, North Carolina, on Saturday .

"The infatuated accomplice of serial killer Joanna Dennehy has launched an appeal against his life sentence. Gary Stretch, who is 7ft 3inches tall, was jailed for a minimum of 19 years after being convicted of helping Dennehy murder three men in a gruesome ten-day killing spree. The 48-year-old - whose real name Gary Richards - shouted 'thank you very much' when he was sentenced in February this year for two counts of attempted murder and preventing the burial of Dennehy's victims. Gary Stretch, 48 (left) - the infatuated accomplice of serial killer Joanna Dennehy (right) - is appealing against his sentence, after being jailed for  two counts of attempted murder and preventing burial of Dennehy's victims . Dennehy (pictured) was handed a whole-life prison term - only the third ever to be given to a woman - after murdering three men in a ten-day spree . But Stretch, from Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, has now launched an appeal against the length of his sentence, for the second time. Dennehy, 31, who pleaded guilty to the murders, was handed a whole-life prison term - only the third ever to be given to a woman. After the trial, it emerged Stretch had sent Dennehy twisted letters from his cell, calling her his 'devil in the flesh' and describing sex with her as 'a dream never to come true'. He also praised her 'bloodthirsty' leanings and 'dirty and dark mind', as they both awaited sentence for their heinous crimes. Stretch even signed off the letters with 'Your biggest supporter!' 'Undertaker' and 'Hubby 4 Lifey'. During the trial, prosecutors said Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her victims as she killed 'for fun'. The bodies of Dennehy's victims - including John Chapman (left) and Kevin Lee (right) - were found in ditches in East Anglia in March and April last year . Dennehy also stabbed Lukasz Slaboszewski (pictured) to death, before going on to repeatedly stab two other dog walkers in Hereford, who both survived . Stretch was described as a 'nodding dog' to Dennehy who was said to be 'a sadistic serial killer with a fearsome personality'. Throughout the trial, Stretch claimed he had acted under 'duress' and in fear of what Dennehy might do to him. He also refused to give evidence during his trial at Cambridge Crown Court. But he was convicted after a trial in which jurors saw CCTV images of him walking hand-in-hand with Dennehy through a motorway service station. The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found dumped in ditches in East Anglia in March and April last year. Dennehy's brutal murders sparked a nationwide manhunt for her and Stretch.  Officers also combed several pieces of land to try and find the pair's victims (pictured) After the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random. She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived. Dennehy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and three of preventing the lawful and decent burials of her three victims. Two other accomplices were also jailed. Robert Moore, 56, was jailed for three years after he admitted sheltering Dennehy and Leslie Layton, 36, was jailed for 14 years for preventing the burials of her victims. Stretch's appeal case is due to be heard tomorrow.","7ft 3in Gary Stretch, 48, was jailed for two counts of attempted murder .

Woman's Day claimed that the coronation of Mary and her husband, Prince Fredrick, could be announced in 'just weeks', in their latest publication on Monday.

"A driver accused of shooting dead a father-of-two in an apparent road rage incident last month has been denied bond by a judge who said he could be a danger to the public. Martin Zale, 69, was ordered to remain in Livingston County Jail, Michigan after prosecutors said the incident is similar to another road rage incident in 2008 when Zale punched a driver in the face. He is now accused of shooting Derek Flemming, 43, in the head on September 2. According to Mr Flemming's wife, he had approached Zale to complain about his erratic driving. But on Tuesday, as Zale appeared in court, his family called him a 'devoted and loving' man who had 'every right to stand his ground' in a statement on their website - the Martin Zale Defense Fund. In court: Martin Zale, 69, appeared in court in Livingston County, Michigan on Tuesday but was denied bond. He allegedly gunned down a father-of-two during an argument about his driving last month . They said they could not detail why Zale was arguing self defense but that truth would be revealed in court. 'We stand united and strongly believe that when all of the facts of this case are disclosed to an impartial jury, the law will prevail and Marty will be judged fairly for his right to self-defense,' it said. 'The record will be set straight regarding the devastating events of that day.' The statement called him 'a faithful, devoted and loving husband to his wife of 25 years', a father of two sons and a man who has 'high regard and respect for the law'. The family is also accepting donations for his defense on the website. In a previous description, it says that he 'was attacked in a space where he had a right to be. He had no duty to retreat, and had every right to stand his ground.' It adds that he is 'being unjustly charged with open murder ... for defending his life.' 'Loving': Before he appeared in court, his family released a statement saying he was a loving and caring man . Who is he? Zale, pictured left in his mug shot and right in a family handout, is a respected for his 'conservative moral family values', his family said. Prosecutors pointed out that he also punched a man in 2008 . Zale has also been charged with discharging a pistol from a vehicle and two counts of possessing a pistol in the commission of the murder and the firing of the pistol. He could face up to life in prison if convicted. In the altercation on September 2, Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached his pickup. Zale then rolled down his window and shot the man, prosecutors have said. Before the incident, both men were involved in separate incidents involving road-rage or threats, the judge heard on Tuesday, Mlive reported. In November 2008, Zale punched a man outside a McDonald's after the man pulled in front of him while turning onto a road, according to a police report. In a statement at the time, Zale said he regretted the incident and was glad that the driver wasn't hurt. The police report was read out in court on Tuesday. Killed: Derek Flemming, pictured right with his wife, was shot in the head after approaching Zale last month . Heartbroken: Amy Flemming ran over and begged her husband to live after watching him drop to the ground . Assistant Livingston County Prosecutor Daniel Rose said that every driver has incidents that spark anger - but Zale acts on those feelings. He noted the two incidents were similar, but Zale's attorney, Melissa Pearce, said that the court would soon learn that this case was very different. But the judge agreed with the prosecution that releasing Zale was not safe. He will be back in court on November 21. In his own incident, Flemming allegedly threatened to shoot Enbridge Energy workers or 'anyone' who came on his property, according to police reports in 2012. In September, he and his wife Amy were driving along Grand River Avenue to pick up their children after the first day back at school when they ran into Zale in his 2012 Dodge pickup. Zale was speeding so fast that Mrs Flemming thought he was going to hit them, she said. He then allegedly tailgated the couple, then as they tried to pull to the right to let him pass, he passed them in the right lane, forcing them to jerk back into the left. He pulled in front and then slammed on his brakes, she said. Scene: Zale pulled the trigger from inside his truck in broad daylight in front of numerous witnesses . Missed: Flemming had been on his way to collect his children when he was shot dead by the stranger . When both cars pulled up at a set of traffic lights on Grand River at Chilson, Derek Flemming got out of his vehicle and approached Zale's window. A loud argument ensued but it doesn't appear there was any physical contact between the men. Zale then lowered his window and shot Flemming once in the face. Speaking to Detroit Free Press, the victim's widow recalled how Zale appeared emotionless after gunning down her husband. She told the newspaper her husband walked up and asked the other driver: 'What's your problem?' 'And it was a second or maybe two after Derek said that to when there was a gunshot,' Flemming said. 'As soon as I heard the gunshot and I saw him fall, I was getting out of the car and running to him.'","Martin Zale 'shot Derek Flemming, 43, in the head in September after Flemming approached him to ask him why he was driving erratically'

"Lycia Martinez, 39, was taking four medications that cause dizziness, police say . A Utah school bus driver has been charged with driving under the influence of prescription medication with 67 children aboard her bus after terrified chaperones called 911 to report that she was swerving between lanes at 80mph. Lycia Martinez, 39, had four different prescription drugs with her at the time of her arrest on Monday morning - painkillers, anti-anxiety pills and blood pressure medication, police say. All of them warn that dizziness could be a side effect. Parents who called 911 were audibly anxious as they described Martinez's erratic driving on Interstate 15 south of Salt Lake City. 'Oh my hell,' the parent said, in an audio recording of the call. 'I don't get scared very easily but my heart is pounding.' 'It's freaking scary and we've got 76 people on this bus. She's nuts.' 'Oh, oh, oh. She almost hit a van.... I am honestly shaking at this point. I'm going to just close my eyes so I see nothing.' A concerned motorist also called 911 to report the bus. Martinez was driving the elementary students and eight teachers from Davis County, Utah, north of Salt Lake city to Brigham Young University in Provo - a journey of nearly 60 miles. The Utah Highway Patrol pulled the bus over south of Salt Lake City shortly after 8am in rush hour traffic on Interstate 15. Scroll down for video .

Police say she was not abusing the medication she had - but had taken it at the wrong time and was impaired when she got behind the wheel. Martinez has been driving for Davis County School District for six years. She has been suspended pending the outcome of a police investigation. The children, fifth and sixth graders, were mostly oblivious to Martinez's bad driving, police said. However, one girl texted her mother when she realized cops had showed up to pull over the bus. Utah State Patrol's Sergeant Blaine Robbins said an impaired driver swerving through rush our traffic on a busy freeway could have led to disaster. He said the children were lucky that parents called 911 when they did.

"Like so many captured British soldiers in the Second World War, he tried constantly to escape. But despite crossing the wire over 200 times, Horace Greasley would always creep back in to captivity. This incredible story of the young PoW sneaking out for snatched moments with his German sweetheart is testament to the enduring power of love amid the hatred and suffering of war. Discovery would have meant death by firing squad for Horace, but the risks run by his lover Rosa Rauchenbach were just as great. Having hidden her Jewish roots from the Nazis, she was an interpreter at the camp where he was held. Defiance: Horace Greasley comes face-to-face with SS monster Heinrich Himmler . At the age of 90, Horace recounted his exploits in a book, Do The Birds Still Sing In Hell? Now, the wartime romance is being turned into a Hollywood movie. When Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia in Spring 1939, 20-year-old Horace was working as a barber in his home town of Ibstock, Leicestershire. One of his clients offered him a safe, well-paid job as a fireman, but Horace opted to join the army. After seven weeks training with the 2nd/5th Batallion Leicestershire Regiment, he was sent to France as part of the British Expeditionary Force. Fearless: Horace Greasley as a 20-year-old soldier before his capture, left, and in retirement in Spain . Captured by the Wehrmacht during the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940, Horace had to endure a 10-week forced march across France, Belgium and Holland. Exhausted and malnourished, he ended up in a marble quarry labour camp in Polish Silesia. Rosa, the 17-year-old daughter of the quarry director, was working as an interpreter in the camp. Horace recalls an instant mutual attraction, and the two snatched meetings whenever they could. But the two were forced apart when Horace was transferred to Freiwaldau, 40 miles away. To see his lover Horace had to remove the wooden bars from his cell window, crawl under the camp's perimeter fence, and make a break for the chapel that was the location for each rendez-vous. Once out, Horace had no chance of escape. The nearest neutral country was Sweden, 420 miles to the North. Instead, he would creep back into the camp under the noses of his captors, often with packets of food for his comrades. These illicit trysts were not Horace's only act of defiance. An incredible photo shows the emaciated prisoner face-to-face with SS leader Heinrich Himmler. Showing the mass murderer his protruding ribs, he demanded more food for Allied PoWs. Around 135,000 British PoWs were held . by Germany in WWII. Most were treated relatively well, as both nations . were signatories to the Geneva Convention (1929) and the Red Cross had access to camps. Officers were never made to work, and . other ranks were usually compensated for forced labour. This relatively . humane treatment resulted in a  3.5 per cent death rate among British . PoWs in German camps, the lowest of any Allied nation. Most PoWs were held in camps in Germany, some in Poland. Under international law, POWs were . entitled to try to escape. However the German 'bullet decree' allowed . guards to shoot those who did. The secret MI9 unit was set up to assist with escape attempts by British PoWs. Stalag 383 was regarded as the best . camp. Guards left its day-to-day running to British officers, and pets . were allowed. Stalag IX-B, meanwhile, was one of the worst. PoWs slept . 160 to a room, sharing a single tap and a hole in the ground for a . toilet. In 1945, Freiwaldau was liberated by the Allies. Although Horace travelled back to England and Rosa became a translator for the Americans, the two continued to communicate by letter. But the correspondence suddenly stopped when Rosa died in childbirth. Horace never found out if the baby - who also perished - was his. Swearing he would never take orders from anyone again, Horace ran a hairdresser's, a taxi company and a haulage firm back in Leicestershire. He met his wife Brenda in 1970, they married in 1975, and retired to Spain in 1988. Aged 89, Horace was introduced to the ghostwriter Ken Scott, and his story appeared in print in 2008, time for his 90th birthday. His tale told at last, he died in February 2010. Now Mission Impossible III producer Stratton Leopold has been asked by US filmmakers Silverline Productions to bring the book to the big screen. Scott - who will fly to America for a read-through of the script - told the Mirror: 'I can say it will be a mix of German and British actors and they are A-listers. 'As for the director, they are currently choosing between two. Finally people will see Horace's amazing story on the big screen'.","Horace Greasley captured by Germans and sent to camp in Polish Silesia .

Cue two late kicks from Wallaby fly-half Bernard Foley as the hosts once again coughed up a winning position – and not for the first time in their run of 21 consecutive defeats to the ‘big three’. It is a painful never-ending story that simply doesn’t want to finish, made worse by injuries across the back-line to Leigh Halfpenny and Dan Biggar. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Warren Gatland: Australia will face different beast at World Cup . Australian fullback Irael Folau beats Wales' Alex Cuthbert to run in the visitors' first try . Wales: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, George North, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Paul James, Richard Hibbard, Samson Lee, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton (captain), Taulupe Faletau. Substitutes: Scott Baldwin, Gethin Jenkins, Rhodri Jones, Bradley Davies, Justin Tipuric, Mike Phillips, Rhys Priestland, Cory Allen. Australia: Israel Folau; Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Christian Leali'ifano, Joe Tomane; Bernard Foley, Nick Phipps; James Slipper, Saia Fainga'a, Sekope Kepu, Sam Carter, Rob Simmons, Sean McMahon, Michael Hooper (captain), Ben McCalman. Substitutes: James Hanson, Tetera Faulkner, Ben Alexander, James Horwill, Will Skelton, Matt Hodgson, Will Genia, Rob Horne. This was a chance to lay down a final marker before the two countries meet at next year’s World Cup, but Gatland believes his side, who face Fiji next week, still have more to offer. ‘There’s going to be a different beast that’s facing Australia in that Pool game,’ said Gatland. ‘Our time together will be a big upward curve and we’ll continue to get better. We have pushed the players right to the edge over the last two weeks but there are a lot of things we didn’t cover.’ Gatland was keen to take positives from the defeat, but that will not appease supporters who watched Wales make too many mistakes. Training has been focussed on fitness, but a lack of skills work was exposed. ‘It’s pretty frustrating,’ said Gatland. ‘I’m not happy with the result but I’m pretty happy with the performance; the way we played and how positively we played. We missed two one-on-one tackles, which they’ve scored, and we threw an intercept pass. For a side that’s just come together, I think we showed a huge amount of positives.’ The Australian game plan was clear from the start. After Alex Cuthbert clumsily knocked on from the kick off, the Wallabies shipped the ball wide and had Israel Folau run into George North’s outside-centre channel within 30 seconds. Only a captain’s turnover from Sam Warburton brought an end to the early onslaught. Gatland was bold with his selection. Experienced front-row Adam Jones will play no part in this series, while fellow Lions Mike Phillips and Gethin Jenkins were both dropped to the bench for the opening fixture. In-form Rhys Webb took the place of Phillips and the gamble paid early dividends when the 25-year-old went over for the opening try after three minutes. Biggar, Halfpenny and Sam Warburton all combined in attack, before the No 9 sniped from the base of the breakdown for the try, which Halfpenny converted. Wales' Rhys Webb runs in the first try of the match in the third minute after a terrific break from captain Sam Warburton . Wallaby's Christian Leali'ifano is driven back by Webb and Taulupe Faletau early on at the Millennium Stadium . Folau strikes again after an intercept on the Wallabies defensive 22m line and runs the length of the pitch . Build up in the Welsh camp has been geared towards narrowing the speed deficit between the regional competition and the southern hemisphere Super Rugby tournament. While GPS data has showed that most Welsh players are used to covering 55 metres per minute at club level, their Australian counterparts are used to playing at above 75mpm. The objective was to play at that speed, while keeping errors to a minimum. But the home defence cracked after a quarter of an hour. Australia skipper Michael Hooper used his low centre of gravity to plough through a weak tackle from Biggar, finding Folau on his inside shoulder for a dash over the line. Foley converted to level the score. It was disappointing to see empty seats at the Millennium Stadium, but that is the side-effect of charging £60 for a general sale ticket. Supporters would rather save their money to watch the All Blacks in two weeks time and they would expect to see far less mistakes than experienced in the first half on Saturday afternoon. While Webb showed his danger with the opening try, he was at fault for handing the visitors a 21st minute lead. After Jamie Roberts broke through the defence, Wales played up until the unlucky 13th phase, when Webb through a 20-yard miss pass that was intercepted by Folau. No one was going to catch the mercurial full-back as he cantered in from 80 metres.

Tevita Kuridrani busts through a tackle on the burst and beats Jamie Roberts (right) for the Aussies' third try of the first half . Wales celebrate their third try through Alun Wyn Jones in time added on in the first half . North was seen as a weak link given his unfamiliar position, but the Saints winger made the break to bring Wales back into the game. With the Australian defence all at sea, the 22-year-old cut inside Adam Ashley Cooper to create the opening for Wales’ second try. Alex Cuthbert got on North’s shoulder and exploited a two-on-one to level the score with the aid of Halfpenny’s conversion. Then struck a huge double blow for the hosts, as Halfpenny was turned over and concussed at the same breakdown. It signalled the end of his game and Tevita Kuridrani – the cousin of Wallaby legend Lote Tuqiri – broke through the tackle of Cuthbert and Alun Wyn Jones, punishing Welsh errors with another easy try. He was to be joined on the injury list by Biggar, who suffered a strained groin. ‘We’ll have to sit down as a group and bring another 10 in for next week,’ said Gatland. ‘We’ll see how the next 48 hours go with Leigh. It’s an opportunity for us to give him a rest next week and perhaps look at Liam at full back.‘ . The introduction of Cory Allen for Halfpenny allowed Wales to revert to a more familiar line-up, with North switching back to the wing. The Welsh forwards had not dominated up front as they expected, but just before half-time Warburton tapped a quick penalty, allowing Jones to crash over and leave the half time score at 21-21. Scrum-half Bernard Foley potted the first penalty attempt of the match early in the second half to put Australia back in the lead . Wales skipper Warburton leads from the front with a strong run at the Australian defensive line . With three British and Irish Lions and more than 300 international caps on the bench, Wales were able to unload a wealth of experience in the second half. Two further penalties from Foley edged the hosts back in front and Gatland sent on both Phillips and Jenkins. The Wales front-five was expected to dominate the scrum, but did little more than hold their own. Only the introduction of Jenkins along with Scott Baldwin in the front-row seemed to provide the impetus. A huge drive provided Wales with go forwards ball and North almost crashed over after 61 minutes, only to be denied by the Television Match Official. Five minutes of re-set scrums followed and referee Craig Joubert eventually awarded a penalty try, to the delight of the home crowd. Replacement fly half Rhys Priestland converted to give his side a one-point lead. Wales had been in this position in so many times before and the curse of the late score has become their hoodoo. History was about to repeat itself. Australia built up the phases and Foley got in position for the drop goal. He made no mistake, before adding a second from the tee to rub salt in the wounds; it was to be another case of Welsh deja vu. Wales dominate the Australian scrum under the posts for a series of penalties and resets before being given a penalty try .

"Frank Holden, 66, says he is desperate to meet his granddaughter Hollie, almost two . He's been condemned as a cliche celebrity father – only resurfacing when his daughter was famous. Frank Holden felt the full force of his daughter TV star Amanda’s venom in her new autobiography. She told how, as an alcoholic, he abandoned his family when she was four, then years later tried to worm his way back into her affections. But despite the attack he still wants the Britain’s Got Talent judge to give him another chance. Yesterday he revealed that he had never seen Miss Holden’s youngest daughter  Hollie, who will be two in a few weeks. He has met her oldest child, seven-year-old Lexi, only once – when she was a baby. The 66-year-old said: ‘It’s pretty obvious that I wasn’t a good father – which I regret. ‘The stuff which is written in the book is a long time ago and I would like them [Lexi and Hollie] and Amanda to spend time with me and learn about me now. ‘There has been no talk about seeing my grandchildren. I do send them Christmas cards and birthday cards. I don’t know if they get them, I never get any acknowledgement. ‘Amanda hasn’t physically banned me but it is an unwritten rule as, like she says in her book, she never wants to talk to me again.’ Mr Holden, who has recently retired from his job directing traffic to the Torpoint ferry in Cornwall, insisted he does not have a drink problem these days but admitted it was an issue in the past. He said: ‘I hold my hands up. I used to drink too much, and I had a bad relationship with the drink.’ Miss Holden’s decision to freeze her biological father out of her life meant he had no idea she had suffered the trauma of a stillborn birth seven months into her second pregnancy in February 2011 until he read about it in the press. Family feud: Amanda has allowed him to meet seven-year-old Lexi (pictured) once but never again . Attack: In her autobiography she claims he abandoned her age four then re-emerged when she hit fame . He said: ‘When she lost her baby and was very poorly nobody told me. I would have liked to have known especially as she was so ill…she is my flesh and blood.’ In her autobiography No Holding Back, Miss Holden, 42, writes: ‘One of my strongest memories of Frank is the way he always smelled of alcohol. And the day I think he left. That day somewhere downstairs, Save All Your Kisses For Me by the Brotherhood Of Man was playing so I was bouncing in time to the music when Mum came into the bedroom with Frank. I bounced into his arms for a cuddle and smelt the alcohol on his breath. ‘Then he set me down without a word, turned around and walked out of the room.’ She continues: ‘He loved his booze more than he loved us and abandoned his children, pure and simple.’ Early years: Frank Holden with Judith, Amanda's mother, in 1973. His daughter claims he abandoned them . 'I'm not bitter or sad, just disappointed that he only chose to come back into my life when I started to become ""famous"" and not when I'd actually needed him,' Amanda writes. But Frank claims he contacted her earlier . Miss Holden’s mother went on to marry Leslie Collistor who the actress refers to as her father. Years later, Mr Holden came to see his daughter perform in a production of The Sound Of Music and also  the West End musical Thoroughly Modern Millie in which she had the title role when she was 32. Those encounters, however, served only to seal Miss Holden’s impression of her father as a cliche celebrity dad. She said in her autobiography: ‘I’m not bitter or sad, just disappointed that he only chose to come back into my life when I started to become “famous” and not when I’d actually needed him.’ Mr Holden disputes this. He said: ‘When I got in touch with her she was just starting out and in the theatre performing. I haven’t latched on because she’s famous. That is a little hurtful and unfair.’ Miss Holden’s lifestyle could not be more different from that of her father. She lives in a £4million home in London with second husband Chris Hughes, 40, and their two daughters. He lives in a £160,000 house with his partner Pauline Long, 73. Miss Holden’s agent yesterday declined to make a comment on her behalf.","Frank Holden attacked in his daughter's autobiography for being alcoholic who abandoned family when she was four then emerged when she hit fame .

"An alligator has become the first in the world to be given a prosthetic tail. The nine-year-old reptile, called Mr Stubbs, was left unable to swim after having his rear end bitten off in a fight. The youngster struggled to keep upright in deep water and he faced a life on land. Mr Stubbs, a 9-year-old reptile, is the first alligator in the world to get a prosthetic tail . The amputee alligator, which had his tail bitten off by a larger alligator when he was just a baby, is learning to walk and swim with his new appendage . Mr Stubbs, without his tail (left), can't swim, and has a much harder time getting around. Kevin Manfredi (right), of Midwestern University, prepares to release Mr Stubbs and study his movements using special markers . With his new tail attached, Mr Stubbs is now learning how to swim, moving through the water and even diving and swimming on his back . But he's been given a new lease of life after being rescued by reptile experts at the Herpetological Society in Phoenix, Arizona. The team had a new high-tech tail made out of latex and silicon at a cost of thousands of dollars.And they're now teaching Mr Stubbs how to swim again. Russ Johnson, from the society, said: 'Mr Stubbs was probably very young and someone put him in with a much larger alligator - and the alligator bit it off. 'Alligators are cannibals so if you're the smallest and someone else is hungry - you're basically a menu item. 'A tail is a vital appendage for an alligator. Without a tail, an alligator can't swim - he can't move forward in the water so he just splashes in circles. Needless to say, a tailless existence is not a very pleasing lifestyle for an alligator.' Mr Stubbs was found among 32 alligators in the back of a truck that had been stopped as it drove through Arizona and handed over to the Herpetological Society, which houses 1,500 reptiles. The team had a new high-tech tail made out of latex and silicon at a cost of thousands of dollars . Sarah Jarvis, an orthopedic research associate with the Center for Orthopedic Research and Education in Arizona, who helped make the cast for what would become Mr Stubbs prosthetic tail, poses with Russ Johnson of the Phoenix Herpetological Society . Mr Stubbs was found among 32 alligators in the back of a truck that had been stopped as it drove through Arizona . Mr Johnson said: 'When he went into the pen with the other alligators we found we couldn't put him in deep water because he couldn't swim without turning himself upside down.' Realising the animal would need a new tail, the team called in reptile specialist Justin Georgi, from Midwestern University, to help. Dr. Marc Jacofsky and his assistant Sarah Jarvis, both from the Center for Orthopedic Research and Education, in Arizona, were also brought in to help make a cast for what would become Mr Stubbs' prosthetic tail. The complicated process involved using infrared video cameras to track the animal's motion and even his centre of gravity. The prosthetic tail was then made using a mould from a similar sized alligator and Mr Stubbs' stump. And the reptile now appears to be delighted to be back in the water with his new appendage. The process of making the tail involved using infrared video cameras to track the animal's motion and even his centre of gravity . It takes just five to 10 minutes to get the tail on Mr Stubbs and fitted properly . The prosthetic tail was made using a mould from a similar sized alligator and Mr Stubbs' stump . Dr Georgi said: 'One of the wonderful things is he takes to it so quickly every time we put it on. 'He never shows any distress or signs of fighting to slip out of it. One of the proofs of matching a tail to something that feels natural for him, is that he doesn't mind - he started moving pretty much naturally as soon as he had it on.' Once Mr Stubbs learns to propel the tail, he'll be able to maneuver, swim, and dive like a normal alligator. And, as he continue to grow over the next 60 years of his life, he will need up to 40 different replacements. Kevin Manfredi prepares to release Mr Stubbs and study his movements using the special markers placed in strategic places on the alligator's body . As he continue to grow over the next 60 years of his life, Mr Stubbs will need up to 40 different replacements .","Young alligator struggled to keep upright in deep water after losing tail .

"After being beaten up by a chicken and losing his brother and leg in the fight, life was looking decidedly dodgy for Dudley the duckling. However, thanks to 3D printing technology, the Canadian animal has a new lease of life - and a new leg. Terence Loring, a 32 year old mechanical engineer and architect, decided to help Dudley after hearing about him from his martial arts instructor. Scroll down for video . Dudley the duck and his 3D printed prosthetic leg. He lost his leg, and his brother, in a fight with a chicken. Born on August 19, 2013, Dudley was initially placed in an enclosure with some chickens at K9-1-1 Animal and Rescue Services in Sicamous, British Columbia. The aggressive chickens attacked Dudley and his brother. His brother died and Dudley's leg was badly damaged, said Doug Nelson, co-owner of the K-9-1-1 Animal Rescue & Services. Dudley lost his foot and part of his leg. He could still swim, but had a lot of trouble getting around on land. 'I was training in jujitsu, and my coach's parents own the shelter, so he mentioned Dudley to me - and he came up with the idea,' Loring told MailOnline. 'He was just a duckling when I met him in September last year, and I'd never tried anything like this before, - but hoped we could help.' Loring decided to build a 3D printed leg for Dudley, working with local firm Proto3000, who are printing Dudley's legs for free. Born on August 19, 2013, Dudley was initially placed in an enclosure with some chickens at K9-1-1 Animal and Rescue Services in Sicamous. One day the aggressive chickens attacked Dudley and his brother. His brother died and Dudley's leg was badly damaged, said Doug Nelson, co-owner of the shelter. Dudley lost his foot and part of his leg. He could still swim, but had a lot of trouble getting around on land. 'He was just a duckling when I met him in September,' said Loring. Dudley's leg front the front . It was modelled on a computer . Then 3D printed . 'We got him up on his leg, and for the past 3.5 weeks he's been walking around on it. 'He's doing very well.' The foot was mirrored off Dudley's good foot to ensure similar sizing. The first design was at a wrong angle and more complex than needed. So Loring designed a second leg, a much simpler version. The main structure including upper-leg, lower-leg, connecting pin for joints are made of a stronger ABS. The foot is made out of a very soft and flexible rubber-mimic plastic to allow easier placement / liftoff of the foot. Loring said the change in Dudley's personality is clear. 'The funniest thing is his personality. Dudley as a duckling before his prosthetic leg was fitted . 'He has a little friend, a pot bellied pig called Elsie that pushes him around. 'When he got his leg, the first thing he did was go push the pig around. 'You can really see the excitement that he can now move around. Dozens of legs were tested, and Loring said more are still being printed as the design is improved, and as Dudley grows. Several legs have been tried out in computer models (right) and Loring said new legs are still being tested . 'We're printing a new leg at the moment, and we think he'll like it. 'He is five months old now, and what's great is that its so easy to print new legs as he grows.' Loring also hopes to help other injured animals. 'I would love to help other animals, if there are more patients out there,' he said. 'We put all the 3d files on out website so anyone can download the file.'","Animal was spotted in a Canadian shelter by a 3D printing expert .

"An academy has sent home 152 pupils in one day after they failed to meet the school's new strict uniform policy. Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, strictly enforced a new dress code on Tuesday and nearly ten per cent of its pupils failed to meet the standards on its first day. Today, another 63 students had to be sent home, taking the total number of pupils banned over the new uniform rules to 215. Clear rules: This is the Hanson Academy's own online guide which is set to inform parents what students can and cannot wear . Several students reported being turned away at the gates for minor infringements such as wearing a winter coat and not displaying their school ID on a lanyard. A majority of student were sent home for wearing the wrong footwear, Hanson Academy business manager Sarah Roberts said. Mason Beaumont, 14, was turned away for wearing black leather Magnum made footwear because staff branded them trainers. His mother Lindsay Stansfield, 34, has been forced to buy him new shoes so Mason can return to school, despite only having got them in September. Mrs Stansfield, who works as teaching assistant at nearby Wellington Primary School, said: ‘Mason was sent home but I don't know what he was expected to change into. ‘He was wearing black leather style footwear with a decent sole, they are certainly not trainers and I wouldn't like to play sport in them.’ The school want pupils to dress in a blazer with a correctly-tied tie and a school lanyard around their necks . School rules: The academy posted these pictures to show students examples of incorrect footwear . A statement made by the school states the rules are necessary to prepare children for the workplace . The guide shows that only smart, black, leather shoes are acceptable, with no trainers or high heels allowed . Mason said: ‘I've been wearing these shoes since September and I thought they were okay for school rules. ‘I couldn't believe it when if was turned away at the gates on Tuesday.’ Joe White, 17, who was sent home for not wearing a lanyard to carry his school ID, said: ‘I feel some of the rules are quite mean and the only thing they have caused us is to waste our education. ‘It has all come out of the blue. Last year they were strict but flexible and more understanding. Since we have come back they have made all these demands about how we dress.'. Damien McDevitt claimed his stepson was refused entry for ‘wearing a winter coat over his blazer’ and said he was sent home at the school gate. ‘He just arrived home with no warning from the school and said that he had been sent home,’ he said. A number of parents took to the school's Facebook page to complain about the 'harsh' new measures. One parent said: 'Some of our children are wearing shoes that were perfectly acceptable last term, but deemed not this year. Provide my son with the perfect shoes so he can have an education he has a legal right to. Another joked: 'Can you advise what thread count their underwear should be please?' Kicked out: Mason Beaumont, 14, pictured with his mother Lindsay Stansfield, was sent home when staff branded his black leather shoes 'trainers' Wrong shoes: The black leather shoes worn by Mason Beaumont for which he was sent home from school . Joe White (left), 17, was among those who were sent home. He was not wearing his lanyard in school . However, Hanson Academy claims made clear its expectations to parents for this school year. Pupils face being sent home for a variety of reasons, including wearing hoop earrings, two earrings or patterned trousers. Students are also not allowed to have an unnatural hair colour or wear jumpers, jackets or coats indoors. There are also strict rules about the type of footwear allowed, with information on this posted on the academy's website. Headteacher Elizabeth Churton, who has been at the school for two years, said the rules were not new and staff were simply ‘reinforcing the rules that are in place.’ She said: ‘I am a head doing her job. I believe that we have to start from ground zero. If we get the basics right then we can push on to make this outstanding. Students need to know the boundaries and it is our job to make sure they are ready for the real world. ‘There was no consultation with parents and there will not be one, as we are just reinforcing the rules. ‘Basic expectations have to be abided by. We have had very, very mixed feedback from parents.’ Elizabeth Churton, head of Hanson Academy in Bradford, West Yorkshire, sent 152 pupils home on Tuesday for not wearing the correct uniform. Some parents have complained about the strict rules . In an official statement, Mrs Churton added: 'Our uniform and dress codes set the tone for our community and provide the scaffolding for high standards in every aspect of school life. 'To ensure that parents and students were fully aware of the high expectations that we would have this academic year we communicated clearly our expectations with parents and students at the end of the summer term, during the school holidays and at the start of this term; we were clear that we would be diligent with monitoring school uniform. 'We explained that students who arrived to school with a uniform issue that could be resolved would be sent home to rectify and parents would be contacted. 'As forewarned, some students were sent home today for this reason. We are very grateful for the support of the majority of our parents in ensuring that their child fully complied with our expectations. 'Hanson School is proud of the achievements made over the past couple of years and we continue our drive for excellence.' 'The school has a responsibility to properly prepare our young people for the world of work and this means understanding the appropriate dress required in today's society. 'On Tuesday 4th November we sent 152 students home, which represents 8 per cent of our whole school community. 'They were sent home to change and the majority rectified this immediately and returned to school ready to learn. This means that 92 per cent of our school community supports our drive in standards of dress code. 'We continue to work closely with parents and carers and we offer additional support to families who are in most need.' Pupils and parents around the country have reported being shocked at the stricter uniform rules being imposed in Britain's schools after they returned from the summer holidays. Around 100 students were sent home just minutes after arriving for the first day of term when staff at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, told them their footwear was not 'black, leather shoes' and was 'inappropriate'. Emma Guthrie, who bought a £20 pair of black formal shoes for her son Lewis, 12, said: 'We had a text about the shoes the day before. But that's no good. 'I think it's disgraceful. What have [shoes] got to do with him looking at a blackboard, reading and writing? 'I'm not going out and buying any more, I'm putting my foot down and he's wearing them.' Tyler Hawkins (left) was made to colour-in his shoes with marker, while (right picture, left to right) Jaydee Hart, 13, Chloe Gregory, 14, and Amelia Wileman, 13, were told their uniforms were 'too tight' A few days later, 15-year-old Tyler Hawkins was told to 'colour in' the white 'swoosh' and soles on his Nike shoes with a black marker pen at Newquay's Tretherras School. His mother, Gemma, said: 'Uniforms cost a lot of money as it is. I've got three children and I don't get any help. 'It's annoyed me so much I feel like being a rebel myself and making him buy an orange pair.' Later last month, parents of pupils at Headlands School in Bridlington, East Yorkshire claimed their teenage daughters have been left in tears after teachers told the pupils their trousers were too tight. They said their children have been told by teachers their black school trousers are too tight around the 'calf and bottom areas' and are not part of the school uniform. Sian Hart said her 13-year-old daughter, Jaydee, was among those taken out of class and told her trousers were too tight. She said: 'She has been wearing the same uniform ever since she started at Headlands. She's very skinny and tall and I really struggle to find trousers that fit her.","Around 10 per cent of pupils at Bradford academy sent home yesterday .

"For the most populous nation on the planet, the Chinese certainly are terrible at football, its most popular sport. But president Xi Jinping wants to change all that by making it compulsory for children to play, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse. A massive fan of the beautiful game, he and many of his 1.37 billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 88 ranking of the Chinese men's national team, according to The Economist. China's then Vice-President Xi Jinping kicks a football during a 2012 visit to Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland . Soccer-mad President Xi will make football compulsory in schools for all Chinese children . The national team's lowly number 88 ranking is a source of shame for many Chinese, including Mr Xi . Mr Xi has loved football since he played at school . So, at the end of last month, it was announced football would become a compulsory part of the national curriculum in Chinese schools. Education official Wang Dengfeng said improving the standard of football in China must 'start with children'. In 2016 the sport will become an option in the national university entrance exam. The idea behind this is that parents will be happier to let their children play where they have previously been reluctant on the basis they were wasting valuable time which could be spent studying. By 2017, the plan is that 20,000 schools will have received new football pitches and training facilities, which it is hoped will create 100,000 new players. Mr Xi has been a football fan since he played for his school team as a youngster. He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup – they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score – will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it. China's leader wants to avoid any more days like June 15 last year, his 60th birthday, when the men's side were thrashed 5-1 by a Thai youth team despite the fact they were playing at home in Hefei, Anhui province. The team had lost to Uzbekistan and Holland in friendly matches earlier that month, but this was the last straw as fans swarmed around China's Spanish coach, José Antonio Camacho, and smashed cars in protest. Mr Camacho subsequently resigned. The country's women's team aren't so bad however – they are ranked 14th in the world and reached the 1999 World Cup final, which they lost to the USA. China's men take on Uruguay at the Wuhan Sports Center Stadium in October 2010.

"A psychic has pleaded guilty to conning an elderly bachelor out of his fortune, by using her own teenage daughter in a bogus marriage and using the proceeds to buy property, holidays and even a Ferrari with the number plate MRBIG1. Rachel Lee, 43, of Portland, Oregon pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering as well as failing to file income tax returns. According to court documents, Rachel Lee met Ralph Raines Jnr, 66, in 2004 and became a carer for his elderly father on their 1,200-acre timber farm in West Portland after he had a stroke. Rachel Lee, right, and her daughter Porsha, left, defrauded elderly bachelor Ralph Raines Jnr out of more than $12 million according to prosecutors in Portland, Oregon over a period of almost a decade . Lee became Raines Snr's primary care giver and moved in her teenage daughter Porsha Lee. By the time Raines Snr had died in February 2011, Lee had already begun siphoning off money from the farm's accounts. According to the indictment in and around 2009, Raines Jnr began claiming that he had married a woman called Mary Marks, an illegal immigrant from the UK. Court documents claim 'Marks' bore Raines Jnr a son named in court documents as the minor 'G'. The child belonged to another of Lee's daughters who allowed the infant to be used as part of the conspiracy. However, according to the indictment: 'The person who interacted with others as Jr's wife Mary Marks was Porsha Lee in disguise. 'When posing as Mary Marks, Porsha Lee typically presented in heavy make-up, a blonde wig, glasses, hat, and a British accent. 'It is part of the conspiracy that, in approximately 2009, through material misrepresentations and omissions of material fact, that that the fictitious Mary Marks/Porsha Lee began sharing administrative control of R. Tree Farm with Rachel Lee.' According to Court documents, between 2006 and 2011, the Lees took control of the financial and business affairs of the Raines father and son. It was claimed that the pair 'gradually and incrementally isolated Jr and terminated meaningful contact between Jr, his business associates , his neighbours and his family.' Among the cars purchased by Rachel Lee was a 2012 Ferrari California convertible similar to this one . Lee also bought a 2012 Bentley Mulsane with the proceeds from her complicated wire fraud, file photograph . The fraudsters also bought a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air from a classic car dealership, file photograph . Acting as Raines' wife, Porsha Lee negotiated the sale of at least four parcels of property for millions of dollars with the proceeds from the sales went into bank accounts controlled by Rachel Lee. Rachel Lee and her boyfriend spent the cash on travel and luxury cars, according to the indictment. A 2012 Bentley had the license plate ""MRBIG."" The license plate for a 2012 Ferrari was ""MRBIG1."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Donna Maddux declined to comment about the case until after sentencing on Jan. 20. A plea agreement states that Rachel Lee will spend seven to nine years in prison. ""The public documents speak for themselves,"" Maddux said. A court record says Porsha Lee, 24, has also accepted a plea agreement. According to court documents, the Rachel Lee bought a white convertible 2012 Ferrari California with the vanity plate MRBIG1. She also bought a 2012 Bentley Mulsane with MRBIG and a 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air. Lee also had a 2012 Mercedes 550. Prosecutors believe that Porsha Lee, posing as Raines Jnr's wife Mary Marks sold at least four parcels of land for a combined total of $12.3 million with the majority of the proceeds lodged in accounts controlled by Rachel Lee. Investigator discovered that Rachel Lee and her boyfriend Blancey Lee used the proceeds to take frequent trips to California and Las Vegas, including luxury stays in the Bellagio, The Venetian and The Wynn.","Rachel Lee involved her family in a fraud to rip off Ralph Raines Jnr .

"Placing your wrist under a tap of running water is an age-old trick to cool yourself down when starting to overheat. But not everyone has a tap or cold flannel to hand. With this in mind, a team of students has developed a bracelet that acts like a wearable air conditioning unit for your wrist. Called Wristify, the band directs either cool or warm air to the surface of a wearer's skin to balance the body's temperature. Scroll down for video . Wristify (concept illustrated) was developed by  embr labs and is a finalist in Intel’s annual Make It Wearable competition. The bracelet provides heating or cooling to the wearer’s skin by pointing waves or air at the skin’s thermoreceptors. It glows blue when cooling the skin, and orange while warming it . Wristify was developed by Matthew Smith, Sam Shames, Megha Jain and David Cohen-Tanugi from MIT, who recently set up embr labs. However, unlike a true air conditioner, the device only adjusts the temperature of the wrist, and not the humidity. Last year, the team's concept won the $10,000 (£6,100) first prize in the Making and Designing Materials Engineering Contest at the Massachusetts-based university, and it is now a finalist in Intel’s Make it Wearable competition. Wrapping a cold flannel around a wrist is a quick way to cool the body down, because there are pulse points in the wrist. At these points, blood vessels are closer to the surface of the skin than in other body parts. The body's natural cooling system circulates blood to move heat from inside of the body to the surface of the skin. Sweat then helps cool the skin by releasing some of this heat as it evaporates. The blood near the surface of the skin recirculates through the body and absorbs more heat to be released. By placing cold air or bands around these pulse points, it helps the body perform this process more efficiently. As a result, the team has been awarded an additional $50,000 (£30,700) to help make the band a reality. In addition to the prize money, all finalists are given mentorship and technical support from the Santa Clara-based tech giant. A prototype version has been developed, and is undergoing tests. Designer Niccolo Casas has also created a concept illustration of what the final model will look like. As the company explained: ‘Wristify uses all-natural waves of coolness or heat to activate the thermoreceptors on the surface of your skin, leaving you feeling rejuvenated. ‘It gently glows blue when cooling you, and glows a warm orange while heating you up. ‘Our comfort depends on a lot more than just core temperature, and we have drawn on the last 30 years of thermal comfort research to design a device for maximised comfort that is also discreet and energy-efficient. The winner of Intel’s competition will be announced on 3 November. embr labs said the team is working to develop the Wristify bracelet ‘as fast as possible’, but did not reveal when it would be available or how much it is likely to cost. The team has created a prototype (illustrated) and recently received $50,000 (£30,700) in funding. Winners of the Intel competition will be unveiled on 3 November. embr labs said the team is working to develop the Wristify bracelet ‘as fast as possible’, but did not reveal when it would be available or how much it is likely to cost . Cooling a wrist can cool or heat the rest of a person’s body because it is a pulse point - meaning the temperature change reaches the blood sooner. 'At embr labs, we are driven by a shared belief in the importance of connecting mind, body and environment,’ continued the firm. ‘Using our patent-pending technology, we're working hard to make a piece of jewellery that actually does something. ‘In fact, we think it will change how the world thinks about wearables and comfort.’","Wristify was developed by Massachusetts-based embr labs .

"The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire died this week at the age of 94 bringing an end to the fascinating life and times of the Mitford sisters. Deborah Vivien Cavendish and her siblings moved in the same circles as Winston Churchill, John F Kennedy, Adolf Hitler and Evelyn Waugh and epitomised a privileged and glamorous aristocratic life that no longer exists. The six daughters - Nancy, Pam, Diana, Unity, Decca and Debo - born between 1905 and 1920 to Lord Redesdale and his wife Sydney, were the Kardashians of their day in terms of the public interest their antics aroused. Scroll down for video . A rare picture of the Mitford family together, pictured in 1935. From left: Unity, Tom, Debo, Diana, Jessica, Nancy and Pamela . They certainly gave people something to talk about with their actions and relationships, creating more scandal than that seen in the fictional Downton Abbey. The most controversial of the sisters was Diana, known as Honks, who left her first husband and married the founder of the British Union of Fascists Oswald Mosley. They tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Joseph Goebbels' drawing room in Berlin in 1936. Hitler was the only other guest. As a result, during World War Two she was locked up as an enemy to the Allies in Holloway Prison. Mary S. Lovell, who has written a biography on the Mitford sisters, said Diana 'became arguably the most hated woman in England for a while.' Unity, Nancy and Diana in 1932: The sisters were the Kardashians of their day as they press was hotly interested in their lives and loves . But Diana wasn't the only Mitford with polarising political views. Decca was once an outspoken supporter of communism while Unity was also a fan of Hitler. Both she and Diana attended the Nuremberg Nazi rally of 1933 and Unity was said to have become fascinated with the leader. They became great friends - some even believe lovers. When war broke out, she was in Germany and shot herself in the head with a silver pistol. She survived but was brain damaged and was sent back to England to be nursed by her family. She died in 1948 of meningitis. Although many hated the sisters for their political alliances, others admired them for their wit and beauty. Bad taste in friends: Unity was a fan of the Nazi party and admired Hitler who she regularly met up with . Diana at the Nuremberg Rally in 1936: Her support of Fascism led her to become 'the most hated woman in Britain' They also had a brother, Tom, who died during World War Two in Burma. The girls were raised in stately homes in relative isolation as their father didn't believe they should go to school to be educated. Despite this, they became prolific writers, the most successful being Nancy who wrote entertaining stories with outlandish characters based on her own family. The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate were her most popular novels and their appeal endures today. As a writer with an affluent background, Nancy was a natural fit with the 'Bright Young Things' - the name given to the group of young aristocrats and socialites in 1920s, including Evelyn Waugh, who raised eyebrows with their partying. Another famous associate of the Mitford sisters was Winston Churchill. In 1937 Decca, then 19, met her second cousin Esmond Romilly, Churchill's nephew. They eloped to Spain during the civil war causing the British government to send a war ship to the country to try and bring them home. Blushing bride: Debo married Andrew Cavendish, who succeeded his father as 11th Duke of Devonshire in 1950 . Legacy: The Dowager devoted her life to running the Chatsworth estate . They then moved to America where Decca remained until her death in 1996 but she had by then long lost her first husband who was killed in action during World War Two. Pamela, the second eldest daughter, led the quietest life and was described as 'the most rural of the Mitfords' as she was more content on a farm than at at cocktail parties and balls. The Dowager Duchess of Devonshire also led a less scandalous life but still made her mark on history. She married Andrew Cavendish, who succeeded his father as 11th Duke of Devonshire in 1950, and devoted her life to running the Chatsworth estate with her husband. While many other stately homes have fallen into disrepair, the Derbyshire house remains not only a home but a successful business as a popular tourist attraction which is testament to the Dowager's efforts. The Dowager was the last of the surviving Mitford sisters but their legacy remains in their works of literature and at Chatsworth. In her book, 'The Mitford Girls: The Biography of an Extraordinary Family' Mary S. Lovell sums up why the girls were so intriguing in their day - and remain so after their deaths. 'These six girls, brought up in exactly the same way yet developing in such an individual manner, seem to have taken the twentieth century by the throat,' she writes. 'It is not so much that they were historically important - but that they were so much larger than life - easily as interesting as the characters's in Nancy's novels.'","Dowager Duchess of Devonshire died this week at the age of 94 .

"Fernando Torres has spoken of his delight at being back in his national setup after a spending a year in the Spanish wilderness. The Chelsea striker has not started for Spain since last summer's 3-0 defeat at the hands of Brazil in the Confederations Cup final - a game in which he was unceremoniously hauled off after 59 minutes.

And Torres will get a chance to prove his worth in the upcoming warm up game against Bolivia, having been named in a 19-man squad that has omitted other strikers Fernando Llorente, Alvaro Negredo and the injured Diego Costa. 'It's very nice to be back with the national team. I've gone a year without being with La Roja, since the Confederations Cup,' he said. 'I knew that anything could happen. Yesterday, I was only hoping to hear my name. I knew that I could've been here or not, but now I have a better chance of being in Brazil.

"The first fraud victims who had their credit cards details stolen and used by hackers who infiltrated Target's computer systems today emerged to condemn the store. The store has admitted that data from about 40 million credit and debit cards might have been stolen from shoppers at its stores during the first three weeks of the holiday season, in the second-largest card breach at a U.S. retailer. The data theft, unprecedented in its scale, took place over a 19-day period that began the day before Thanksgiving. Target said that it identified and resolved the issue on December 15. It is thought hackers obtained the data by remotely installing software on 40,000 credit card machines in nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores nationwide. The software could have spread through the Target network after being installed on a company machine, possibly by fooling an employee into clicking on a fake link in a 'phishing' scam. Christopher Browning, 23 of . Chesterfield, Va., said was the victim of credit card fraud earlier this . week and he believes it was tied to a purchase he made at Target with . his Visa card on Black Friday. However, he called Visa Thursday and the . card issuer couldn't confirm. He says he hasn't been able to get through . Target's call center. Scroll down for video . A Target investigation into the security breach which took place over the busy holiday period showed that the stolen information included names, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses . Hackers are thought to have stolen the credit card details by breaking in to Target's computer systems and installing data mining software on credit card machines. The software installed on 40,000 machines across Target's 1,797 stores read the information on a card's magnetic strip -including account number, sort code and CCV code - when it was swiped through the machine. All the card details were then sent back to the hackers through the internet, before the theft was discovered after nearly three weeks. On . Monday, Browning received a call from his bank's anti-fraud unit saying . that there were two attempts to use his credit card in California - one . at a casino in Tracey, Calif. for $8,000 and the other at a casino in . Pacheco, for $3,000. Both occurred on Sunday and both were denied. He . canceled his credit card and plans to use cash. Although Browning has no . proof, he says he believes the fraud was tied to his Black Friday . purchase at Target. ""I . won't shop at Target again until the people behind this theft are caught . or the reasons for the breach are identified and fixed,"" said Browning. Though smaller than the breach . disclosed in March 2007 by TJX Companies Inc, parent of apparel chains . TJ Maxx and Marshalls, the data theft took place over a much shorter . period and hit shoppers at the beginning of the U.S. holiday season. Target said the breach might have compromised accounts between November 27 and December 15, a period of nearly three weeks. The . data theft revealed by TJX took place over 18 months, affecting 45.7 . million payment cards, according to the company. Banks later said in . court documents that the hackers could have obtained more than 94 . million account numbers in the TJX case. On . Thursday, Target told customers in an alert on its website that the . criminals had stolen customer names, payment card numbers, expiration . dates and their CVV security codes. The company's shares fell in today as the . Secret Service launched an investigation and the first victims of the . theft began to emerge. This data would allow them to produce counterfeit credit cards, and if they were also able to intercept PIN numbers they would be able to create debit cards to withdraw money from ATMs. ""On . December 15, we were able to identify an unauthorized access and we . were able at that time to resolve the issue,"" Target spokeswoman Molly . Snyder said by telephone. Almost all stores: Nearly all of Target's 1,797 stores were targeted as hackers infiltrated 40,000 credit card machines . Krebs . on Security, a closely watched security industry blog that broke the . news on Wednesday, said the breach involved nearly all of Target's 1,797 . stores in the United States and investigators believed the data was . obtained via software installed on point-of-sales terminals used to . swipe magnetic strips on payment cards. It . is not yet clear how the attackers were able to compromise . point-of-sales terminals at so many Target stores. ""It is very clear it . is a sophisticated crime,"" Snyder said. If you think yours was one of the 40 million credit or debit cards involved in a data breach at Target, security experts recommend a policy of watching and waiting: Watch the account you used at the retailer on a daily basis, and wait, because there's no telling when it will be tapped by thieves. With the information that was obtained in the data breach between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 - cardholder names, card numbers and the three-digit security codes - crooks can use them for online transactions or manufacture duplicate cards. ""This could be something that hits your card months from now, so you need to continue to be vigilant,"" says Yaron Samid, chief executive officer of BillGuard, a company that offers a free service monitoring credit and debit cards for unusual activity. Don't look for crazy, big-ticket charges, Samid says. Sophisticated hackers are more likely to make small purchases, sometimes aimed at checking the viability of an account. ""These folks are not going to put a $10,000 charge on one card,"" Samid says. ""They're going to put a $1 charge on 10,000 cards."" Small charges are less likely to be noticed and disputed, he says, and a single charge - even if it's for just 99 cents - enables the crooks to resell the stolen information at a premium, according to Samid. A validated stolen card number is worth more than an untested one, he says. If you used a credit card at Target, you have more protection than if you used a debit card. That's because consumers are protected from the fraudulent use of a credit card. You still have to report the fraud to your card issuer. A fraudulent charge is typically credited back to the consumer's account after a fraud report is made. The card issuer then investigates the complaint and, unless the charge is found to be valid, the credit will be made permanent. With a debit card transaction, money immediately comes from the consumer's bank account. After filing a fraud report with the bank, it is then in the bank's hands when - or if - to return that money. Either way, if a fraudulent charge is spotted, consumers should get a new card. But experts say it's better to err on the side of caution, and - at least for debit card holders - get a new card now. ""I do see this as a very severe breach. Take it very seriously,"" says Mark McCurley, senior information security adviser for Scottsdale, Arizona-based IDT911 Consulting, a company that does data breach prevention and post-breach analysis. McCurley says he used his debit card at a Target store during the period the numbers were stolen. He requested a new debit card and PIN number. ""That's how seriously I'm taking the matter,"" he says. At a minimum, change your PIN number, experts advise. If the thieves have captured your PIN, you can prevent them from getting a cash-back during a transaction or using your card at an ATM machine, McCurley says. Molly Snyder, a spokeswoman for Target, says there is no indication at this point that PINs were collected by the thieves. By Reuters . The . U.S. Secret Service is working on the investigation, according to an . agency spokeswoman. A Federal Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman . declined to comment. ""While . this search for the truth is happening, the issue damages the trust . Target have gained in mobile and calls into question how sales (will) trend in January,"" said Brian Sozzi, chief executive officer of Belus . Capital Advisors. Target spokeswoman said the stolen information was limited to data stored on the magnetic strip and she tried on Friday to downplay the situation . MasterCard . and Visa officials had declined to comment late on Wednesday, after . news of the breach surfaced. An American Express spokeswoman said the . company was aware of the incident and was putting fraud controls in . place. The theft is particularly troublesome for Target because it has has used its red branded credit and debit cards as a marketing tool to lure shoppers with a 5 percent discount. As many as 25 per cent of Target shoppers use the store branded cards. This holiday season, Target added other incentives to use its cards. Two days before Thanksgiving, Target.com ran a special review sale with 25 exclusive offers, from electronics to housewares for those who used the branded card. Households who activate a Target-branded card have increased their spending at the store by about 50 percent on average, the store says. 'This is how Target is getting more customers in the stores,"" said Brian Sozzi, CEO and Chief Equities Strategist. ""It's telling people to use the card. It's been a big win. If they lose that trust, that person goes to Wal-Mart.' Target said it had . alerted authorities and financial institutions immediately after it was . made aware of the unauthorized access and that it was ""putting all . appropriate resources behind these efforts."" The company said it hired a forensics firm to investigate the incident. Target's shares were down 1.7 percent an hour before the market was due to open. The . shares, which have risen 7.4 percent this year, closed at $63.55 on the . New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. The stock has largely . underperformed the broader S&P 500 index, which has risen 27 percent . this year. Hackers . usually sell account information on the black market to those who want . to produce fake cards. Crime rings use the cards to buy gift . certificates from large stores that they later turn into cash, according . to investigators. Target Corp. advised customers to check their statements carefully. Those who see suspicious charges on the cards should report it to their credit card companies and call Target at 866-852-8680.","Almost all of Target's 1,797 stores in the US were targeted as 40,000 credit card swipe machines were hacked .

"She's a 69-year-old grandmother who stands at just four foot nine inches tall, but she's also a world-record breaking weightlifter. Meet Pat Reeves from Kingswinford, West Midlands, who has been competing in powerlifting for the last 26 years and currently holds both the World Champion and British Champion titles in her category. Pat specialises in deadlifts, where a loaded barbel is lifted off the ground and up to the hips, then put back down on the ground. Although she weighs just 7st 9lbs (50 kilos), she regularly lifts around 90 to 100 kilos - twice her body weight. Grandmother Pat Reeves, 69, lifting weights in her home gym in  Kingswinford, West Midlands. The pensioner holds the deadlifting World Champion title and British Champion title for her weight and age category . Now preparing for her 70th birthday, the pensioner is hoping to break further world records by being the oldest woman in the world to compete in her category next year. She said: 'I suppose you could say I'm not a conventional grandma, I'm not about to start knitting - I have dumbbells. 'There is no age limit and that's wonderful, that's one of the wonderful things about powerlifting, you can keep going for as long as you're alive basically. 'Keeping in shape is more important to me than getting old. Age is just a number. 'I have no intention of feeling 70 while I don't have to. Pat Reeves works out regularly in her home gym, where she has been lifting weights for the last 26 years . 'I now compete in the 50.5 weight category and have done for the last four or five years.' Powerlifting consists of three disciplines - squat lifts, bench press and dead lifts. First breaking the world 'deadlift' record back in March, 2010, when she was 64-years-old, Pat has remained determined to hang on to her title – competing every year and upping her record by 0.5 kilos every time. Today, she carries the deadlifting World Champion title and British Champion title for her weight and age category, as well as being the oldest female competitor in Europe. Pat first took up weightlifting 26 years ago, when she was 38 . She said: 'I don't think I ever come across anyone who thinks I'm mad. 'People are bemused by it and some of them will come around and watch me compete. 'And I've never met anyone who said you're too old for this - except a doctor many years ago. He said ""You're too old to lift, give it up."" 'That was probably 18 years ago - it's great proving people wrong.' Pat even claims that her hobby has helped her to battle cancer twice. Pat claims a healthy diet of raw foods has helped her to battle cancer . She first took up weightlifting after becoming diagnosed with brain cancer in 1983 and says that doctors advised the disease was terminal but that she could prolong her life with drugs. Pat turned her back on traditional hospital treatment in favour of healthy-eating and exercise, which she claims was responsible for her beating the disease. She said: 'When I was first diagnosed with cancer doctors told me I would under chemotherapy, radiotherapy, drugs and the prognosis was still the same, I was going to die. 'I didn't want to believe it, I wanted a second opinion and that came back with the same grave results.' I was totally unsatisfied with the NHS that I took matters into my own hands and improved my health. Pat has been competing in weightlifting competitions since taking up the sport in the 80's . 'I dramatically improved my diet which was poor before, initially I just started with a healthier diet, lots of fruit and veg and I did a lot of research about the health benefits of different foods. 'The main thing was exercise, I took up running and then realised it was only really working me from the waist down. 'I then began body building and a coach suggested I got into powerlifting.' After being cleared of brain cancer, Pat was then diagnosed with osteosarcoma – in the shape of 14 bone cancer tumours – in 1994. Pat Reeves holding her 2014 Cup won in Dusseldorf, Germany . Pat has rows and rows of trophies and medals for powerlifting on display in her home gym . She claims that her exercise regime combined with a diet of raw foods was responsible for once again curing her of the disease. She said: 'The powerlifting kept me strong, it worked my whole body and it kept me focused. 'I think we get out of our bodies what we put into them, I healed my body by being good to it with exercise and diet.' But experts warn that this is not a sensible method of curing cancer and should only be used as a complimentary therapy alongside traditional hospital treatment. Oncologist Professor Karol Sikora said: ‘The problem with alternative medicines is they are difficult to disprove and difficult to prove any benefits. ‘This really is an extreme course of treatment and certainly not to be recommended at all. ‘Many doctors are now fans of complementary alternative therapies alongside other treatments but not to replace it. ‘Anyone considering alternative therapies for cancer should discuss it with their consultant first.’","Pat Reeves from the West Midlands has been weightlifting for 26 years .

"Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell's grandmother has revealed that she took the little girl to the police after learning Mama June's boyfriend had sexually abused her, saying: 'I wanted to kill him.' In an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight, Sandra Hale said she believes that her daughter, June Shannon, has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars for child molestation. Anna was just eight when she told a teacher that Mark McDaniel had repeatedly assaulted her. 'My reaction was I wanted to kill him,' Hale said. 'To do that to a child - especially her... I took her to the police department and filed the charges. I wasn't going to let this go away.' Scroll down for videos . Anger: Sandra Hale, the mother of Mama June, had custody of Anna when she was reportedly sexually assaulted by Mark McDaniel, June's boyfriend, in 2002. She has spoken out about her anger at the case . Anna, who is now 20, has previously said that Mama June told her she didn't believe her accusations, and Hale said she thinks she is still refusing to accept them. 'She was in denial and I feel she's still in denial,' she said. It also appears that she's in denial about seeing McDaniel again; despite images showing them together, she has claimed that she has not spoken to him. But Hale says she doesn't believe her - and says that she is now concerned for the safety of Honey Boo Boo who, at aged nine, is a year older than Anna was when she was abused. 'That's about the same age he likes,' she said. Hale said that when child protective services called her this week, she urged them to look 'carefully and closely' into the allegations that McDaniel has been hanging around Mama June's children. Hale's interview came as Anna also spoke to Entertainment Tonight about claims that her mother is dating the man she claims attacked her. 'I'm mad. I'm upset. I feel betrayed. I feel very hurt,' she said. 'That's the main thing that I am - I feel very hurt that Mama let him come around. Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, has spoken out about her anger in an interview with Entertainment Tonight after her mother was pictured with the man who Anna says molested her when she was eight . Hurt: She said that she would spit in Mark McDaniel's face if she saw him again and would tell him to leave . 'She's smiling and giggling when he's around. You know, he's a child molester, Mama. He did this to me. Why would you let him come around the girls knowing what he did?' She said she cannot believe her mother would bring the convicted molester in contact with her younger children, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14. 'You should have told him to leave!' Anna said of her mother. 'If that was me and I was there I would tell him, 'You did this to yourself, and you're not supposed to be around kids. Either you leave or I'll call the cops and your a** will go back to jail'.' She added that she could not understand why her mother is letting him around the girls - as photographs have suggested - especially because she could lose custody of them if a child services investigation finds anything untoward . 'She let him get around Alana and Pumpkin knowing that she is going to get the kids taken away,' she cried. 'Why? Why let him? 'It's Mama's fault. It's her fault. She has to live with it. She has brung the past back and now she can't get the past away now.' When host Nischelle Turner asked her to send a message to McDaniel, she lost her composure and broke down into sobs. 'I would look at him in disgust,' she said. 'I would either spit in his face and say 'Either you f***ing leave or I will call the cops because you're not supposed to be here because you know what you did'.' Together: An image shows Mama June and McDaniel, top, with his hand on Honey Boo Boo's shoulder . Accused: An image shows Mark McDaniel, 53, who served 10 years in prison for child molestation . Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago. She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting toegther and him hanging out with Alana. After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons. Anna claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch. 'I wanted to kill him,' Hale said of finding out about Anna's accusations. On Friday, RadarOnline reported that after Mama June signed the TV deal in 2012, she begged Anna - who was then pregnant - to return home. All smiles: Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, left, dances in front of her mom June Shannon outside their home on Thursday - seemingly unfazed by the scandal surrounding their family . 'June bribed Anna with money to move in with the family,' a source said. 'She offered her $500 a month because she believed Anna's unmarried teenage pregnancy would create good story lines.' McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He was released from prison in March. Cardwell married her husband Michael almost six months ago and they have since moved from Georgia to Alabama with Anna's daughter Kaitlyn for Michael's new truck mechanic job. Earlier this week, Michael, 22, paid tribute to his wife in a touching Facebook post. 'I have to say I probably have the strongest wife in the world,' he wrote. 'Even [through] all this BS and betrayal she has [kept] her head high and not let this get her down. Baby I love you so much.'","Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, spoke out about claims that her mother has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel, who 'abused Anna as a child'

"Mars is most definitely an alien landscape, with its barren craters and huge mountains. However, researchers have now got a new insight into possibly its most bizarre region. Known as 'chaos terrain', the areas have dozens or even hundreds of isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high  scattered through them. Scroll down for video . Hydraotes Chaos, a large basin, approximately the size of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, lies in the Martian highlands, near the equator. The area has  isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high scattered through it. Seen from orbit, they form a bizarre, chaotic pattern. Scientists believe that water in the form of ice was stored in cavities beneath the surface of the highlands early in the history of Mars; this was then heated and thawed out. It was then placed under so much pressure that it escaped to the surface with great force through fissures and fault zones. As it flowed out, the water eroded the terrain and gradually left behind the striking landscape visible today. Among the most interesting landforms on Mars are features referred to as 'chaotic terrain', the DLR, Germany's national aeronautics and space research centre, which created the video, said. Dozens or even hundreds of isolated mountains up to 2000 metres high are scattered in these extensive regions. Seen from orbit, they form a bizarre, chaotic pattern. Such terrains are found over a large area to both the west and east of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the Solar System. Hydraotes Chaos is a typical example of this type of landscape. This large basin, approximately the size of the German state of Baden-Württemberg, lies in the Martian highlands, near the equator. Headwaters of large rivers that flowed from the highlands . 'No comparable landforms are found on Earth,' said DLR. 'Scientists believe that water in the form of ice was stored in cavities beneath the surface of the highlands early in the history of Mars; this was then heated and thawed out. 'It was then placed under so much pressure that it escaped to the surface with great force through fissures and fault zones. The data used to generate these images and the simulated overflight were acquired by ESA's Mars Express spacecraft. The High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC), operated by the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt; DLR) on board . Once again, image strips from orbit 18 – symbolically significant for the HRSC scientists – were edited and used for the animations and images shown here. Over 10 years ago, in January 2004, Mars Express flew over Hydraotes Chaos during orbit 18. This was the third time that the HRSC camera had been switched on, and the images in the image strips, which were over 1000 kilometres long, were so spectacular that they were drawn on for publication of the first images from the successful ESA mission. To be able to show the western half of the Hydraotes Chaos basin in a larger regional context, additional HRSC images from subsequent orbits were used for the large image mosaic. The region shown is around 400 by 200 kilometres. 'As it flowed out, the water eroded the terrain and gradually left behind the striking landscape visible today.' Another factor supporting this theory is that many of the chaotic terrains on Mars are located at the head of large outflow channels, through which enormous quantities of water flowed out of the highlands towards the northern lowlands. The quantities of water that were first stored in Hydraotes Chaos and then flowed northward through Simud Valles must have been enormous. Such terrains are found over a large area to both the west and east of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon in the Solar System. Hydraotes Chaos is a typical example of this type of landscape (inset) They flowed away from a drainage area about 1500 kilometres in diameter, an area approximately the size of central Europe. The Hydraotes basin is 420 kilometres in diameter. It is thought to have formed a very long time ago – over three and a half billion years – during the Noachian Period on Mars. Generation of the images and animations . The images and animations were generated by the Planetary Sciences and Remote Sensing Group at Freie Universität Berlin, which was headed by Gerhard Neukum (1944 – 2014) from the beginning of the Mars Express mission.","Known as 'chaos terrain', the areas have dozens or even hundreds of isolated mountains .

He won a date with contestant Wen-Jing Mo, 28, and the pair went on a romantic holiday to Cyprus. But today she told the Daily Mirror he failed to reveal his past to her and 'manipulated' her into bed. She said she was 'shocked' after discovering the 32-year-old had a criminal conviction, telling the newspaper: 'I have been domestically abused before - when I was 17 - and now my face has a permanent scar from it, a deep scar.

She said she was 'manipulated' into bed and said she would not have slept with him if she had known about his criminal conviction for hitting a woman. She won a date with the 32-year-old following last Saturday's show and the pair went to Cyprus for their romantic getaway. Wen said: 'I'm shocked. There is definitely no way that if I knew a guy had hit a woman that I would have slept with him'. She said she had been 'domestically abused' when she was 17 for about three months and has a permanent scar from the attack . Mr Withers did not tell producers of the show about the conviction or the fact he is a male escort. Wen claimed Mr Withers told her about the fight but did not reveal one of the victims was a woman. She also said he was texting another girl while they were away. ITV said it will not show footage next week of the date where Wen said she agreed to the date after leaving her light on by accident. But if the girls are not interested, they turn out their lights, which has led to the show coining the phrase 'no likey, no lighty'. A source told The Sun of the party at Wyelands House, held to celebrate the new series: 'There was loads of sex going on - people were doing it in front of each other.' Another spoke of one girl who had sex with three men and 'canoodled' with nine others while another reveller told how there were 'condoms everywhere'. Party-goers had apparently been playing a 'lock and key' game where girls are given a padlock and the men a key. The game involves those playing circulating until a match is found. ITV said it was 'relaxed' about the event. Revellers . are believed to have spent £3,000 on alcohol. As they left doors . were found off their hinges, smashed bottles and glasses were . discovered and carpets were ruined by spillages. Wyelands House, owned by developer Paul Bailey and available for rent, has . ornate ceiling cornices, sash windows, marble fireplaces and flagstone . floors, according to its website. The property also has an outdoor pool, giant TV and games room and playground. Mr Bailey's daughter said revellers showed disrespect but said she wouldn't be pursuing it. Yesterday it was discovered that Take Me Out contestant Mr Withers is signed up to the Platinum Select escorts website. On . his profile page on the site, which advertises the services of more . than  5,000 escorts, Withers states his charges as £50 for an hour, £500 . for an overnight visit or £1,500 for the whole weekend. His profile states that he is happy . to entertain 'mature clients', adding: 'I have an awesome personality . and will never struggle to hold conversation.' Selling his wares: Aaron's escort profile page on the Platinum Select website . Referring to his other job, tarmac . worker Withers told the Daily Mirror: 'It seemed like easy money to fund . surf trips when I first came to London, just a bit of fun. 'I was really skint and needed to earn cash.' However, . Withers insisted that he never offered any more than an escort service, . unlike many of his competitors who provide 'X-rated extras'. He added to the paper: 'I certainly didn't offer any more than that.' Withers . was convicted of hitting Amy Kerr and her boyfriend Simon Edwards with a . pool cue during a brawl in a pub in Somerset last summer. He was fined £200 and told to pay both victims £50 compensation each after pleading guilty to the attack. An . ITV spokesperson said Withers' background should have been checked more . thoroughly by the Take Me Out production company TalkbackThames. They . said: 'We are disappointed his record was not picked up in background . checks carried out by talkbackThames, the producers or Take Me Out.' TalkbackThames . said they are now 'reviewing procedures', saying: 'During the . application process we ask contestants to declare any convictions, and . background checks are carried out on each individual, in line with . industry practice.

"Former Everton star Tim Cahill was on target as Australia struggled to a tepid 1-1 draw in an international friendly against an under-strength South Africa in Sydney on Monday. More than 50,000 turned out at the Olympic Stadium to bid farewell to the Socceroos before they depart for the finals but the home side struggled to break down a Bafana Bafana team weakened even from that which went out in the second round of African qualifying.

"She's the bubbly pageant queen with a penchant for glamorous dresses so it made sense for KEY fashion to snap up Amy Willerton to model its new partywear collection. The model and TV star has replaced Ashley Roberts as the face of the brand and showcases the glamorous, girly styles to perfection in the new campaign. Speaking about her new campaign, Amy told MailOnline: 'I am so excited to be modelling this range, it is princess-like, sparkly and girly so I was in my element. Scroll down for video . New face: Amy Willerton has replaced Ashley Roberts as the face of KEY Fashion and showcases the glamorous, girly styles to perfection in the new campaign imagery (£160) 'I wanted to be a princess when I was younger so this is my dream come true. I come from pageantry and full-on glamorous attire is what I love to wear so the opportunity to wear all these beautiful dresses was one I couldn't turn down.' The new range is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and Amy says each and every design makes her feel confident, which, she says, is the most important element of getting ready for a big event. Beauty buff: Amy says it doesn't take her very long to get ready, despite what people may think, and she's really interested in organic beauty and natural remedies (£95) In her element: Amy said she loved modelling the new range because she is a huge fan of girly, feminine fashion (£160) Party perfect: The new range, which Amy launched yesterday at Chotto Matte in Soho, London, is full of party dresses ideal for the season ahead and Amy says each and every design makes her feel confident (£95) What's her secret? Amy eats a clean and lean diet - she loves protein-rich meals - and works out every other day to stay in shape (£160) 'People don't believe me but I get ready very quickly. I try to enhance myself, not change myself. It's important to highlight the best of what you've got,' she said about her beautifying regime. Amy, who describes her personal style as 'girly girl', says another misconception people have is that they think she dresses like a grandmother. 'They say I dress like an old lady but it's because I love the fifties. Everyone is so into looking cool and wearing leather and then I'm there prancing around in my dress.' When it comes to style inspiration, the 22-year-old cites her style icons as Gisele and Grace Kelly; she takes the classic Hollywood look of Grace and combines it with the strong, independent flair of Gisele. She's a pro! Amy recently landed a modelling contract and proves her worth as professional poser modelling the new dresses from the AW14 collection (left: £65, right: £175) Despite getting a taste for the world of fashion in this new campaign, Amy admits she doesn't have the expertise needed to create her own range. 'I know everyone does their own collection but I need to get a taste of it before I would ever consider it. I don't follow trends so I'd suck at designing!,' she said. One project she is considering - and one that she knows all about - is beauty. 'I would love to look into designing my own hair range or natural organic make-up collection. I am a big believer in finding alternative treatments. 'I make my own hair treatments but I can't give you the secret formula in case I develop it!'.

'If I want to feel good, I eat raw, natural food. If mother nature didn't make it, don't eat it,' she says. However, the lithe-limbed star does allow herself the occasional treat and says she's very flexible when it comes to eating. 'I don't let my diet control me, I would never let it rule my life and I love a good pizza. I know from first-hand experience from when I was in the jungle on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here that not eating properly is really bad for your body. I lost a lot of weight but then just piled it all back on afterwards.' The star, who just landed herself a modelling contract with a top agency, says that she exercises every other day and really enjoys it but found the London marathon 'horrific'. Fresh from her latest fashion campaign, Amy has lots of plans in the pipeline but says they're all 'top secret'. Watch this space.

"An autistic man who was removed from his family home died when he choked on a piece of gammon in the care home he was forced into. Mark Bailey died in June last year when he choked on the meat at a specialist care centre in Staffordshire. Sheila and Charles Bailey claim their son  would still be alive today if a family court had ruled in their favour in 2011. Mrs Bailey said: 'The social services through the council have totally destroyed our lives.' Mark Bailey, 40, (right) died when he choked on a piece of gammon at a specialist care centre - his parents (left) claim their son would still be alive today if he had been allowed to continue living at the family home . Mark Bailey moved to the Choices care home, in Staffordshire (pictured) in October 2012 when Stoke-on-Trent City Council secured a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard through the courts - but he died in June 2013 . The 40-year-old was removed from his Penkhull home in 2011 when his condition deteriorated and concerns were raised over whether his parents could still look after him. Stoke-on-Trent City Council secured a Deprivation of Liberty Safeguard (DOLS) through the courts, which was later ratified by a Court of Protection judge. It allows a person to be detained for their own protection in a care home and was needed after Mrs Bailey refused to voluntarily place her son in a care setting. Mark was moved to the Choices care home, in Staffordshire, at the end of October 2012 and died in June 2013. An inquest yesterday heard Mark choked on a piece of gammon and suffered a heart attack and brain damage. His life-support machine was switched off a week later. Mark died when he choked on a piece of gammon and suffered a heart attack and brain damage . Mrs Bailey said: 'When he was moved, he asked me when he would be allowed to come home and it just broke my heart' Mark, pictured at his sister, Nicola's wedding in 1987 - she said Mark was always very friendly and smiling . And today, his parents said their son would still be alive today if he had not been taken away from them. Mrs Bailey, 75, said: 'He would still be here today if he had stayed at home. We brought him up and looked after him for nearly 40 years. No-one can look after your own child as well as you. I just wanted him back. 'But at first they put the DOLS order on him for four months and then it was for another four months. It just kept going on and on.' 'When he was moved he asked me when he would be allowed to come home, and it just broke my heart. 'He used to love Christmas, and we put up all the decorations for him to come back over that time, but the social services wouldn't even bring him round for Christmas, so we just took all the decorations down again. 'We were still quite capable of looking after him, but we have been treated so badly by the social services.' Mark, aged 15, pictured with friends in a production of the musical 'Oklahoma' (he is on the far right) Mark's sister Nicola, said: 'Mark was very friendly, he was always smiling and people used to call him ""Smiler""' Mark was removed from his Penkhull home in 2011 when his condition deteriorated and concerns were raised over whether his parents could still look after him . Restrictions were later placed on Mrs Bailey, limiting her to just supervised visits after she attempted to take Mark on a day trip from the care home. She added: 'One time, all I wanted was to take him to a coffee morning, but they didn't let him go because they said they hadn't got enough staff to take him. 'I said I could take him on my own, but they wouldn't let me. 'Eventually they said they would call the police because I wouldn't leave without him. 'I haven't been to visit him in the cemetery yet, because I just think of him with tubes in him when we had to switch off the life-support machine. It was heartbreaking.' Mark's sister Nicola Walker, aged 47, of Basford, said: 'My mum wasn't allowed to see Mark and that caused family problems. 'I wasn't living in the area at the time and when my dad went to see Mark my mum got upset. I can understand why social services went for the DOLS order but it caused us a lot of issues. 'Mark was very friendly, he was always smiling and people used to call him 'Smiler'. He would approach strangers and shake hands with them.' Choices managing director Nigel Downs said: 'Our sincere sympathies go to Mark's family. We are dedicated to providing high-quality care and we continue to reflect on all our procedures. 'It is very distressing to all concerned when we experience a very rare incident occurring like this.' Stoke-on-Trent City Council councillor Gwen Hassall, cabinet member for social care, said: 'Mark Bailey was subject to DOLS issued by the Court of Protection, and the city council had no concerns about the provider or the placement. 'His death was a tragic accident, and our heartfelt condolences go out to his family.'","Mark Bailey choked on a piece of meat in Choices care home, Staffordshire .

"A London firefighter has told the Hillsborough inquest that he was 'dumbfounded' at the lack of help for stricken fans as disaster struck. Anthony O'Keefe had left his seat and gone on the pitch to help victims, as supporters were being crushed to death on the Leppings Lane terrace of the Sheffield stadium as the FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest got under way on April 15 1989. The Liverpool fan, who had been a fireman with London Fire Brigade for three years at the time of the  match, said he was 'amazed' at the lack of response from emergency services at Hillsborough. London firefighter Anthony O'Keefe has told the Hillsborough inquest that he was 'dumbfounded' at the lack of help for stricken fans as disaster struck . Mr O'Keefe, who gave evidence at the inquest in his London Fire Service uniform, said after the match was abandoned he left his seat in the stand above the Leppings Lane terrace and made his way to the pitch. He said: 'I was dumbfounded, the fact that by the time I got on the pitch, it was enough time to get some emergency response.' Mr O'Keefe said while there, he saw a local firefighter in uniform with an oxygen cylinder. He continued: 'I asked him, I said, ""Where are all the firefighters?"" 'He said a phrase, something like, ""there's 10 or 12 appliances outside, they think there's a major riot going on"". 'By then it was getting really frustrating.' Mr O'Keefe said when he first got on the pitch he had been given a green First Aid armband by a St John's Ambulance man and told, 'Go and see what you can do.' He continued: 'What I witnessed was something unbelievable. The Liverpool fan, who had been a fireman with London Fire Brigade for three years at the time of the match, said he was 'amazed' at the lack of response from emergency services at Hillsborough . 'There was so many that was in need of care I felt so isolated. 'There's people lying all over this pitch and a line of police officers right across the middle and some police officers here helping with fans. 'This should not be happening, there should be some more response. I don't think all the time I was there, there was no great organisation. 'I would not want to use swear words but it was absolute chaos. It just beggars belief. I was just amazed at the lack of emergency response.' Mr O'Keefe found he could do nothing to save a number of fans but gave chest compressions and mouth to mouth resuscitation to a number of others before helping to carry an injured fan to the stadium gym - hastily turned into a casualty station and mortuary. Christina Lambert QC, counsel to the inquest, asked the witness: 'When you went in the gym, what did you see?' Mr O'Keefe said: 'It just seemed like chaos. 'The thing I will always remember is the way there was bodies just laid out in a strange order. 'In rows. A young Liverpool fan looks at tributes left at the Hillsborough 25th Anniversary Memorial Service in April . 'Dead and alive in the same vicinity.' He was told if he found no sign of life in an injured fan to put a T-shirt over that person's head. He then stayed with a young fan who was shouting, 'Am I going to die?' to reassure him and telephone his mother to let her know he was still alive. The disaster, in 1989, claimed the lives of 96 people. Earlier the inquest jury heard from Stephen Curry, an experienced football writer for a national newspaper who was reporting on the match from the press box in the main stand at the game. Mr Curry said around 15 minutes before kick-off, he noticed the build up of fans in the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace behind the goal where the fans were crushed, and used a pair of binoculars to scan the scene as the disaster unfolded. Mr Curry, a sports journalist for 27 years at the time, said: 'You get a feeling for these things when you have been going around football matches four, five times a week. You get a feeling for when things are brewing. It's almost like an instinct. I felt it that day. 'I said to a Liverpool radio colleague, ""I don't like the look of what's going on around there"".' He agreed there was an 'extraordinary imbalance' between the central pens which were 'absolutely heaving' but plenty of room in the pens either side. Fans hold up scarves during the memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough at Anfield stadium, in April this year . Mr Curry said: 'It appears people were in the wrong pens. They should be balanced across the whole (terrace).' He was asked about police reaction as it became apparent disaster was looming. Mr Curry replied: 'Well there did not seem to be any. I was actually shouting in the press box, ""Open the gates!"" Yet nobody opened the gates. I just could not understand it.' Mr Curry agreed officers on the ground appeared to 'lack organisation and leadership,' and after the match was abandoned at 3.06pm the scene on the pitch was, 'Chaotic. Totally chaotic,' with the police, 'extremely slow to react to what was happening'. Mr Curry agreed in a statement he gave earlier this year he described the Hillsborough Stadium as 'not fit for purpose' to host the FA Cup semi-final. The witness said the ground was not used to having full houses of 50,000 fans and it was 'common sense' Liverpool fans should have been given the much larger Spion Kop end of the Sheffield ground not the Leppings Lane end. The witness said he was a well known journalist and Manchester United fan and had spoken to Liverpool fans before the game. He said: 'It was all very friendly banter, as it always is with Liverpool fans.' Mr Curry was then asked about other witnesses, including police officers, who said they could smell alcohol on the Liverpool fans. He replied: 'I have to say whenever a football match is organised at whatever level, you can smell alcohol because fans have a drink before a match.' He added: 'I have been a student of football for 50 years and I have to say at this point, in my view, Liverpool football fans are some of the best in the country...they understand the game, they're passionate about the game, they are amusing. You get a bad egg in every few dozen if you want, but overall I think Liverpool fans do themselves justice at home and abroad.' The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow morning.

"A coroner has issued a warning about the dangers of the sea after a woman died as she had a paddle in the English Channel in rough conditions on Christmas Day in 2012. Alan Craze, the East Sussex coroner, hoped the death of Frances McKeown, 51, would act as a 'salutary reminder' that the sea needs to be treated with 'respect'. He spoke after hearing how Ms McKeown was swept to her death amid force nine winds and waves of more than 6ft high off the coast of St Leonards. Tragic: Frances McKeown drowned while paddling in the sea close to Hastings on Christmas Day . The inquest, at Hastings Magistrates' Court, heard she had joined an informal gathering of people for a paddle on Christmas Day morning after reading about it on Facebook. Ms McKeown, a community development worker, lined up with up to 11 people on the beach before a  countdown was shouted out. As some who ran in turned round to come back up the shoreline, Ms McKeown stumbled and was pulled back into the surf, the inquest heard. Her partner of 15 years, John North, had been filming her but soon noticed her in difficulty. He said in a statement: 'I was calling her name and could still see her being taken by the waves and off where there was a groyne.' A buoyancy aid was fetched to try to reach Ms McKeown as she was being swamped by the waves, but it could not be flung far enough. Mr North said: 'I want to be clear that Fran didn't have any intention to swim that day. She just wanted to get her feet wet. Scene: Ms McKeown died on a stretch of coastline at St Leonard's in East Sussex . 'She had some health problems that she was managing. This dip was her way of taking advantage of the mobility that she had.' Describing . her as a socialable person who loved life and cherished those close to . her, Poole-born Ms McKeown was looking forward to a holiday to Kenya at . the time. Witness Jim McSweeney, a teacher, told the inquest: 'She seemed to be getting further and further out, and was still waving. 'The . waves were just huge. Then a few minutes later an enormous wave hit her . on the head, and when she came up she was face down and floated towards . the pier.' Another swimmer, . Dean Skelton, said: 'That day has taught me a lot about the sea. I have . never experienced anything like that before.' He added: 'I feel it was the swell and the strength of the under-current that no-one could see.' Mr Skelton said that six or seven people had entered the sea for about 35 seconds, and he had to be pulled out.

"A Nigerian sex trafficking victim forced to work as a prostitute in the UK was cut on her back, shoulders, chest and legs with a machete during a black magic ceremony designed to scare her into secrecy, a court heard. The woman, who was 20 at the time, told Cardiff Crown Court how she was left with scars all over her body after being subjected to the 'juju ceremony', in which she was also forced to eat a live snail. The young woman is one of two who was allegedly trafficked from Nigeria into Britain by Lizzy Idahosa, 24, and her husband Jackson Omoruyi, 41. Lizzy Idahosa, 24, from London, (left) denies trafficking two women into and around the UK and inciting them to work as prostitutes. Her partner and co-accused Jackson Omoruyi, 41, (right) also denies three charges . Giving evidence, the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'The juju man was standing there with a big knife, like you use for cutting grass. I was scared because I did not know what he was going to do to me. 'He used the blade to make marks on me. It was sore and it left me with scars.' Idahosa, from London, has been charged with trafficking the two women into and around the UK and inciting them to work as a prostitutes. She denies a total of seven charges, which also include transferring criminal property. Her partner and co-accused Omoruyi denies three charges of inciting the women to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. On the first day of the trial, prosecutor Caroline Rees told the court how the woman, who lost her mother when she was 10, had wanted to travel to London to find her father. She had met a woman in Nigeria who promised to help her travel to England, but who first made her take part in a 'juju ceremon'y where she was forced to eat a live snail, an egg and some dust. The woman who was allegedly cut with a machete at a 'juju ceremony' was arrested while working as a prostitute at the Ambassador Suite in Cardiff (above) She was told that if she broke her vows of secrecy, she would become ill or infertile. She told the court: 'Before I got to the house, I had no idea what would happen. When I arrived, Lizzy's sister and the juju man told me I would be swearing an oath. 'I was there for a couple of hours. They brought out a live snail and broke its shell, then they asked me to swallow it. They gave me some dirty water to drink. 'I had to give my underwear to his assistant and the juju man cut the backs of my legs with a machete and marked me with a razor blade. 'It made me bleed and I had pain in my legs. I did everything they asked me because I really wanted to go to London.' Adedamola Aderemi, representing Idahosa, suggested that the woman had fabricated the story of the juju ceremony and explained such rituals were common in Nigerian films. He also suggested her scars were traditional marks given to children in Nigeria. The court heard that, following the ceremony, the woman had travelled to London using a fake passport and visa. She then met up with Idahosa, who told her she would have to pay £50,000 for her travel costs and started sending her to brothels to earn money to pay her debt. The woman said she had worked in eight brothels across the UK, including some in Cardiff and Swansea. She told the court that during a typical day at one brothel in Cardiff she would get up at 10am and get dressed in her underwear before waiting for men to arrive mid-morning. She said she would then have intercourse with up to eight men each day who would pay her £50 in cash. The court heard that on one occasion, she had refused to work at a brothel in Swansea. She said: 'They tried to control me and I did not like it, so I left. They told me I had to sleep with all the men, even if I was tired. I was not allowed to sleep. When Lizzy found out, she shouted at me.' Jackson Omoruyi (pictured above during his arrest) is accused of inciting two women to become prostitutes and transferring criminal property. He denies the charges and the trial continues at Cardiff Crown Court . Cardiff Crown Court heard that Idahosa and Omoruyi used African witchcraft to force the women to comply . When asked why she had not run away, she replied: 'Lizzy told me if I disobeyed her, the juju would kill me or make me go mad. She told me she would send someone to kill my sister and brother.' When asked during a police interview if she still believed in juju, she said she did not know. The woman was arrested while working at the Ambassador Suite in Cardiff in June 2010.

"Budget carrier Tigerair is offering dirt cheap $13 airfares for flights around Australia in a four-hour Halloween sale on Friday night. But the airline is gambling its servers won't be spooked by an expected stampede of bargain-hunters when the sale goes live at 8pm tonight. The low-cost tickets will be offered on nine routes, including Sydney to the Whitsundays, Brisbane to Darwin, Adelaide to Sydney and Gold Coast to Sydney. Scroll down for video . The airline is offering $13 fares to locations around Australia between 8pm and midnight AEDT on Friday evening . Tigerair says consumers should 'pounce' on the fare deal . 'We're certainly prepared for a surge in demand this evening,' Tigerair spokeswoman Vanessa Regan told Daily Mail Australia, adding the company was 'very hopeful' their systems would cope. The sale comes less than a week after angry travellers took to social media to criticise Jetstar's website and phone lines crashing in the midst of a one day sale frenzy. The special airfares only apply to 'thousands of seats' between June 2 and June 24, 2015: . Adelaide – Melbourne . Hobart – Melbourne . Melbourne – Mackay . Gold Coast – Sydney . Adelaide – Brisbane . Adelaide – Sydney . Sydney – Whitsunday Coast . Brisbane – Cairns . Brisbane – Darwin . Thousands tried to snap up cheap $88 flights from Australia to Bali when seats went on sale, but Jetstar's systems crashed shortly after it began. As angry travellers vented on Twitter using the hashtag #JetstarFail, the airline apologised to its customers. While Tigerair is confident it will avoid a system meltdown, they could face customer backlash over the hidden credit card charge attached to the $13 fares and limited availability. The fares are only on offer for flights between June 2 and June 24 next year. That is the period before school holidays in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. The bargain fare does not include that $8.50 'booking and service fee' for credit card users, although Australian Mastercard debit card holders can escape being slugged the extra fare. The airfares include 10kg of carry-on baggage. Ms Regan said the sale is likely to 'surprise, shock and sweeten your senses' and urged customers to 'pounce' on the deal as soon as possible.","Budget carrier Tigerair will offer $13 fares on nine domestic routes .

"Tornadoes in the United States are increasingly hitting in swarms rather than as isolated twisters, new figures reveal. The average number of twisters per year - around 500 - has not changed for decades. But now as many as 115 can strike in just one day, leaving more weeks tornado-free. And the pattern does not seem to be reverting. Scroll down for video . Shift: Clusters of tornadoes are hitting the United States as opposed to isolated twisters, a study showed . It means emergency services already struggling to deal with large-scale hits like Hurricane Katrina will have to dramatically step up their resources. The study released by US government meteorologists on Thursday charted the nation's tornado database from 1954 to 2013, excluding twisters with wind speeds below 112mph. It found that since 1970s, at least five days a year will see 20 or more tornadoes - more than double the average beforehand. In recent years, there were on average three days with more than 30 tornadoes, compared with just one day a year four decades ago. And on the list of the 10 single days with the most tornadoes since 1954, eight have occurred since 1999, including five since 2011. That year alone had days with 115, 73, 53 and 52 twisters. 'We need more resources … even if we don't use them very often,' Harold Brooks, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told Science. May is the month with the most tornado activity, followed by June and April. Although some weather experts have blamed climate change for the shift in patterns, the report does not stipulate a cause. 'Knowing that the climate now has changed from that of the 1970s makes for a circumstantial argument in favor of a changing climate playing at least some role in the tornado changes,' said meteorologist Patrick Marsh of NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. 'There are indications that heavy rainfall events are occurring with greater frequency globally, and given a warmer climate, this makes sense,' added Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Greg Carbin. Urgent: Experts warn emergency services must step up the level of resources to deal with natural disasters . But 'any trend in tornado events is much more difficult to discern,' Carbin added. 'The links in the chain connecting them aren't complete yet,' Brooks told Science. Records for both the most and fewest tornadoes over a 12-month period have come in the past five years, with 1,050 from June 2010 to May 2011 and 236 tornadoes from May 2012 to April 2013. Tornadoes, rapidly spinning columns of air usually spawned by rotating thunderstorms, can be among the most violent weather events. They have been reported on every continent except Antarctica but most often hit a U.S. region covering the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest and South. Tornadoes can cause extensive loss of life and property damage like the May 2011 twister in Joplin, Missouri, that killed about 160 people and wrecked thousands of homes.","Average number of twisters is the same but more are hitting at once .

"A British photographer captured these stunningly detailed portraits – using only an iPhone. Allie Astell, 42, from Bath, moved to Egypt in 2011, where she found she enjoyed taking photographs of her Bedouin neighbours. The resulting pictures appear as if they were taken on a professional camera costing thousands of pounds, but in fact the technology used to produce them is found in most people's pockets. Allie Astell moved to Egypt in 2011, where she enjoys taking photographs of the local Bedouin people . Ms Astell said she first started using her mobile phone to snap photos because the Bedouin were wary of large lenses. By using her iPhone she was able to be less intrusive and found it easier to get intimate portraits. She said: 'I don't like carrying around a huge camera. I find it intimidates people and you can take a more natural photo with a phone than with a digital SLR camera. 'It just fits in my handbag and it's easy to take photos quickly.

"The King of Spain's sister has been charged with tax fraud as part of claims her Olympic medallist husband embezzled millions of Euros in public funds. The High Court on the island of Mallorca upheld the charge today against 49-year-old Princess Cristina de Borbon, whose brother was crowned as King Felipe VI just five months ago. It is the latest twist in a corruption scandal which has engulfed several members of the Spanish elite. Scroll down for video . Accused: Spain's Princess Cristina earlier this year outside the courts in Palma de Mallorca, where she returned today to be told she will face charges of tax fraud after a long-running investigation into her husband . High-profile: Princess Cristina with her husband Iñaki Urdangarín, a bronze medal-winning Olympic handball player who is accused of embezzling millions of Euros of public funds. The couple have both denied wrongdoing . Investigations have unearthed high-level corruption across Spain involving top players from politicians to bankers to trade unions. Allegations have ranged from backhanders being slipped to officials at town halls to unchecked spending on company credit cards. Princess Cristina's husband Iñaki Urdangarín, who won bronze medals for Spain in its handball team at the 1996 and 2000 Olympics, is at the centre of many of the claims. The 46-year-old is accused of using his connections to win public contracts to put on events through his non-profit Noos Foundation, as well as embezzling millions of Euros in public funds. He has been charged with breach of legal duty, embezzling . public funds, fraud, influence-peddling and money-laundering. The couple, who have four children, have both denied . wrongdoing. Royalty: King Felipe VI (pictured) was crowned just five months ago after his father Juan Carlos abdicated . Couple: The Royal pair pictured on their wedding day in 1997.

And it is not guaranteed that she will face trial over the tax fraud claims, as Spanish law says the alleged victim - in this case Spain's government - must support the charges. The anti-corruption prosecutor of the Balearics, where the investigation is centred, has said repeatedly that he does not believe there is evidence that the princess committed a crime. Today's ruling came after the couple's defence lawyers appealed the charges of tax fraud and money-laundering, which were made by a lower court in Palma de Mallorca in June.

Stephen Coward resigned last month after video evidence (pictured left) and emails became available showing he'd been using Clearwater Fire Station 51 for rendezvous with women other than his wife . Coward admitted to acting inappropriately, and said he had sex with the woman in both the dive truck and the weight room. WFLA reports the footage shows Coward inside the bathroom of his firehouse dormitory room engaging in intercourse with an unidentified woman. In the video, he is smiling and holding up a cell phone in the mirror. The Clearwater fire chief received a flash drive containing the video and 40 emails on August 6th. Shaw told WFTS a letter contained in the package urged the city to investigate. Yet another anonymous tipster came forward to tell authorities Coward had been with as many as eight different women while on the job.

"In the X Men films, Wolverine has mutant powers which mean he can heal himself - even when he’s shot, or thrown from a building. And now researchers in the US are working on an implant that would make these superhuman powers a reality. The ElectRx - pronounced 'electrics' - concept involves implanting tiny devices into patients’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs. The ElectRx - pronounced electrics - project (illustrated) involves implanting tiny devices into patients’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs. Each implant would be so small, it could be injected into patients using a needle to target nerve endings . The program is being sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Each implant would be so small, it could be injected into patients using a needle. The ElectRx - pronounced electrics - project involves implanting tiny devices into patients’ bodies that use electric impulses to monitor and fix vital organs. Each implant would be so small, it could be injected into patients using a needle. As it is sits inside the body, the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body’s organs. If it spots an organ is infected, injured or failing, it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ back to functioning effectively. The idea behind the implant is based on the body’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation. As it is sits inside the body, the implant would use electric impulses to monitor the health of the body’s organs. If it spots that an organ is infected, injured or failing, it would stimulate the nerves needed to get the affected organ functioning effectively again. The idea behind the implant is based on the body’s natural monitoring system known as neuromodulation. In the body’s peripheral nervous system, neuromodulation monitors the status of organs and manages how they respond to disease. But, when a person is sick or injured, this process can be weakened and doesn’t work as well as it should. In some cases, it can cause people to become more ill as the body fails to fight the infection. The implant being proposed by Darpa would give this natural process a boost, and prevent it from going wrong. Current medical neuromodulation devices are large and difficult to implant, but Darpa's implant would be small enough to target precise nerve endings. In the X Men franchise, Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman pictured) has mutant powers that means he can heal himself - even after being shot, or thrown from a building. Darpa's implant would work in a similar way to give the body’s natural monitoring and healing system, known as neuromodulation, a boost . ‘The technology Darpa plans to develop through the ElectRx program could fundamentally change the manner in which doctors diagnose, monitor and treat injury and illness’ said Doug Weber, Darpa program manager. ‘Instead of relying only on medication - we envision a closed-loop system that would work in concept like a tiny, intelligent pacemaker. It would continually assess conditions and provide stimulus patterns tailored to help maintain healthy organ function, helping patients get healthy and stay healthy using their body’s own systems.’ Darpa claims the device would be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury and even depression, for example. The agency said it will release full technical details on ElectRx ‘in the coming months’.","The ElectRx – pronounced electrics - project is sponsored the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

"Debi Marshall has written a book on the The Family Court Murders in Sydney in the 1980s . Investigative journalist Debi Marshall was warned to steer clear of the The Family Court Murders by everyone involved in the unsolved case. However, her gut instinct told her to keep digging regardless of the potential dangers she would inevitably be confronted with on her search for the truth that is unveiled in her latest book. The Tasmanian true crime writer refused to let fear stop her from embarking on a terrifying journey in an attempt to help solve the case involving four murders, five bombings and two shootings in Sydney between 1980 - 1985. 'For the sake of justice, it had to be written,' she said. Marshall gained the trust of all of the victim's frightened families who finally agreed to break their wall of silence. But it was the chilling moment when Marshall came face-to-face with the man named as a suspect, Leonard Warwick, that she really felt she was placing her life on the line for the sake of justice. Strike Force Reddan was established in July 2013 to look into the case with investigations ongoing. Detective Superintendent Michael Willing said the horrific crimes are embedded in the psyche of not only NSW but the entire country. 'The review process is very much ""behind the scenes"" and involves looking at all existing materials, considering changes to technology, forensics and even the law,' he said. 'Throughout the years, these crimes have been investigated by some of the best detectives this state has ever seen.' Here Marshall tells the gripping story of her dogged determination to unveil the truth of a 30-year-old case: . Don't prod that snake. That was the message given to me by people involved in the so-called Family Court Murders in Sydney between 1980 and 1985, an audacious series of bombings and shootings in which four people were killed and dozens more seriously wounded. But despite a suspect, Leonard Warwick – who is still alive and living in Sydney - being publicly named by the coroner in two inquests, incredibly, after more than three decades, the cases remain unsolved. Leonard Warwick – who is still alive and living in Sydney - was named by the coroner in two inquests into the Family Court Murders ranging from 1980 - 1985 . Warwick's wife at the time Andrea (left) and their daughter Trudi (right) Trudi (left) on a shooting trip with her father Leonard Warwick (right) circa mid - 1990s . These were hits at the very heart of our judicial system and that they remain unsolved is staggering. Two shooting murders in 1980: the suspect's brother-in-law, Stephen Blanchard and four months later, Justice David Opas, one week before he was due to hand down judgement in the suspect's legal battle with his then wife, Andrea. There were no further murders for three years – and then all hell broke loose again. In 1984, Justice Gee's home was bombed, an explosion that miraculously, the family survived. Gee had taken over Opas' court list. The following month, the Parramatta Family Court was bombed. The wife of Justice Watson was killed instantly when a bomb exploded as she opened the front door of their home unit. Watson had taken over Gee's court list. The following year, there was an attempted murder of Andrea's former solicitor, with a bomb placed in the wrong car, and five months later, a suburban Jehovah's Witness hall was bombed, in which one man was killed and scores more seriously wounded. Warwick's brother-in-law Stephen Blanchard (pictured right as a teenager with his father Leslie) was shot and killed in 1980 . Four months later, Justice David Opas (pictured with his two children Josh and Persia) was shot and killed, one week before he was due to hand down judgement in Warwick's legal battle with wife Andrea . Justice Watson's wife was killed when a bomb exploded as she opened their front door in 1984 . While police scrambled in a deadly game of cat and mouse to catch the killer, who remained an elusive one step ahead, an emotionally beaten Andrea relinquished custody of her precious daughter to her ex-husband. And the bombings stopped. When I was researching the book, everyone involved in the case all gave me the same advice: Don't prod that snake. But as an investigative crime journalist and author of five true-crime books, (including Killing for Pleasure on which the feature film, Snowtown, was based and Justice in Jeopardy, which helped overturn Australia's double jeopardy laws) how could I turn away from this story through fear? For the sake of justice, it had to be written. The research was tough and heartbreaking. To my amazement, I found that not one person involved in these cases had been contacted by NSW police in more than three decades. Victim's families and the suspect's former wife and daughter cowered behind a wall of silence. They had long ago given up hope that the murders and injuries of their loved ones would be solved and had vowed never to speak to journalists. It took time to gain their trust, but eventually they all agreed to tell their stories – including Andrea and their daughter. Justice Richard Gee pictured with his late wife Helen and their children Stephen and Alison. It was a miracle they survived the bombing of their home in 1984 . There is an incredible poignancy in holding the hands of victim's families as they articulate their grief. More than three decades on, the heartache of these people – wives, children, husbands – remains palpable, as does their anger that no arrest has been made. Why hasn't it? It is true enough that in the 1980s - despite circumstantial evidence against Warwick - that police did not have that smoking gun. But I found further circumstantial evidence which, coupled with today's new evidentiary regime, warrants - according to a senior criminal barrister - his immediate arrest. What we need to ask is: what are police doing? Alone, I attempted to interview the suspect at the house he shares on Sydney's outskirts with his second wife. My mouth was parched as I walked up his long driveway – and as he walked silently, threateningly towards me, his hands plunged deep in his pockets. I panicked, for a moment. Was he hiding a weapon? His ice-cube eyes bored into mine as he told me, in no uncertain terms, to get off his property. I've had some extremely frightening moments in my extensive true-crime career, writing about serial killers, paedophiles and psychopaths; up close and personal more times than I can remember to the dark heart of the human soul. Graham Wykes (pictured with his wife Joy) was murdered when a Jehovah's Witness hall was bombed in 1984 . But nothing has been as frightening as turning my back on this man and taking the long walk back down that driveway, alone. Nothing as frightening as being warned by today's investigating unsolved homicide team to 'watch my back' when the book was released and being told that Warwick is not under surveillance. Nothing as frightening as being warned, repeatedly not to 'prod that snake' and looking over my shoulder every time I left the house. Was it worth the danger? Will the New South Wales Unsolved Homicide Team and the Department of Public Prosecutions finally decide to test the evidence against Leonard Warwick? Will the Family Court murders finally be solved? Was it worth prodding that snake? Read the book. You be the judge. Debi Marshall’s book The Family Court Murders is out now through Ebury Australia, for $34.99 .

"Former Newcastle favourite Steve Harper has called on the club’s fans to give rookie goalkeeper Jak Alnwick a rousing welcome when he makes his full home debut in Sunday’s Tyne-Wear derby. The 21-year-old has been passed fit for the visit of Sunderland after injuring his shoulder during Wednesday’s 4-0 defeat at Spurs. Alnwick was to blame for two of the home goals but Harper feels criticism is the last thing the young stopper needs ahead of such a mammoth match. Steve Harper has called on the club’s fans to give their support to young keeper Jak Alnwick . Alnwick has been passed fit despite injurying his shoulder during the 4-0 defeat against Tottenham . ‘Rather than criticism, Jak Alnwick needs a proper Geordie reception when he runs out to give him a lift,’ said Hull keeper Harper, who made 199 appearances for the Magpies. ‘Get behind the young lad by singing his name to pick him up and watch him grow in response to it.’ Had Alnwick been injured, Newcastle would have made an application to the Premier League to sign a goalkeeper on an emergency loan deal. But midfielder Moussa Sissoko says the squad have every faith in the academy graduate. ‘It (mistake at Spurs) was nothing,’ he said. ‘We are not worried about it – anybody can make a mistake in a game. It’s okay, we have to forget about this. Jak is strong, he will be fine for Sunday.’ Stand-in keeper Alnwick injured his shoulder in Wednesday night’s Capital One Cup defeat at Tottenham . Newcastle lost 4-0 against Tottenham as Alnwick had a game to forget, gifting two of the goals on Wednesday . Meanwhile, Sissoko has made a point of assuring fans that the players are aware of the fixture’s importance, despite having lost the last three. ‘We know Sunday is a big game for us and for the city,’ he said. ‘You have to forget the 4-0 defeat against Tottenham and try to be ready for the Sunderland match because it is massive for us. ‘We know that we haven’t been good enough in the recent games against them. ‘I can assure the supporters we know what it means. Every player is ready.’","Newcastle United face Sunderland in the Tyne-Wear derby on Sunday .

"When Henry Slade was first told by Exeter Chiefs director of rugby Rob Baxter that he had been picked at outside centre, he thought there had been a mistake on the team-sheet. But such is his quality that on Friday night, barely three months after making the switch from fly-half to No 13, the 21-year-old will take the field against Sale ready to demonstrate once again why many believe he could yet be the long-term solution to England’s unsettled midfield. ‘We get the team emailed to us,’ Slade told Sportsmail. ‘We had a pre-season game in August and when I first saw the team I thought “what is that?” I thought it was a typo. I’d played a bit at 12 when I was younger and played full back for Plymouth Albion on loan a few years ago. But I hadn’t played 13 before. Henry Slade was moved from fly-half to outside centre three months ago and has been a revelation . Slade has drawn comparisons with Wallaby great Matt Giteau since making the switch . ‘You never know how switching positions will work out but I’ve been over the moon with the amount of game time I’ve had. I’d much rather be playing 12 or 13 than be sat on the bench.’ Put simply, Slade has been a revelation. After first catching the eye with a supremely confident performance at No 10 against Jonny Wilkinson and his Toulon galacticos last season, Slade struggled for regular game-time with the ever-reliable Gareth Steenson preferred. But Baxter’s inspired decision to move the playmaker into the centre has led to comparisons with Wallaby great Matt Giteau and coincided with third-placed Exeter’s best start to an Aviva Premiership campaign. ‘It’s an exciting time to be at Exeter,’ Slade said. ‘We’re playing some really good rugby and winning games in different ways. We’ve really developed our game. Many believe he could yet be the long-term solution to England’s unsettled midfield . ‘The other week against Saracens we won by playing a tactical kicking game, while other games we’ve won through the strength of our attacking game. We’ve shown different ways that we can play. Personally I’ve been really pleased with how it’s gone. I couldn’t be happier in the centre. ‘Giteau is one of the best examples of a 10 playing in the midfield. He is probably a guy I try to emulate in terms of being a playmaker in the midfield. ‘Playing well against someone like Jonny Wilkinson last season gave me a lot of confidence.’ While his superb feet, smart kicking game and high-class distribution have been widely lauded, Slade’s defence has also been immaculate. Slade takes on Fionn Carr of Connacht during the European Rugby Challenge Cup match in October . In an Aviva Premiership defeat to Leicester earlier in the season, the 92kg youngster completely nullified his hulking opposite man Manu Tuilagi. Victory in Salford tonight would move Baxter’s team to the top of the Premiership table, with Northampton and Leicester both playing tomorrow. And another impressive show by Slade will keep his name in the frame for the Six Nations after being drafted into England’s Pennyhill Park training camp during the autumn. The clock may be ticking on next year’s World Cup, but Slade is refusing to give up hope. ‘Of course the World Cup’s on everyone’s minds,’ he said. ‘There’s not a lot of time left now. But anything can happen. We saw during last World Cup when Stephen Donald was the fourth-choice All Black 10 going into that and ended up playing in the final. There are always surprises in World Cup year so who knows?’","Henry Slade made switch from fly-half to outside centre three months ago .

"For a man so incredibly quick with his feet, Jefferson Montero was hardly rushing to follow his father into the family business. Banana farming in the plantation surrounding his home in Ecuador was one outcome he desperately wanted to avoid. ‘It’s hard, hard work,’ says the Swansea winger. ‘Long days and hard. For sure, that would be me now if I did not play football. ‘I worked in the farms for a while but I was lazy. I just wanted to play football. Always, all I wanted was football.’ VIDEO Scroll down to watch Watch Jefferson Montero's first senior goals at Independiente . Swansea's Jefferson Montero (centre) advances with the ball as Spurs' Harry Kane makes a challenge . Jefferson Montero is one of 41 players, coaches and directors named in a match-fixing investigation in Spain, relating to a fixture between Levante and Real Zaragoza in 2011. Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera is also among the players named. A Swansea spokesman said: ‘We have had no contact from any authority regarding this matter.’ It’s what he would say to the teachers who confronted him over his truancy. And to one of his early clubs, which he left after four days because they insisted on 5am alarm calls to kick-start a series of daily chores. It’s also what he said to the numerous suggestions that he was just too small to be any good. ‘I had the same hormone treatment as Lionel Messi when I was young,’ Montero says. ‘I’d probably be 10cm smaller if I didn’t.’ At 5ft 7ins and 25 years old, the little boy from Ecuador has grown up in a number of ways. Going into Saturday’s match against Hull, Montero has emerged as one of Swansea’s biggest threats. His demolition of Calum Chambers was central to Arsenal’s defeat at the Liberty Stadium last month; his match-up against Everton’s Tony Hibbert in September’s Capital One Cup fixture was even more one-sided. Swansea's Montero (right) challenges Arsenal's Calum Chambers at the Liberty Stadium last month . There were also prolonged moments against Crystal Palace’s Joel Ward, QPR’s Nedum Onuoha and Tottenham’s Kyle Walker when the first impression was underlined — he is a fantastically entertaining left winger who, on form, can turn games. His deliveries require work, but his pace, feints and flair make him one of the most effective dribblers in the Premier League. The statistics show he has four assists in 11 starts — most recently against West Ham this month — and on average will beat a man three times a game, the sixth highest tally in the Premier League behind Eden Hazard. It is why he has seemingly overtaken Nathan Dyer in the Swansea pecking order in the past six weeks and why, in Ecuador, they call him ‘Turbine’. ‘I have always liked to run at defenders,’ Montero says. ‘It is a part of the game I love. My family name is Montero, my mother’s name is Mercedes so some people at home call me a Ferrari. That makes me laugh.’ Home for Montero is Babahoyo, a city of 153,000 people in the centre of Ecuador. Agriculture is the main industry and bananas are the family trade. Montero in action for Ecuador at the 2014 FIFA World Cup against France in Brazil last June . His house is down a long, narrow dirt path in the heart of one of the plantations. ‘I come from a very modest family,’ Montero says, speaking via a translator in his first major interview in Britain. ‘My family have always worked really hard. They have always worked in agriculture. My dad was on the farm and my mother was in the home. ‘I have a brother and a sister but they don’t play football. My dad used to play with me when I was little and he tells me his father used to play for Barcelona in Ecuador. ‘In school all I wanted was football. I used to get grants for schooling because of my football in the local teams, but I used to turn up maybe 10 days per month and the teachers would get unhappy and say, “Stop playing all this football. You need to study because football is not going to give you anything”. ‘I used to pass every year but football was what I wanted. I watched football whenever I could — I used to like Arsenal. Robert Pires was my favourite. Robert Pires scores a penalty for Arsenal during a Champions League match against FC Thun in 2005 . ‘My dad used to support me. My mum was complaining that I shouldn’t choose football but I always wanted to play only football.’ It was that mindset that led him to quit a club as a 16-year-old. ‘I was at a team in Ecuador and they used to wake up at 5am to work and only afterwards would we play football,’ he says. ‘We would spend hours cleaning. After four days I told them I was leaving and I went to Emelec, a big team in Ecuador. ‘It is a big rival of Barcelona, who my dad supports. He said: “Do not go there” but when I was 16 I realised I could do something with football.’ From Emelec, Montero joined Independiente in the Ecuadorian second division and then went on loan to a Mexican side before heading for Villarreal in Spain in 2009. Montero (right), then at Villarreal, chases Barcelona's Lionel Messi (left) during a La Liga match in 2010 . ‘In my first-team debut, I came on as a substitute for Pires. I used to watch him so closely and then I was coming on for him. It was very strange but amazing. ‘I also played with Santi Cazorla for a couple of years and I never knew what foot was his strong foot. He was amazing with both.’ Montero went on loan to Levante and Real Betis before joining Morelia in Mexico in 2012 and almost headed to a different part of Wales a year later. ‘I was close to joining Cardiff,’ he says. ‘I was desperate to come to the Premier League but everything happens for a reason. Maybe the reason was I had to be at Swansea. ‘I am grateful Cardiff wanted to sign me. It was not a decision from me (to turn Cardiff down) and I don’t think it was a decision from Cardiff. It was a decision from my ex-agent.’ Montero (right) and Arsenal's Spanish midfielder Santi Cazorla vie for the ball at the Liberty last month . Montero stayed in Mexico and went on to start all three of Ecuador’s World Cup games before finally getting his move to the Premier League for £4m this summer. ‘Antonio Valencia from Manchester United told me this was the best league and I love it,’ he says. ‘After going to the World Cup as well I would say this is maybe my best year. I play great players every week. (Pablo) Zabaleta was probably the hardest full back – he was very clever. ‘I have been able to help my family which has always been my dream. My father doesn’t have to work any more.’ The banana industry’s loss has been Swansea’s gain.","Jefferson Montero has emerged as one of Swansea's biggest threats .

"Ally McCoist is being left to sweat it out as Rangers manager following talks with the club hierarchy on Wednesday. The Ibrox boss met with non-executive director Derek Llambias and Sandy Easdale, chairman of the football board, after handing in his notice last week. It had been thought that a deal over the timing of McCoist’s departure could be produced at the meeting. Ally McCoist to stay on as Rangers manager after talks with the club’s board on Wednesday afternoon . McCoist met with directors Sandy Easdale (pictured) and Derek Llambias for 40 minutes . However, following 40 minutes of what were described as ‘cordial’ discussions, it emerged that he would continue in charge for Saturday’s game against Livingston. ‘Ally’s here and we’re looking forward to Saturday to the game,’ said Easdale as he left Ibrox on Wednesday night. But the Greenock-based businessman declined to comment on what might happen beyond the weekend or the possibility of a settlement on McCoist’s 12-month notice period. Given the relative brevity of the meeting, it seems unlikely that any serious negotiations over a financial package to accelerate his exit took place with the Ibrox boss. The club confirmed on Monday that McCoist had tendered his resignation and that they hoped an ‘amicable solution’ could be reached. They also revealed that his salary would revert to £750,000 during his notice spell after he took a 50-per-cent wage cut earlier this year. As is stands, the 52-year-old will be in the uncomfortable position of sharing the top table with club directors at what promises to be an extraordinary annual general meeting on Monday. It remains to be seen whether his situation will change once that stormy event has passed. The Rangers board hope the AGM will provide approval for a new share issue — possibly underwritten by Mike Ashley — to help plug the £8million funding gap they face next year. Progress with a new financial plan may also provide the leeway required to negotiate a deal with McCoist (below). McCoist handed in his notice to the Rangers board last Friday but remains in charge for now . Meanwhile, Rangers have revealed another financial battle after opposing an SPFL bid to force them to pay a £250,000 fine the Ibrox ‘oldco’ received for its use of Employee Benefit Trusts. In February 2013, an independent commission headed by Lord Nimmo Smith handed down the punishment for use of the controversial tax scheme. Rangers believe that punishment was only applicable to the ‘oldco’ — currently in the process of being liquidated by BDO. However, the SPFL insist the club is bound by the terms of the five-way agreement signed in 2012 to transfer SFA membership and want to withhold broadcasting revenues until the debt is settled. A Rangers statement to the Stock Exchange read: ‘The board of the SPFL has determined that Rangers FC Limited is liable to pay the EBT Commission fine of £250,000 levied on RFC 2012 PLC (previously The Rangers Football Club plc) (in liquidation). ‘The SPFL has also decided that this sum will be recovered from the club by the SPFL withholding broadcasting money and other sums due to the club but which are paid in the first instance to the SPFL. ‘An appeal has been lodged with the judicial panel of the SFA which has confirmed that the decision of the SPFL is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal subject to the SPFL’s right to object. ‘The board is advised that the sum is not due to the SPFL and the appeal will be pursued vigorously.’ McCoist will be in the dugout for Rangers Championship match against Livingston on Saturday . The SPFL responded by claiming senior club officials at Ibrox had previously recognised that the fine would have to be paid. ‘Rangers FC Limited (“Rangers Newco”) signed an agreement under which they would be liable for sums such as this,’ said a statement from the governing body. ‘The chairman of Rangers FC, David Somers, and on one occasion the club’s then chief executive Graham Wallace, engaged in individual discussions with the majority of current SPFL board members several months ago acknowledging the liability and suggesting ways of paying the sums due. ‘Following such discussions, it was only when no sums actually arrived from Rangers that the SPFL board decided to offset this liability against future sums payable to the club.’ It creates a second area of conflict with the authorities after the SFA this week issued notices of complaint against Rangers and Ashley. They relate to alleged breaches of an undertaking about the Newcastle United owner’s level of influence at Ibrox. ‘The directors of Rangers will take legal advice with a view to defending the actions of the company and the club robustly in relation to those matters raised by the SFA,’ said a club statement. The case will go before a hearing on January 27 but is not expected to halt Ashley’s plans in relation to Rangers. Those may include underwriting a new share issue. It has been reported he plans to increase his stake to up to 29.9 per cent — which would give him effective control without triggering takeover rules — and that his legal team is ready to seek SFA approval for such a move.","Ally McCoist is still Rangers manager following talks on Wednesday .

"Celtic are facing a fifth UEFA charge in just three years after European football's governing body announced it has opened disciplinary proceedings against Celtic for 'crowd disturbances' during their match with Dinamo Zagreb. A UEFA statement read: 'Disciplinary proceedings have been opened following the UEFA Europa League Group D match between GNK Dinamo Zagreb and Celtic FC played on 11 December in Croatia.' It is the fifth time within the last three years Celtic have been hit with charges because of the behaviour of their supporters during European matches. Celtic fans let off a flare during their Europa League clash with Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia earlier this month . Celtic lost 4-3 to Dinamo Zagreb but still qualified for the last 32 of this season's Europa League . After the most recent incident - when an 'illicit' banner was unfurled at a Champions League match with AC Milan in 2013 – it resulted in a £42,000 fine and the club's chief executive Peter Lawwell condemned the 'small minority' of supporters who were 'damaging the reputation' of Celtic. A £4,221 was handed down earlier that year after fireworks were set off by supporters during their Champions League qualifier with Cliftonville. The club's fans also caused them to be fined twice during their Europa League campaign in the 2011/12 season. Celtic were fined after fans displayed this banner during a Champions League game against AC Milan in 2013 . In March 2012, UEFA fined Celtic £21,000 after supporters displayed an offensive banner and set off flares during an away game with Udinese. Celtic were also fined £13,000 for 'illicit chanting' in the same competition during a match with Rennes in 2011. Given the high volume of supporter-related incidents, Celtic now run the risk of a more severe sanction over and above a financial penalty.","Celtic are facing a fifth UEFA charge in just three years .

"Things are going Ben Morgan’s way. As if scoring two tries and claiming the man-of-match award against Australia wasn’t enough, the England No 8 topped things off by being named QBE player of the autumn series — all just days after beating five-time world champion Eric Bristow at darts. This time last year, things were not going Morgan’s way. Deeply frustrated by Gloucester’s woeful form under ex-coach Nigel Davies, his Premiership form deserted him and he slipped down the international pecking order as a result. England No 8 Ben Morgan scores opening try against Australia at Twickenham . But the past 12 months have seen a remarkable turnaround for the former 20-stone plumber. ‘It’s been a pretty special few weeks,’ Morgan said on Thursday, just minutes after being named QBE player of the series. ‘I definitely wasn’t expecting it. It’s a great accolade to have. ‘Personally I feel worlds apart from last season. I wasn’t in a good place mentally and 100 per cent it was getting me down. I lost all my confidence. I have to be playing and enjoying myself. That’s where my confidence comes from. I didn’t have any of it. It was hard. ‘But having stuck it out and come through it will really help when I face more tough times. We now have a new set-up at Gloucester (with David Humphreys installed as director of rugby) with new players and new coaches, I feel really, really good. Morgan with darts greats Keith Deller, Bobby George, Wayne Mardle and Eric Bristow . ‘I’m enjoying my rugby again and I think that’s been reflected in how I’ve been playing in the last few games. I’ve signed off the autumn happy.’ He is even happier following his remarkable defeat of Bristow in front of a stunned crowd at a darts event staged at Kingsholm last week. ‘Whatever sport I play I want to win,’ Morgan said. ‘I hadn’t played darts for a while. I was nervous on the oche but I backed myself. You don’t go up there to lose! I hit a 140 and then Eric missed check-out on 81. I won with double four!’ Bristol-born forward Morgan was named QBE player of the autumn series . Happy, relaxed and enjoying his time at the top of his sport, it could all have been very different for the Bristol-born No 8. Four years ago when Morgan turned down an invitation from Johnson to play for England Saxons he thought he’d blown his international future. Barely three years after being made redundant as an apprentice plumber who used to gorge on entire chickens for lunch, Morgan had moved to Wales, turned professional, slimmed down and was attracting attention on both sides of the Bristol Channel. Days before qualifying for Wales on residency grounds, Morgan received a call from the former World Cup-winning captain turned England head coach. ‘Martin Johnson left a message on my answer phone, I was absolutely awestruck,’ said Morgan, who had secured a £5,000 contract with Welsh minnows Merthyr in 2008 before signing for the Scarlets a year later. ‘But that was the first I’d heard that England were even looking at me. I was carrying a couple of knocks as well and I didn’t want to go up there and not be 100 per cent. I was a young lad, panicking that if I didn’t impress I’d regret it for ever. Morgan is happy, relaxed and enjoying his time at the top of his sport . ‘I was so nervous making that call. Saying no to Martin Johnson? Who wouldn’t be? I was absolutely dreading it. ‘He was really good about it but it was a huge call and I was worried that I’d blown my whole future.’ Now with 27 caps to his name, the 25-year-old is starting to look the part at Test level. Barring injury or an unexpected loss of form, he looks sure to start England’s opening Six Nations clash against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 ahead of Billy Vunipola. But it took an intervention from Stuart Lancaster after Johnson’s departure in 2011 to convince Morgan he should throw his lot in with England. ‘I’d always wanted to play for England, I’d never considered playing for another country growing up,’ he said. ‘Just talking with Stuart about how he saw things gave me confidence I was being watched. It was a reassuring meeting.’ Firmly established in Lancaster’s squad, the work Morgan has done in order to lose around 18 kilograms is paying dividends. ‘When I first started at Scarlets I weighed 132.5 kilos. I was a big lad. The first year was just about trying to get me in shape. ‘When I worked on the building site we would go for a greasy fry up every Friday. I’d go for lunch and buy a French stick, split it open and stick a chicken in it . ‘A whole chicken. I think about it now and think what the hell was I doing? I know so much more about my body now and how to take care of myself.’ With a World Cup pending, England’s fans will hope things continue to go Morgan’s way.

"Sunderland striker Steven Fletcher is determined to make up for lost time as he goes in search of a fourth successive derby victory over Newcastle United. The 27-year-old Scotland international scored in last season's 2-1 victory over the Black Cats' arch-rivals at the Stadium of Light, but missed their back-to-back 3-0 wins at St James' Park through injury and is hoping to play his part in a famous hat-trick on Tyneside this Sunday.

"Record-breaking multiple Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was arrested on Tuesday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence. The arrest took place in Baltimore City, Maryland, the 29-year-old's home state, according to TMZ Sports. This marks the decorated swimmer's second DUI arrest. Phelps was arrested in 2004 at age 19 for DUI and later received 18 months probation. 18-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Phelps was arrested for drink driving on Tuesday . Police arrested Phelps after he was caught driving 84mph in a 45mph zone in Baltimore . It was after 1:30 when Maryland Transit Authority police pulled over Phelps' Land Rover on I-395. They initiated a field sobriety test, which according to TMZ, he failed spectacularly and had nearly twice the legal B.A.C. 'He was unable to perform satisfactorily a series of standard field sobriety tests,' reads the MdTA statement. 'Mr. Phelps was cooperative throughout the process.' The 18-time Olympic gold medal winning athlete was charged with for driving 84mph in a 45mph zone, police told TMZ, and for crossing double lane lines. 29-year-old (pictured partying hard during a 2008 Bahamas vacation) was unable to perform standard field sobriety tests, though he remained 'cooperative throughout' the encounter with police they said . The last time news broke of Phelps' antics behind the wheel, it too took place in Maryland. In 2004, then 19-year-old Phelps was arrested near Salisbury University in the city of Salisbury and charged with DUI, DWI, violation of a license restriction and failure to obey a stop sign. As part of a plea deal, the rising sports star pleaded guilty to drunk driving and was sentenced to 18 months probation. 'I recognize the seriousness of this mistake,' Phelps told a judge in 2004 as 100 spectators looked on. 'I’ve learned from this mistake and will continue learning from this mistake for the rest of my life.'

"Michael Phelps has been handed a six-month suspension by USA Swimming following his arrest for allegedly drink driving last month. The most successful Olympic athlete in history, with 22 medals in total including 18 golds, announced on Sunday his plan to take a break for an unspecified amount of time to focus on his personal issues in the wake of the scandal. Yet his governing body has taken a dim view of the incident and released a statement on its official website detailing the punishment for the 29-year-old, who cannot take part in official events sanctioned by USA Swimming until April 6 next year. 18-time Olympic gold medallist Michael Phelps was arrested for drink driving last week . USA Swimming have susspended Phelps for six months . Phelps also has to withdraw from the 2015 FINA World Championships team and will have his funding withdrawn for the length of his ban. 'Membership in USA Swimming, and particularly at the national team level, includes a clear obligation to adhere to our code of conduct,' USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus said. 'Should an infraction occur, it is our responsibility to take appropriate action based on the individual case. Michael's conduct was serious and required significant consequences .

'We endorse and are here to fully support his personal development actions.' Phelps was arrested and charged in Baltimore, Maryland nearly 10 years after his first infraction for the same offence. Phelps is the most decorated Olympian in sports history, winning 18 Olympic golds during his career . On Sunday, he announced on his official Facebook and Twitter pages his plans to take a break, saying: 'I recognise that this is not my first lapse in judgement, and I am extremely disappointed with myself. I'm going to take some time away to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself.' Phelps first came to prominence after winning six golds at the 2004 Olympics in Athens before setting a record for the number of gold medals at a Games by topping the podium eight times in Beijing four years later. Four more golds at London 2012 followed and although he announced his intentions to never compete again, he returned to the pool earlier this year and had been seeking to add to his medal haul at the Rio Games in 2016.","Michael Phelps was arrested for drink driving on Tuesday .

"Rome will enter a bid to host the 2024 Olympic Games, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced on Monday. The application phase for potential candidates is set to formally open in September 2015, with a deadline of January 8 2016 and the announcement of the chosen venue set for the summer of 2017. Following concerns over finance, Italy, which hosted the 1960 Olympics in Rome, had scrapped plans to bid for the 2020 Games, which will be held in Tokyo, Japan. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi (right) announced Rome's candidacy for the 2024 games on Monday . Renzi told a news conference at the Italian National Olympic Committee headquarters in the capital: 'The Italian government, together with CONI, is ready to do its part for a project that isn't based on great infrastructures or big dreams, but rather great people. 'We will be at the vanguard for all the spending controls. 'Our country too often seems hesitant, it is unacceptable not to try... or to renounce playing the game. Italy has all it needs to face its problems - you can't not dream.' Last week, the International Olympic Committee passed reforms which will see bids encouraged to use existing and temporary venues, with some events able to be located outside the host city or 'in exceptional cases' even outside the chosen country. Renzi said that Italy, which pulled out of the race for the 2020 games, could afford to host in 2024 . Germany intend to submit a bid from either Berlin or Hamburg, while there has been speculation Kenya will put forward a candidate city, which if succesful would be the first from Africa to host the Games. France are expected to back another bid from Paris, beaten by London for the 2012 Olympics, while the United States have also expressed an interest, with Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington all potential hosts, along with Istanbul in Turkey.","Prime Minister Matteo Renzi confirms Rome will bid for games .

"Manny Pacquiao used to regularly knock out Amir Khan in sparring, trainer Freddie Roach has revealed.

Four members of a Nebraska university frat house have been charged with supplying the alcohol that an 18-year-old freshman binged to death on. University of Nebraska-Lincoln student Clayton Real was found dead in his room at FarmHouse fraternity house on September 5 after passing out at an off-campus party the night before. Vance Heyer, 21, the frat vice president, Thomas Trueblood, 19, the society chairman, Cory Foland, 21, the new member educator, and 22-year-old Ross Reynolds, a frat member, have all been charged with procuring alcohol for a minor resulting in death. Trueblood organised the event after contacting  friends who were willing to host the party at their house, according to a police report. Heyer, Foland and Reynold all supplied the alcohol, including a keg, two crates of beer, whiskey and vodka. Witnesses reported seeing Real, an agricultural economics major, getting drunk at the event before passing out at around 12.30am. Members of the fraternity took him back to his room where they left him asleep, before calling medics at 7.30am. Mr Real was pronounced dead at the scene. Tests showed Mr Real's cause of death was acute alcohol intoxication, with a blood-alcohol content of .365 - four times the legal driving limit. Mr Real had suffered from Type 1 diabetes since childhood, though the accused say they took his blood-sugar level before putting him to bed, and decided he did not need medical attention. Around 80 people attended the party. Hosts, Marin Hartfield, 20, and Lauren Williams, 20, have been ticketed under city ordinances for maintaining a disorderly house. Thomas Trueblood, 19, organised the party after finding friends willing to host the event at their house near the university (pictured).  Vance Heyer, and Cory Foland, both 21, and 22-year-old Ross Reynolds, bought alcohol for the event - including a keg, two crates of beer, whiskey and vodka . William Miller, 21 a member of the frat, was ticketed under a misdemeanor offence after police said he gave the pair vodka in return for hosting. Following the arrests, UNL suspended the fraternity chapter indefinitely, meaning more than 20 freshmen were forced to find another place to live. 'We have taken appropriate action, given the seriousness of the matter,'  Juan Franco, the university vice chancellor for student affairs, said at the time.","Clayton Real, 18, was found dead at a fraternity house on September 5 .

"Amir Khan’s hopes of Floyd Mayweather finally agreeing to meet him in a megabucks fight have been dismissed as an empty dream by Manny Pacquiao’s legendary trainer. Freddie Roach has also poured cold water over speculation that his PacMan might fight Khan, who has nominated Pacquiao as his alternative opponent to Mayweather. Khan, the victim of a broken promise by Mayweather once already, has been encouraged to believe that victory over former world champion Devon Alexander next month will lead to a Las Vegas showdown with The Money Man next May. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roach on Floyd and Manny on Roach . Amir Khan's hopes of fighting Floyd Mayweather have been dismissed by Freddie Roach . Khan has been led to believe that beating Devon Alexander will give him his fight with Mayweather . But Roach said: ‘It’s not going to happen.’ Nor is he speaking out of sour grapes for Khan leaving him for another American trainer after losing the two world titles to which he had been guided by Roach. In fact, Roach bases that assessment on his belief that Bolton’s favourite son would present problems to the boxer rated the pound-for-pound best in the world. Roach says: ‘Floyd knows that Amir’s speed would trouble him. He is too careful with his choice of opponents to take that risk. Roach has also poured cold water over speculation that Manny Pacquiao (above) could fight Khan . ‘Floyd also knows he himself doesn’t possess the knock-out punch which would make him more certain of winning that fight.’ Pacquiao, however, does carry concussive one-punch power and Roach reveals for the first time that he used it to KO Khan several times in sparring when they were training together in his Wild Card gym in Los Angeles. Roach says: ‘Manny frequently put Amir on the floor, knocking him cold four or five times.’ Since that was inflicted with gloves more thickly padded than those used in actual fights and Pacquiao is as fast as Khan, Roach says: ‘There’s no point Manny fighting Amir. The reality is that it’s no big fight.’ Khan left Freddie Roach (right) for Virgil Hunter after losing his two world titles . Pacquiao, always courteous and diplomatic, politely went along with the notion of a Wembley Stadium fight when it was put to him. But he made clear later: ‘I do not choose who I fight. That decision is always made by my trainer and promoter.’ Roach will advise Hall of Fame promoter Bob Arum against taking Pacquiao to London ‘for a non-fight’, even though he expects Khan to edge Alexander in Vegas on December 7. He says: ‘Amir can win this one because although Alexander has good skills he doesn’t have a big punch’. Roach shares Arum’s belief that only a phenomenal financial offer will lure Mayweather into boxing any opponent who would seriously imperil his cherished unbeaten record. Roach says: ‘Manny is the one really big threat. That’s why everyone has been wanting to see them fight for so long. And that is why this is the only fight which can raise enough money to get Floyd into the ring with someone truly dangerous.’ Pacquiao and Chris Algieri gear up for battle in Macau in front of the glare of the world's media . Arum is working towards an offer which no man who calls himself Money and is so obsessed with the folding stuff can possibly refuse – namely a minimum £95million purse from an unprecedented Billion Dollar Fight. That depends on him pioneering pay-per-view television in the gigantic Chinese market, which in turn relies on both Pacquiao and the ring idol of the People’s Republic Zou Shiming winning their fights here this weekend. Pacquiao’s catch-weight defence of his world welterweight title against New York’s undefeated light-welter champion Chris Algieri marks the second time Shiming has been the PacMan’s chief support in Macau’s Cotai Arena. The 35-year-old Filipino revealed earlier this week he felt as fit as he did in the early stages of his career . Shiming, a gold medallist at the Beijing and London Olympics, has his first 12-round assignment in only his sixth professional fight. Curiously, it is against an unbeaten Thai flyweight who looks so much like Pacquiao that his appearance at the final press conference caused much amusement and we dubbed him Mini-Manny. Shiming, whose fights are watched by hundreds of millions on the mainland, is more crucial to the Chinese pay-TV project – with its potential for generating more than half the billion dollar target –than even PacMan versus the Money man. Arum says: ‘We’re getting there with this deal.’ Mayweather poses with bundles of cash (right) - but could be set to earn even more if he fights Pacquiao . So he is trusting that Mini-Manny only resembles Pacquiao in appearance, not explosive boxing ability. Assuming all goes according to plan, Arum will then concentrate on the power of money. Of Mayweather’s luxury spending on an industrial scale – designer watches, diamond jewellery, luxury cars, nightclub ladies and now a gold-plated Bentley golf cart for his son’s birthday – Roach says: ‘We are watching the way he gets through his money and at the present rate he’s going to need a lot more. We hope that’s going to be our trump card in getting Manny the fight.,’ So does the boxing world. Pacquiao v Algieri will be televised live in Britain on BoxNation late Saturday night.","Amir Khan's hopes of fighting Floyd Mayweather have been dismissed by the Bolton man's former trainer Freddie Roach .

"Alexis Sanchez may now be able to call himself a £30million Premier League footballer but he has not always led such a gilded life. Arsenal's new forward grew up in poverty-stricken rural Chile in a mining town called Tocopilla - which literally means Devil's Corner - and he used to perform on the street for money at the tender age of six. Yet now the 25-year-old is on a £130,000-a-week contract with Arsenal and will relocate to London from Barcelona with his girlfriend Laia Grassi. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arsene Wenger talk up Alexis Sanchez's ability . Things are looking up: Alexis Sanchez signed for Arsenal from Barcelona for £30million this summer . Humble beginnings: Sanchez grew up in the poverty-stricken rural Chilean mining town of Tocopilla . Talented: When he was young Sanchez was nicknamed 'El Nino Marvailla' - meaning 'the Wonder Kid' Determined: Sanchez's brother Humberto said he had three options - to be a miner, fisherman or footballer . In an interview with The Sun on Sunday, Sanchez's brother Humberto revealed the Chilean international's journey from his impoverished upbringing and earning a living on the streets at the age of six to global football superstar. Humberto said: 'Alexis had nothing when growing up. He had to fight for everything he has. 'We were the poorest of the poor so Alexis had to earn money any way he could from a very young age. 'He would wash cars for a few pence or perform somersaults for a handful of coins from onlookers. He was like a little gymnast, hurling himself all over the place. 'The neighbours would give him a few coins for entertaining them. Sometimes he was so hungry he would knock on neighbours' doors and ask for bread. They would always gibe him what they had to spare. On occasions Alexis would box in the street for entertainment.' Sanchez grew up in a single-storey house - which was roughly held together by wood, breeze blocks and corrogated iron - with his sisters Tamara, now 17, Marjorie, 32, and brother Humberto. Shirty: Sanchez's girlfriend Laia Grassi posted this photo after the Chilean completed his move to the Emirates . Couple: New signing Sanchez poses for a photo with Spaniard Grassi, who will move with him to London . Pulling up: Sanchez's mother used to wash fish and sell flowers in order to feed her four children . Their mother Martina raised her four children by herself after his father Gullermo Soto deserted them when Sanchez was a toddler. She did every odd-job going to bring in money for her children, including washing fish for her neighbours and selling flowers. His daily release from the hardships of poverty was to play football barefoot on mud-covered streets - thankfully something he excelled at. Humberto, 28, continued: 'His poor background is what makes him so hungry to succeed on the pitch. He knows how lucky he is to be where he is and never forgets where he comes from. 'If Alexis wasn't a footballer he would be working in the mines like most men around here. It's a very tough life for 300,000 pesos (£314) a month. Growing up around here Alexis had three options - mining, fishing or football.' Sanchez had boundless energy as a child and was originally nicknamed 'the Squirrel' by his friends before he became known as 'El Nino Maravilla' - 'the Wonder Kid' - due to his unique footballing talents. Star: Pacey forward Sanchez lit up the World Cup for Chile with some fantastic displays in Brazil . Versatile: The energetic Sanchez is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions for Arsenal . Star: Alexis Sanchez can light up the Premier League after moving from Barcelona to Arsenal this summer . Money: Sanchez will earn £130,000-a-week at Arsenal but he used to scrape around for pennies on the streets . He was first spotted by Club Arauco youth team coach Alberto Toledo who brought him to the club even though he could not pay the fees. The forward once arrived late for a match and, with the team trailing 1-0, he came on and banged in eight goals. Sanchez's journey continued as he moved to Cobreloa in Chile, then Argentina's River Plate, and Udinese in Italy's Serie A before joining Barcelona in 2011. Last Christmas he went back to his home town with his brother and Tocopilla's mayor Fernando San Roman to give out sweets and replica shirts to poor children. He also donated £160,000 to help restore five small youth football pitches around where he used to live. When he was young Sanchez played football on dirty streets. This season he will grace the pitches of Old Trafford, Anfield and, most importantly, the Emirates. Now that is quite a journey.

"Hereford United have been wound up by the High Court. Owner Andy Lonsdale had promised to invest £1million in the club but he did not arrive at the hearing on time, reportedly claiming he was stuck in traffic. It was the 10th time Lonsdale had been ordered to appear at the High Court and, despite his barristers saying they had a statement that the money was in the bank, the judge was not satisfied there were sufficient funds. The winding-up petition was brought by HM Revenue and Customs, one of the club's creditors.

Hereford were elected to the Football League following that triumph and spent 31 seasons in the league in two spells before relegation to the Conference in 2012. This summer they were expelled from the Conference for financial irregularities and began this season in the Southern League Premier Division.

"Arsenal have been drawn against Monaco in the knock-out stages of the Champions League. Considering the Gunners finished second in their group, the French side is one of the more favourable outcomes they could have hoped for from the draw. For boss Arsene Wenger it will be a return to one of his former clubs - he managed Monaco between 1987 and 1994 and won the league in 1987-88. Will Arsenal be happy with their draw? Considering Arsenal could have drawn Barcelona, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid, they should be pleased with drawing Monaco, who are currently sixth in Ligue 1 and nine points off the leaders Marseille. They have already lost five times in the league this season. Arsenal finished second in their Champions League group with 13 points from their six games, which is actually more than Monaco managed. The French side topped Group C with 11 points ahead of Bayer Leverkusen, Zenit and Benfica. Dimitar Berbatov will be one of a number of familiar faces in the Monco side . First leg . Arsenal vs Monaco . Wednesday, February 25, 2015 . Kick-off: 19.45 . Emirates Stadium . Second leg . Monaco vs Arsenal . Tuesday, March 17, 2015 . Kick-off: 19.45 . Stade Louis II . Have the two teams met before? Arsenal have never met Monaco in a competitive game before. They did play in the pre-season Emirates Cup in the summer when Radamel Falcao, now on loan at Manchester United, scored the only goal of the game for Monaco in a 1-0 win. Who do Arsenal have to watch out for in the Monaco side? Arsenal fans will need no introduction to Monaco’s star man, the Bulgarian stroller Dimitar Berbatov. Berbatov spent eight years in the Premier League with Fulham, Manchester United and Arsenal’s north London rivals Tottenham. Berbatov has scored five goals so far this season – but is yet to find the back of the net in Europe. Arsenal and Monaco met in the Emirates Cup in the summer - but never played a competitive fixture . Another player for the Gunners should keep an eye on is Joao Moutinho. The Portugal star is a cultured midfielder who played more 600 games for Sporting Lisbon, Porto and Monaco and is considered one of the best attacking players in international football. Another player who will be familiar to Arsenal fans is Ricardo Carvalho. The former Chelsea defender moved to the Stade Louis II last season and has also played at the top level for Porto and Real Madrid. And what about the managers? Leonardo Jardim replaced Claudio Ranieri in the summer having previously managed Sporting Lisbon and Olympiacos. He stared his managerial career at 21 acting as assistant to local side A.D. Camacha for two years. The casino in Monte Carlo is one of the main attractions in the Principality . What kind of draw is it for the fans? It is a perfect draw for Arsenal fans. The South of France is easily accessible from London with flights going to Nice regularly. Return flights cost around £120. But with the tie taking place in March, it won’t be hot so fans are unlikely to take a dip in the Mediterranean. But Monte Carlo’s famous casino is likely to attract some of the Arsenal supporters who fancy a bit of a gamble. What has it done for Arsenal’s chances of winning the Champions League? Arsenal will fancy their chances of winning the tie given their experience of playing in at this level for so long.

"Brendan Rodgers has branded criticism of Raheem Sterling as 'incredible' as he prepares to unleash the England international on Arsenal. During an unusually brief and tense press conference at Liverpool's Melwood training ground, Rodgers was economical with his words but his longest answer was saved for when the subject of Sterling arose. The 20-year-old scored twice in Wednesday night's 3-1 win over Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final and is almost certain to lead the line against Arsenal on Sunday, given that Mario Balotelli is suspended.

Sterling (fourth left) celebrates scoring for Liverpool as they reached the Capital One Cup semi-final stage . Sterling enjoyed one of his finest games in a Liverpool shirt when Arsenal were demolished 5-1 in February and Rodgers did not waste his chance to highlight what he feels is unjust criticism of the young forward. ‘Raheem is an outstanding talent,” Rodgers said. “It is incredible the stick that the kid has received. He has been outstanding for us, wherever he has played. (On Sunday) we will do what is in the best interests of the team.’ When asked about Mario Balotelli’s one-game ban from The FA, Rodgers said: ‘We accept the ban so it is fairly clear. He is here as a footballer player and is trying to become a better player.’ During his four minutes and 33 seconds in front of the cameras, Rodgers would not give any indication whether he would be looking to make new signings in January or give any indications whether Fabio Borini, who is admired by Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, has long-term future at Anfield.

"Javier Mascherano believes that he has remained an integral part of Barcelona's success because of his work ethic, rather than any natural born talent. From Pep Guardiola to Luis Enrique, all the coaches Mascherano has worked under during his four years at Barca have relied on his graft and discipline, and the Copa del Rey win over Huesca on Tuesday marked the Argentine's 200th appearance. Barca have been in transition under Luis Enrique this season but the versatile Argentine, who joined the club in 2010, remains one of the first names on the team sheet and the side looked to his composure and leadership when their form stuttered early on. Javier Mascherano has become a key figure for Barcelona since joining in 2010 . Mascherano has come a long way since arriving in England with fellow countryman Carlos Tevez at West Ham .

Real have a four-point lead over Barcelona but while they are away looking to extend their winning run to 22 matches in the final of the Club World Cup this weekend, the Catalan side can close the gap before the Christmas break. 'I've always identified myself as a worker,' Mascherano told the club website. 'I am someone that perhaps wasn't born with the same talent as other top players but I have always put in a lot of hard work and that has taken me to where I am now. 'Barca is the biggest club that I have been at and to move here (from Liverpool) was the most important decision in my career as I arrived at the top. The demands of this club are the maximum that can be asked of a footballer.' Pictured here with Lionel Messi, Mascherano excelled for Argentina in this summer's World Cup . Jeremy Mathieu was brought in to boost the defensive line this season but in the important matches, it has either been the Frenchman or Gerard Pique that have played alongside Mascherano. 'I don't give much importance to statistics but to reach 200 games for this club is not easy with the competition internal and external,' Mascherano added. 'All the time you are being tested because all players want to come here. I never would have imagined that I would play this number of games and it is due to the work.'","Mascherano completed the landmark against Huesca on Tuesday night .

"Pep Guardiola's footballing philosophy is still lost on a German audience, according to Bayern Munich sporting director Matthias Sammer. Despite Bayern sitting pretty with a 12-point advantage at the top of the Bundesliga, the Spaniard has still come in for criticism in some quarters. Former players Dietmar Hamann and Lothar Matthaus, for example, have claimed that Guardiola's constant tactical tinkering is holding the team back. Pep Guardiola has been criticised for his constant tactical tinkering despite Bayern's Bundesliga lead . Matthias Sammer (left), pictured with Guardiola at Bayern's Christmas party, has defended his methods . Bayern Munich cruised to a 2-0 home win over Freiburg on Tuesday, with Thomas Muller (centre) on target . Arjen Robben opened the scoring at the Allianz Arena, his 100th goal for the club . But, after a 2-0 win over Freiburg on Tuesday, Sammer defended the boss who delivered a Bundesliga and German Cup double in his inaugural season and again has his side top of the table with the winter break approaching. 'The fact that not everyone thinks everything we do is great doesn't affect our thinking,' he told Sport Bild. 'It is not yet understood in Germany how Pep thinks. The system does not change to shoot the team in the foot. 'This idea is apparently new to German football. Bayern are happy and grateful that we have a coach like Guardiola who proves himself again and again. 'He is hugely influencing German football with his thinking.' Bayern's lead at the top of the Bundesliga table stands at 12 points with one game to play before the break .

Sammer went on to respond to the comments of Hamann and Matthaus, saying he pities them for not being able to understand Guardiola's methods. He added: 'As former professionals, [they] should ask themselves why and how someone like Guardiola makes a footballing choice. 'In the end I guess they can be happy they have something to discuss...

"Rarely has a team held such dominance over a division. A week barely goes by without Bayern Munich setting some new record or another and it's fairly safe to assume that the Bundesliga's 'Winter champions' will still be on top in May as well. Pep Guardiola's team recorded a perfunctory 2-0 win over Freiburg on Tuesday night, with goals from Arjen Robben and Thomas Muller, and barely broke sweat. Bayern Munich cruised to a 2-0 home win over Freiburg on Tuesday, with Thomas Muller (centre) on target . Arjen Robben opened the scoring at the Allianz Arena, his 100th goal for the club . Pep Guardiola's side are well on course for another Bundesliga triumph in the new year . It means they have taken 42 points from a possible 48 so far and enjoy a 12-point advantage over Wolfsburg, who can restore that to nine on Wednesday evening. Bayern head to Mainz on Friday and then aren't in competitive action again until January 31, such is the generous German winter break, but as first halves to the season go, this one hasn't been bad. Most remarkable is Bayern's frugal defence. They have let in just three goals so far, a new Bundesliga best. It was one-way traffic at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday, with the hosts firing in 31 shots on goal - a season high - and they didn't allow Freiburg a sniff of goal until the 75th minute. Indeed, Manuel Neuer was more of a sweeper keeper than ever, spending much of the match roaming around in midfield as Bayern produced wave-after-wave of attack. Bayern's lead at the top of the Bundesliga table stands at 12 points with one game to play before the break .

The team held up a banner reading 'Thank you! You are great' to the fans after the win over Freiburg . Manuel Neuer spent most of the match stationed in midfield as Bayern attacked in front of him . Robben's goal was his 100th in competitive matches for the club in just 184 appearances and to cap his night, he was presented with the Dutch Sportsman of the Year Award. The evening also saw Rafinha claim a new record. With the right-back in their team, Bayern have not conceded a goal in 1,106 minutes - a new Bundesliga record. The previous best was their former player Michael Ballack, who clocked 1,099 minutes in the team without them conceding during the 2002-03 season. Guardiola's death-by-passing approach is well refined but seems to be reaching even greater heights with Bayern. They have completed an average of 612.6 passes per game this season, more than any other side in Europe's top five leagues. The Bayern team gather together to record sing some Christmas carols for their fans . Franck Ribery tries on a red Santa hat as club mascot Berni bear keeps a close eye on proceedings .

Xabi Alonso, meanwhile, has completed 1,320 passes so far this season, more than anyone else playing in England, Spain, France, Germany and Italy. So what records can be broken in the second half of the season? If Bayern beat Mainz, they will enter the winter break with 45 points, two less than their tally at this stage last season. But they can still surpass their own record from 2012-13 of total number of points in a season overall. They gained 91 that season and can still hit 96 this, though they'd have to win every game after Christmas. On the evidence of the season so far, however, you wouldn't put it past Bayern to win the lot.

"A woman is 'absolutely mortified' after calling police and wildlife experts to her home to deal with an escaped crocodile - which turned out to be an inflatable toy. The mother-of-one was horrified to spot the 3ft green reptile outside her kitchen window in Plymouth, at 12.20pm. She asked two neighbours for assistance but called police after they agreed it was too dangerous to approach the creature unarmed. Officers from Devon and Cornwall Police attended and called a team of wildlife experts from Dartmoor Zoo, who set off with snare poles, nets and riot shields. Scroll down for video . The mother-of-one, from Plymouth, was horrified to see the 3ft reptile lurking outside her kitchen window . Neighbours agreed it was not safe to approach the creature and police officers came to the rescue - and realised it was an inflatable toy . The officers threw water over the crocodile from a safe distance and gingerly approached when it did not move. It was then that they realised it was an inflatable toy. It was removed from the garden and placed in police custody, while the Dartmoor Zoo team were stood down. 'I was making my lunch in the kitchen and looked out into the back garden,' the home owner, who did not wish to be named, said. 'It was pouring with rain and I saw what I thought was a crocodile in the garden. I went to my neighbour's house to ask if they would come and have a look at it. 'They did think it was a baby crocodile and suggested calling the RSPCA or the police but we decided to call the police as I have a three-year-old and was worried. 'A policeman and a policewoman arrived and at that point we were all a bit suspicious because it hadn't moved. Devon and Cornwall police tweeted the incident on their official account and later expressed their relief . 'One of the police officers bravely went out to have a look. They threw water on it and it didn't move. I'm absolutely mortified.' A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed that officers attended the incident following the woman's call at 12.20pm. 'We received a call from a concerned member of the public reporting that an escaped crocodile was in their garden, approximately 3ft in length,' the force spokesman said. 'The caller was concerned for her child and the RSPCA and Dartmoor Zoo were informed and on their way to the zoo. 'Police officers attended and bravely investigated. The beast turned out to be an inflatable toy crocodile. Police have apprehended the crocodile.' A spokesman for Dartmoor Zoo said experts were regularly called out to deal with escaped pets including lizards and snakes. He said the zoo received a call from police at around 12.30pm and assembled a team to attend the garden within 15 minutes. 'The team were on the road with all the equipment needed,' the zoo spokesman said. 'They were halfway there when we received a call from the police to say it was a toy. 'Our team have a variety of equipment to deal with such situations, including snare poles, nets on poles and riot shields. 'We also have dart guns but did not bring them on this occasion.'","Mother-of-one horrified to spot a 3ft crocodile outside kitchen window .

"Mauricio Pochettino believes a break in European football over the next two months will see Tottenham climb into the Premier League top four. After completing their Europa League group stage against Besiktas in Istanbul on Thursday, Pochettino’s side now face a hectic schedule of seven matches in 21 days over the festive period, starting with Sunday’s visit to Swansea. But the Argentine boss says the travel that comes with European competition is one of the reasons behind their current mid-table position and is relieved to be back into a purely domestic fixture list for a while. Tottenham have made a poor domestic start to the season and sit tenth on 21 points after 15 games . Despite this Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino believes his side are more than capable of finishing in the top four . Spurs have clocked up over 12,000 miles this season travelling to their four away Europa League matches in Limassol, Belgrade, Tripoli and Istanbul. Pochettino said: ‘It is good that we stopped playing in the Europa League because it is very difficult to manage the games. ‘Now, I think all of our opponents in the next two or three months will maybe play in the same condition. This is important, it is very important. ‘We are very strong. I think we are going in the right way and now on Sunday we play against Swansea, a very good team, and try to get three points.’ Cenk Tosun (centre) scored the only goal in Besiktas  1-0 win vs Tottenham in Thursday's Europa League tie . When asked whether Spurs could challenge for the Champions League places, Pochettino said: ‘I believe that is possible because so far, so good. ‘I think that the team arrive in a very condition, physically and mentally. They are ready to compete now in this very, very busy period. ‘It is important to arrive with all the players fit and ready to compete because maybe you play now a lot of games and you need the whole squad. ‘Yes, we are very close but we need to be consistent. It is true.’ In their last Premier League outing Spurs (left) were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw at home to Crystal Palace . Pochettino has been boosted by the return of right-back Kyle Walker following nine months out with an abdominal injury. The England international played 76 minutes in Istanbul and is in contention to start at the Liberty Stadium. ‘It is important for us because I think he is a key player,’ said Pochettino, whose team are set to play on a Sunday for the 32nd time in the last 17 months.

"James Ward-Prowse hopes Southampton can take solace in the Capital One Cup and end a five-match winless run at Sheffield United on Tuesday night. Saints, who play United in the quarter-finals, made a flying start to the season but are now without a win since beating Leicester City on November 8. Ronald Koeman's men drew at Aston Villa before suffering successive defeats to Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Burnley. Ashley Barnes bundled the ball home from close range to give Burnley a valuable win against Southampton . But James Ward-Prowse believes the Saints can get back to winning ways against Sheffield United . 'We're all desperate to turn around the run at the moment and get back to winning ways,' midfielder Ward-Prowse said. 'The Christmas period, there's always another game around the corner to change the fortunes around. 'I don't think there's any better opportunity than the quarter-finals of the cup. 'We're very confident that we can beat them and take it on. The manager's made it very clear we want to win every game, whether it's a league game, a cup game, whatever it is. Ronald Koeman looks on frustrated from the bench after seeing his side concede late on against Burnley . Dusan Tadic missed from the penalty spot as Southampton had a golden opportunity to go ahead at Burnley . 'That's the ethos of the club and that will be taken into the game on Tuesday. 'We know the qualities that they've got and I'm sure we'll analyse that. But we know we've got enough quality to win the game.' Ward-Prowse could make his first start after more than two months out with an ankle problem at Bramall Lane. The 20-year-old came off the substitutes' bench in the first half of the loss at Turf Moor, when 18-year-old midfielder Jake Hesketh sustained a knock to his knee. Ward-Prowse says morale is good despite the wait for a victory being extended by Burnley. He added: 'We know we're all good players. We know we're a good team. Everybody knows that. Tadic shows his frustration after missing a penalty which saw his side move five games without a win . 'It's just one of those runs in the season where you get bad results and it's up to you to turn it around.' Ward-Prowse hopes he can play a part in Saints' form returning to what it was earlier in the season. He insists he is ready to go. Ward-Prowse added: 'It's up to the manager to put me on the pitch then hopefully I can contribute. I'm ready for whenever the manager puts me on. 'It was obviously a very frustrating period for me sat on the sidelines and not being able to do what I love but I'm thankful I'm back and thankful to the medical staff for getting me back in good shape. 'The worst thing for any footballer is to be injured. It's not what you want, but you've got to work as hard as you can to get back and get back into the team.'

"Southampton's famed academy continues to produce young players of Premier League quality and on Saturday they gave a full debut to another 18-year-old. Jake Hesketh came on against Manchester United last Monday for his top-flight bow and sufficiently impressed Saints manager Ronald Koeman to be given a starting spot against Burnley on Saturday. Unfortunately for Hesketh his full debut lasted only 32 minutes as he came off injured after a strong tackle from Michael Keane. That being said, however, there are high hopes for the attacking midfielder at St Mary's. Here, Sportsmail tells you all you need to know about Southampton's latest young star. Jake Hesketh made his first start in the Premier League as Southampton faced Burnley at the weekend . But teenager Hesketh sustained an injury during his side's 1-0 defeat and was forced off after 32 minutes . Hesketh, pictured with Darren Fletcher, came on for the last 20 minutes against Manchester United last week . Why does his name sound familiar? Hesketh scored a brilliant goal - reminiscent of Matt Le Tissier's famous 1993 strike against Newcastle - in Southampton's 7-0 FA Youth Cup thumping of Portsmouth last December. Hesketh, who scored twice and set up another two in the rout, chips the ball over Jack Whatmough's head before lashing it home. He was an unused substitute against Aston Villa and Manchester City before finally getting his chance against United. Southampton youngster Hesketh scored a goal reminiscent of Matt Le Tissier's against Newcastle . The teenager flicked the ball over a defender's head before curling it into the net . Hesketh wheels away in celebration after scoring in his side's 7-0 Youth Cup win against rivals Portsmouth . So, what kind of player is he? 'He is used to playing between the lines, he's fast, he's left, right-footed and a player with a future,' said Koeman after the United game, adding: 'He's doing well, he's a talent. He's improving.' He is a No 10 similar in style to former Saint Adam Lallana, with an ability to find a pass and run at defenders. Hesketh also has an eye for goal, finishing top scorer for the Under 18s with 13 last season. English youngster Hesketh has similar qualities to former Southampton star Adam Lallana (below) Adam Lallana, trying to get away from Man United's Marouane Fellaini, signed for Liverpool in the summer . Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale, Liverpool's Adam Lallana and Arsenal duo Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are just some of the names who have progressed through Southampton's academy. Former Saints left back Luke Shaw sealed a £30million move to Manchester United in June after impressing at St Mary's, while Calum Chambers joined Arsenal for £12m. So, will we see more of him this season? Hesketh's performances for Saints' youth teams last season saw him voted Scholar of the Season, which was previously won by James Ward-Prowse, who has gone on to establish himself as a first-team regular. He was also rewarded with a three-year contract in May - a sign of the club's faith in him. Hesketh is expected to miss his the Capital One Cup clash at Sheffield United but could feature at the weekend against Everton. Koeman certainly seems to be a fan and is committed to Southampton's policy of giving young players a chance. Morgan Schneiderlin will return from injury in the next few weeks and Jack Cork some time next year, but until then - injury permitting - Hesketh should continue in the first team. Southampton manager Ronald Koeman appears to be a big fan of young Hesketh . So, what type of personality is he? Hesketh is said to be a determined, focused young man – who isn’t letting his rapid rise go to his head. ‘At the start of the year I was playing youth football and now I've made my debut against United in the Premiership,’ Hesketh told the Southern Daily Echo. ‘When the season started my main goal was to cement a place in the Under 21s. I did that, then got a few sessions with the first team. It's gone quite quick. I'm really proud, it hasn't sunk in yet.’ And what about England? Hesketh was called up to train with England's U18s in January but is yet to make his debut for his country at any level. Considering recent events, however, that may well change in the new year.","Southampton starlet Jake Hesketh came on against Manchester United .

"Rangers interim executive chairman David Somers has hinted Derek Llambias may not end up being the club's new chief executive. Somers has stepped up from his non-executive role to take full command of the Scottish League One champions for the time being as they search for former chief executive Graham Wallace's replacement. It was thought that role would go to Mike Ashley's right-hand man Llambias following the Newcastle owner's Ibrox power grab. Derek Llambias is working as a consultant for Rangers, but may not become the new chief executive . So far the club has only confirmed that the former Magpies managing director is acting as a consultant along with Barry Leach, another Ashley associate. But Somers admitted to Sky Sports News on Thursday morning that Llambias is yet to even apply for the Light Blues' top job. He said: 'I don't think I should say (how many people have applied for the chief executive role) at this point. I have got some head-hunters helping me look for people. 'I can't confirm that (Llambias has applied). That would be unfair of me to say who has applied and who hasn't. As you can imagine it is really early days. 'I was looking at his CV but he hasn't actually applied. He hasn't actually said anything to me. He is here as a consultant.' Interim boss David Somers said Llambias has not even applied for the role yet, but he had looked at his CV . Somers' new role was confirmed in an early-morning announcement to the Stock Exchange. As well as finding someone to fill Wallace's old role, the chartered accountant will also lead the search for Philip Nash's replacement as finance director. Both men were forced out of the club after Ashley's succeeded in having a £2million loan accepted by the cash-strapped Glasgow giants. The terms of the facility now gives him the power to name their replacements - although the Scottish Football Association is now set to investigate the latest developments in the Ibrox saga. Any attempt to place Llambias and Leach on the board could fall foul of Ashley's agreement with Hampden chiefs, which was designed to limit the Sports Direct tycoon's influence at Ibrox while he remains in control of Newcastle. Ashley signed the agreement, which restricts him to a share of no more than 10 per cent, in 2012. He currently holds an 8.92 per cent stake. The cameras are on Llambias as he arrives at Ibrox to take up his new role as consultant . The stock exchange statement said: 'David Somers, non-executive chairman, will become executive chairman of Rangers on a temporary basis with immediate effect. 'In this role, he will liaise directly with senior staff within the club about the operation of the business, and he will oversee the recruitment of a new chief executive and finance director.' But Somers, who was appointed as Rangers' acting chairman in November last year and was re-elected at the club's AGM the following month, refused to put a time-scale on his recruitment drive. He said: 'The board have asked me to lead the search for a new chief exec and also for a finance director. 'And obviously we are having a look at everything with the consultants. It's a good opportunity to dig into everything while we are appointing these people. 'We have got to do these things properly. We have got to make sure we get the right guy. Obviously I would like to do it as fast as possible but at the same time I need to make sure I get the right person for Rangers. 'We may put an interim finance director in, just to fill the gap. It's the same for this role, we need the right person.'","David Somers is the interim chief executive at Rangers .

"The FBI investigated threats of violence made against Malcolm Glazer and his family around the time the late owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was acquiring English soccer club Manchester United, according to newly released documents. Glazer, a self-made billionaire whose 2005 takeover of the English club was fiercely opposed by fans, died in May at age 85. The FBI released more than 120 pages of partially redacted records, including details on threatening telephone calls and emails, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from The Associated Press. The FBI investigated threats of violence made against Malcolm Glazer and his family around the time the late owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers acquired English soccer club Manchester United in 2005 . Manchester United fans burn an effigy of Glazer outside the club's stadium in May 2005 . Manchester United fans hold a controversial sign in the air before a European Champions League clash with AC Milan in 2005 . Glazer had already owned the Bucs for a decade when he acquired Manchester United in a leveraged buyout valued at roughly $1.4 billion. Fans who opposed foreign ownership decried the move, fearing he would sell off the stadium, raise prices and saddle the club with debt. At the time, some Manchester United supporters burned Glazer's likeness in effigy, urged fans to wear black and wave black flags, and called for a boycott of the club's sponsors. British police had also said they were investigating threats from a militant fan group. Buccaneers owner Glazer shares a victory parade ride with head coach Jon Gruden after they defeated the Raiders 48-21 to win the Super Bowl in  2003 . Manchester United fans declare their feelings towards Glazer's takeover with a large banner in 2005 . On the morning of May 12, 2005, the day Glazer became the majority shareholder, a male caller with a British accent called the Buccaneers headquarters, asked many questions about the Bucs and ended the call by saying he wished Glazer were dead, according to an FBI report on the threat. Several hours later, a male caller again speaking with a British accent identified himself as a member of the Manchester United Action Group and warned that the Glazer family would be in danger unless Glazer backed down from his takeover bid, the FBI report said. Another call came the following day, with the man saying he was the same person who had called before and asking, 'Do you remember me?' The caller said he knew people who 'were ready to take action against Glazer,' and against another person whose name is redacted. Within a year of the leveraged buyout, Glazer had two strokes and his son - Avram, Joel and Bryan pictured above - ran the 20-time English champions . The caller said, 'I am giving you another warning' and set a deadline for Glazer to abandon his takeover bid. The FBI issued subpoenas as part of the investigation. But the records show that the case was closed without prosecution because the authorities could not conclusively identify the source of the threats. Because of the threats, the NFL planned for security representatives for all teams the Buccaneers played that season to have pictures of members of the Glazer family, according to the FBI documents. Within a year of the leveraged buyout, Glazer had two strokes and his children ran the 20-time English champions.","New documents reveal that the FBI looked into threats made against Malcolm Glazer in 2005 .

"Jose Fonte has branded Southampton's Capital One Cup quarter-final defeat at Sheffield United 'unacceptable' and issued an apology to their supporters after they 'blew a great opportunity'. A second-half goal from Marc McNulty proved enough to put the Sky Bet League One side through, and inflict a fifth straight defeat on the Saints. Afterwards, manager Ronald Koeman accused Blades boss Nigel Clough of showing a lack of respect, with words exchanged on the benches following the goal and United's first-team coach Chris Morgan sent to the stands before the Dutchman then refused to shake hands at the final whistle. Jose Fonte shows his frustration during's Southampton's defeat at Sheffield United on Tuesday . Fonte appeared to take the defeat by the League One side worse than most and has now spoken out . Portuguese defender Fonte insists the players must shoulder their share of the responsibility for what was a below-par performance on a damp night in South Yorkshire. 'It was not acceptable. I would firstly like to apologise to the fans, they didn't deserve this. That is not us,' Fonte told Southampton's official YouTube channel. 'Given the last games we have lost, we played and we showed that we are better than the opposition and we had the opportunities to win and deserved more from the games. 'But after Tuesday night, I am disappointed obviously and I am angry because we had a great opportunity to go and do something special and we just blew it. 'Everyone needs to take responsibility, not hide in their shell. We must stand up and be counted because there's another game in the Premier League and we need to stop this bad run. Sheffield United midfielder Marc McNulty (second right) bundled the ball into the net for the winning goal . McNulty and his team-mates can now look forward to a semi-final date, and are one round from Wembley . 'The minimum we can do is try our maximum and give everything that we can, but it was disappointing because I think we should have done much better. 'I just want to apologise to the fans, because they didn't deserve it. 'We will be working harder to make sure this never happens again. It is an opportunity lost, but there is still a long season ahead.' Southampton - who lost at Burnley last weekend, following successive defeats by Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United - will look to get their campaign back on track at home to Everton on Saturday. Fonte believes Saints must stick to their slick passing style which helped take them up to second place in the Barclays Premier League earlier in the season. Saints boss Ronald Koeman (centre back) had a bust-up with Blades manager Nigel Clough (front) 'Especially after the first goal we started going long and with all due respect, we are not a long ball team. For the last five years we've been playing football,' the defender said. 'We've opened teams up with one-twos, crosses in the box, playing out of defence, and we changed everything and I don't understand why. 'We've spoke about it and we need to take responsibility, come and get the ball, do what we do, play the way we normally play and that's the way we believe we can win. We didn't do that. 'We didn't create enough changes because we didn't match their desire. Congratulations to them, but from my point of view, we blew a great opportunity and it is just frustrating.'","Southampton were beaten by Sheffield United in Capital One Cup .

"White boots are now by far the most common among top-flight footballers, with almost 48 per cent of players favouring that colour in the last round of Premier League action. White boots were once an indication of a special player - or at least a player who thought he was special. For those less gifted, the old Henry Ford statement used to apply: 'You can have any colour you like, as long as it's black.' But now, judging from the colours on display in top-flight games played between December 13 and 15, it seems it's over three times more likely for a player to wear white boots than black - just 15 per cent of players wore the traditional colour. Green - in its various shades - was also more popular than black on 16.4 per cent. Willian (right) was among five Chelsea players who chose to wear  white boots against Hull . Premier League players now favour white boots over traditional black boots . Not one player from Stoke, Chelsea, Leicester and Everton chose to wear black boots during the last round of Premier League fixtures . TEAM-BY-TEAM FINDINGS .

The 220 players starting games had their footwear noted and the survey found 17 different varieties - in some cases there were two colours that had to be classed as the base. Hull were the most 'old-school' team with six pairs of black boots, but even in these cases the toes were a different, brighter colour. Stoke, Chelsea, Leicester and Everton steered clear of black boots altogether, while Manchester United, West Ham and West Brom sported the greatest range with six different colours worn by their starting XIs. Diego Costa had his shooting boots on as he notched his 12th goal of the season in the 2-0 win over Hull - and what boots they were.

"Earlier this month there was a frisson of excitement as we waited to see whether James Ward might become another one of those rare things: a British man cracking the world’s top 100. On social media, calculations were published about whether he might make the treasured double digits after a late run in some Challengers around the globe, only for Euston’s finest to marginally fall short of the magic mark. Other countries might have found something vaguely comic about this, Wimbledon’s host nation getting worked up about having a second man gaining direct entry into the Grand Slams. The scarcity value of a British man gaining such elevated status is, ultimately, a sign of just how bad things have been in recent decades. James Ward had a great year, in which he nearly infiltrated the top 100 of the men's single rankings . This is not, incidentally, to belittle Ward’s impressive rise this year. He is an admirable professional who deserves everything that comes his way, and pound-for-pound his Davis Cup victory over Sam Querrey would win my vote as the performance of the season from a British man or woman. The progress to the Davis Cup quarter finals, when only an inspired Fabio Fognini prevented Leon Smith’s team from making the last four (why couldn’t he have proved as useless as he was towards the end of the season?), was a highlight of the year. The team competition was also a metaphor for the way a season of promise rather fell away into one of familiar disappointment. In the case of Elena Baltacha it was one of real human tragedy, putting the footling business of elite tennis into perspective. Ward has been an admirable professional, who deserves everything who comes his way . In the trivial pursuit of producing top tennis players the ledger shows that Great Britain did make some progress in the men’s game while sliding backwards on the female side. If we use the top 300 as a benchmark, the number of men inside it has gone up from four to eight, with four inside the top 200 as opposed to three a year ago. On the women’s side there are only three inside the top 300, a desperate figure, down from seven twelve months previously. I will not dwell too much on Andy Murray here, as his exploits are well-documented by the albeit dwindling number of writers who try to cover the sport in a serious fashion. Only he really knows if the changes to his entourage are a good thing or not, but regardless he will surely remain embedded in the top ten, and probably rejoin the top five. The performance of the season goes to James Ward (right), who beat Sam Querry in the Davis Cup . He remains the gold standard, although with the way he is playing at the moment it is difficult to see him beating either Novak Djokovic, or a fully fit Rafael Nadal, in a Grand Slam again. Yet he has shown before that he has the answers. On the wider canvas of British tennis there are cautious grounds for optimism that Lawn Tennis Association Chief Executive Michael Downey and his imported Director of Player Development Bob Brett may be moving things in the right direction. The strategy of trying to build the sport from the bottom up and helping the grass roots flourish has to be the right one, and what is emerging is that the changes to the performance side of things are more radical than had previously been thought. Andy Murray (left) congratulates Ward after his five-set victory against Querry in the Davis Cup . The money-no-object approach is clearly going out of the window, with large cuts expected in the numbers of High Performance Centres, player funding, personnel support and talent identification schemes. Look out for the bountiful award of wildcards to be cut as well. It is part of a policy they are calling ‘customised decentralisation’. This is the kind of jargon you often hear organisations come up with when they have lots of other people’s money to spend, which is the case with the LTA. But whatever it means, if it fosters a greater sense of self-reliance, resourcefulness and ambition among current professionals and aspiring ones then it must be the right thing to do, as those are indispensable qualities required to make the big time. The tragic death of Elena Baltacha in May put tennis into perspective this year . Brett’s biggest attributes are likely to be his improvement of other coaches and the simple setting of standards that should be adhered to. Apparently he is already showing the value of demanding drills, combined with an insistence on discipline. For example little things like the practice of players taking a breather courtside at the National Tennis Centre and checking their mobile phones in the middle of a session is outlawed when he is around. Why it has taken until late 2014 for this to be forbidden you can only wonder. You also hear that many employees are anxious and uncertain about what is going on, with areas such as the staff physio situation said to be a mess. Some of British tennis' stars show off their 'Rally for Bally' wristbands at Queens, in support of Baltacha . Yet as one coach told me, the effect of the wider changes may be to sort out who really wants to be a player and who does not. The apparent retirements this year of Oliver Golding and George Morgan, two young players who had shown such promise, demonstrate the truism that creating a healthy production line is a numbers game. They were part of a generation in who great hope was invested due to junior results, whose other members include Liam Broady and Kyle Edmund. The older ones are barely into their twenties and already the ranks of serious prospective top 150 players are diminishing. Victoria Azarenka takes a selfie at Queens during a pause in play at a charity match for Baltacha . The idea – as one sees in successful tennis countries – is that you get a large enough volume of players with the technical quality, athleticism, attitude and ambition to drive themselves towards the top. Then when you get dropouts, as will inevitably happen for all sorts of reasons, you will still be left with a decent sprinkling of survivors. Whichever way you look at it, you have to get sufficient numbers of those with some genuine potential coming in at the bottom of the pyramid. Broady was a heartening story, finally getting back on track after looking like he was going to fall into that gaping black hole between juniors and the professional ranks. While still having much to do, the Stockport lefthander was testament to the benefits of spending a prolonged spell on the road and getting on a roll through playing a large volume of matches. Laura Robson has struggled through the year with a wrist injury - the worst of all tennis problems . Edmund would probably have hoped to end the year higher but finished on a positive note at the Yokohama Challanger in Japan that saw him enter the world’s top 200. His progress seemed to be arrested by uncertainty over his coaching when Greg Rusedski was brought in. Rusedski’s work ethic and credentials are not in doubt, but there was always going to be a problem with his commitment, given his other interests. The reasons for his appointment seemed tied up with political expediency at the governing body, and the experiment was brought to an end in October, not to the great surprise of shrewder observers. Robson was in action in Australia in January, but has missed a lot of 2014 through injury . But this kind of thing is an almost inevitable consequence when you have a large, centralised system with lots of staff to handle, as we have seen before. One was also left questioning, not for the first time, whether showering a promising young British player with wildcards was, in the long run, a sensible way forward. Edmund has the drive and talent to push on again in 2015, although it seems likely that he and Broady are facing a tough generation of international contemporaries. Heather Watson enjoyed a strong comeback and was, by some distance, the standout GB female performer. Wins over the likes of Dominika Cibulkova and Flavia Penetta showed what she is capable of, but her form tailed off from mid-August onwards, just when it looked she could make a run towards the top 30. Heather Watson had a mightily impressive year, rising from 121 back into the top 50 of women's tennis . Her rise back from 121 to the top 50 was the more impressive for not having any competition from Laura Robson, who was badly missed through that worst of tennis injuries, to the wrist. It has cost her a year of her career at least, but the optimistic view is that it could yet be the making of her - that is if the time away has sharpened her appetite. She could certainly look at what Eugenie Bouchard has achieved in the intervening time and believe she is able to exceed that, as she is more than her equal in physical talent alone. Hopefully Laura will be back at the start of the season as she is already in training in Florida – but we should not expect too much too soon. Wins over the likes of Dominika Cibulkova and Flavia Penetta showed what Watson is capable of . Naomi Broady did well but Jo Konta failed to make any headway, somewhat surprisingly. After that one has to sift through a very long list of players before coming to Katy Dunne and then the chronically underachieving Tara Moore, who is destined to join the swollen ranks of British could-have-beens. Perhaps the most encouraging news was the return from retirement of Naomi Cavaday, who swiftly enjoyed wins at a lower level and, at 25, still has the time to fulfil her potential. There are not, it must be said, too many younger British players setting the world alight, although you hear encouraging things about the long term potential of a few, especially in the 12 to 15 bracket. Naomi Broady had a good year, and played a big match on court 1 at Wimbledon against Caroline Wozniacki . Of course we have heard it all before, the focus on the younger age group, so it is necessary to fend off the inevitable degree of scepticism. But at least the focus now appears to be on preparing players for the professional ranks, and not looking too much at the window dressing of junior performances. The LTA will pay as much attention to the forthcoming participation figures as it will the state of the elite rankings. They will be particularly interesting in light of the huge drop in recreational cricket numbers revealed last week. At the bottom and at the top there are grounds for thinking there may be an improvement next year although, as ever, seeing will be believing.","James Ward was close to infiltrating the men's top 100, but missed out .

"Michael van Gerwen turns up bleary-eyed and takes a moment to finish his coffee before trying to focus his mind on Sergio Aguero’s helicopter, his ambition to own more houses than Phil Taylor and playing darts with Ron Vlaar. It is 11am, but the reigning world darts champion takes a good 10 minutes to compose himself. ‘It’s too early,’ the 25-year-old Dutchman calls across the room. It is clear, early on, that this is going to be a very unusual interview. Van Gerwen, who is preparing to defend his world title, eventually ambles over. I ask about the story of him tiling Dennis Bergkamp’s roof when he was an apprentice, before his darts career took off in his late teenage years. Michael van Gerwen is looking forward to defending his World Darts Championship title . The Dutchman won his first world title at Alexandra Palace last year . ‘That’s not true,’ he says. ‘I was doing his neighbour’s house. I’ve never met Dennis Bergkamp. I’ve met a lot of footballers, but not Dennis Bergkamp. ‘I speak to Ron Vlaar regularly. Tim Krul has been to the darts a couple of times. Robin van Persie likes darts. It’s nice and it’s good for the sport. It doesn’t make a difference to me — I just want to do well for the ones who’ve paid for the tickets,’ he adds in his thick Dutch accent, laughing loudly. Van Gerwen befriended his compatriot Vlaar, the Aston Villa and Holland defender, when he was at a Premier League darts match in Birmingham. He reveals that Vlaar has a dartboard hanging on a door in his house and marks on the side whenever people throw 180s or finish with a score over 100. Van Gerwen doesn't think Phil Taylor's haul of 16 world titles will ever be matched . Taylor and Van Gerwen will be among the favourites for the title when the tournament commences . ‘I went there for practice and a bit of a chat and he was marking all these things down for me on his door,’ Van Gerwen recalls. ‘I play a bit of darts and snooker with him. He plays quite well. I’ve played with a couple of footballers. Ron Vlaar and Rafael van der Vaart are the best.’ Now, when Van Gerwen is competing in the Midlands, he meets Vlaar for a coffee or they play darts and snooker together. ‘He won the last time we played snooker,’ Van Gerwen adds, looking slightly annoyed. ‘It’s always a tight game because we’re both rubbish. I’m no Ronnie O’Sullivan. He’s never taken a game off me in darts, though.’ Van Gerwen is the world No 1 and is something of a sensation in the sport. By 17 he had become the youngest player to win the World Masters and throw a televised nine-dart finish. Van Gerwen has made a sensational rise in recent years having endured a tough spell . Van Gerwen plays darts with Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar . But he went through a tough spell until two years ago, when he began to zoom up the rankings from 38 and became the youngest person to win the World Championship last year aged 24, a title he will defend at London’s Alexandra Palace when the tournament starts on Thursday. Consider that 16-time world champion Taylor — ‘The Power’ — did not break through until he was 29, it is some achievement. It is why World Cup footballers come to watch him play. But Van Gerwen does not believe Taylor’s record world-title haul can ever be matched because there are now so many high-quality players on the circuit. He has, however, thought of another way to catch him. ‘I was living with my parents two-and-a-half years ago and now I have two houses,’ he explains. ‘I’m going to try to build it up. Trying to catch Phil, he’s got a bit more. He’s got about 12 houses. ‘I’ve done all the hard work to get in this position. That’s why I’m strong . . . ’ He tails off, pausing to consider how best to explain. ‘I need to think how to put this. It’s too early,’ he repeats. I point out that it is now 11.30. ‘You don’t know the life of a darts player,’ he says. ‘I was up late last night, I went to the Football Supporters’ Federation awards. William Hill sponsor them as well as the World Darts Championship.’ After a moment, he forgets the point he was making. I mention that Sergio Aguero was there to pick up the FSF player of the year award. ‘With a helicopter,’ he adds. ‘I don’t have a helicopter yet. Argentina lost the World Cup final, he’s not even world champion.’ Sky Sports will show the William Hill World Darts Championship exclusively live on the Sky Sports Darts channel starting next Thursday.","Michael van Gerwen will begin world title defence next week .

"A man who was charged over a hijack scare on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Bali has been found not guilty of interfering with a crew member. Matt Christopher Lockley, 28, triggered the airline's hijack procedure in April when he allegedly bashed on the cockpit door and demanded entry. He pleaded not guilty to interfering with a crew member in October, arguing he was trying to get into the toilet and was confused because he was having a panic attack. The Brisbane Magistrates Court previously heard Lockley was paranoid someone had interfered with his luggage. Scroll down for video . Matt Lockley, 27, sparked a hijack scare by allegedly pounding on the cockpit door of the Virgin plane . Pleaded not guilty: Matt Lockley attended court on Thursday . Well, this is interesting!

Matt Christopher Lockley is dragged off the Virgin plane . Guns drawn! Mr Lockley's alleged antics caused an international hijack scare . Magistrate Judith Daley on Friday found Lockley not guilty of interfering with the crew and accepted that he was suffering from an undetermined medical condition. Lockley said he 'definitely had a panic attack'. 'I am very relieved ... I never tried to get in anywhere, it was a big misunderstanding,' he told reporters outside court. Flight attendants have testified that about four hours into the flight Lockley complained that other passengers had tampered with his bag and that he was being followed. Attendant Angela Demo said he asked her to get rid of two zip-locked bags containing vitamin bottles and toiletries. He had feared other passengers had tampered with his bag and said he knew 'the ramifications of entering Indonesia with illicit drugs'. Lockley allegedly complained of feeling claustrophobic, and said he had 'perhaps watched too many movies and he'd had a drink the night before', flight attendant Abigail Tilley said.

Ms Demo said Lockley's eyes were dilated and he seemed nervous and possibly under the influence of drugs. The court heard a woman began suffering a suspected heart attack about five hours into the flight. Lockley allegedly offered to perform CPR and said he had a first aid certificate. Flight attendant Jenni Manning told the court she had to leave the semi-conscious patient to get oxygen for her because other cabin crew were busy dealing with Lockley. About half an hour later, he was seen pounding loudly on the cockpit door, rattling the handle and saying, 'Let me in'. Ms Demo said when Lockley refused to stop she activated Virgin's hijack procedure drill by giving a verbal code to the flight deck. 'I was frightened,' she said. 'I came across as feeling threatened and felt that he was being aggressive.' The trial continues.","Matt Christopher Lockley sparked a hijack scare when he banged on the cockpit door of a Virgin flight .

"Snoop Dogg posted a derogatory meme of Iggy Azalea earlier in the week. And he continued to attack her with ever-mounting vitriol... until it came to an abrupt end on Wednesday afternoon. The 42-year-old posted a contrite video on Instagram voicing regret over his behaviour and a promise to 'not do it again'. Scroll down for video... He's sorry: Snoop Dogg posted a contrite video on Instagram voicing regret over his behaviour and a promise to 'not do it again' after attacking Iggy Azalea online . In the clip he says: 'Alright boys and girls I just got off the phone with my homeboy TIP (rapper TI), the king of Atlanta, and it is officially over. 'No more bad talk. I apologize. Yeah I apologize I won't do it again.' He captioned the video: 'It's over I'm bac on my cool s*** no harm no foul. much love @troubleman31t respect sorry bout that'. Staying cool: Throughout the ordeal Iggy did her best to not react to the vitriol coming her way as the rapper is one of her heroes . Water under the bridge: Iggy, 24, graciously accepted the gesture, tweeting back: 'I appreciate the apology @snoopdogg' Moving on: The star let fans know she wanted to forget the entire saga . And Iggy, 24, graciously accepted the gesture, tweeting back: 'I appreciate the apology @snoopdogg'. Adding: 'Let that be that people, time to focus on the positive things I've got going on. no time to dwell on the negative.' The night before the legendary rapper has escalated his online vitriol into outright name-calling and apparently veiled threats. Snoop told Iggy to check herself before he did in an Instagram video posted late Tuesday night. Hitting out: Snoop Dogg appeared to threaten Iggy by telling her to check herself before he did in an Instagram video posted late Tuesday night . Soon after the blonde singer's boyfriend Nick Young tweeted, 'Ain’t nobody worried about no SnoopLion .. This dude Just goin thru a midlife Crisis you Go get convertible yet . OG’s out here losin.' Snoop originally said that the Australian rapper looked like man without make-up on as he posted various cruel memes. But on Tuesday things clearly got a bit more ugly, as Snoop says in his short video: 'Say, b****, you’re f****** with the wrong n****, and your n**** better check you before I do.' He has her side: Nick Young, with Iggy in August at the MTV Video Music Awards, stood up for his girlfriend with a tweet on Wednesday . Adding: 'You funky b****. Yeah, you. F****** c***.' In what appeared to be a response to the video, as it was posted soon after, Iggy tweeted: 'its like the guy that asks for your number and then says you ugly and a b**** when you say no…' After Snoop initially blasted her online Iggy, 24, used Twitter to voice her displeasure at the comments, saying: 'Why would you post such a mean pic on insta when you send your body guards to ask me for pictures every time we are at shows?' She then added: 'I'm disappointed you'd be such an a** for no reason.' Hitting back: Iggy responded to Snoop Dogg's Instagram post on Monday, suggesting she looks like a man without make up - she Tweeted the rapper saying: 'I'm disappointed you'd be such an a** for no reason' The photo that started it: Snoop posted this shot which he said looked like Iggy with no makeup . TMZ reported the singer had made the post, but then deleted it from her account. The social media stoush started when the veteran 42-year-old rapper Instagrammed a picture of a blonde, long haired male on Monday with the caption 'Iggy Azalea no makeup.' It's not the first time he has taken pot shots at others in his sphere of work - he  previously feuded with legendary rapper Eazy-E and at one point called out America's entire East Coast. Many of Snoop's 3.5million-plus followers were also tickled by the derisive picture, as it scored thousands of likes and comments within hours. It comes days after the Australian rapper was spotted sporting minimal makeup after she arrived at LAX airport last week. Iggy looked a natural beauty, wrapping her enviable figure in a black thigh high slit maxi skirt and a dark greens sweater - but the Gin N' Juice rapper jested otherwise. And while Snoop, who famously burst onto the hip hop scene over 20 years ago with a song dissing rapper Eazy-E, poked fun at Iggy, other American rappers have been harsher. Brushing it off: It's not the first time another performer has mentioned her name in recent months, as MC Rah Digga called Iggy out for 'not being real' The rapper endured her share of controversy last month after fans perceived Nicki Minaj's BET Award acceptance speech as a dig at Iggy. 'What I want the world to know about Nicki Minaj is when you hear Nicki Minaj spit, Nicki Minaj wrote it,' she said - prompting many to assume that the Anaconda rapper was criticising her fellow female artist. Nicki would later clarify her comments on social media and deny that any insult was meant by her comments, but another female rapper, MC Rah Digga, called Iggy out, saying her music 'is not real to me.' But The New Classic in unperturbed, Tweeting 'Its definetly funny seeing people get so emotional over it all. What does it matter? Music is music and many enjoy mine, no need to feel upset.'

"A prankster was branded a 'reptile' today after he admitted recording himself doing a vile NekNomination stunt by swallowing - a live frog and lizard. Sheldon Jeans, 23, stripped to the waist and dressed in a 'Scouser' black curly wig and moustache before introducing the stunt to the camera. During the 90-second-long clip, Jeans downed a glass of water filled with crickets, before putting a frog in the same vessel and knocking it back whole. Scroll down for video . Sheldon Jeans swallowed a live frog and a lizard during the Neknomination stunt which he posted on Facebook . Jeans pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to the creatures under the 2006 Animal Welfare Act . Jeans, pictured, apologised to the three-inch long lizard before covering it in water and swallowing it whole . Jeans, of Cowplain, Hampshire even apologises to the three inch long lizard before covering it with water and swallowing it whole. Despite claiming he regurgitated the animals afterwards, Jeans became the first person to be successfully prosecuted for causing cruelty to any creature other than a fish, while taking part in the web craze. He was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work after admitting causing unnecessary suffering to the animals, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Portsmouth Magistrates' Court also ordered him to pay £1,200 in costs after changing his plea to guilty on the first day of his trial. RSPCA inspector Alan Browning said: 'Unfortunately this isn't the first case we've had involving NekNomination, but it is the first to come to court that involved animals other than fish. 'The two small animals would have suffered considerably during this incident, going through the distress of being swallowed and coming into contact with stomach acids. 'We hope this sick game is now on the decline as it is just not acceptable to subject animals to this sort of ordeal.' In the video, he said: 'Hello this is Sheldon Jeans with a NekNomination. 'As you can see on the table in front of me, I've got a glass full of crickets. I had to get little ones because the geezer thought I was buying these for myself. 'I've got myself a lizard and I've got myself a frog. I'm going to call this the ""I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here Nek Challenge."" First up, for the crickets.' Jeans zoomed the video camera onto to the frog so viewers could see that the amphibian was real . He also showed viewers that he had put the lizard, pictured, into the bottom of his glass before drinking . He also drank a glass full of crickets although these were not covered by animal protection legislation . He then called the frog a 'little fellow', before swallowing it whole and declaring it 'f***ing lovely.' He said to the lizard: 'Sorry mate, but you are next. In with the lizard, we'll have some of that. Add a little bit of water. Don't worry son, it's your turn.' Jeans then posted the footage on Facebook, which led to people complaining to the RSPCA. The only reason he was not prosecuted for killing the crickets during the 3 February stunt was because they are not covered under the Act. Jeans was fined £1,200 and ordered to complete 80 hours of unpaid community service following his stunt . Last month, Will Williams, of Caernarfon, north Wales, was criticised after drinking 70cl of the 40 per cent whiskey ahead of what he called a 'weekend on the beer'. Health experts say the reckless stunt - in which Mr Williams consumed at least 28 units of alcohol - could easily have killed him. The video, which has gained nearly 400,000 views on YouTube, shows Mr Williams biting the seal from the bottle of liquor while his friends laugh in the background. He then inserts a straw into the bottle to help the spirits go down quickly and knocks it back in less than 10 seconds. After spitting on the floor, he then tells his friends 'Neknominate that', a reference to the recent internet craze that saw some killed after drinking large amounts of alcohol. Many of the video's viewers went online to criticise Mr Williams for completing the stunt, which they pointed out could easily have been fatal. In an earlier court case, bin man Paul Wooding of Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire was handed an 18-month conditional discharge after he swallowed live fish during a Neknomination stunt from February. Still from a video of Paul Wooding preparing and drinking a cocktail containing alcohol and four live minnows. (RSPCA) In the video, Wooding announces 'this is my Neknominate' before downing a pint glass of wine, gin, vodka, rum and lemonade - together with the fish. The footage came to the RSPCA's attention after it was seen on Wooding's Facebook page. In it, after downing the cocktail, he nominates four other people to join the drinking game. The Neknominate phenomenon is understood to have emerged in Australia, with Wooding's believed to be the fifth such case to come to court in connection with the craze. After being interviewed about the video, Wooding later posted on Facebook: 'Some people's lives must be that sad and boring, to get any excitement they have to report me to the RSPCA for my Neknominate,' Wooding was also ordered to pay £500 costs and a £15 victim surcharge.","Sheldon Jeans filmed himself swallowing the frog and lizard for a dare .

"Trevor Hicks today relived the 1989 tragedy which killed his two daughters alongside 94 other football fans . The father of two teenagers who were killed in the Hillsborough disaster has revealed the heart-breaking moment he had to identify his daughter's bodies on the pitch. Trevor Hicks was on the Leppings Lane terrace when he saw fans crushed in pens behind the goals where his daughters Sarah and Victoria were standing on April 15 1989. The teenagers were among 96 fans who were crushed to death at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Their parents are among viictims' families giving evidence at a new inquest into the tragedy in Warrington. Today, he told of how he and his wife, Jenni, had travelled to the stadium with their daughters who 'gave them the slip' to watch the match from the stands with their friends. But around ten minutes before kick-off, the father said he noticed people being crushed up against the fence behind the goal posts where they were. 'Some things burn in your memory but I saw an old chap, because I was much younger then, grey haired like me in a grey suit. 'He really looked like he was dying stood up and looked unconscious and other people around him looked in distress.' Mr Hicks was standing on the terrace below the police control box and had tried to alert an officer to what was happening. He said: 'We were calling up at him and then as I reported several times, he eventually turned to me and told me to, ""shut my f*****g prattle"". He added: 'It was just getting worse. I’ve said this before, it smelt worse. You could sense that things were really, really bad.' Then to his horror, he saw the body of his daughter Victoria being passed over the fence, . Laid out next to her sister on the pitch, he tried reviving the teenager as two other men gave CPR to Sarah. Mr Hicks said it was 'absolute mayhem' on the pitch with just one St John's Ambulance cadet in sight. Victoria (left) and Sarah Hicks (right) left their parents to stand in the pen behind the goal post at the football stadium on April 15 1989 . Victoria was taken to a medical cubicle and pronounced dead around 10-15 minutes later, her father recalled. 'As soon as I knew there was nothing I could do for Vicky my attention turned to find Sarah and what I could do for her. 'Again it was utter chaos in the hospital, people milling everywhere, there was casualties, bodies, people, police officers. 'The hospital staff were all over the place.' After seeing their daughter's photograph on a wall of Polaroids 'of the dead', the couple identified their girls' lifeless bodies formerly. Jenni Hicks (left) and her husband (right) are among victims' families who fought for the original inquiry's ruling that the girls' deaths were accidental to be quashed . Mr Hicks said: 'Basically they brought the girls out on to trolleys. 'They unzipped the body bags so we could identify them formally. 'Bear in mind Jenni had not seen either of them, she wanted to give them a hug, which she did and we noticed Sarah’s body was quite warm.' The couple  then gave a statement to police and asked 'repeatedly how much they had had to drink before going home.' The following day, they were 'beseiged by the press,' he told the inquest. His account was heard at an inquest into the disaster following a High Court decision to quash the result of a 1991 inquiry which ruled the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans were accidental. Ninety-six Liverpool fans were killed at the football stadium due to severe overcrowding. A man receives medical treatment on the pitch which Mr Hicks described as 'mayhem' Fans on the terraces climb over each other to safety. Mr Hicks said he pleaded with police to take notice of the developing tragedy but was ignored . When asked about earlier witness accounts which claimed Liverpool fans were 'blind drunk', Mr Hicks said he had no recollection of that. 'I'll probably get told off for saying this but it really does brass me off to have to listen to that,' he said. To suggestions that fans were 'pushing and shoving' to get into the grounds before the tragedy, he said: 'I must have been at a different game.' Mr Hicks added the way he was treated by police following his children's deaths was 'appalling'. The inquest continues.

"Gabi Jones, 29, is almost four times the weight of an average woman her age. Weighing in at 620lbs (44 st, 3lb) Gabi, from Denver, is super-morbidly obese but rather than trying to lose weight she is deliberately trying to add pounds to her frame, thinking of her body as a piece of art work. She has been gaining weight deliberately since she reached 250lbs (18st) and is now what is known as a ‘gainer’, a woman who embraces being severely overweight and strives to be even larger. Scroll down for video . Gabi Jones, 29, currently weighs over 620lbs but is deliberately trying to get larger . Gabi says: ‘I don’t know when I’m going to stop but I still want to be able to walk. I think walking is important. 'I’m not like everyone else. My body is voluptuous, my body is sexy. I think fat is art and I’m a masterpiece in the making. 'It’s about me growing softer. It‘s about the added pounds and my arms getting jigglier. ‘For me gaining is art, it’s beautiful. I am like a Picasso, I want to change society.’ Unbelievably Gabi claims that she is aware of the extreme health dangers of her size, but still refuses to stop gaining weight. She also understands that her love of obesity is at odds with society’s view of normality. Unlike many women, Gabi relishes the jiggle of her arm fat, considering her huge body a 'work of art' 'I get grief from people pretty much every day of my life about my body and my size,' she adds. ‘I know people who are bigger die younger, I’ve accepted that. A lot of people said I would only make it until I was 25 but I’ve made it until I’m 29 and I believe I will make it until I’m at least 40', she says. Bullied since childhood about her size, Gabi fought her weight for years until she discovered the world of gainers and the thousands of men who love large women. Kenyan, 18, from Kansas, is one such man. Explaining his unusual obsession he says: ‘Every aspect of being fat is attractive to me. I couldn’t really say why but I love it and it is part of me.’ Gabi runs a website for fat admirers and her particular draw is her stomach, which overhangs almost to her knees in an ‘upside down heart shape’ He is one of thousands of men who pay to log onto Gabi’s website, where she runs a business catering to an army of fat admirers by posting pictures and videos of herself. Men often request videos which see Gabi playing with her stomach fat, rubbing body lotion on it or shaking it in what is known as ‘belly play’. Known as ‘Gaining Gabi’, Kenyan has become a huge fan: ‘She looks like the living embodiment of the goddess,’ he adds. In the market for a ‘feeder’ or a man who wants to intentionally feed a woman to make her bigger, Gabi gets visits from Kenyan who will cook and feed her a meal. 'Being able to feed Gabi is just amazing', he explains, 'I mean some people would say it's just too disgusting but it is heaven to me. 'It's definitely sexual but its not like ""oh I want to feed you and have sex with you"", it's more like ""I want to feed you and get you bigger and more beautiful and treat you like a goddess."" Her fans enjoy feeding and then being squashed by Gabi so that thay can enjoy her full weight . The pair also engage in 'squashing' where Gabi sits on Kenyan to allow him to fully feel her weight himself. 'It's like an elephant sitting on a rabbit,' Gabi says. But Kenyan loves his experience of squashing: 'I like feeling the weight. I mean you can see it on the scale but it kind of hits home when a woman sits on you how successful you are as a feeder.' He now hopes to take his feeder relationship with Gabi further. 'I would like to be physical but at the same time I don't want to rush things. I've rushed things in the past and they haven't worked out and I really want this.'","Gabi Jones currently weighs in at over 600lbs but is  trying to get larger .

"Andrew Cuomo and Bill de Blasio left early from a Church dinner to join a star-studded birthday celebration for Al Sharpton. The New York Post reports that the governor and the mayor went to receive their lashes at the annual Al Smith dinner, held in support of Catholic charities, before ducking out to wish the Reverend a happy birthday at the Four Seasons two blocks north. Cuomo reportedly left the white-tie dinner halfway through and arrived still dressed in his tuxedo, while the mayor changed out of his fancy threads before heading over after the event. Respects: (from left to right) Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo shake hands with Cardinals Edward Egan and Timothy Dolan at the Alfred E Smith Foundation Memorial Dinner . Spotlight: Aretha Franklin (right) watches Al Sharpton blow out candles while de Blasio looks on. The mayor joked 'The Queen is higher ranking than the mayor' at the celebration. They were joined by other New York pols like Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand in celebrating Sharpton's 60th. 'He has grown immensely over the years,' said Cuomo during a speech for Al. 'And he’s no longer just New York’s Al Sharpton. He’s the nation’s Rev Sharpton — and the nation is better for it.' At the  dinner, hosted by the Archdiocese of New York in rememberance of Gov Alfred Smith, the first Catholic candidate for president, Cuomo had taken his licks, according to theDaily News . 'The governor just got back from Afghanistan — the only place more hostile than Albany,' said Alfred Smith IV, great grandson of the honoree governor of the dinner. Toastmasters also took shots at the mayor, with Charlie Rose joking that the next book from Bill O'Reilly, who's written titles such as 'Killing Lincoln' and 'Killing Kennedy,' would be 'Killing Groundhogs.' 'You know where he’s going to go for his researcher,' said Rose, a reference to de Blasio's recent red-faced episode where he dropped the Groundhog's Day mascot, which later died. White-tie: Nan Smith, wife of Alfred Smith IV, is flanked by the mayor and the governor during the dinner, where pols and public figures are roasted in support of Catholic charity . Chatting: Bill de Blasio exchanges a remark with Andrew Cuomo, before the two ducked out of the ceremony to make it to Sharpton's birthday . Pals: Mayor de Blasio embraces Al Sharpton during a speech at his 60th birthday celebration, which drew Democratic pols and celebrities . Kenneth Langone, the billionaire founder of The Home Depot who earlier this year compared the rhetoric of anti-inequality politicians to that of Hitler, also took the microphone and razzed the Reverend on his birthday. 'I don’t see the person in charge of the NYPD up here tonight - Al Sharpton,' said Langone, to which NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton responded with a big laugh. But the mayor, arriving at the birthday bash, which was hosted by Sharpton's National Action Network and drew sponsors like AT&T and celebrities like Aretha Franklin, didn't mind the heat. 'The more people criticize him the more I want to hang out with him,' said de Blasio.","According to the Post, Cuomo left midway through the charity function hosted by the Archdiocese of New York to make it to Al Sharpton's 60th .

"Stunning images of outer space have been released, which have been taken by amateur astronomers and photographers. The Central West Astronomical Society received more than 200 entrants across Australia and picked the best of the best for the 10th annual David Malin Awards, as part of the CWAS AstroFest. The overall winner of the astrophotography awards was Paul Haese of South Australia for his incredible image of the Orion Nebula - titled 'Dust and Gas'. Judged by world renowned astrophotographer, Dr David Malin, who told Daily Mail Australia the standard of this year's entrants was highly outstanding. Scroll down for video . Paul Haese's deep sky image of 'Dust and Gas' won the overall 2014 Central West Astronomical Society Astrophotography Awards . Phil HartWide-Field's was another winner of the competition for his photo 'Dusty Heart of the Milky Way' Stefan Buda's composition of Mars over several months - entitled 'Mars 2014' - was also awarded . Paul Haese's image, submitted in the Solar System - Wide-Field category, was the photo editors pick. It's entitled 'Prominence' Phil Hart also entered an image in The Moon category, with his award-winning photo 'Marine Moonset' David Fitz-Henry's photo 'The Horsehead and Flame Nebulas' was also awarded the Photo Editor's Choice . Dr Malin, who's been in the industry for 40 years, was particularly impressed by Mr Haese's image. 'I think it is the best true-colour image of the Orion Nebula I have seen for a long time,' he said. 'It has everything. The basics are well covered by a realistic-looking colour balance and the dynamic range, which makes the heart of the nebula look brighter than everything else, which is as it should be. But the other things are right too, including the delicate, faint nebulosity that fills the field and the careful handling of the bright stars, which don't dominate the image.' AstroFest organiser John Sarkissian told Daily Mail Australia he was satisfied that CWAS is able to showcase the Australian talent. 'Each year the event has become better and better and the quality of the photos are phenomenal,' he said. Winners were presented with their awards at the CWAS AstroFest conference dinner in Parkes, central west region of NSW, on July 19. An exhibition of the photos will be on display at CSIRO Parkes Observatory's Visitors Centre until July next year while a second touring exhibition, with a selection of images organised by the Powerhouse Museum, will travel to selected venues throughout Australia. It began at the Sydney Observatory and is now in Melbourne. Last year, Mr Sarkissian said the exhibitions attracted about 234,000 viewers from across the nation.

"The taxpayer has paid more than £2million buying smartphones and iPads for bureaucrats in NHS quangos, it can be revealed. Thousands of iPhones and tablet computers have been bought for staff at NHS England and Public Health England, set up under the coalition's reforms to save money for the health service. The government insisted it helped staff work more flexibly, but the expensive gadgets are all for managers and not doctors and nurses. Scroll down for video . Since Jeremy Hunt became Health Secretary, his department and NHS quangos have spent tens of thousands of pounds on Apple iPhones and iPads, it has emerged . New details of spending on technology emerged in response to a parliamentary question by shadow public health minister Luciana Berger. Data released by health minister Dan Poulter shows that NHS England and Public Health England, both formed last year, were the biggest spenders on iPads and iPhones. NHS England bought 115 iPads and 400 iPhones in the year before it was officially launched in April 2013, and since then has bought another 150 iPads and 1,900 ipads. The quango's total bill comes to £1.2million. Public Health England, also formed last year, has spent a total of £530,000 on 2,036 iPhones and £113,743 on 65 iPads. The Department of Health itself, which is run by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, has spent almost £40,000 on four iPhones and 95 iPads. The Health & Social Care Information Centre, which collects and analyses NHS patient data, has bought five iPads and 186 iPhones, costing a total of £45,875. The Care Quality Commission, which inspects care homes and hospitals, bought 238 iPads and two iPhones, costing £129,122. And the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which rules on spending on drugs, spent £3,717 on nine iPads and an iPhone. Karl Turner MP said: 'At a time when the NHS is in crisis, out-of-touch Tory ministers are splashing more than £2 million on iPhones and iPads for pen-pushers. 'Labour is promising an extra £2.5 billion beyond Tory plans – which will be spent on patients, not office perks.' NHS England and Public Health England, both set up last year under the coalition's NHS reorganisation, have spent the most on iPads and iPhones . The government has been repeatedly criticised for the controversial reorganisation of the NHS, which saw Primary Care Trusts abolished and a new network of quangos and clinical bodies set up instead. The changes were designed to reduce the number of managers and put decision-making in the hands of doctors. Insiders have described the reforms as 'unintelligible gobbledygook' which had been a 'huge strategic error' for the Conservative's reputation for looking after the health service. The controversial shake-up, which was not included in either Coalition party's manifesto, was drawn up by Andrew Lansley, when he was the health secretary. It was originally claimed it would save £7.7billion, but it was later downgraded to £6billion. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Employers across the world are embracing 21st Century technology such as smartphones and tablets because they allow staff to be more flexible and efficient, and in the case of the public sector provide better value for money for taxpayers. ""Our bureaucracy-busting reforms to the NHS are saving £1.5billion a year. There are also over 13,500 more frontline staff and 7,000 fewer managers in the NHS since May 2010.' Critics have complained that managers given pay-offs after health bodies were axed were quickly rehired by new NHS groups. Yesterday the Treasury announced redundancy payouts given to NHS managers are to be clawed back if workers get a new job in the health service. Ministers vowed to end the revolving door of highly-paid administrators handed golden goodbyes worth thousands of pounds before walking straight into another role. But the move was dismissed as 'too little, too late' after 4,000 have already been rehired and it emerged staff will be able to keep the cash if they wait for a year before taking up a new post.","EXCLUSIVE: Quangos set up under NHS reorganisation spent most .

"It was one of the most popular TV series of its time and fans were devastated when it disappeared from their screens forever after just two seasons. But two of Thunderbirds' most-loved characters made a welcome return to the capital earlier this week to celebrate the release of a new documentary film about the making of the cult 1960s series. Aristocratic secret agent Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her loyal butler Aloysius Parker, two of the show's most popular puppets, were given a whistle-stop tour of some of London's top tourist sights, including Madame Tussauds, where Lady Penelope was granted a brief audience with 'Her Majesty the Queen' and given a chance to snuggle up to Hollywood heartthrob 'George Clooney'. Scroll down for video . Sorry Penelope, he's already taken! The Thunderbirds star seemed particularly fond of the George Clooney waxwork . The aristocratic Thunderbirds agent posed up for a picture with 'the Queen' during her visit to Madame Tussauds . During their whirlwind tour of London, the two puppets, pictured right with creator Gerry Anderson, also paid a visit to tourist hotspot the London Eye (left) Filmed in Supermarionation gives Thunderbirds fans a chance to see how the popular series was filmed - and how the show's unique puppetry processes were first developed . The puppet pair, who also took the time to enjoy a trip on the London Eye, were helping to promote the newly-released Filmed in Supermarionation, a documentary  by British director Stephen La Riviere. It charts the TV successes of the late Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, who died in 2012 aged 83 after being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. The film focuses on popular sci-fi series Thunderbirds and details the creation of Anderson's innovative supermarionation filming techniques, which were first made famous by the popular puppet series. Supermarionation is a puppetry technique created in the 1960s. The technique relies on the use of lip-synched marionettes, controlled by supposedly invisible wire-pulling on 3D sets. It was first developed by Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson, his then-wife Sylvia and their film company AP Films. The technique was first made famous by the Thunderbirds series, which remains one of the most well-known supermarionation shows ever made. The popular process has since been parodied in a variety of TV and film projects, including 2004 cult comedy film Team America. Filmed in Supermarionation gives a unique behind-the-scenes insight into the development of the original thirty-two Thunderbirds episodes, which were first broadcast between 1965 and 1966. It features never-before-seen interviews with Gerry and his team of puppeteers, as well as a series of comical puppet 'blooopers'. The two series of Thunderbirds, which has just celebrated its 50th anniversary, were filmed in Slough at a run-down warehouse studio Anderson soundproofed with 1,500 egg-boxes and it is here that much of the documentary footage is based. The series told the story of the International Rescue team, a group of secret agents who flew mighty rockets from their secret Tracy Island refuge to save those in peril. Lady Penelope, who was frequently seen being driven around in a pink, six-wheeled Rolls-Royce by chauffeur Parker, served as the team's London field agent. In the original series, the character was voiced by Anderson's then-wife Sylvia, who also was also credited with helping him to create and develop the show. Both creators feature heavily in the new documentary. Filmed in Supermarionation also offers fans additional behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into some of Anderson's other more popular TV projects, including sci-fi series Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet. But it is Thunderbirds that has remained Anderson's most popular supermarionation production. The sci-fi series has been adapted for the big screen three times - two puppet film sequels which were released in 1966 and 1968 and a live-action film adaptation which premiered in 2004 - and will soon return to our televisions in a new ITV series, Thunderbirds Are Go! The 26-part programme, which is due to air in Spring 2015, will feature the vocal talents of Gone Girl actress Rosamund Pike, 35, who will voice Lady Penelope, and Game of Thrones star Thomas Sangster, 24, who will play International Rescue team members Gordon and John Tracy. Filmed in Supermarionation is out now on DVD, Blu-ray and Limited Edition Box Set #FiS .

"Occasional wine drinkers will be saying cheers to a new gadget designed to prevent opened bottles from going off. The revolutionary device, which goes on sale for £269 today, pierces corks using an ultra-thin needle which wine can then be poured through. This prevents air getting into the bottle and stops the wine from going off, meaning drinkers can enjoy a glass or two of their favourite tipple without having to polish off the whole lot. Scroll down for video . The new Coravin 1000  gadget pierces the cork of a wine bottle without taking it out completely meaning that drinkers can keep a bottle of wine fresh for months . The Coravin 1000, which can be used on all wines apart from sparkling types, replaces the void left by the poured wine with argon, an inert gas that has no effect on taste or smell. Once the needle is removed the pressure on the cork closes the hole back up, protecting the leftover wine from oxidation. Manufacturers of the device say drinkers can still be enjoying wine from the same bottle months after it was first opened. The only downside is that it takes 25 seconds to pour each glass of wine using the needle. The drinks gizmo is the product of American entrepreneur and wine enthusiast Greg Lambrecht. Being the first of its kind the innovative design yields a rather high price tag, going on sale today at Harrods for £269. Mr Lambrecht, 45, from New York, says that it was his own passion for wine that drove him to create the Coravin. The cutting edge gadget replaces the void left by the poured wine with argon, an inert gas that has no effect on taste . 'It was inspired by my love of wine and the never-ending discovery in taste and aroma that it provides. 'My dream was to magically pour wine from bottles without ever pulling the cork. The remaining wine could then go back in my cellar, so that I could enjoy it again whenever I wanted.' Mr Lambrecht is thrilled with the final result but admits that it has been a long time coming, with the device taking him ten years to develop. 'What followed was a decade of development and testing until I had a system that left the cork in place, but still delivered great glasses of wine, indistinguishable from untouched bottles. 'For the first time, wine enthusiasts are able to enjoy wine by the glass without committing to the whole bottle, enabling you to enjoy your wine glass by glass, weeks or months later,' he added. Greg Lambrecht, the inventor says that he believes that the device could be used at home as well as in restaurant and bars . For Mt Lambrekt his design is a complete necessity and he expects to see it in both domestic and commercial situations. 'The Coravin System is for both consumers at home, as well as businesses such as restaurants, wine shops, wineries and wine bars.' The American creative  believes that his invention could revolutionise wine tasting: 'The Coravin System allows wine enthusiasts to expand their palates by comparing, contrasting and tasting across multiple bottles at a time. 'Anyone who enjoys wine will be able to get more creative with their food and wine pairings, and be able to enjoy finer wines by the glass at any time,' he said. .","The Coravin preserves bottles of wine for months after they've been opened .

"Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has slammed Mama June for bringing her molester back into their lives and said that she will spit in his face if she ever sees him again. The 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' star appeared in an emotional interview with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday to speak about claims that her mother June Shannon has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel, who served 10 years behind bars after Anna accused him of abuse. 'I'm mad. I'm upset. I feel betrayed. I feel very hurt,' she said. 'That's the main thing that I am - I feel very hurt that Mama let him come around. 'She's smiling and giggling when he's around. You know, he's a child molester, Mama. He did this to me. Why would you let him come around the girls knowing what he did?' Scroll down for video . Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, has spoken out about her anger in an interview with Entertainment Tonight after her mother was pictured with the man who Anna says molested her when she was eight . Hurt: She said that she would spit in Mark McDaniel's face if she saw him again and would tell him to leave . She said she cannot believe her mother would bring the convicted molester in contact with her younger children, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14. 'You should have told him to leave!' Anna said of her mother. 'If that was me and I was there I would tell him, ""You did this to yourself, and you're not supposed to be around kids. Either you leave or I'll call the cops and your a** will go back to jail"".' She added that she could not understand why her mother is letting him around the girls - as photographs have suggested - especially because she could lose custody of them if a child services investigation finds anything untoward . 'She let him get around Alana and Pumpkin knowing that she is going to get the kids taken away,' she cried. 'Why? Why let him? Anger: She said she does not understand why her mother would put her other children, Honey Boo Boo and Pumpkin, in danger by bringing them into contact with a child molester . Angry: Sandra Hale - June's mother and Anna's grandmother - said she wanted to kill McDaniel when she heard Anna's allegations. The grandmother, who brought up Anna, will appear in an interview tonight . 'It's Mama's fault. It's her fault. She has to live with it. She has brung the past back and now she can't get the past away now.' When host Nischelle Turner asked her to send a message to McDaniel, she lost her composure and broke down into sobs. 'I would look at him in disgust,' she said. 'I would either spit in his face and say ""Either you f***ing leave or I will call the cops because you're not supposed to be here because you know what you did"".' Cardwell, who is now married with a two-year-old daughter, said that she just goes 'day by day' in the aftermath of the abuse she says she suffered at the hands of McDaniel eight years ago. She added that she encourages her nine-year-old sister Alana not to get too close 'because you never know what will happen'. Accused: An image shows Mark McDaniel, 53, who served 10 years in prison for child molestation . Together: An image shows Mama June and McDaniel, top, with his hand on Honey Boo Boo's shoulder . Mama June has denied the claims that she has been seeing McDaniel, 53, despite damning photographs that show them house hunting toegther and him hanging out with Alana. After the images emerged, TLC canceled the show, which has had four seasons. Entertainment Tonight will air the second part of the interview series on Friday, when they will share more of the interview with Anna and speak to her grandmother, Sandra Hale. She was living with Hale at the time she made the allegations against McDaniel in 2003. The little girl claimed he abused her for months in 2002 at the trailer he shared with Mama June - sometimes while Pumpkin, then three, was forced to watch. 'I wanted to kill him,' Hale said of finding out about Anna's accusations. On Friday, RadarOnline reported that after Mama June signed the TV deal in 2012, she begged Anna - who was then pregnant - to return home. All smiles: Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, left, dances in front of her mom June Shannon outside their home on Thursday - seemingly unfazed by the scandal surrounding their family . 'June bribed Anna with money to move in with the family,' a source said. 'She offered her $500 a month because she believed Anna’s unmarried teenage pregnancy would create good story lines.' McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He was released from prison in March. Cardwell married her husband Michael almost six months ago and they have since moved from Georgia to Alabama with Anna's daughter Kaitlyn for Michael's new truck mechanic job. Earlier this week, Michael, 22, paid tribute to his wife in a touching Facebook post. 'I have to say I probably have the strongest wife in the world,' he wrote. 'Even [through] all this BS and betrayal she has [kept] her head high and not let this get her down. Baby I love you so much.'","Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, 20, spoke out about claims that her mother has rekindled her romance with Mark McDaniel, who 'abused Anna as a child'

"Agents from the Transportation Security Administration allegedly ruined a son's plan to fulfill his mother's last wishes by spilling her ashes inside his luggage during an airport luggage screening. Shannon Thomas , from Cleveland, Ohio, had flown from his home to Puerto Rico to spread his late mother's ashes in the Caribbean Sea. But when he opened his suitcase he found the urn carrying the remains had opened and spilled - and he also found a TSA notice saying they had searched the bag. Spilled: The urn, left, had carried the remains of Mr Thomas's mother - until it was allegedly opened and negligently resealed by TSA agents, who left a notice, right, in the suitcase . Anguish: Mr Thomas was devastated to find the ashes, above, spilled all over his suitcase and clothes, despite his strenuous efforts to make sure the urn would survive the trip unscathed . Mr Thomas, who is suing the TSA for negligence, causing emotional stress and the 'outrageous' treatment of human remains, alleges that the agency broke its own rules by opening the urn, then didn't put the lid back on properly. Court documents filed in Cleveland, and seen by the Cleveland Scene magazine, tell how Mr Thomas had bought a sturdy urn especially to withstand the journey. They say he tested it extensively then padded it with clothing to ensure that it would stay safe during the journey. But his preparations were ruined at some point during his two-part journey, which took him from Cleveland Hopkins Airport to San Juan, Puerto Rico, via Washington D.C. Last wishes: Mr Thomas's mother had requested that her ashes be scattered in the Caribbean . Lawyers for Mr Thomas, who is seeking $750,000 from the government and the TSA, accuse agents of acting 'negligently, carelessly and recklessly' when they handled the urn, which made it to spill later in the flight. They also say the TSA never made any effort to apologize to Mr Thomas. They told how he suffered: 'severe and persistent emotional distress and mental anguish when he saw that the urn had been opened and the remains of his mother spilled on his clothing and interior of his suitcase.' Attorney Adeladi Williams writes in the papers that the TSA's actions 'constitute intentional and/or negligent infliction of emotional distress.' He adds that: 'The negligent, careless, and/or reckless acts and omissions of [the TSA] violated [Mr Thomas's] right to inter the remains of his mother and constitute outrageous disturbance of human remains. 'The laws of these United States do not tolerate such outrageous disturbance.' TSA rules state that agents must never open urns with remains inside them, and that if they are suspicious about their contents they should bar them from the flight rather than try to open them themselves. The TSA said it cannot comment on active court cases.","Shannon Thomas, from Cleveland, Ohio, lost his mother in 2012 .

'Well done security guard 'Joe' for holding his own in a professional and peaceful way,' she said. 'Thankyou for the long hours you work 'Joe' and for ensuring a safe environment for us all on the train.

As he continues to explode into a racist rant, other train passengers are heard in the video but 'Joe' stands between passengers and the teenager who goes on a racial outburst . 'Joe' received an out pouring of support from the community . The vile incident has sparked rage within the community, a facebook page called 'Man Hunt To Find Racist Kader Boumzar' has been set up. Before the teen was charged it said, 'If there is anyone who knows where this pr**k lives, his phone number or anything. Post it here. He has to apologize and suffer for his actions. He was very keen to fight the security guard. Lets see how good his fighting skills are.' A woman who made a comment on one of the posts said her husband also worked for rail security, the same company as 'Joe'. 'This poor guard that was involved is a fantastic person that really didn't deserve this s**t to happen. Man this d**kh**d should never step foot on Queensland rail again! All the guards know who he is!' The rail spokesperson said staff were working with police to ensure safety and security was a priority across the network. 'Their right to come to work and be treated respectfully is something we take very seriously and a right everyone deserves.' 'We hope that this sends a message to those who disregard that right.' Queensland Rail wanted to also remind passengers that more than 8200 CCTV cameras are installed across the rail network including railway squad police officers, mobile security, dog patrols and transit officers who are patrolling.

The vile incident has even prompted a response from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who slammed the teenager in the video, labeling his behaviour as 'deplorable'. Mr Abbott said he had been briefed about the incident, which he labelled as 'un-Australian', by Queensland Premier Campbell Newman. 'Just as I think it's un-Australian to defend death cults, I think it's un-Australian to abuse people in a public place just because you don't like the way they look, or you don't like the way they dress, or you make assumptions about what they believe,' Mr Abbott told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday. Mr Campbell who spoke to 'Joe' personally about the incident said he conveyed two things to the guard. 'Firstly, I thought he showed admirable restraint. I think he, from what I could see, responded very professionally in what was a very difficult situation and I have thanked him for his great job as part of the Queensland Rail team,' he said. 'Secondly, I have conveyed to him my absolute disgust at what he was subjected to. I've told him how totally unacceptable it was.' 'And I have said that whether or not he makes a complaint is up to him but I have assured him that on behalf of him and indeed the entire Queensland Rail team that we will be going after the individual or perhaps other individuals responsible for this racist attack.'

"Six people are either dead or missing following Typhoon Phanfone, which whipped up 112 mile-per hour winds and dumped several inches of rain when it came ashore in Tokyo, Japan early Monday morning. A U.S. airman stationed on Okinawa is one of the confirmed dead, after being swept out to sea Sunday afternoon while taking pictures of the large waves on the north side of the island. Three other American servicemen were swept away with him. One survived, while two others are still missing. Their names are being withheld for 24 hours, while the military contacts their families. A 21-year-old surfer is one of the others missing in the Pacific, off the coast of southwest Tokyo, while rescuers are searching the scene of two landslides in Yokohama for two people that went missing there.

The powerful typhoon came ashore in Tokyo around 11am on Monday, and moved northeast before eventually blowing out to sea over the Pacific. About 1.7million people were advised to take refuge in the storm, with 50,000 ordered to evacuate in the central Japanese prefecture of Shizuoka where landslides and floods were most at risk. Another 5,000 were evacuated in Aichi, where a local river threatened to burst its banks.  An estimated 9,000 homes in seven prefectures lost power in the typhoon. The strong winds and heavy rainfall caused travel chaos across the nation as an estimated 600 flights were grounded and dozens of bullet train services cancelled.

"Big business: Spending an average of £5 a bag, party bags now cost parents £808 million . Forget a home-made cake and a few balloons, children's birthdays are now big business, with parents feeling serious pressure to outdo each other with lavish parties and gifts. Across the nation mothers are collectively spending up to £808 million on the traditional party bag gesture. It's no secret that parents feel a level of competitiveness to surpass each other when it comes to who does it best, and this research shows that the party bag is playing a big part in the competition. Mothers spend as much as £5 on each bag and children invite, on average, 21 friends. This equates to a sizeable spend of £105 per party – just to keep their place in the league of best party hosts, as rated by parents in the playground. In fact, so big is the trend to make birthdays an occasion to remember that generous mothers are also spending as much as £355 on gifts, cakes, party entertainment and a family day out. The study, carried out with 2,000 mothers to mark the launch of a new campaign by charity World Bicycle Relief UK, found almost half (43 per cent) of mothers admit they feel social pressure to spend a lot of money on their child's birthday even though it didn't necessarily increase the enjoyment of the occasion for the child. Almost all of the mothers questioned (80 per cent) said they found the grand gestures on birthdays left them feeling regretful. Two thirds (66 per cent) of mothers admitted to unnecessarily exceeding their budget every year. In light of the findings, World Bicycle Relief UK is launching a campaign to encourage mothers to make a change and swap the spend on party bags for a more meaningful gesture. The 'Bag a Bike' campaign is urging parents to forego the contents of the traditional party bag and swap novelty hair clips and loom bands for a charitable donation. To help mothers do this, World Bicycle Relief UK has set up a party tool kit on its website, which includes downloadable cards that mothers can give with a piece of cake that guests can still take home, explaining how their party bag is helping others. World Bicycle Relief UK provides school children, (70 per cent girls) living in poor areas of Africa with robust bicycles that give them access to education, healthcare and better opportunities. With £95, they can buy a bicycle for a child, which will enable them to attend school on a daily basis. Generous mothers are also spending as much as £355 on gifts, cakes, entertainment and a family day out . This specially designed bicycle can withstand the tough terrain that faces them when they make the journey to school - which can be up to three hours long. 1. Notepads . 2. Set of colouring pencils . 3. Jewellery . 4. Sweets . 5. Nail varnish . 6. Toys . 7. Action figurines . 8. Mini puzzle . 9. Stickers . 10. Books . Swapping party bags for a donation is a simple way that a family in the UK can change the life of a schoolchild growing up in some of Africa's poorest regions. Over a quarter (26 per cent) of mothers said their offspring would be happy to help children less fortunate than themselves if they knew more about others' needs. Stephen Cromwell, World Bicycle Relief UK Development Director, said: 'The findings from our report show that there is a fantastic opportunity to use the generous spirit of British families to change the lives of those less fortunate. 'Access to education and healthcare is a given for children in the UK, but in rural parts of Africa it can take children more than three hours of walking, on an unforgiving terrain, just to get to school. 'Supplying durable bicycles mobilises these young children, giving them the chance to build a future. Our campaign is encouraging parents to think differently about the traditional party bag and introduce an alternative gesture, which could completely change the life of a school child in Africa.' UK mothers are increasingly turning to social media for advice. Research released today by Philips Avent has found that over a third (33 per cent) say social media and forums make parenting that little bit easier and 35 per cent of British mothers say they turn to apps over loved ones for guidance. Almost eight in ten (79 per cent) of British mothers find modern technology a life saver when it comes to parenting with 15 per cent admitting that Skype makes parenthood more stress-free as they can keep in touch with family members and friends across the globe. More than six in ten (63 per cent) say Facebook is very useful to them when it comes to getting advice from friends and family. As well as using technology for parental assistance, mums are also using it to keep others up to date on their children. The average UK mum admits to uploading nine pictures of their children per week onto social media. Most say they do this to keep their family and friends updated on their child's progress. However, a quarter admit they upload images just to brag about their child's accomplishments. Brighton residents are the worst offenders with almost half saying they only upload photos of their children to brag followed by those in Nottingham.","Almost half mothers admit they feel social pressure to spend a lot of money .

"The head of the world’s economic watchdog yesterday delivered an extraordinary call for the Bank of England to cut interest rates even further as British households were warned the income squeeze will last for another 18 months. Christine Lagarde, of the International Monetary Fund, gave a strong endorsement of the Government’s deficit cutting plan – but suggested that if growth failed to pick up, temporary cuts in VAT or National Insurance should be considered. Mrs Lagarde said the Bank of England should ‘reassess the efficacy’ of cutting rates below the current record low of 0.5 per cent to reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses and homeowners. George Osborne and IMF chief Lagarde arrive for yesterday's press conference at the Treasury in London . Labour insisted the IMF report showed Britain needed to come up with a ‘plan B’ to kickstart growth and stop the economy sliding further into recession. But Chancellor George Osborne said the study backed his decision to take tough measures in 2010 to start slashing back the deficit inherited by the Coalition. Mrs Lagarde’s intervention raises the prospect of the first zero per cent interest rate since the Bank of England was founded in 1694. Japan cut rates to zero in the 1990s when it suffered a decade-long depression. But because the banks were so focused on reducing bad assets, they were not interested in handing out more loans and the plan did little to speed up growth. Mrs Lagarde also suggested that the Bank considers a fresh round of money printing – so-called ‘quantitative easing’ – to stimulate growth. Support: Mrs Lagarde yesterday a strong endorsement of the Government¿s deficit-cutting plan . Mr Osborne welcomed yesterday;s vote of confidence from the IMF . Both measures would be grim news for savers, who have already been hit hard by low interest rates and earlier rounds of QE, which have helped drive the value of pension annuities to rock bottom levels. The Office for Economic  Co-operation and Development, meanwhile, warned that consumer prices will rise faster than disposable incomes both this year and next, meaning another year-and-a-half in which families can expect to be worse off in real terms. The IMF boss, in London  to deliver her annual assessment of the UK economy, delighted Mr Osborne by backing the Coalition’s deficit reduction measures. She said that when she looked back to the last election in May 2010, she ‘shivered’ to imagine what would have happened to the British economy without the austerity programme. ‘She later told ITV News that the Government had cut the deficit from 11 per cent of national income to 8 per cent now. ‘You have to compare that against other countries which experienced severe deficit numbers, did not take action right away and are now facing very, very stressful financing terms that is putting their situation in jeopardy,’ she said. However, in its annual assessment of the UK’s economic record, the IMF said the Treasury should be ready to consider making temporary tax cuts to kickstart the economy if ‘recovery fails to take off’. One possibility would be a temporary cut in VAT, which was raised to 20 per cent from 17.5 per cent in the Chancellor’s first budget. Such a move would be a political disaster for Mr Osborne, since it is precisely what Labour has been calling for since the economy began to stutter again in the final months of last year. An alternative would be for the Government to offer a temporary cut in National Insurance – raised by Labour before it left office – as a means of boosting business and jobs. The IMF noted that the economy remains ‘flat’ and warned that the weak recovery may be ‘more protracted than previously anticipated’. The Chancellor listens intently as Christine Lagarde said the Bank of England should ¿reassess the efficacy¿ of cutting rates below the current record low . Mrs Lagarde backed a suggestion by David Cameron that the Government should consider using its hard-won credibility on the international money markets, which means Britain is able to borrow at record lows, to do more to underwrite infrastructure and housing projects and loans to small businesses. The IMF also suggested there was scope for the Government to boost growth through higher infrastructure spending, which could be funded by imposing further public sector wage restraint or reforming property taxes. The Chancellor said: ‘The IMF couldn’t be clearer. Britain has to deal with its debts and the Government’s fiscal policy is the appropriate one.’ Pressure: The Bank of England has held interest rates at 0.5% for several years but is being asked to go further . Ed Balls, the Shadow Chancellor, insisted a plan B was required. He added: ‘If we fail to do so, and we see years of slow growth and high unemployment being entrenched.’ The OECD left its 2012 growth forecast unchanged at 0.5 per cent, but suggested another small decline in real incomes would be seen this year and next. Households have already suffered the sharpest fall in living standards since the 1920s. The Prime Minister will today warn EU leaders that Europe will be plunged into recession unless action is taken to prevent Greece falling out of the single currency. At an emergency summit on the eurozone crisis, Mr Cameron is expected to step up pressure on German Chancellor Angela Merkel to allow the European Central Bank to issue ‘eurobonds’ – which would effectively see Germany underwrite the debt of stricken countries such as Greece.","Christine Lagarde has said that the move will be good for UK homeowners and businesses .

"Tennessee state Senator Jim Summerville has been arrested on assault and stalking charges . Tennessee state Senator Jim Summerville is facing stalking and assault charges, a month after being arrested for public intoxication. The Dickson Police Department on Friday night arrested Summerville on a stalking charge filed by a neighbor and released on bail. Police said Summerville was arrested again on Saturday for assault after threatening the same neighbor. He was released on $10,000 bond. Neighbor Cecilia Donaven says she's filed several reports against the senator. 'We always have to have our guard up,' she told WSMV. 'It's no way for anyone to have to live.' 'As intelligent as he is, he has no respect for the law or his neighbors,' she added. Donaven says Summerville often shines flashlights into her dining room. 'Every minute I'm in this house, he's watching me,' Donaven told WSMV. 'Every minute, he wants to see what I'm doing.' In September, Summerville was charged with public intoxication after police said he sat in several residents' yards drinking while uninvited. Summerville denies the charges says he will sue the city of Dickson once his case is resolved in court . As for the latest charges, police didn't provide details. Summerville said in a statement that he's being harassed and plans to sue the Dickson Police Department. 'The City of Dickson Police Department is engaging a systematic campaign of harassment,' he said. '(Stalking! At my age?) Once these charges are resolved in court, I shall be suing the City of Dickson. Settlement negotiations will start at one million dollars.' Summerville resigned from the Republican Caucus in August after a loss in the Aug. 7 election primary. His term ends following the Nov. 4 general election. His behavior and controversial legislation have made headlines on several occasions during his term. Last year, he proposed a measure to eliminate affirmative action initiatives from higher education institutions in Tennessee. After the legislation failed, Summerville threatened GOP lawmakers who voted against it, saying they would face repercussions in this year's election. Summerville also was heavily criticized for an email he sent insulting the Legislature's black caucus. In the email to then-black caucus chairwoman Barbara Cooper, he wrote: 'I don't give a rat's ass what the black caucus thinks.' The email was sent after the caucus issued a news release critical of a hearing, led by Summerville, that looked into allegations of grade tampering at Tennessee State University. Summerville later apologized for the email.","Tennessee state Sen. Jim Summerville was arrested on a stalking charge filed by a neighbor in Dickson .

"A primary school teacher has been accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes - by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it. Philip Meredith restrained the child under a beanbag the size of a double bed at Ty Sign Primary School in Risca, Wales while the youngster shouted ‘get off, get off’, a professional conduct committee hearing was told. A teaching assistant working in Mr Meredith’s classroom at the time of the alleged incident told the hearing how she could see the child – named only as ‘Pupil A’ - ‘kicking’ as he tried to free himself. Philip Meredith (pictured) has been accused of restraining a pupil for five minutes - by covering him with a giant beanbag and sitting on top of it . Ellen Sheldon said ‘There was a fight between Pupil A and another child. Pupil A was put into a restraint by Mr Meredith onto the bean bag. ‘I didn’t see how he got from there to under the bean bag. I could see his feet kicking and he was shouting “Get off, get off”. ‘I would estimate he was under the bean bag for four to five minutes.’ Sobbing throughout her evidence she told the panel: ‘I’ve never had to deal with anything like this on my life and I never want to deal with it again. ‘It’s made me feel ill.’ She reported the incident - which allegedly happened on November 17, 2011 - the following month and Mr Meredith was subsequently suspended. He was later dismissed. Mr Meredith is now appearing before a General Teaching Council for Wales (GTCW) professional conduct committee facing seven charges of professional misconduct. It is alleged that while he was employed at the school he shouted at Pupil A, final year pupil aged 10 or 11, and spoke 'overly loudly' to him, when it was not necessary or appropriate to do so. He denies the claim but admits he has a 'naturally loud voice'. He is also accused of telling Pupil A to sit in the 'thinking chair' when the child’s behaviour did not justify the sanction. In another allegation, he is also accused of holding Pupil A on the floor with his face against the carpet. The primary school teacher is also accused of holding a second child - Pupil B - by the front of his shirt and also holding him on the floor with his face against the carpet. Philip Meredith lodged the child under a beanbag the size of a double bed at Ty Sign Primary School (pictured) in Risca, Wales while the youngster shouted ‘get off, get off’, a professional conduct committee hearing was told . He denies all of the allegations. Head teacher Alison Dacey told the hearing that Mr Meredith was appointed in September 2011 to a role which involved teaching some of the more demanding pupils at the 430-pupil school. Ms Dacey said some of the pupils 'had very challenging behaviour' and she added that 'unruly and violent behaviour' was not uncommon. She said she was very pleased with his appointment during his first few weeks in the post, describing his relationship with the children and the response he could get out of them in the early stages of his employment as 'breathtakingly wonderful'. 'There was huge potential for him,' she told the hearing. 'If he adhered to the support system in the school we wouldn’t be here today.' Numerous measures were taken to address 'a number of concerns' about Mr Meredith’s conduct and behaviour in the school that arose 'from quite early on', Ms Dacey said. These related to his teaching and classroom organisation as well as 'shouting and yelling' at pupils. She also had to speak to him about body proximity and respecting the personal space of the children. 'I was quite concerned from an early stage about the way he spoke to the children,' she said. 'He seemed to shout at them. We have a no shouting policy in the school. 'I spoke to him about it on several occasions and encouraged him to reduce the volume of his voice.' She said Mr Meredith frequently failed to write up restraint forms after incidents and there were many occasions where she was only aware of restraints when the children bragged about them. Ms Dacey recalled how on September 18, 2011, Pupil A had a red mark on his arm which he said happened following a restraint by Meredith. She said: 'It had the appearance of carpet burn and was a couple of days old and it had blistering on it. No restraint form had been completed.' The head teacher added: 'There continued to be a number of concerns about Mr Meredith. Most were relevant to his teaching and classroom organisation.' The hearing, in Cardiff, continues.","Philip Meredith restrained child under beanbag the size of a double bed, hearing told .

"Police are investigating after a series of 'child exorcisms' are said to have taken place at dawn outside a south London leisure centre. People living near the South Norwood Leisure Centre in Croydon have reported a string of incidents in the past month where groups of people surround a toddler chanting, 'Get the demon out!' Witnesses also say the adults shout about 'releasing the spirit' during the 20-minute ceremonies, which take place between 4am and 6am. Scroll down for video . The group of about eight people have allegedly been gathering outside the South Norwood Leisure Centre in Croydon and chanting about 'releasing the spirit' during the 20-minute ceremonies, between 4am and 6am . The 'exorcisms' are said to have taken place at dawn outside the South Norwood Leisure Centre, pictured, in Croydon . It is claimed that the child is told to 'stand still' in the centre of a circle while the group chant and when they are finished, they drive off in their cars, putting the child in a car seat. It is not yet known if the same child is present on each occasion or if they are different children. The ceremonies have taken place several times in the past month, with the latest being held yesterday outside the leisure centre, when police attended. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police confirmed that officers had spoken the group on Thursday after being alerted to the suspected exorcisms by local residents. He said the group were warned about how their actions could impact on the ‘wider community’, but that there were no allegations of criminal behaviour. He said: 'We received a call about this issue earlier in the month, although no allegations of crime have been made. 'Officers have made local enquiries but have not identified any of the individuals involved at this time. 'We are continuing with our enquiries to try and establish the identify of the child allegedly involved to ensure that there is no risk to their welfare.' Local Amy Davies, 34, who lives near the leisure centre, said: 'Whatever is going on it’s a bit weird. A scene from the film the Exorcism of Emily Rose. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that officers had spoken to  the group after being alerted to the suspected exorcisms by local residents in Croydon . 'The child must be confused and it can’t be good for them to be in this situation.' While another, who asked not to be named, said he had contacted the police after witnessing the incident on Wednesday and Thursday this week. He said: 'The child is put in the circle as the adults start chanting about demons and spirits. 'I didn’t get too close as it’s all a bit odd, but I thought I should phone the police and let them know about it just in case this kid was in danger.' Other residents are said to have contacted the police after being woken up by the chanting in the early hours of the morning. One said: 'It’s not quiet chanting, it’s loud enough to wake me up and I'm at least 200 feet away from where they hold these things.' A spokesman for Croydon Council said: 'When we became aware of this issue we quickly referred it to the police. 'We’ve also discussed the situation with local residents to gain as much information as possible. 'If anyone witnesses any further gatherings they should contact the police directly.'","'Exorcisms' are said to have taken place near to a Croydon leisure centre .

Above, his swollen, infected leg is seen just three days before his death . Following the youngster's tragic death, a forensic examination 'determined the cause of death as severe sepsis due to complications of a spider bite', NBC Montana reported. Severe sepsis, which can lead to septic shock, life-threatening inflammation and organ dysfunction, is caused by bacteria or germs. It causes millions of deaths across the world every year . In Keith's case, the condition was caused by the venomous bite of brown recluse spider, the Yellowstone County Coroner told the boy's mother, Mandy, according to KRTV. Keith, a fourth-grade student and one of three siblings, was a talented sportsman who played for Three Forks District School's wrestling and football teams.

"Located 100 metres beneath the surface of a Chinese mountain, this nuclear bunker is a relic of the cold war. In the 1960s Chairman Mao Zedong ordered regional governments across China to build nuclear bunkers in case of a surprise attack from the Soviet Union. Many of the bunkers such as this one in Ruichang in the eastern Chinese Jianxi Province, abandoned for many years, are now being reborn as potential tourist attractions. Scroll down for video . The cold war bunker is built into the side of a mountain in Ruichang in Jianxi Province, eastern China . The interior of the bunker is protected by two large blast doors which lead to an access corridor . Workers tunneled through solid rock to create the complex which was designed to survive a nuclear strike . A large number of these shelters were built across China. The construction project continued from the 1960s and into the 1970s as Chinese leadership were fearful over the intentions of their northern Communist neighbour. Some other bunkers are used in the summer to allow people spend time underground where the air temperature is considerably cooler allowing them to escape from the sweltering conditions. However, China is not the only country where they are trying to develop new uses for abandoned nuclear bunkers. One bunker built near Dundee in Scotland, which was built for £30 million was on sale earlier this year for just £200,000. The bunker is located at a former army camp in Cultybraggan, where Rudolf Hess was held for one night after he flew to the UK to negotiate with British authorities. This area appears to be a very basic latrine with a two troughs offering only the most rudimentary toilet facilities . The bunker in Ruichang consists of just six rooms and an area set aside to act as an armoury as well as a control room . The abandoned structure has begun to look quite dilapidated as it has not been maintained in recent years . At the very centre of the bunker, more than 100 metres below ground, designers built a high security armoury to hold weapons . During the summer months, some locals are known to use the bunker in order to escape sweltering temperatures .

"Toys 'R' Us Australia has been fined more than $10,000 for selling cots that did not meet safety standards. The infringement was issued by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) to the toy retailer. The Nantucket 4-in-1 household cots were sold across Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us stores throughout Australia as well as online between February and November 2013. Toys 'R' Us Australia has been fined more than $10,000 for selling cots that did not meet safety standards . Testing shown to the consumer watchdog confirmed that the cots did not meet the mandatory safety standard, and that there was a risk of 'injury or death to infants from the cots, including from falls, entrapment or suffocation.' The retail chain cooperated with the ACCC, establishing a recall soon after being notified of the problem. The infringement notice was labelled as a disappointment by the ACCC, who said that Toys ""R"" Us failed to identify the problem through their compliance system. 'Mandatory safety standards prescribe certain design, performance and labelling requirements to safeguard Australian consumers from the risk of serious injury or death,' ACCC Deputy Chair Delia Rickard said.

'The ACCC is committed to ensuring that all Australian suppliers, regardless of their size, meet their product safety responsibilities.' Toys ""R"" Us has agreed to provide further notices to customers about the recall, and will offer free collection of affected cots and refunds to customers. The retail chain will also be taking efforts to improve its product safety procedures, introducing a consumer law compliance program as part of the court enforced undertaking. 'It is disappointing that the Toys R Us compliance system failed to identify this problem. Companies must have quality assurance systems that can ensure the integrity of their supply chain and that important product safety standards are complied with,' Ms Rickard said. 'Adopting and maintaining a comprehensive compliance program is a fundamental aspect of any retailer’s ability to comply with safety standards.'

"Business taxes in Britain will undercut the lowest rates in the developed world if the Conservatives win next year’s election, David Cameron pledged yesterday. In one of the most striking commitments of his final conference speech before voters go to the polls, the Prime Minister guaranteed to keep corporation tax at the lowest level in the G20. Chancellor George Osborne has already slashed the main rate of corporation tax to 21 per cent, down from 30 per cent in 2007. Tax cuts: David Cameron yesterday pledged to make the UK's business tax rate lower than any other nation in the G20 if his Conservative party returns to government with a majority after the next general election . Delegates applaud as the Prime Minister delivers his keynote speech to the Conservative party conference . He is due to cut it again next year, to 20 per cent. This would make Britain more competitive than China, which currently has the lowest business taxes in the G20 group of developed nations. Rival economies in Europe – particularly Germany and France – have watched with growing dismay as Britain has sought to compete with low-tax countries. A survey earlier this year revealed that 63 per cent of the 1,344 chief executives polled worldwide put government tax policy high on the agenda when choosing where to locate their business. Economists say Britain’s tax breaks are attracting bigger international firms to do business here, spurring investment and protecting jobs. Mr Cameron said the Government’s long- term economic plan had helped businesses create many more ‘decent jobs’. Jobs: Mr Cameron claimed his government was putting people back to work after the recession . ‘Look how far we’ve come,’ he told the conference. ‘Today there are 1.8million more jobs in our country than there were in 2010. ‘We are creating more jobs here in Britain than in the whole of Europe put together. You know, when Britain is getting back to work, it can only mean one thing – the Conservatives are back in government.’ The Prime Minister said the Tories aimed to ensure the highest employment rate of any major economy so that all those who ‘can work are able to work’. ‘Standing on their own two feet, looking at their children and thinking “I am providing for you”. We can get there – but only if we stick to our plan. ‘Companies are coming from all over the world to invest and create jobs here. That’s not happened by accident. ‘It’s because they see a Government rolling out the red carpet for them, cutting their red tape, cutting their taxes. ‘So here is a commitment: with the next Conservative Government we will always have the most competitive corporate taxes in the G20 . . . lower than Germany, lower than Japan, lower than the United States.’ Chancellor George Osborne listens as Mr Cameron gives his keynote speech to the Conservative party conference - the last time he speaks to such a large gathering of the party faithful before the general election .

The Prime Minister’s wife wept in the audience yesterday as he recalled their nights in hospital with their severely disabled child, who died in 2009 aged six. Mr Cameron, whose eyes also appeared to fill with tears, accused Labour of ‘lies’ for claiming that the Tories are undermining the NHS. A D-Day veteran was given a standing ovation by delegates after the Prime Minister said meeting him was the ‘best moment of my year’. David Cameron met Patrick Churchill, pictured, who stormed the Normandy beaches with the Royal Marine commandos, in Bayeux at this summer’s 70th anniversary of the landings. The 91-year-old, who was invited to the conference with his wife Karin, was visibly moved and said the tribute was ‘wonderful’. The flipside, Mr Cameron said, would be measures to prevent multinational firms diverting profits offshore in order to dodge or minimise corporation tax. The Chancellor will unveil measures to stop companies transferring money between countries in order to pay less. Firms including Google and Starbucks have been accused of adopting the tactic. Mr Cameron said he had a ‘message to those global companies: we have cut your taxes – now you must pay what you owe’. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Keeping corporation tax at the lowest level in the G20 is a powerful and tangible commitment to promoting Britain as a place to do business. ‘However, whilst it’s also right that companies operating here pay their fair share of tax, clamping down on egregious tax avoidance must coincide with a radical simplification of the tax code. Taxes must be simpler, as well as lower.’ John Cridland, head of the Confederation of British Industry, said: ‘We need more investment to create more jobs, so pledging to keep the UK corporate tax rate the most competitive in the G20 will send out a clear positive signal to businesses.’ Terry Scuoler, of manufacturers’ organisation EEF, said: ‘Business will be delighted by the PM’s commitment to maintain low corporate taxes.’","The Chancellor is slated to cut corporation tax to just 20% next year .

"Former Tory MP Mark Reckless has admitted he could lose his seat after defecting to UKIP and calling a by-election . Rebel MP Mark Reckless has admitted that he could lose his seat and become 'a footnote in history' after triggering a by-election by joining UKIP. The ex-Rochester and Strood Tory MP admitted his switch, announced on the eve of the final Tory party conference before the 2015 general election, came with 'enormous personal risk'. But he said he could not keep his election promises to slash immigration and cut Britain's mounting debt pile as a Tory MP. Mr Reckless announced that he was leaving the Tories to join UKIP after being introduced by Nigel Farage at the party's conference in Doncaster on Saturday. He has faced an onslaught of criticism from his former Conservative party colleagues since his defection, with some openly accusing him of lying about his plans to defect. Andrew Mackness, chairman of the Rochester and Strood Conservatives, said Mr Reckless had agreed to join a Tory campaign bus the day before he quit. But in an interview with BBC Radio Kent, Mr Reckless said that had the Tories found out about his plans in advance, he would have been attacked in 'the most vicious, vicious way'. He said: 'You cannot announce these things in advance and what the Conservatives would have liked me to have done is to have told them so that they could have launched a media onslaught on me ... rather than me explaining the positive reason of why I wanted to join Ukip and why I wanted to keep the promises of my constituents.' He added: 'I'm running an enormous personal risk. I may be a footnote in history. I may be wrong. Perhaps the people of Rochester and Strood don't feel as I do. 'Perhaps they don't feel let down. Perhaps they are not worried about the Government breaking its promises. 'It's a big risk. I think I have a fighting chance but I may lose. I will take my case to the electorate here and the people I have worked for and done as much as I possibly could over the last four and a half years. 'I will ask them. They will make the decision.' The defection has caused fury in Downing Street – with the Prime Minister vowing to do everything he could to win back the seat for the Tories. Mr Reckless won the seat for the Tories in 2010 with a 10,000 majority ahead of Labour. But UKIP did not put up a candidate. In an impassioned address to party activists, the Prime Minister said Mr Reckless had lied to his former party 'over and over and over again' about his loyalty. The PM also warned any backbenchers against following Mr Reckless and Mr Carswell. He said: 'I would say one other thing to those people – you have got elected with the help of Conservatives, who stuffed envelopes, who walked streets, who knocked on doors, who worked their guts out to get you to be a member of parliament, you have let those people down. 'We are coming for you in by-elections and we are going to throw everything we can at you.' London Mayor Boris Johnson, who will address a rally at the Tory conference today, issued an appeal to any further would-be Tory defectors, urging them not to break ranks and join Nigel Farage's 'people's army'. The Prime Minister, listening to William Hague's final party conference address in Birmingham yesterday, has vowed to throw everything at Rochester and Strood to hold the seat . Writing in his weekly column in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson said Conservative MPs would be 'utterly nuts' to desert the party for Ukip as they simply risked handing power to Labour at next general election. But former environment secretary Owen Paterson, who was removed in the last Cabinet reshuffle, called on the Prime Minister to reach out 'respectfully' to disaffected Conservatives who might be considering voting for Ukip. He told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: 'We have to be absolutely clear to those small C conservatives out there who may be sitting back at the moment - some might go to protest parties like Ukip. 'We have got to be respectful of them and we have got to make a very clear, intelligent case that the only national organisation that can resolve the long-term problems of the UK is the Conservative Party. 'Ukip is a symptom of this problem. We have to convince these people that we are serious ... however frustrated they must be, they must see that the Conservative Party can deliver.'","Ex-Rochester and Strood MP admits switch came with 'enormous risk'

"A dying nurse who was suffering from terminal cancer staged her own wake called 'rave to the grave' because she wanted to see who would come to her funeral. Grandmother Karil Harrington, of Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, organised the party just weeks before she died so she could say goodbye to her family and friends. More than 400 people turned up to the wake, which Mrs Harrington had been planning since being diagnosed with an inoperable liver tumour and given six months to live.

"The sister of the survivalist suspected of killing a Pennsylvania trooper and wounding another three weeks ago said on Saturday she thought her brother had fled the area, and she urged him to surrender to authorities. Tiffany Frein, the 18-year-old sister of Eric Frein, said she believed an intensive manhunt, involving hundreds of officers, has failed to capture her brother because he was not in the deep woods of the Pocono Mountains where they have been searching. 'I think if he were here they definitely would have found him by now,' she said, while walking her German shepherd on a dirt road by her family's home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania. Scroll down for video . Give up: Tiffany Frein (left) issued a statement to her brother Eric (right) this weekend, telling him to turn himself in to police who have been hunting for him in the Pocono Mountains since last month . If she could talk to her brother, Tiffany Frein told a reporter, she would tell him 'to do us all a favor and turn yourself in.' Troopers carrying assault weapons were out in full force again Saturday not far from the house where Eric Frein had lived until a few weeks before a sniper shot and killed Corporal Bryon Dickson, 38, and critically wounding Trooper Alex Douglass, 31, on September 12. 'This is too much,' the sister said. 'This is just too stressful.' Officers have also reported spotting Frein, 31, in the woods, just out of reach, on several occasions during the manhunt, though not in recent days. This recent photo and released by Pennsylvania State Police on October 3 shows a campsite near Canadensis, Pennsylvania that officials say was used by suspected killer Eric Frein . A massive manhunt has been underway for 31-year-old Frein in the rugged terrain of the Pocono Mountains since September 12 . The self-taught survivalist is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass outside their barracks in Blooming Grove . Earlier this week police said that a search team came across a campsite that contained clothing, food and ammunition believed to have belonged to the suspect, an expert marksman who is now on the FBI's Most Wanted List. With the discovery of the cache, authorities are more convinced than ever that Frein is hiding in a five-square-mile area in the northeastern corner of the state, taking refuge in the state forests and game lands that blanket the region. She said she would ask her brother, who she said was a straight-A student in school, one question: 'Why?' The sister said police told the family that Eric had tried to call their home but it went unanswered, she said, because no one was home at the time. Tiffany Frein, a student at a community college, said Eric was a 'good brother,' and had no idea what could have caused him to do what the police claim he did on September 12. She said her parents are not taking it well. 'It's hard,' she said.

"Money doesn't grow on trees because if it did, universities like the University of Michigan wouldn't have to spend almost half-a-million dollars on transporting an old oak. A 250-year-old burr oak tree, the oldest on Michigan's campus, will cost $400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks. There's a 20 to 30 per cent the tree won't survive during the move but school officials are still willing to take a chance, reports Mlive.com. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Expensive by nature: The costly, months-long process of uprooting a 65-foot-tall, 250-year-old tree will culminate later this month as the University of Michigan has set a move day sometime in the coming weeks . The move: A crew began the $400,000 process of excavating and moving the legacy burr oak tree in July in order to make way for the school's $135 million, donor-funded expansion at the school . Large cargo:  Crews have already placed pipes beneath the 700,000 pound tree's roots and will lift the tree from the center of the ground and then transport it  to a new home . The burr oak tree stands at 65-feet tall and carries with it 250 years of history. The incentive to move the tree came after it stood in the way of expanding the M. Ross School of Business as part of a $135 million donor funded project, reports The Washington Post. Funding was made possible in part by real estate tycoon Stephen M. Ross for whom the business school was named. 291 students and faculty signed a petition to save the oak. 'As I see it, the rationale for preserving the (legacy burr oak) tree is about history, tradition, pride and respect,' petition signer Jenny Cooper told the Ann Arbor News. 'The tree is a symbol of strength and resilience and far predates the university as part of the landscape.' The University of Michigan hired specialists from a company called Environmental Design to oversee the project to increase the chances the tree will survive. Big spender:  The expansion of the M. Ross School of Business as part of a $135 million donor funded project is helped much in part by real estate tycoon Stephen M. Ross (right) for whom the school is named . A piece of cake: Crews are planning to isolate the ground where the tree stands and remove it like the center of a piece of cake onto another plot of land on campus . Moving land plots: The plan is to move it from its place in a courtyard at the north side of the Ross complex, facing the School of Education, to a lawn area off Tappan Street on University of Michigan's campus . History:  A 250-year-old oak tree, the oldest on Michigan's campus, will cost $400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home in a couple of weeks after students and faculty signed a petition to keep the tree alive . Expanding: Tree is being moved in order to make way for the school's $135 million, donor-funded expansion at the school , specifically the M. Ross School of Business . Crews have already placed pipes beneath the 700,000 pound tree's roots and will lift the tree from the center of the ground. Once they've isolated the tree, workers will transport the tree to a rolling platform and they will then place the tree in its final destination on October 25. Despite some critics saying $400,000 is a waste of money to move a tree that may not survive, more people than not are happy the campus appreciates trees and the nature surrounding the school. The University of Michigan released a press release describing announcing the endeavour. 'The transporter has approximately 100 wheels, which all operate independently. This gives us the flexibility to turn the tree as many different directions as needed to safely relocate the tree,' said Paul Cox, vice president of Environmental Design in the release. 'We expect the process of relocating the tree to take all day Saturday, again, weather permitting.' he added. Cox explains that the cost has less to do with the act of moving the tree and more with keeping it alive. 'It’s very much like the Egyptians moved the blocks for the pyramids,' Cox told Fox News. 'The driver of the cost is the amount of weight being moved. When you move things that are 700,000 pounds — which is equivalent to moving 300 average size cars at the same time — that’s what’s driving the cost of it.'","A 250-year-old burr oak tree, the oldest on University of The Michigan's campus, will cost $400,000 to move just 100 feet to a new home .

"Friends using Facebook Messenger could soon send each other money in a very similar way to how they currently exchange photos within private messages. This rumour is based on screenshots taken by a US computer science student who uncovered what he believes is Facebook’s next move to make its stand-alone messaging service more popular. The payment options appear to let users send money in the same way they send files, with the addition of in-app PIN code to boost security. Andrew Aude, a student at Stanford University in California, used an iOS tool called Cycript on an iPhone to explore the ‘forthcoming’ feature, which has yet to be confirmed by Facebook,TechCrunch reported. He said users will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message, but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free, or whether users will have to pay a charge for the convenience. If the feature is confirmed, it may explain why Facebook recently appointed David Marcus – the former President of PayPal – as the new head of Messenger. A Messenger payment service would go head-to-head with PayPal, as well as other peer-to-peer payment systems. It would also make Facebook’s offering stand out from other popular messaging apps such as WhatsApp. More than messages? The student who used the payment system says users of Messenger (logo pictured)  will be able to pay friends at the touch of a button within a message but at this stage it is not known whether the feature will be offered for free, or whether users will have to pay a charge . In July, Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg hinted that a payment service will be added to the social network, saying: ‘over time there will be some overlap between [Messenger] and payments. A payment service would go head-to-head with other peer-to-peer payment systems. A screenshot of the current Messenger is pictured . ‘The payments piece will be a part of what will help drive the overall success and help people share with each other and interact with businesses.’ However, he warned at the time that there was a lot of work for Facebook to do and that the company would ‘take the time to do this,’ possibly over several years. Security researcher Jonathan Zdziarski first came across ‘evidence’ of the rumoured payment system last month, but Mr Aude has gone a step further by turning it on and taking screenshots of the feature. ‘With FB messenger, you attach money just like you attach a photo or a location. You don't even have to link a bank account!’ Mr Aude tweeted. He continued that users can press a button to make a payment, entering the amount of money they want to send. The transaction is not posted to a user’s News Feed and is kept private. Explaining how it works, Mr Aude said the system uses ‘some magical means’ to look up the bank account number of a recipient, before depositing the chosen sum of money. The student said the system only works with debit cards – not credit cards or bank accounts – which is possibly because this type of payment is the cheapest to process. He thinks each transaction would cost Facebook up to $0.50, but in its current form, it looks as if the feature is free to users. A note in the code suggests that while the system is initially being built to make payments from one friend to another, there is an intention to support group payments in time. Mr Aude believes that Facebook will roll out the feature in the US over the next few months, but concedes that it could take much longer. Financial tech expert Gi Fernando shared his vision for the future of banking with MailOnline. In the future, banks could rely on social networks in a way their customers have never seen before. For example, as those without social profiles become a shrinking minority, banks could ask their clients for permission to access them. According to Fernando, cards will soon disappear, to be replaced with mobile phones used to tap against readers to pay for goods and services. But even that technology won’t last long, Fernando continued. Instead, banks will rely on finger scanners and retina readers to process transactions. Fernando also predicts bank branches will move into coffee shops, cafes and supermarkets. And he believes that stripping away card systems in favour of smart tech will mean the end of long queues.","Student from Stanford University, California, hacked into payment system .

"Mark Duggan: An unlikely martyr, given his suspected gang links . Semone Wilson has not yet told her children that their father is dead. ‘How do I explain to them that their daddy is gone?’ she says. Such a task would be traumatic enough for any mother, but especially so for Miss Wilson. Her fiance, Mark Duggan, was travelling in a minicab in North London on Thursday evening when it was stopped by officers from Scotland Yard’s Operation Trident, who specialise in fighting black-on-black gun crime. The officers were armed with Heckler & Koch submachine guns and there was an apparent ‘exchange’ of fire. Moments later Duggan was dead. He and Miss Wilson, both 29, had been together since they were 17. They had two sons aged ten and seven, and a baby daughter. ‘Mark was a good dad,’ says Miss Wilson, a student at Middlesex University. ‘He loved his kids dearly. He idolised them.’ Maybe he was. Perhaps he did. His family and friends claim he was unarmed and have demanded ‘Justice for Mark’. But the man whose violent death triggered the Tottenham riots at the weekend makes an unlikely martyr. On the streets of the Broadwater Farm estate, where Mark Duggan grew up, he was also known by another name: ‘Starrish Mark’. It sounds like an innocent nickname; it was anything but. In fact, the word ‘Starrish’ denoted his membership of a notorious ‘crew’ called The Star Gang who strut the streets of London’s N17. The stock-in-trade of such ‘postcode’ gangs is violence, intimidation and, more often than not, drugs. Duggan himself, according to some residents, was a crack cocaine dealer who routinely carried a gun. It was an argument over a woman and drugs, they say, that resulted in the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton, 23, who was stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at the Boheme nightclub in Bow, east London, in March this year. ‘Duggan was paranoid about what happened to his cousin,’ said one local. ‘He had a gun to protect himself because of what happened to Kelvin.’ So much for Mark Duggan being a ‘well respected member of his community’, as he is described on a memorial website. That respect was underpinned by fear. Inferno: Duggan's death sparked riots throughout Tottenham which proved incredibly destructive . Police: Officers had numerous show-downs with protestors angry at Duggan's death . Violence: These youths are shown using aerosol cans to set fire to shops' shelves . The Star Gang is an offshoot of Tottenham’s ‘Man dem’ gang which has links with Jamaica’s ruthless Yardie gangsters. Back in the late Nineties, ‘Man dem’, whose ‘territory’ included Broadwater Farm (where Duggan grew up, remember), controlled dozens of ‘crack houses’ and its psychopathic members or ‘soldiers’, as they styled themselves, were believed to be behind countless shootings, robberies, kidnappings and gangland killings. The leader was one Mark Lambie, who police suspected was implicated in the murder of PC Keith Blakelock, hacked to death by a mob during the infamous riot on Broadwater Farm in 1985. Lambie was just 14 at the time. He was eventually jailed for 12 years in 2002 for other gang-related crimes (which involved torturing two rivals with a hammer and an electric iron, and pouring boiling water over their genitals). The Star Gang is understood to have been formed after Lambie was locked up. Can there be any doubt that Mark Duggan, the loving father and ‘respected’ member of the community, was involved in this chilling sub-culture? Not really. Burnt: A police car used as a road-block was completely destroyed by a gang of rioters . Aftermath: Shops were destroyed and pavements strewn with rubbish on the morning after the riots . Emergency: Firemen were working all day to bring burning buildings under control . One photo circulating the internet shows Duggan making a ‘gangsta’ gun pose with his  fingers. In others, he is wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the words ‘Star Gang’. How grimly predictable that  there is a . link, through gang membership, between Mark Duggan – focus of the . Tottenham riots of 2011 –  and the murder of PC Blakelock during similar . riots 26 years ago. The eruption of violence in Tottenham is a chilling echo of the infamous Broadwater Farm riots 26 years ago in which PC Keith Blakelock was hacked to death. The disorder on October 6, 1985, was sparked by the death of 49-year-old Cynthia Jarrett after four police officers burst into her home. Mrs Jarrett’s son Floyd was in custody at Tottenham police station after allegedly giving officers a false name over a car tax disc. The ensuing police raid sparked panic in his household on the Broadwater Farm estate and Mrs Jarrett, who had a weak heart, collapsed and died. The next day a small crowd gathered in protest outside the police station –  much like the demonstration over the shooting of Mark Duggan by police. Tensions spilled over into violence when the police station windows were broken and at 3.15pm, two officers were attacked and seriously injured as the gathering mob began to launch bricks and gunfire broke out. By the time riot police arrived to support firemen after a blaze broke out at a newsagent's, the mob had put up barriers and prepared petrol bombs. As police were forced back, PC Blakelock, 40, tripped and fell. He was surrounded and hacked to death by masked rioters wearing balaclavas and wielding sticks, knives and a machete. Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip were convicted of the Blakelock killing in 1987 but cleared on appeal. Outside the North London semi where Duggan’s parents Vincent and Pamela and younger brother Marlon, 27, live, there is further proof of the world Mark Duggan inhabited. One of the messages left among the floral tributes refers to ‘Gang N17 Farm’ (a rival postcode gang). Indeed, Operation Trident officers had Duggan under surveillance amid fears he was planning to avenge the death of his cousin Kelvin Easton. He was about to be arrested when he was fatally injured. Moments earlier, he had phoned his fiancee Semone Wilson. ‘I spoke to him at about 5pm [on Thursday] and he asked me if I would cook dinner and I said “Yes”, she told the Mail. ‘At about 6pm he sent out a  message on his BlackBerry saying “the Feds are following me”, and that’s it, the last time anyone heard from him. ‘By 6.15, he had been gunned down. ‘I kept phoning and phoning to find out where he was. He wasn’t answering. I didn’t know what had happened.’ Later, she received a phone call from his brother. ‘Marlon phoned me and told me what had happened,’ she said. ‘I didn’t believe it. I kept phoning Mark, then everyone was phoning me. Then I thought it must be true because I still hadn’t heard from him.’ Miss Wilson says she and Duggan, who also had a fourth child from another relationship, were planning to get married. She said she did not recognise the picture of Mark as a ‘gangster’. ‘Mark was known to police but he had never been sent down for anything before. He has been on remand.

"A supermarket is offering shoppers 'free erections' after a sign was wrongly translated into Welsh . A supermarket is offering shoppers 'free erections' after a sign was wrongly translated into Welsh. The sign on a cash machine at the Tesco store in Aberystwyth should read 'arian am ddim' which means free money. But the supermarket blundered by saying 'codiad am ddim' which means free erections. The error was seen by Welsh speaking Aberystwyth councillor Ceredig Davies who said: 'There were a few titters in the town so I went down to have a look myself. 'Ten out of ten to Tesco for considering the Welsh language. 'But perhaps they should have had it checked by an actual Welsh speaker before putting the signs on the machines. 'People get their Welsh translations wrong from time to time but this one is hilarious.' Managers at the Tesco Express store in the university town took the sign down and were investigating the mistake. But shoppers believe the supermarket used Google to translate - and got it badly wrong. Garin Fitter, 18, whose girlfriend works at the new store, said: 'I am not sure how they came up with because anyone with a basic understanding of Welsh would know it is the wrong word. 'They must have used Google translate. 'I think it's quite funny but I know some people might be offended they didn't bother to check they had got it right.' The Tesco social media team saw the funny side of the incident, tweeting: 'We’ve taken down the sign and will replace it with the correct translation. We appreciate this is a sensitive area.' In 2010 Swansea Council sent an email to its in-house translations service to have a road sign - 'No entry for heavy goods vehicles. Residential site only' - translated into Welsh. The only problem was that the Welsh translator wasn't in at the time. An automated email response was sent to council officials who believed it was exactly what they needed. But in fact it stated: 'I am not in the office at the moment. Send any work to be translated.' Unaware of the real meaning of the message, authorities had it printed on the road sign under the English. A council spokesman said the sign was removed as soon as it was notified of the blunder.

"Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King has been filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted online by his brother today. The little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the Prague playground by his older brother Naveed, who then sits with him on a rocking toy while carefully supporting his head. The footage, uploaded by Naveed, 20, then shows him playing with a giggling Ashya on a toy digger - much to the little boy's delight. It is apparently the first time that the seriously ill boy has been able to go to the park with his family since he started being treated in the Czech Republic. Five-year-old brain cancer patient Ashya King has been filmed on an outing to the park in a touching family video posted by his brother . The little boy can be seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair in the Prague playground by his older brother Naveed . It comes after he was pictured at a pizza restaurant clutching a favourite toy and looking healthier than he has done for weeks in an image also shared by his older brother. Ashya's parents, Brett and Naghmeh King, sparked an international police hunt when they removed their son from Southampton General Hospital on August 28 without medical consent. They took him to Prague to receive proton beam therapy which was not available for him on the NHS. The video blog footage shows the family taking Ashya outside and to a children's park on a sunny day. When the footage of the family in the park comes to an end, Naveed says to the camera: 'So that's kind of been like the first time in ages that Ashya's been able to go to the park. He then sits with him on a rocking toy. It is the first time in two months the little boy has gone to the park . Naveed can be seen gently supporting his younger brother's head as they rock back and forth . Ashya is clearly enjoying his time at the park - and smiles as he and his older brother sit on the rocking toy . The footage, uploaded by Naveed, 20, then shows him playing with a giggling Ashya on a toy digger - much to the little boy's delight . 'It's been about two months maybe since he's been at the park. That's pretty much since he's had his operation. So, two months for such a young boy is such a long time.' He added: 'He had such a great time. It's amazing.' Naveed described the outing as 'a huge thing'. He said: 'We haven't actually taken him out since we've been here. I really wanted to make sure he had a nice time... I'm really happy that he was happy.' The footage was posted online today but it is not clear when exactly the footage was filmed, although at the beginning of the film Naveed says it is Sunday. Two days ago, Naveed posted a photograph of himself and Ashya on Instagram, saying: 'Ashya found 2 people today in prague wishing him well, people who he had never meet before, but they knew all about him!' While posted online today, it is not clear when exactly the footage was filmed, although at the beginning of the film Naveed says it is Sunday . Five-year-old cancer patient Ashya King  was seen for the first time since undergoing brain tumour treatment - on a family trip to a pizza restaurant with his older brother Naveed . Once it was discovered the Kings had fled with Ashya in August, an international arrest warrant was issued and the parents faced a protracted legal battle to get him to the Proton Therapy Centre (PTC), with a High Court judge only approving the move after they had been released from police custody in Spain. The PTC has said proton therapy is more effective than radiotherapy as it limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs, such as the heart and liver in Ashya's case. This would lead to less severe long-term side-effects including heart and breathing problems. The NHS has since agreed to fund Ashya's treatment. Jana Kulhankova, of the Proton Therapy Centre of Prague, said the boy had been moved into his own private room following his last round of proton beam therapy. Naveed King (right) claims Kids n Cancer have accused his family of being greedy by asking for the £50k raised for his younger brother Ashya's (left) treatment. The charity refused the request because it will be funded by the NHS . Brett and Naghemeh King with their son Ashya, 5, at the Motole University Hospital as he waits to have proton beam therapy at a clinic in Prague . 'Ashya left the intensive care unit on Tuesday and has been put in an individual room,' she said. He has 'started to put on weight, he is smiling, and he is reacting to the gestures of his parents and those close to him,' she added. His father, Brett King, said the family are now considering the next step of his treatment which could see them head to Spain. He said: 'Now Ashya has started his proton beam therapy, we need to be thinking about what comes next. 'He still cannot move on his own and he can't talk properly either so we need to think about physiotherapy and occupational therapy for him. 'We have got a doctor who works in Madrid coming to see us soon so he can assess Ashya and his condition. But he will definitely need ongoing treatment in a hospital so we won't be coming home for a while.' He added that Ashya still needs to be fed through a tube and they are still working out the best way to get him to the hospital in Spain. 'Once we meet the doctor, we will have a better idea of what lies ahead,' he said.","Ashya King, five, is seen smiling as he is gently lifted out of his pushchair .

"An aspiring Playboy model and a private pilot were set to make a staggering $2million from drug smuggling when they were arrested at a California airport, it was today claimed. Krista Boseley, 30, and  Gilles Lapointe, 61, both from Canada, allegedly transported 50,000 Ecstasy pills and around 90lbs of raw MDMA to John Wayne Airport in Orange County on a private jet. They were asked to hand over their bags for inspection after officials found out that a plane believed to have previously been involved in drug trafficking had touched down, federal court documents said. Aspiring model: Krista Boseley (pictured), 30, and Gilles Lapointe, 61, both from Canada, allegedly smuggled 50,000 Ecstasy pills and around 90lbs of raw MDMA into John Wayne Airport in Orange County on a private jet . Apprehended: They were asked to hand over their bags for inspection after officials found out that a plane believed to have previously been involved in drug trafficking had touched down at their airport (pictured) But on doing so, a sniffer dog reportedly discovered the stash of Ecstasy and MDMA hidden in the pair's luggage. MDMA is a powder used in Ecstasy, the club drug known as 'Molly'. Now, Boseley and Lapointe have been arrested by police and are facing federal drug charges, according to the court documents, filed with the U.S. District Court in Santa Ana. Boseley, from Vancouver, British Columbia, is a former real estate agent and aspiring model who had an online modeling profile until this week, when it was taken down, The Vancouver Sun reported. She has previously been photographed during an open call for Playboy. Drug stash: During the search, a sniffer dog 'discovered the stash of Ecstasy and MDMA hidden in the pair's luggage'.

During the drugs bust on October 9, Boseley and Lapointe, who had flown to John Wayne Airport from Las Vegas, were seen taking their luggage out of the plane by plain clothes investigators. They were then spotted going to a rental car desk, where they inquired about hiring a vehicle, before they were searched and apprehended by police. In addition to the drugs, which were later determined to total an estimated $2million, the pair were found to be in possession of a total of $20,000 in cash, it is alleged. They reportedly claimed the money was from winnings at the Bellagio Hotel's casino. Camera-ready: The 30-year-old had an online Model Mayhem profile, which was taken down this week . Lapointe was spoken to separately by investigators, one of whom wrote in the affidavit that he 'immediately saw a large sum of United States currency' after opening the man's backpack. During the investigation, it was revealed that 'Boseley was stopped approximately September 16, 2013, by the Los Angeles Police Department and she was found with over $40,000 in cash.' According to records, Boseley claimed at the time that the money belonged to someone else. Boseley and Lapointe are due in court on October 27.

"Home Secretary Theresa May was challenged by Labour last night after it emerged that a former MI6 spy in a relationship with her senior Tory adviser is tipped to be appointed top Home Office mandarin. The expected promotion of ex-spook Charles Farr, the official most closely linked to ‘Big Brother Britain’, has sparked a heated debate among senior civil servants – and MPs. Unmarried Mr Farr, 53, the most powerful spy figure in Whitehall, is currently Director of the Office for Security and Counter Terrorism in Mrs May’s department. Special adviser: Fiona Cunningham is in a relationship with Charles Farr who is tipped to be appointed top Home Office mandarin . He is frontrunner to succeed former Home Office Permanent Secretary Dame Helen Ghosh. Ambitious Mr Farr is said to have impressed Mrs May with his handling of sensitive security matters. At present he is responsible for the so-called ‘Snooper’s Charter’ laws giving police, security services and the taxman the power to monitor the public’s every internet click. And he is credited with persuading Mrs May to back the controversial drive to curb the radicalisation of young Muslim men. Mr Farr is in a relationship with Mrs May’s glamorous special adviser, Fiona Cunningham, 39. Highly-regarded Ms Cunningham is one of the most powerful figures in the Home Office and advises Mrs May on everything, from detailed policy matters to her choice of clothes. Key role: Home Secretary Theresa May with Ms Cunningham. Ms Cunningham is one of the most powerful figures in the Home Office and advises Mrs May on everything, from detailed policy matters to her choice of clothes . Dame Helen Ghosh left unexpectedly in September and insiders believe the delay over choosing a replacement is linked to Mr Farr’s candidacy. Some officials have questioned whether it is appropriate for a former spy to have such a senior Whitehall position. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the all-party Commons Select Committee on Home Affairs, wrote to Whitehall chiefs last week demanding to know if Mrs May will have a say in deciding who gets Dame Helen’s job. Mr Vaz claims the delay is causing chaos. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There is a leadership vacuum at the top of the Home Office that must be resolved to deal with urgent issues.’ A senior Tory figure with close contacts at MI6 said: ‘I am concerned at the prospect of Mr Farr running the Home Office. He was not popular at MI6 and his secretive manner is not in keeping with the requirements of modern Whitehall. Having a Permanent Secretary who  is in a relationship with a Conservative official who works for Mrs May could put the Home Secretary in a tricky position.’ Threat: Charles Farr said one potential source of biological weapons was UK universities . As a spy, sandy-haired and bespectacled Mr Farr flew round Afghanistan delivering hundreds of thousands of US dollars to Afghan warlords to stop them growing opium. An intelligence source said: ‘Charles was very good at his job, but he was not everyone’s cup of tea. Let’s just say he does not suffer fools gladly.’ He was thwarted in his ambition to be head of MI6 when rival and super-smooth Foreign Office diplomat John Sawers was given the job in 2009. Friends say Mr Farr sees becoming chief mandarin  at the Home Office as ‘the next  best thing’. A friend of divorcee Ms Cunningham said: ‘It is nonsense to suggest there would be any conflict of interest if Charles becomes Permanent Secretary. Fiona works for the Home Secretary, not the Permanent Secretary. There is a clear separation between the two. They have both behaved with total professionalism.’","The expected promotion of Charles Farr has sparked a heated debate .

"Warning: Alex Chisholm, head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said today that customers 'cannot be bothered' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off . Millions of customers are paying £400 or more a year in unnecessary overdraft fees because Britain's biggest banks make it too hard  to compare charges. Alex Chisholm, head of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), said today that customers 'cannot be bothered' to move banks because it is too difficult to work out if they will be better off. It came as the CMA this morning launched a major investigation to challenge the stranglehold of Britain's big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses. The CMA is concerned that customers are being misled by the finance giants, which promote their services as ‘free banking’. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals. The Competition & Markets Authority says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service, reducing choice in the market. There are also calls for a 'nuclear option', which would be to break the big four banks up to allow more competition. Alex Chisholm told the BBC this morning that their complex overdraft charges have left some customers with fees of £400 a year because they can’t find better deals. ‘The market is not working well for public. Many customers are dissatisfied by the banks and they find it difficult to compare the charges', he said. ‘The actual costs that people pay in overdraft charges can be quite considerable. There are 25million people with overdrafts and of those around two million a year are paying £400 a year or more in overdraft charge so that can be a considerable amount to pay. ‘It has got easier to switch accounts, within seven days, but that is just a three or four per cent a year. It must be that people find it difficult to compare and certainly if you want to compare what you would pay if you are overdrawn it is difficult to say. I think people are left scratching their heads and they think I cannot work this out and I cannot be bothered’. The CMA's new investigation will look into why customers are reluctant to switch banks and the difficulties they have in comparing different accounts. Lloyds, RBS, Barclays and HSBC have been accused of offering bad service and poor value deals to customers . The CMA is also interested in why the market shares of the big four have not changed over time. Mr Chisholm added: 'Effective competition in retail banking is critically important for individual bank customers, small and medium-sized businesses, and the wider economy. 'After carefully considering the consultation responses, most of which supported a market investigation, we remain of the view that there should be a full market investigation into the sector.' Commenting the announcement, John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce said: 'This is undoubtedly the right decision as businesses want more competition and greater choice in the banking sector. 'For many years Britain's dysfunctional banking sector has struggled to meet the needs of small to medium size enterprises (SMEs), impeding the growth prospects of some of our most promising young companies. 'The independent Business Banking Insight confirmed that a large number of firms across the country are unhappy with the level of service they receive from their bank. 'This investigation represents a unique opportunity which must be seized, in order to deliver real change in the banking sector.' Concerns have previously been raised that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £20 in return for perks of little value (file picture) He added: 'We call on the government to commit to implementing the findings of the CMA's investigation to restore trust, transparency and relationships between lenders and businesses.' The probe will look at ways to make the banks spell out their charges in a simple format that would allow customers to make comparisons between them. Another option likely to be considered is replacing ‘free banking’ with up-front monthly fees for accounts. This generates about £8billion in revenues from current account customers every year. In the past, bank bosses have said any attempt to disrupt their policies could lead to the blanket introduction of monthly fees on current accounts. Many banks in the US, Canada, parts of Europe and Australia charge monthly fees for their services. Banks in France charge a management fee of €10 (£7.80) for every three months – €40 a year. On top of that, there is typically an annual fee of around €40 for a debit card, or €45 for a credit card that can be used overseas. French banks also charge €1 a month for five text messages giving balance details. A bank might charge €60 to allow a customer to have a long-term authorised overdraft, although the interest rates are capped at relatively low levels. In the US, the Bank of America has a standard fee of $12 (£7.50) a month – $144 a year – for those who do not have a minimum balance of $1,500. There is also a fee of $2.50 for cash withdrawals from machines not owned by the bank. On top of that, overdraft charges can be extremely high, with a fee of up to $35 for every payment that is bounced. Charges of £5 to £20 a month could be applied to accounts to cover a fixed number of cash withdrawals, cheques and bill payments through standing orders. Anyone going beyond this would pay extra fees. The Financial Conduct Authority received 319,505 complaints about current accounts in the first six months of this year, 11 per cent more than in the same period last year. Investigators fear competition has diminished since the financial crash of 2007-8 because brands like the Halifax have been swallowed up by Lloyds, while others have disappeared completely. Efforts to encourage new small lenders to enter the market have had limited success, with only a few – including Metro Bank, Tesco Bank and TSB – making any real impact. There is also damning evidence that the banks continue to fail small businesses by failing to offer loans. If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider. Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money has a regularly updated guide to the best offers carefully chosen by its expert writers at Five of the best Current Accounts. We round up some of the best deals on offer below: . Free money and incentives . Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit. First Direct pays £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months. The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf. If you switch your main current account to one of the Post Office’s Standard, Packaged or Control current accounts the bank will give you a £100 gift card. M&S Bank offers a £125 gift card to new customers signing up to its Current Account. The bank account offers an automatic £500 overdraft with the first £100 interest-free. Interest-paying current accounts . Lloyds Bank is tempting desperate savers with its Club Lloyds current account - offering up to 4 per cent for balances between £4,000 and £5,000. But you will have to pay in at least £1,500. TSB has also recently launched the interest-paying Plus Account, which pays 5 per cent on balances up to £2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £500. Santander's 123 current account pays interest on in-credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between £2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers free travel insurance. It also operates a Refer a Friend scheme, whereby both parties will receive £50 if an existing customers successfully recommends friends or family to the bank. Tesco Bank's Current Account gives customers 3 per cent interest on balances of up to £3,000. Spending on the account's debit card also clocks up Tesco Clubcard points. It pays one Clubcard point for every £4 spent in Tesco stores plus £8 you spend out of Tesco, . By Amy Andrew . It was hoped that a system to help people switch bank within seven working days would boost competition, improve service and reduce fees. However, relatively few people have done so. The CMA said today that it is concerned about continuing barriers of entry and expansion in the sector, which limit the ability of smaller and newer providers to develop their businesses. The investigation will be conducted by a market reference group, drawn from the CMA's panel of independent members. The group will be appointed shortly and will publish a timetable for the investigation. Investigations of this kind can take up to 18 months. Martin Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, was among the consumer campaigners suggesting the inquiry could lead to the introduction of monthly fees. This would be more transparent, he said, but ‘incredibly unpopular’. Richard Lloyd, of the campaign group Which?, said: ‘It is now crunch time for the biggest banks that dominate a market blighted by a lack of trust and poor customer service. ‘We want the CMA to expose the cost to consumers of a lack of competition in the current account market and to pave the way for reform.’ MP Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, said consumers and small businesses had been getting a ‘poor deal for decades because of a lack of effective competition and genuine choice in banking’. The banks rejected the need for an inquiry. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers’ Association, said: ‘There are already substantial changes currently under way across the banking industry to strengthen competition.'","Competition and Markets Authority to probe big banks control over sector .

"The men accused of killing three children and their mother after crashing a stolen SUV onto a Philadelphia sidewalk in July also kidnapped the owner of the vehicle and sexually assaulted her, according to new charges revealed today. A 45-year-old real estate agent testified on Tuesday that the men held a cell phone to her head and told her it was a gun then forced her to drive to an alley. The victim identified 23-year-old Cornelius Crawford and 19-year-old Jonathan Rosa as the attackers who forced her to perform sex acts. Carjackers: Cornelius Crawford (left), 23, and Jonathan Rosa (right), 19, carjacked a 45-year-old woman and forced her to perform sex acts before Crawford killed four behind the wheel of her car, the victim said Tuesday . 'You want to live? Or you want to die?' the woman, 45, says Crawford asked her as he held up 19-year-old co-defendant Jonathan Rosa's cellphone wrapped in a T-shirt. She described how Crawford struck her in the temple in order to make her speed up behind the wheel of her 2005 Toyota 4Runner as he barked directions. 'He just gave me orders, to make turns, or keep the speed,' she said. Eventually, he ordered her to park her car on a quiet street where she was told to perform sexual acts on the two carjackers before Crawford crawled into the driver's seat. 'He was driving crazy,' the woman said, and moments later he drove through a crowd gathered for a church fundraiser, killing a mother and her three children. The youngest of whom, seven-year-old Terrance Moore Jr, was dead before bystanders could reach him. Damage: Police say the stolen SUV blew a tire before the driver lost control, striking and killing four near a church . Too soon: The crash killed 7-year-old Terrence Moore (left) and his 10-year-old brother Thomas Reed(right) along with their sister while they sold fruit to build a playground near their church . Victims: Keisha Williams (right), 34, was put into a medically induced coma before passing away weeks after the crash while her daughter, 15-year-old Keiearra, died the day of . Victims: Witnesses testified to seeing the crash flip Keisha Williams into the air along with Thomas Moore Jr, who died at the scene . In addition to the four dead, the car clipped 65-year-old Thelma Brown, leaving her in a wheelchair with a broken foot and ankle. 'I only moved an inch. I thought I moved faster. All I could see was the guys jumping out of the car, running,' Brown said. 'And then this lady crawled out of the car.' Crawford's lawyer, C.P. Mirarchi III, delicately asked why the woman did not mention the sexual assault in her original statement to police after being hospitalized with bruises and broken bones. Crash: The vehicle collided with trees before the suspects fled and witnesses report seeing a woman crawl out of the SUV . Scene: A woman looks on as investigators examine a heavily damaged SUV before it is towed from the scene of the fatal accident . 'I (thought) they're never going to catch those two guys, and I (didn't) know what happened to the family. I just (kept) it to myself. I (felt) embarrassed,' said the woman, who had a Cantonese translator with her in court. The crash immediately claimed the life of the youngest victim, seven-year-old Terrance Moore Jr, who was selling bananas by the bunch to passing cars in support of Eagles Wings Evangelistic Church. 'The little boy, I knew, was dead already,' said bystander Renae Cureton, 55, who watched him make a sale before he and his mother were struck and flipped into the air. The boy's 10-year-old brother, Thomas Joseph Reed, and 15-year-old sister, Keiearra Williams were also hit and died later on the day of the crash. Their mother, Keisha Williams, 34, was hospitalized in critical condition with multiple fractures, before passing away two weeks after the crash. Williams and her children often set up a stand to sell fruit near that intersection and hoped to use the money to turn a vacant lot into a playground. The little boy's father, Terrance Moore, said he 'was starting to learn how to earn a dollar, by selling fruit,' thanks to the boy's mother. Police say the car likely blew a tire as Crawford went into a high-speed turn, causing him to lose control. The car was later found in the woods about a mile from where it was originally stolen, the wreck mangled after striking a stand of trees. There police recovered the cellphone that had been the decoy gun and which lead to the arrests of the suspects. Blood on a T-shirt left behind matched with Crawford's, prosecutors said at the hearing. Crawford's relatives have insisted 'he's not (a) monster,' and he had been out on parole and working after being incarcerated at 16 for robbery. Rosa had waived his right to a hearing in August, but told the court then 'I want to ask for forgiveness from the family,' according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The second-degree murder charges carry a maximum life sentence.","The 45-year-old victim, a Philadelphia real estate agent, testified that two carjackers made her drive with what she thought was a gun to her head .

"Emergency dispatchers are constantly dealing with annoying accidental calls. But, thanks to a savvy call center operator, a 911 pocket dial on Saturday lead police to a major drug operation bust. The worker stayed on the line for almost half-an-hour listening to people'talking about making and selling methamphetamine', according to a police report obtained by The Smoking Gun. The operator sent police to an address in Deltona, Florida, updating the officers en route from what she was hearing, including a 'bubbling sound as if something was cooking'. Family duo: Donna Knope, 55, her son Jason Knope, 32, were allegedly busted cooking meth in a shed at the back of their home in Deltona, Florida, on Saturday after accidentally calling 911 . Accomplice: Thomas Stallings, 41, was arrested with the mother-son duo. Inside the shed police allege they found drug-making paraphernalia such as coffee filters, a butane torch, batteries, drain opener hypodermic needles and lighter fluid . Arriving at the residence about 12.31am, cops found a shed out back that had white smoke coming from it. Peering through the windows they realized the structure was a clandestine methamphetamine lab. '(The officers)  observed Thomas Stallings and Donna Knope sitting in chairs facing a second male later identified as Jason Knope, who was working on something on the work bench,' the report said. 'There was a green plastic bottle wrapped in plastic wrap, a butane torch, and a zip lock bag with a white powdery residue on the work bench.' The officers said the bottle was smoking. Donna Knope, 55, her son Jason Knope, 32, and Thomas Stallings, 41, were caught off guard when the officers stormed the shed. All three were arrested and charged with manufacture and possession of methamphetamine with intent to sell or deliver. Scene: The shed was located at the back of this home at 3281 Roland Drive, Deltona, on Saturday night . A search of the shed produced'all of the makings of an active meth lab, including coffee filters, a butane torch, batteries, drain opener, plastic tubing, hypodermic needles, lithium strips, lighter fluid, plastic bags and numerous plastic bottles containing a white substance', Smoking Gun noted. Knope - who was denied bail - and her son live in the house at 3281 Roland Drive. Stallings, who lives at a separate address, is on probation in connection with a burglary conviction. The meth lab has since been dismantled.","Accidental 911 call made late Saturday night in Deltona, Florida .

"Guilty: Ian Ousey leaving Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court today after he admitted defrauding the makers of the X Factor of £225,000 . A former executive at the company behind The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent is facing jail after stealing £225,000 to buy a Mediterranean holiday home. Ian Ousey, who was chief financial officer at television production company FremantleMedia, siphoned off funds by submitting false invoices between 2008 and 2012 to make payments on a property in Corsica. Ousey, 51, was caught only when senior colleagues noticed huge shortfalls in the company’s finances and launched an audit. Probes were also made over suspected bogus claims on Ousey’s company credit card, but the matter was dropped when investigators failed to distinguish legitimate claims from potentially fraudulent ones. He has since paid back the full amount he stole, as well as £1million to cover the cost of FremantleMedia’s internal inquiry. He is also believed to have surrendered his full pension to the company. Yesterday, Ousey, who lives in a £1.9million five-bedroom detached home in Ascot, Berkshire, was warned he could be facing a prison sentence after pleading guilty at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court, North London, to fraud by abuse of position involving £224,754. Defence solicitor Samuel Parish said Ousey, who has children in private school, began taking money from the company accounts when he could not afford payments on the holiday home. He told the court: ‘He’s been to Corsica with his wife, he’s decided to buy a property which he had to pay for in instalments. ‘At the last stretch there was some hiccup and he was unable to make the final instalment. The conditions were such that if he was unable to pay he would have lost the whole lot. ‘He submitted a false invoice for a company that did not exist but which had a similar name to a company that did supply to [FremantleMedia]. ‘He’s stated that he couldn’t stop, but he’s paid everything back.’ Home: Ousey, 51, lives in a £1.9million detached six-bedroom house in Ascot, Berkshire (pictured above) FremantleMedia, which co-owns The X Factor and Got Talent franchises with Simon Cowell, also makes other popular TV shows such as Take Me Out and Grand Designs. Mr Parish added: ‘This matter came to light as a result of Mr Ousey making a statement to his employers and he paid back every penny, including investigation costs getting on for £1million. ‘He’s a man with children in paid schools, and his whole way of life has gone completely. ‘He can’t get a job, he’s had to inform his professional body and has been struck off their rolls. ‘And now what he is most worried about is the welfare of his family, because he’s left them in really difficult circumstances.’ Ousey was Chief Financial Officer of FreemantleMedia Group, which makes Simon Cowell's X Factor (pictured) and other major shows like American Idol, Take Me Out and Grand Designs . Suspicious transactions, which also involved the company credit card as well as bogus invoices, were discovered in 2012 by FremantleMedia’s group financial director Mark Riddleston. The company credit card was also used to pay for vehicles, mobile phones and other unauthorised expenses. Ousey, who graduated in economics and statistics from the University of Exeter, spent more than a decade in senior finance roles in the TV industry. He trained at accounting firm PwC in the 1980s before taking a job in Monaco with Grundy Worldwide, the Australian production company behind Neighbours, the long-running daytime soap opera. Offices: Ousey worked at FreemantleMedia Group's HQ (pictured) at 1 Stephen Street in central London . Ousey then went on to work for the European entertainment giant RTL when it bought out Grundy, and then FremantleMedia when the companies merged. After leaving the company last year, he was made redundant from a rival firm in April and then worked as a self-employed consultant. On his online social networking LinkedIn profile, he describes himself as ‘a highly experienced CFO, with a reputation for significant contribution to the business, and delivering the best commercial outcome’. Ousey was released on conditional bail, which included handing the court his passport, and will be sentenced at Blackfriars Crown Court at a date yet to be set.","Ian Ousey was the Chief Financial Officer of TV company FreemantleMedia .

"Detectives in North Carolina have seized the Yahoo! Internet accounts and phone records of a woman found dead in her home three months ago, in a scene made to look like a suicide but which police believe was actually homicide. Sarah Catherine Long, 41, was found dead in the bedroom of her townhouse in Davidson from a single gunshot wound to the head on July 23. Her death was initially deemed self-inflicted, however witness statements placed another person in the house on the night Long died. The gun, a .357 Taurus revolver, was also found in her left hand - even though Long was right-handed - and there was no blood on the hand, despite the bullet entering her head on the left side. Murdered: The shooting death of Sarah Catherine Long, 41, in July was initially suspected a suicide but has since been ruled a homicide. Investigators hope her internet and phone records will lead them to her killer . Scene: Long was found in the upstairs bedroom of her townhouse in Davidson, North Carolina on July 23 . An autopsy determined Long had died three days before she was found from a single gunshot wound . A medical examiner determined Long died on July 19, three days before she was found. Police found Long's body after being called by a man, William Becker, who said he had not been able to get in touch with her, according to The Charlotte Observer. Becker then called police the following the day and set up a meeting with a detective. Becker told the detective he and Long had started dating in April but the relationship was secret because of them were married. Becker told investigators that Long’s marriage was abusive and that her husband had assaulted her several times, according to The Observer. It is not know where Long's husband, Christopher Reeves, was at the time of her death. Becker also said that Long suffered from depression and had been having suicidal thoughts after recently being diagnosed with cervical cancer . However Long's doctor said there was no cancer diagnosis, and friends said she was not the suicidal type. Additionally, Becker told detectives that Long had given him documents 'and told him to give them to her financial adviser, William Morgan, if something happened to her'. The documents listed Becker as Long's next-of-kin and awarded him $939,504.67 in the event of her death. Searching for answers: Long is seen here with her brother, John, who said in a TV interview he suspects foul play in her death . Meanwhile, neighors said they saw Long enter her house through the front door with a 'tall, unidentified man', on the night she died, according to a search warrant obtained by WSOC TV. Another neighbor told police they heard a 'bang sound, like a heavy slam', the same night. Police are now hoping Long's internet records may be able to tell them who was in the house that night. If a device, such as a smart phone, had synced with her wireless inter router, investigators may be able to pinpoint who that person was. Police have also seized text messages and saved, opened, unopened and deleted emails from Yahoo! to paint a picture of what Long was doing in the weeks and days leading up to her death. Becker has not responded to calls for comment.","Sarah Catherine Long, 41, was found dead in the bedroom of her townhouse in Davidson, North Carolina, on July 23 .

"Her tenth holiday in a year: Coleen Rooney in Barbados yesterday . When Wayne and Coleen Rooney bulldozed a 1930s mansion and replaced it with a sprawling £5million neo-Georgian palace, locals accused them of wrecking their affluent corner of Cheshire. Now, however, the boot is on the other foot – after Mrs Rooney complained over plans to build 15 homes near the pair’s 20-acre estate. In a letter to Cheshire East Council, Coleen, 28, warns: ‘Let’s not ruin our village. The development would be in direct conflict with the national policy to protect green belt land. 'The development will mean more car journeys into the village, which is already congested and unsuitable for the increased traffic. It will damage the special landscape, character and appearance of the area.’ The plans would see 15 homes built on Green Belt land owned by Harvey Wood Investments, including five 'affordable' homes, with one of the builds visible from the end of her drive. She also wrote: 'There is No evidence of very special circumstances required to override the harm to the Green Belt – the absence of a 5 year housing land supply in Cheshire East does not constitute very special circumstances.' Mrs Rooney added that she also had concerns over 'highway safety' because of poor visibility along the proposed estate's main access road. Scroll down for video . Coleen Rooney has hit out at plans to build 15 homes on Green Belt land (pictured), just yards from her £12million Cheshire mansion (circled) The plans, submitted to Cheshire East Council, would see five 'affordable' homes built on Green Belt land . The Rooneys bought their eight-bedroom pile in 2013, not far from the home of Wes Brown . Her objections have been backed by nearly 60 neighbours, including former Manchester United defender Wes Brown's wife Leanne and ex-Slade rocker Noddy Holder's wife Suzan. Mrs Holder wrote: 'I can see no 'very special circumstances' that would be the only way to justify the destruction of this green belt area for the purpose of building any number of new houses. Prestbury is an historic village and we need to preserve its character and setting.' However not everyone is on Mrs Rooney's side. One resident of the affluent neighbourhood said: 'It's a bit rich coming from her her. 'When she and Wayne moved here she bought a very attractive house and then knocked it down and replaced it with a monstrosity and put huge gates round it. It looks like they're living in a prison.' Coleen Rooney, pictured on another holiday in Barbados, where she and Wayne own a second home, objected to the plans because she believes the new builds would 'ruin' her village . Planning chiefs will make a decision on the application next month, but Richard Morris, representing Harvey Wood Investments, held little hope of the plans being given the green light. He said: 'I think it's likely that the application will be rejected. There have been 50 or 60 objections to it. 'Mrs Rooney's home is nearby but she cannot quite see our site. 'From what I understand her site is quite large. There was some upset when she had building work done too, but that was a completely different scenario.' Such comments were unlikely to have troubled Coleen yesterday – she was enjoying her tenth holiday of the past year, this time at the couple’s £5 million villa in Barbados where she often takes her sons Kai, four, and one-year-old Klay. Wayne, meanwhile, is still at home while serving a three match suspension from playing for Manchester United. England and Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney is yet to join the debate on the controversial plans .","Coleen Rooney has slammed plans to build 15 homes next to her mansion .

"The woman in the supermarket peered past my basket and into the pushchair where my one-year-old daughter, Matilda, sat contentedly munching on a rice cake. ‘Oh she’s gorgeous,’ she said. ‘Look at those chubby thighs - I could just eat them.’ As she waltzed off down the aisle, I could feel my cheeks stinging red as if she’d slapped me. A perfect stranger had just told me how beautiful and healthy my baby was, but the only word that echoed around my head was...fat! Scroll down for video . One-year-old Matilda with mum Debbi, who worries that her daughter may be overweight and is keen to teach her children the principles of healthy eating . Don’t get me wrong, I know how lucky I am to have a healthy baby. I actually have two. My son Sam is nearly four. However, unlike his butterball sister, he’s a whippet of a boy whom I constantly worry doesn’t weigh enough. When Sam was a baby I struggled to feed him and he spent his first few months scrawny and scrabbling around at the bottom of the weight charts. It caused me so much heartache and distress to have a baby that was noted as ‘failing to thrive’ on his medical notes that I was positively insane with angst. When a woman in the same shop had commented how little Sam was (he was weeks old) I promptly burst into tears. Debbi says: 'When I look at my dear little Matilda, I can see that while she may be tubby, at least she's not obese. And, at just 12 months, she is not properly up and about yet' So you’d think I would have been thrilled when my daughter came along, weighing a bouncing 7lb 4oz. Unlike her brother, she was a really good feeder, and soon had those rosy, chubby baby cheeks — the sort I’d longed for when Sam’s hollow face had smiled back at me as a baby. ‘She’s got a good covering,’ my mum reassured me, as Matilda grew bigger and stronger with every week. I sat back, content that she was going to be OK, and this time motherhood would be a breeze. But, as her little limbs became podgier and chunkier, a dark, fearful thought started to stir inside me: what if my daughter was going to be fat? I didn’t dare confide in anyone. Especially when one of Sam’s nursery workers admired her extra tyres of blubber and exclaimed how she missed the days when her own toddler daughter was as fat as a little Buddha. She’d have been horrified if she’d known what was going on in my head. And when I look at my dear little Matilda, I can see that while she may be tubby, at least she’s not obese. And, at just 12 months, she is not properly up and about yet. I know — well, I’m hoping — that as soon as she starts racing around with her brother, the fat will melt away, leaving her a normal-sized little toddler. It doesn’t take a genius or even a psychiatrist to figure out what is really going on. It’s clear that my fears and obsessions are in fact only about one person — me. While I’m not overweight now, I did struggle as a young girl. I always had solid thighs and felt bigger than everyone else in junior school. Then, as a teenager I didn’t feel comfortable in my ever-growing body. I hid my flabby bits away under baggy tracksuit bottoms and jumpers, and desperately avoided any parties where a dress would be required. I joined Weight Watchers at 14 in an attempt to lose the extra 21lb I was carrying. I was convinced losing weight would be the answer to all my unhappiness and insecurities. And lose weight I did. The number of ‘oversized’ babies, meaning they weigh over 8lb 13oz, has risen by 25 per cent in the past 30 years . With hindsight I can also see that, even at a size 14, I really didn’t look that bad. However, the words: ‘She shouldn’t be wearing that dress with her legs,’ still ring in my ears today, despite the fact they were spoken 20 years ago by one of the ‘cool’ girls on a school camp. I doubt the girl who whispered them even remembers my name, but I hear her voice every time I glance in the mirror, deciding whether to buy an outfit or not. These are the reasons I worry for my daughter. Nearly every woman I know struggles in some way with her body image. Either we’re not thin enough, not curvy enough or our boobs aren’t big or small enough. Now we’ve had babies, our skin is stretch-marked and saggy. When I found out I was expecting a girl I cried for 12 hours. I was petrified of what it would mean for her and tormented myself about whether I would be up to the job. Debbi with husband Matt and Matilda when she was six days old. Debbi says it’s clear that her fears and obsessions are in fact only about one person — herself. My son, I was confident, would take after his dad — secure in his own skin and of his place in the world. A daughter, I feared, would look to me as an example and history would repeat itself. I worried that she would spend days on end staring at her reflection, hating it, despising it, believing it would never be good enough. It was clear from the start she wasn’t a skinny bean like her brother, but I reassured myself that it was better and healthier that way. Debbi worries that her daughter will spend days on end staring at her reflection, hating it, despising it, believing it will never be good enough . When the time came, I weaned her on home-cooked organic food. Barely a jar of prepared baby food passed her lips. It filled me with joy when Matilda gobbled up another homemade fish pie or cauliflower cheese and scraped the bottom of the organic, sugar-free yogurt pot I gave her. She was a pleasure to feed. But when her full face caught the camera at an unflattering angle, causing it to balloon out of proportion, or when my mother teased that she had roly-poly thighs that might not fit the cute little trousers I had just bought her, the cold horrible jolt hit me like lightning — my baby was fat. I blamed myself, naturally. Had I set her on a collision course to obesity by giving her formula milk when she was seven months old? What if she was fat because I let her have a bite of cake or a lick of my ice cream, rejoicing at the look of delight on her face when the sweet coldness touched her lips. Debbi worries that Matilda delights too much in being allowed edible treats . Or maybe it was my fault because, deep down, she was hard-wired to be just like me: weak-willed when food is around and utterly incapable of stopping at just one slice of cake or square of chocolate. So when that kind stranger bent over Matilda’s pushchair and complimented me, all I heard was: ‘Fat baby, just like her mother!’ I’ve confided my fears to my husband Matt who, rightly, shakes his head in despair. He doesn’t look at our daughter and worry about her weight. He cares whether she is happy and healthy, which of course I do, too. Although he is certain of one thing: whatever she grows up to be, she must not inherit my insecurities. We’ve discussed in depth how I must not share my fears about her weight, or the despair I feel at mine. I never mention diets in front of my children — I even spell out the word ‘fat’ as if it is a swear word they must never hear. I know it’s up to me to make a change as well. I’m determined to teach my children how to live healthily, eat well and exercise regularly. They see me exercising and eating fresh fruit and vegetables, so I can be good role model. I have to toughen up and sort my head out, because I am grateful for two healthy children and, as long as they are happy, the size of their clothes means nothing at all. I’ll make certain to rain kisses on my daughter’s bonny cheeks, and enjoy them, because I know one day when she grows up they’ll be gone and I’ll miss those moments more than anything.","Debbi Marco worries that her daughter Matilda may be overweight .

"A tight-knit Native American tribe is grappling for answers after Friday's high school shooting when one of their own shot four of his friends at point-blank range then killed himself. Jaylen Fryberg's rampage, the latest in an increasingly frequent number of mass gun attacks, sent shock waves through the Tulalip Tribe, one of the most economically and politically successful  Indian communities in the US. Just weeks before, he had been joyfully riding bikes with his two brother-like cousins Nate Hatch and Andrew Fryberg - who were both left in a critical condition after the attack. Baffled: Members of the community grieve beside a makeshift memorial at Marysville-Pilchuck High School . Desensitized? People suggested gun crime is now a desensitized subject as shootings are more frequent . Questions: The Tulalip tribe is grappling to ascertain what drove Jaylen Fryberg to shoot his friends in the head . 'For our generation, we couldn't have even fathomed something like this,' said Marysville resident Frank Ripley, standing near a makeshift memorial of flowers and notes near the school. 'For some of these kids, they've now heard about it so many times ... they almost in a way are desensitized to it.' As three teenagers continue to fight for their lives, it appears the attack will have a minimal effect on the nation's stance on gun laws. It comes after a Harvard and FBI report revealed this month that mass shootings are becoming more frequent, with an average of 16.4 active-shooter incidents from 2007 through 2013, more than double the 6.4 average from 2000 to 2006. Citizens are expected to turn out in droves to a vote next week on Washington's proposed adjustments to gun laws - whether or not to widen or limit background checks - in reaction to the shooting. However, with a minuscule fatality count in comparison to previous shootings, analysts predict the knock-on effects will not cross state borders. Jaylen, the shooter, carried a .40 caliber handgun, reportedly owned by his father, which he used to kill himself, police said. Relatives have identified the two male victims as cousins he treated like brothers: Nate Hatch, 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15. No one saw it coming: Jaylen, 15, was an outgoing, popular schoolboy who was proud of his heritage . Victims: His close friends Gia Soriano (left) and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit (right) are fighting for life in hospital . More frequent: Harvard University has found the frequency of mass shootings in the US has doubled since 2011. The chart above is from research by the Harvard School of Public Health, published in Mother Jones . Hatch, in serious condition with a gunshot to the jaw, improved on Sunday, while Andrew Fryberg was in critical condition with a gunshot wound to the head, hospital officials said. Female victims Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, remained in critical condition at a different hospital, officials said. Zoe Galasso, 14, was killed in the attack. The boys were all members of the Tulalip Tribe, which has boosted Snohomish County's economy with businesses and retail parks and even won the Governance of American Indian Nations award from Harvard University. Tribal leaders recalled that Jaylen and Nate seemed like best friends, growing up doors away from each other near Marysville on the reservation that 2,700 Indians call home. They rode four-wheelers along back roads near the Puget Sound just months ago, played video games after school, went to the movies and played basketball and football together, family members said. Struck: The Tulalip tribe, one of the nation's most successful Indian communities, is reeling in shock . Devastating: Tribe members said they have no idea what led Jaylen to unleash his deadly attack and kill himself . The boys were also often together with the victims, attending the ceremonial First Salmon festival in June and, on the Saturday before the shooting, Jaylen and all the victims went to a high school dance together. Jaylen's deadly outburst just days later left the thriving community baffled. 'It's just so devastating,' Deborah Parker, a Tulalip board member and national expert on violence against American Indian women, told the Seattle Times. 'We just don't know how it all adds up.' A Native youth counselor Matt Remle told the paper tribal leaders will consider whether his dual culture had anything to do with the outburst. 'None of us can really say what led him to that,' Remle said. 'But you could say that when you're part of another culture, that's just an added stress on top of what is already a very stressful time in every kid's life.' But he added: 'They're very family-oriented. All of them come from big families that love and support each other. That's what makes a lot of it unreal, I guess.'","Jaylen Fryberg, 15, shot two cousins and three friends at school .

"A 4-year-old boy who witnessed his mother's brutal murder has pointed the finger at the 22-year-old woman's boyfriend, who initially claimed burglars shot her dead. Police were called to the Orlando, Florida home of John Michael DeJesus and his fianceé Yolizmarie DeJesus Borrero  the morning of April 30, where they found the woman bleeding from her right temple. Authorities arrived on the scene at 4:43am and six minutes later, Ms Borrero was pronounced dead laying in her bed on bloodied sheets next to her 4-month-old daughter. DeJesus told police that he was a drug dealer, and that three men broke into the house he rents from his mother to target him. He blamed the burglars for shooting dead the woman he proposed to just three days before. Shot dead: Yolizmarie DeJesus Borrero (left) was shot and killed in her home last April. Police suspect her fiancé John Michael DeJesus (mugshot right) was responsible after her 4-year-old son told family he saw the murder . But the victim's 4-year-old son from a previous relationship, who was sleeping in a bedroom across the hall, appears to have witnessed the murder and inadvertently implicated DeJesus  after  watching the film The Amazing Spider-Man 2. At the end of the film, a main character is killed and the  boy told a family member: 'That's how daddy killed mommy.' Other evidence suggests DeJesus committed the crime as well. A neighbor's surveillance footage shows a man running from the direction of DeJesus's house to a nearby lake, and then running back around the time of the shooting. Investigators later found the murder weapon submerged in that body of water. Other evidence suggest DeJesus committed the crime as well. Surveillance footage shows a man running from DeJesus' house to a nearby lake and back. Police later found the murder weapon submerged there . DeJesus was arrested on May 9 and charged with first-degree murder. He remains locked up in Orange County, Florida jail . And just two months before Borrero's death, DeJesus called her father William DeJesus to complain about her. 'You need to get your daughter from here. I don't want to live anymore with your daughter because one day I'm gonna kill her,' DeJesus allegedly said, according to Borrero's father. Family have described the couple's relationship as tumultuous and volatile. Borrero's sister Yariliz DeJesus Borrero  says DeJesus once punched out all the windows in her car after she told family that he slapped her. 'He was very jealous of Yolizmarie,' Borrero's cousin Luz Minerva Izquierdo Santiago told deputies in Spanish, as reported in the Orlando Sentinel.

"MIchael Owen was returning from LA to Heathrow when his flight was diverted to Manchester . Airport regulations saw former England and Liverpool striker Michael Owen endure his very own travel 'torture' on Tuesday. The footballer-turned-horseracing owner was travelling back to the UK from the US on a British Airways flight after attending the famous Santa Anita Breeders' Cup meeting. Scheduled for a fly-in to London Heathrow Airport from Los Angeles, thick fog meant the flight had to be diverted to Manchester. The irony is, Owen's original plans were to end up in Manchester via transfer from Heathrow. However, once the plan was grounded in the north west, it wasn't quite the stroke of luck that the 34-year-old had hoped for. Owen took to Twitter to inform the world of his 'travel torture' when he wrote: 'Been told I can't get off. Got to wait on plane for over an hour to then fly to Heathrow and miss my flight back up to Manchester. #Torture.' But it was his next, possible tongue-in-cheek tweet that saw him come in for criticism on the social networking site. Owen added: 'Please BA, let me walk off the plane and into my Dads car. I want to pick my kids up from school and don't need to go to Heathrow and back.' Conor Waters replied: 'Go through security like the rest of us,' while Barry Smith added: 'Sure there's many other ppl on the plane with same dilemmas #civilianlife.' Jack Cunningham weighed in with: 'it's a security risk, ex footballer or not ,' while Karcher got personal with his comment of: 'Please BA leave him on the plane forever!' Michael Owen spent three years at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson . Owen (right), Patrick Kluivert (centre) and Fabio Cannavaro  pose with t-shirts at a Global Legends Series media event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Craig Hughes added: 'Rules are rules, Michael,' which warranted a response from Owen when he Tweeted back: 'I know and I abide by them 100%. Doesn't mean I can't be annoyed.' Keeping his 2.99 million followers up to date of how his frustrating day was going, Owen later Tweeted that he had missed picking his children up, but had managed to squeeze on another flight out of Heathrow. A spokesman for British Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'We are very sorry that our customers were inconvenienced by this delay. 'Our flight from Los Angeles to Heathrow diverted to Manchester yesterday morning due to heavy fog at Heathrow. It refuelled in Manchester before resuming its journey to London. 'Leaving the diversion airport as quickly as possible is our priority as it causes the least disruption to our customers. Allowing some customers to disembark and leave the airport would increase the delay to the flight and further inconvenience the majority of customers for whom Heathrow is the final destination.' Owen (left of picture) watches as his horse Brown Panther is unsaddled by jockey Richard Kingscote at the Breeders' Cup in Santa Anita, US . Owen will have been less than pleased after his horse Brown Panther finished 11th of 12 in one of the Breeders' Cup's big races . It rounded off a frustrating few days for Owen. He took his horse Brown Panther over to the US for the world famous Breeders' Cup. Unfortunately, racing in the $3million Turf event he only beat one rival to finish 11th of 12. Owen is no stranger to criticism, having received it by the bucket-load over his style of commentary since joining up with BT Sport as a commentator. And now to add fuel to his critics' fire, his hatred of films, and cringeworthy moaning at 'not being allowed off the plane' will simply go to show off his personality still further. MailOnline reported how Owen's role with BT Sport could be under threat after he chose to watch his horse Brown Panther run in the Breeders’ Cup meeting in the States rather than work on BT Sport’s Newcastle v Liverpool match last Saturday. BT are understood to have been disappointed by Owen’s decision to put his racing interests before his football commitments and have made that very clear to him. So much so that if Owen misses another game in similar circumstances, there could be a parting of the ways. Michael Owen won every domestic trophy on offer, but will be best remembered scoring goals for Liverpool . But it's not all doom and gloom for Owen. Last month he was inducted into the English Hall of Fame for his services to football. Owen, who won every domestic honour available during his time with Manchester United and Liverpool as well as the 2001 Ballon d'Or said at the time: 'I am delighted to be selected to join the Hall of Fame. What a fantastic way to end my playing career. 'My whole family are very proud. It is great to be joining a list that includes so many of my heroes.' The former England striker tweeted from the event to reveal he was sat at a table 'with legends Roger Hunt, Bobby Charlton, Jimmy McIlroy etc.'","Owen was planning on ending up in Manchester via Heathrow transfer .

"As his old side gears up to try and force further misery upon bitter rivals Liverpool, Rene Meulensteen has launched an astonishing attack on Louis van Gaal and his tenure at Manchester United. Speaking to The Telegraph, Meulensteen, who was a coach at Old Trafford during Sir Alex Ferguson's era, blasted Van Gaal's personal skills and implied his fellow Dutchman has been fortunate with how results have panned out for him. 'We are nearly at Christmas now and look at the performances. I still don’t see a flow, a rhythm,' Meulensteen said. 'They win five on the spin but they were absolutely pummelled at Arsenal and should have lost against Southampton. Rene Meulensteen was a coach at Manchester United under the era of Sir Alex Ferguson (left) Louis van Gaal has also faced criticism from Gary Neville and Paul Scholes about his side's style of play . 'He will blow up at some point. That’s part of his make-up. Remember these words. 'If you go and sit with Van Gaal, you’ll come out thinking ‘I’m 12 years old’. He will speak to you as if you have no clue. He will look at you and be thinking ‘what are you asking me? I’m Louis van Gaal’. But while Meulensteen is not the biggest advocate of Van Gaal's techniques, he singled out Ryan Giggs' role as assistant manager as pivotal for United's future. 'I said to Ryan: ‘I’m so glad you’re staying at the club in this role because you’re the one holding on to this life-line to the Ferguson era but I’m telling you it’s going to be the most difficult three years ahead of you,’ Muelensteen said. Criticism from some of Ferguson's most trusted men has started to rain down on Van Gaal recently, despite guiding United into third position in the Premier League. Meulensteen said Ryan Giggs' role as assistant manager to Van Gaal is critical to United's future . Before Muelensteen spoke out,  Gary Neville compared United's defending to a pub team, while Paul Scholes raised fears that the best young talent in Manchester will be drawn to Manchester City after the Premier League champions unveiled a new £200million training complex. Van Gaal shrugged off the comments by saying they are based upon 'no facts', but he will hope that United can silence Meulensteen by compounding Liverpool's woes with  a winning result and a dominant performance at Old Trafford on Sunday.","Former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen blasts Louis van Gaal .
