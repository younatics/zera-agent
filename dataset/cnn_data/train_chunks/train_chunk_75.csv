"(CNN) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton shook hands on the sidelines of Brazil's presidential inauguration this weekend, state media reported. The Venezuelan state-run AVN news agency said the two discussed specific issues in a brief, informal conversation. Both leaders were in Brazil for the inauguration of Dilma Rousseff, the country's first female president. ""We greeted each other. (Clinton), I think, was entering the room. She had a very spontaneous smile and I greeted her with the same effusiveness. ... It was a pleasant moment. We spoke about two or three specific things,"" Chavez told state-run VTV. State media did not specify what issues were discussed. As of early Sunday morning, the U.S. State Department had not released any details about the conversation. Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been particularly strained recently. Last week the State Department announced that the U.S. government had revoked the visa of the Venezuelan ambassador to Washington. That move came in response to Venezuela's decision not to accept the diplomatic credentials of Larry Palmer, the U.S. ambassadorial nominee for the South American country, State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. Earlier, Toner told reporters that diplomatic relations with Venezuela were in the ""national interest."" ""We believe it's in our national interest to have an ambassador in Caracas so that we can candidly express our views and engage with the government of Venezuela. ... There are tensions in the relationship, and it's precisely because of that that we feel that it's important to have appropriate diplomatic relations,"" he said. Venezuela's government has said it considers statements Palmer made about the country ""unacceptable declarations."" In response to a questionnaire by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, Palmer said last year that he had concerns about freedom of expression in Venezuela and that there are ""clear ties"" between the Venezuelan government and Colombian guerrillas. Venezuela ""considers that the content of those statements sets a precedent of meddling and interventionism from someone that has not even arrived in Venezuelan territory yet,"" the Venezuelan government said in a statement last year.","Chavez tells state media that they discussed ""two or three specific things""

"(CNN) -- Normally Germany and France are close partners at the heart of Europe -- but U.S. diplomatic cables suggest a battle royal between the two allies over satellite technology, with the German space and intelligence agencies accusing the French of bad faith and looking to the United States as a future partner to develop next-generation satellites. At the heart of the rivalry is HiRos -- a High Resolution Optical System -- that would potentially be a leap forward in satellite surveillance. A flurry of cables obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten shows German officials lobbying for a ""strategic US/German partnership"" in 2009 to develop the system, amid French attempts to kill it. Some thirty pages of cables show the political maneuvering and enticing technological potential of HiRos, as well as the determination of the German space agency (DLR) to get it deployed by 2013. The cables also shows the DLR's desperation to end Germany's dependence on ""foreign sources of imagery."" German officials were clearly sensitive about the dual intelligence and commercial use of the program. In February 2009, U.S. diplomats were told that ""to minimize possible political backlash from developing HiRos as an intelligence satellite, the program will be managed by a civil agency."" But a later cable -- from September 2009 -- talks about HiRos' ""primary customer"" as the German intelligence service. One cable from February 2009 reveals efforts by German officials to steer development work on HiRos away from a Franco-German consortium toward a German company ""in an effort to minimize French mischief."" Subsequently, a senior official at the German space agency said Germany ""had been pushed into a corner by the French and left little choice but to go it alone within the EU."" The alliance with the United States, explained another official, would help prevent a French monopoly of the lucrative market for electro-optical imagery. But he was concerned by the ""fierce and persistent"" French lobbying to halt HiRos. In lobbying the U.S. embassy in Berlin, German officials said HiRos would enable Germany to be ""a better partner... by bringing more unique value to the table."" A senior German official suggested that three German and three U.S. satellites could be deployed, with the imagery being shared. At the same time, access to U.S. imagery of China, North Korea, Iran and the Haqqani Network (a terrorist group based on the Afghan/Pakistan border) would help fill German collection gaps. U.S. diplomats were enthusiastic about HiRos -- saying the German satellite program ""has yielded sophisticated and reliable satellite systems that provide an extraordinary amount of product for their investment."" They waxed lyrical about HiRos' ""daily revisit capability for any spot on the Earth's surface,"" and its projected ability to provide detailed 3D images. German officials also promised that HiRos would be able to process ""near real-time"" or in ""milliseconds"" data that currently takes several hours to process. HiRos remains in the project phase, despite the intense lobbying by German space agency and intelligence officials -- and optimistic noises in 2009 that they were ready to move beyond the design phase and start ""bending metal."" CNN has reached out to the German space agency for further comment on the status and funding of HiRos. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the French Foreign Ministry would comment on the leaked cables, citing policy not to discuss classified information.","Cables show tensions between France and Germany .

"(CNN) -- The San Francisco 49ers beat the Denver Broncos 24-16 as Wembley Stadium in London played host to an NFL match for the fourth time on Sunday. In a showdown between two struggling sides, the only points from a disappointing first half came from Joe Nedney's 34-yard field goal for San Francisco. However, early in the second half, Denver quarterback Kyle Orton's 71-yard pass to Brandon Lloyd stopped only one-yard short of the end zone. And in the next passage of play, young quarterback Tim Tebow carried the ball over for only his second career touchdown. A 32-yard field goal from Matt Prater put the Broncos 10-3 ahead, but the 49ers quickly rallied. Troy Smith completed a 38-yard pass to Delanie Walker and then completed a one-yard run himself to score the game-tying touchdown. And then Smith threw to Michael Crabtree for a second touchdown pass soon after. And the 49ers made the result safe when Orton's pass was intercepted and Frank Gore crossed for another touchdown. There was a late rally from the Broncos when Orton's one-yard pass found Lloyd in the end zone, but Prater missed the extra point to make it 24-16.","The San Francisco 49ers beat the Denver Broncos 24-16 at Wembley Stadium .

"(CNN) -- A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck the central coastal area of Chile on Sunday, some 70 kilometers (45 miles) northwest of Temuco, the U.S. Geological Survey said. There were no immediate reports of major damage or injury. The quake, which stuck around 5:20 p.m. (3:20 p.m. ET), was felt as far away as Santiago, roughly 595 km (370 miles) north of where the USGS said the quake occurred. The epicenter was more than 10 miles underground, the USGS said. Loreto Henriquez, manager of the Holiday Inn Express in Temuco, felt the quake for about a minute, describing it as loud and strong. She said people ran into the streets, but did not report any major damage. CNN Chile similarly reported no immediate injuries or damage. The temblor cut some telephone and electricity lines, according to Chile's national emergency office, which did not provide any further detail. Roughly 91,000 people felt very strong shaking, according to USGS estimates. Soon after the quake, a 5.0-magnitude aftershock rattled the area around 6:10 p.m. (4:10 p.m. ET), striking some 110 km (70 miles) northwest of Temuco. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said no widespread tsunami threat exists, but did not rule out the possibility of local tsunamis close to the quake's epicenter. In February, an 8.8-magnitude quake hit Chile near the nation's second largest city, Concepcion, killing hundreds. Sunday's quake struck roughly 100 miles south of Concepcion.

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney scored his first goal in open play since March last year to help Manchester United to a 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns on Saturday. The striker scored after just three minutes heading home from a Patrice Evra cross to end his marathon goal drought. Football's heroes and villains of 2010 . But United's lead didn't last long as James Morrison fired a spectacular 25-yard equalizer, volleying past Tomasz Kuszczak into the top left corner after 14 minutes. And West Brom should have gone ahead in the 62nd minute when referee Chris Foy awarded them a penalty when Rio Ferdinand brought down Jerome Thomas. But Peter Odemwingie could only drag his spot kick wide of the Kuszczak's right post. It was a miss that the Baggies were quickly made to pay for as Javier Hernandez (who came on for Dimitar Berbatov after 60 minutes) headed home unopposed from a Wayne Rooney corner with quarter of an hour remaining. Manchester City kept up the pressure on United with a 1-0 win over Blackpool at Eastlands. Adam Johnson's deflected shot found the net after 34 minutes. City were the dominant side throughout but Carlos Tevez squandered a series of chances to put the game to bed, including a missed penalty in the first half. The win puts City level on points with United on 41 points, but United have two games in hand over Roberto Mancini's men. Arsenal enjoyed a comfortable 3-0 win over Birmingham at St Andrews to maintain their title challenge. Robin van Persie opened the scoring after 13 minutes when his free-kick deflected off the Birmingham wall and past a wrong-footed Ben Foster in goal. Samir Nasri doubled the lead in the 58th minute with a neat finish into the left corner and a hapless Roger Johnson scored an own goal eight minutes later. The Birmingham defender saw the ball ricochet off his knee and into his own net after Foster had semi-blocked a fierce close-range effort from Cesc Fabregas. Arsenal remain third, two points behind both Manchester clubs. Defeat for Birmingham means they slip to second from bottom with 19 points from 19 games. Gareth Bale scored his 11th goal of the season as Tottenham Hotspur proved too strong for London rivals Fulham at White Hart Lane. Bale's header from a Rafael van der Vaart free-kick three minutes before half-time proved decisive. The 1-0 win lifts Spurs above Chelsea to fourth in the table with 36 points, but the Blues can regain fourth if they beat Aston Villa on Sunday. Joe Cole's late winner at Anfield gave Roy Hodgson some temporary respite from his troubled tenure at Liverpool as the Reds overcame Bolton Wanderers 2-1. Kevin Davies headed Bolton into a 1-0 lead just before half-time, but back came Liverpool as Fernando Torres netted after receiving an exquisite through ball from Steven Gerrard in the 49th minute. Liverpool then proceeded to dominate the second half but had to wait until the second minute of injury time before Joe Cole -- who replaced David Ngog in the 82nd minute -- tapped in to score -- from what looked like an offside position -- his first Premier League goal since joining from Chelsea in the summer. Liverpool move up to ninth place with 25 points while Bolton slip to seventh. West Ham hauled themselves off the bottom of the table with a 2-0 win over Wolves at Upton Park. Wolves defender Ronald Zubar bundled the ball into his own net in the 51st minute to hand the Hammers the lead, and striker Freddie Sears made sure of the three points for Avram Grant's men 11 minutes from time with a low drive past Hennessey in the Wolves goal. The victory lifts West Ham to 15th in the table with 20 points. Everton's poor season continues as they lost 2-0 away to Stoke City. Kenwyne Jones put Stoke ahead midway through the first half when he headed a Matthew Etherington cross past Tim Howard. Stoke's double their advantage in the 69th minute when Phil Jagielka contrived to score an own goal. Everton remain just three points above the relegation zone on 22 points, while Stoke move up to eighth with 27 points from 20 games. Sunderland moved up to sixth place after a convincing 3-0 win over Blackburn Rovers. Two first half goals from Danny Welbeck (11 minutes) and Darren Bent eight minutes later confirmed the home side's dominance in the first half. Asamoah Gyan made sure with a third goal a minute from the end of the game to give Steve Bruce's men their sixth home win of the season.","Wayne Rooney scores for first time in open play since March 2010 to earn Manchester United 2-1 win .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Three representatives of the Economic Community of West African States and an African Union representative met twice Monday with self-declared Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo in an attempt to persuade him to step down, but there was no indication late in the day that they were near their goal. ""We had a very fruitful meeting between all parties and in a good spirit,"" Sierra Leone President Ernest Bai Koroma told reporters after meeting with Gbagbo for a second time Monday in his residence here. ""But the discussions are still underway."" He said a full statement would be issued Tuesday, though there was no indication that further meetings would be held Tuesday. The presidents of Benin, Sierra Leone and Cape Verde, and the African Union mediator -- Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga -- also met with the man the international community recognizes as the winner, Alassane Ouattara. After the meeting, Ouattara told reporters that Gbagbo must leave immediately. The African leaders then departed Abidjan. They had indicated they were planning to fly to Abuja, Nigeria, to consult with Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan on the matter. An election observer in the Ivory Coast's November 28 election for the Carter Center offered a dour interpretation of Monday's events. ""It doesn't look like he will take an offer from these leaders today, and that's a real problem, it's a tragedy,"" John Stremlau, told CNNI in a telephone interview. ""He is being obstinate right now."" The leaders' apparent failure to make progress leaves the West African community with little recourse but to strengthen the U.N. presence, he said. ""There has got to be a resolution of this, but it should not betray the wishes of the Ivorian people,"" he said. Odinga warned Sunday that Gbagbo must step down or face military intervention by his neighbors. He said the Ivory Coast's people ""have spoken clearly"" in the runoff, which international observers say Gbagbo lost to his challenger, Ouattara. Gbagbo has refused to leave office and had himself sworn in for another term. The standoff has brought the country to the brink of renewed civil war. ""We are engaged in this to ensure there is a peaceful solution -- that we do not have to use military force to sort out matters in Cote d'Ivoire,"" Odinga told reporters, referring to the country by its French name. ECOWAS has threatened to use ""legitimate force"" to remove Gbagbo and called a two-day meeting of its defense chiefs January 17 to plan future steps if he fails to step down by then. Gbagbo has said he wants an an international committee to recount the vote. But the AU, ECOWAS, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States all have recognized Ouattara as president-elect and called on Gbagbo to step down. The impasse has led to a tense standoff in Abidjan, where Ouattara has been holed up since the election with U.N. peacekeeping troops in the Golf Hotel. On Sunday, Gbagbo cabinet minister Charles Ble Goude reversed his call for Ivorians to surround the hotel ""to give a chance for peace and the negotiations that are going on."" Ble Goude made the announcement on the state television network RTI. U.N. officials had warned Gbagbo that the 9,000-strong peacekeeping mission would ""repulse and defeat"" any attack. Meanwhile, 400 to 500 refugees were crossing the border daily into Liberia, putting pressure on Liberia's ability to meet their needs, Ibrahima Coly, the U.N. Human Rights Commissioner representative for Liberia told CNNI from Monrovia. ""The local community and human rights organizations are working hard to see how to improve the basic services like water, like sanitation, health, and also provide them some relief items,"" he said. Asked about the possibility that Liberian mercenaries might be on the ground in the Ivory Coast, Liberian Information Minister Cletus Sieh told CNN, ""It is possible that some of them might want to get involved in mischief."" But, he added, ""We have made it very, very clear, emphatically clear, that we would not support any Liberian going to the Ivory Coast and anybody who is caught in that kind of position will be dealt with under our laws."" In Washington, a senior administration official said an offer for Gbagbo to step down and travel to the United States remained open. The official, who spoke on background because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue, said ""If President Gbagbo is looking for a dignified exit, we remain open to help him with that, but there's no indication that he's prepared to leave at this point."" The country was wracked by civil war from 2002 to 2007, when a settlement left the country divided between north and south. The 2010 elections came with high expectations that they would open a new chapter in the country's history.

"(CNN) -- Champions League holders Inter Milan crashed to a 3-1 defeat at English club Tottenham on Tuesday night as the Italian side were again tormented by young winger Gareth Bale. The 21-year-old, who scored a hat-trick in the London team's 4-3 defeat at the San Siro two weeks ago, again embarrassed the much-vaunted Inter defense to set up second-half goals for strikers Peter Crouch and Roman Pavlyuchenko after Rafael van der Vaart's opener. The result put tournament debutants Tottenham top of Group A on goal difference, having joined Inter on seven points from four matches. Dutch champions Twente boosted their hopes of reaching the second round with a 2-0 win at German club Werder Bremen, moving onto five points. Your chance to ask Benitez your questions ... Tottenham started the game boosted by the presence of key midfielder Van der Vaart, who injured his hamstring in Saturday's 2-0 defeat at Manchester United. The Dutchman again had to go off at halftime, but made a vital contribution in the 18th minute as he timed his run to perfection to collect Luka Modric's clever pass and beat stand-in Inter goalkeeper Luca Castellazzi with a clinical left-foot shot. It should have been 2-0 soon after but Crouch opted to try an ambitious volley from Bale's teasing cross when Van der Vaart was unmarked inside him. Carlo Cudicini started in goal for Tottenham in place of the suspended Heurelho Gomes, sent off early at the San Siro, and the Milan-born keeper kept the score level at halftime with a superb save from Wesley Sneijder's right-foot free-kick. Inter boss Rafael Benitez gave 19-year-old midfielder Nwankwo Obiora his first-team debut in the 52nd minute, but Tottenham went 2-0 up just after the hour when Bale raced down the left past Brazil fullback Maicon and curled a perfect low cross into the path of Crouch. Benitez responded by bringing on teen prodigy Coutinho and May's final hero Diego Milito, but it was the Argentina forward's early-season replacement Samuel Eto'o who continued his hot scoring run to reduce the deficit. The Cameroon striker cut inside fullback Alan Hutton and curled a right-foot effort past Cudicini -- who started his career at Inter's city rivals AC -- to set up a tense finish with 10 minutes to go. But Tottenham sealed victory in the 89th minute when Bale took the ball inside his own half, pushed it past Lucio and sped past the veteran Brazilian World Cup winner with nonchalant ease to set up Crouch's replacement Pavlyuchenko in a near repeat of the second goal. Milito skimmed the top of the bar in injury-time, but Inter fell to a first defeat in the tournament since the second leg of last season's semifinal against Barcelona. ""Gareth was outstanding. No disrespects to the right-back Maicon, but he has given him a torrid time. It was amazing to see,"" Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp told reporters. ""The whole team was brilliant. We outplayed them. We were the better team from start to finish. It was an outstanding performance -- it was a pleasure to be part of it."" Twente took advantage of Werder Bremen captain Torsten Frings' second-half sending-of to score two late goals and pick up a first victory of the campaign. The midfielder was red-carded for hauling back Bryan Ruiz with 16 minutes to play, and the Dutch side capitalized five minutes later as Belgian forward Nacer Chadli fired in a shot that deflected off Per Mertesacke. Chadli then set Ruiz free in the 84th minute and the Costa Rica international's cross was headed home by Luuk de Jong to boost Twente ahead of the trip to Inter on November 24. Barcelona stayed top of Group D despite being held 1-1 away to Copenhagen, with both goals coming in the space of a minute. Star forward Lionel Messi put the Spanish champions ahead just after half an hour in Denmark with a rare right-footed effort as he pounced on the loose ball to poke the ball in off the post. But Copenhagen hit back immediately as Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes, in for the suspended Jose Pinto, could not deal with Jesper Gronkjaer's cross and Brazilian midfielder Claudemir volleyed in the equalizer. Pedro hit the post with a scorching late effort for Barcelona, who stayed a point ahead of Copenhagen. Russian champions Rubin Kazan lost ground on the top two teams after being held to a second successive 0-0 draw by bottom club Panathinaikos, this time despite having home advantage. Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win away to Bursaspor despite fielding several fringe players against the Turkish champions. The 2008 winners are now in pole position to qualify from Group C, needing just a point from the upcoming trip to Rangers to ensure a place in the second round. Scotland midfielder Darren Fletcher opened the scoring three minutes after halftime with a measured right-foot effort, then 21-year-old French forward Gabriel Obertan smashed in his first goal for United as the defense retreated in the 73rd minute. Four minutes later, veteran midfielder Paul Scholes set up Champions League debutant Bebe for the 20-year-old's second goal for the English club. Valencia moved above Rangers into second place, three points behind United, with a 3-0 home victory over the Scottish champions. Spain striker Roberto Soldado scored in either half, forcing home from a corner in the 31st minute and firing a low shot underneath goalkeeper Alan McGregor with 19 minutes left. Tino Costa sealed victory right at the end with a fine lunging left-foot volley that went in off the post, as Rangers were left to rue two efforts from striker Steven Naismith that came back off the woodwork. Lyon remain top of Group B despite suffering a 4-3 defeat away to Benfica, with the Portuguese club taking a four-goal lead after 67 minutes. Fabio Coentrao scored twice while Alan Kardec and Javi Garcia also netted before the French side rallied with goals in the final 15 minutes from Yoann Gourcuff, Bafetimbi Gomis and Dejan Lovren. The result left previously unbeaten Lyon with nine points, while Benfica picked up their second win to close to within a point of second-placed Schalke. The German club can still reach the second round despite drawing 0-0 away to bottom side Hapoel Tel Aviv, who now cannot qualify. However, the result did little to help the position of Schalke coach Felix Magath, who is under increasing pressure after a poor start to the Bundesliga season.","Tottenham move top of Group A with 3-1 win over defending champions Inter Milan .

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- The tug-of-war between the two men who claim the presidency of the Ivory Coast intensified Wednesday. Soro Guillaume, who was picked by Alassane Ouattara to be prime minister in his government, said on Wednesday that the international community should use force to remove incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo from power. The country's Independent Electoral Commission said Ouattara won a November 28 runoff election, but its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared Gbagbo the winner. The United Nations, the African Union and other international and regional bodies recognize Ouattara as the victor, but Gbagbo has declined to step down. A United Nations credentialing commission added pressure by approving on Wednesday a diplomatic maneuver that would further isolate the government of Gbagbo. The commission agreed to back a new ambassador to the body appointed by Ouattara. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley on Wednesday said that the United States and other countries were discussing with African nations the possibility of augmenting the existing U.N. force in the Ivory Coast. However, he said it was unclear what a U.S. contribution could look like, whether it be forces of logistical support or something more indirect. Right now, these are just ideas, Crowley said. The World Bank on Wednesday said it has halted lending and disbursing funds to the Ivory Coast and that the agency's office in the West African country has been closed. The agency said it and the African Development Bank have backed the AU and the Economic Community of West African States ""in sending the message to Gbagbo that he lost the elections and he needs to step down."" ""A peaceful and rapid resolution is critical"" for Ivorians and the region, the bank said. Meanwhile, France has become the latest Western country to warn its citizens of danger in the Ivory Coast. French citizens in the West African nation should leave if possible, a government spokesman, Francois Baroin, said Wednesday. The United States and United Kingdom also have warned their citizens of possible violence in the Ivory Coast, where up to 50 people are said to have been killed amid a political stalemate after a disputed presidential election. The U.S. State Department ordered nonemergency personnel and family members this week to leave the country. It also warned U.S. citizens against traveling to the Ivory Coast, a former French colony of about 19 million people. The UK Foreign Office also had advised British citizens to avoid travel to the Ivory Coast and, for those already there, to leave the country unless they ""have a pressing reason to remain."" On Tuesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned that the country risks a return to civil war . ""In the past week, there has been an alarming increase in the use of intimidation by elements of the national security forces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo against the civilian population, and in particular against supporters of President-elect Ouattara,"" he said. ""The tactics include abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation,"" he continued. ""There is a real risk of a return to civil war."" Gbagbo struck a defiant tone in a Tuesday speech, declaring, ""I am the president."" He stressed he is the legitimate winner of the election, but said he would be willing to welcome an international committee to review the results to avoid any further violence. ""I don't want any more bloodshed. I don't want any more war,"" he said. U.N. peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy referred to Gbagbo's remarks when he spoke to reporters in New York. ""Mr. Gbagbo has been very clear. He wants no violence, no more blood,"" Le Roy said. ""So all the forces loyal to him should stop immediately provocation, instigating violence, violation of human rights and provoking"" U.N. peacekeepers in the country. Le Roy said Gbagbo's allies have been handing out rifles to members of a ""Young Patriots"" group, and mercenaries from Liberia and Angola have been hired ""to provoke"" civilians and U.N. peacekeepers. Amnesty International, citing eyewitnesses, has said that it has heard an increasing number of stories of people arrested or otherwise taken by gunmen, often with the cooperation of security forces. ""It is clear that more and more people are being illegally detained by security forces or armed militiamen, and we fear that many of them may have been killed or have disappeared,"" Salvatore Sagues, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, said in a written statement. The U.N. Security Council has extended its peacekeepers' mission in Ivory Coast through June 30, despite an expulsion order by Gbagbo. The Gbagbo government accuses the United Nations of providing military and logistical support to former rebels who are backers of Ouattara -- a charge Ban denied.

Highly intense, with a bulbous nose, high cheekbones and ruddy complexion, the actor was immediately recognizable in films ranging from the second ""Jurassic Park"" movie to ""Romeo + Juliet."" It was for his role as Daniel Day-Lewis's father in the IRA drama ""In the Name of the Father"" that he got his only Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor.

"BEIJING, China (Reuters) -- Just days after China marked the one-year countdown to the Olympics with fireworks, pomp and ceremony, the Chinese co-designer of the Games' most iconic stadium has slammed the event as a public-relations sham. Ai Weiwei: ""Can a nation be celebrated and be so proud with this ignoring of its past?"" Ai Weiwei, one of China's foremost architects, said he feels ""disgusted"" that the $400 million, ""Bird's Nest"" National Stadium he helped design with Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron has become a proud symbol of China's development. ""I've already forgotten about it. I turn down all the demands to have photographs with it. I'm not interested,"" the portly artist told Reuters at a studio in Beijing's northeast suburbs. ""I would feel ashamed if I just designed something for glamour or to show some kind of fake image."" Last Wednesday, Chinese and Olympic officials hosted a 10,000-strong celebration gala with fireworks, dancers and pop stars on Tiananmen Square, scene of a bloody army crackdown on student-led pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989. Ai's criticism stands in marked contrast to the upsurge in national pride the Olympics has generated, though it does join a chorus of deliberately timed criticism from mainly foreign rights groups. The designer, who once smashed a 2,000-year-old Han dynasty vase for art, speaks candidly -- and from personal experience. Ai was raised in a labor camp in China's remote northwestern region of Xinjiang, after his father, Ai Qing -- himself regarded as one of China's finest modern poets -- was purged in the 1950s after being denounced as ""an enemy of the state and a rightist."" ""I spent five years with him at a labor camp where he cleaned toilets, but these stories become so catchy today,"" Ai shrugged. ""I have my own problems."" He likened China's embrace of the Olympics as a ""pretend smile."" ""Can a nation be celebrated and be so proud with this ignoring of its past?"" Ai asked, sitting on a bench next to one of his works, a distended wooden slab called ""Crooked Coffin."" ""Can you have the self-confidence to clearly examine yourself, rather than to give this kind of pretend smile on your face... It's this kind of fake smile which is disgusting ... So I hate this.""

"Wilmington, Delaware (CNN) -- A parking lot attendant in Wilmington described a strange encounter with a former Pentagon official, just two days before his body was discovered in a Delaware landfill. Iman Goldsborough told CNN on Wednesday that a man she later recognized as John P. Wheeler wandered into the parking garage where she works on December 29 around 6:40 p.m., disheveled and carrying a shoe in one hand. ""'I'm not drunk, I'm not drunk,'"" Goldsborough quoted Wheeler as saying. The man, who wasn't wearing a coat despite temperatures in the 30s, couldn't remember where he had parked his car, and said his briefcase had been stolen, she recounted. Goldsborough said she doesn't think his car was parked in that garage, because she had never seen him before and she knows most of her customers. Two days later, police say, Wheeler's body was found in Wilmington's Cherry Island Landfill. Goldsborough said when she saw the news reports about his death, she recognized him as the man she had spoken with that night. A man whom police identified as Wheeler was recorded by security cameras in an office building in downtown Wilmington as late as 8:30 p.m. December 30, the day before his body was discovered, according to a police statement Wednesday. He appeared confused, the statement said. The man had been approached earlier that day by several people who police say had offered him assistance, which the man declined, according to the statement. An area newspaper, The News Journal, reported in its online edition that Wheeler walked into a pharmacy in New Castle, asking for a ride to Wilmington at 6 p.m. December 29. Pharmacist Murali Gouro, who had filled prescriptions for Wheeler in the past, said he offered to call a taxi, which the former Pentagon official declined, the website reported. Gouro told CNN the report was accurate but would not confirm the details of his alleged encounter. Authorities want to hear from anyone who might have seen Wheeler on Thursday, and they're actively searching for the crime scene. ""If we can find the location where this happened -- that will lead us hopefully to the killer,"" said Newark Police Lt. Mark Farrall. He said police are also working with Amtrak officials in an effort to determine whether Wheeler had been on a train from Washington to Wilmington that he had been scheduled to take near the time of the death. Wheeler, 66, of New Castle, was a West Point graduate, an advocate for Vietnam veterans and the first chairman of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. He had served in the past three Republican administrations. Farrall said Wheeler's body was seen jutting out of a garbage truck Friday at the landfill by a spotter whose job it is to ensure that hazardous material is not dumped there. Police believe Wheeler's body was most likely picked up by the truck at one of the first of 10 specially designated trash bin pickup spots before heading to the landfill. Police have asked a car dealership and a Goodwill store listed as ""locations of interest"" for any surveillance videos in which their garbage bins are visible, according to those businesses. ""We are cooperating fully with the Newark Police Department regarding our surveillance tapes of our Dumpster,"" said Mike Childers, a manager at Newark Toyota. ""Beyond that, I cannot go any further."" Wheeler's vehicle has turned up in a different parking garage near Wilmington's Amtrak station, Farrall said. Police in the city of Newark, about 12 miles south of Wilmington, are the lead investigators in the case, but detectives are consulting with the FBI, Farrall said Tuesday. Wheeler worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. He served as a special assistant to the secretary of the Air Force from 2005 to 2008. While in the Army, he served as a staff officer in Vietnam and later as head of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. Wheeler also worked as a part-time consultant for the MITRE Corporation, a not-for-profit organization that provides systems engineering, research and development and information technology support to the federal government. He had been been working on promoting discussions about cyberdefense between governments, industry and academia, according to a company statement. ""At this time our thoughts are with his family,"" said spokesman Jennifer Shearman in the statement. As authorities dig into Wheeler's background, Farrall said, an apparent dispute between Wheeler and a neighbor is being looked at as ""one facet of the investigation."" Wheeler's attorney, Bayard Marin, told CNN that his client had been involved in a lengthy legal fight with a couple building a new home across the street in a historic district of New Castle, about six miles south of Wilmington. Wheeler had adamantly opposed the new construction. The dispute may have become contentious, but ""I can't recall a confrontation,"" Marin said. ""Everything seemed to be kept within normal bounds."" Wheeler's family has said they won't comment on his death and asked for privacy. But veterans' advocates offered statements of praise for the former official. ""It is only fitting that we pause now and remember Jack Wheeler, who served his country honorably, then dedicated himself to ensuring that our nation's service members are always given the respect they deserve,"" said Jan Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. What Wheeler ""cared about was civic values and civic virtue,"" wrote James Fallows, national correspondent for The Atlantic magazine and a longtime friend. ""He was a complicated man of very intense (and sometimes changeable) friendships, passions, and causes. ... I feel terrible for his family and hope they will eventually find comfort in knowing how many important things he achieved."" CNN's Sarah Hoye, Susan Candiotti, Deborah Feyerick, Sheila Steffen and Allan Chernoff contributed to this report.","Police work with Amtrak to determine if John P.

"HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- In the decade since the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, local movie-makers have faced daunting changes in the industry. A trend of fewer films being produced each year in Hong Kong at the time of the handover has continued into the 21st century. Stephen Chow's ""Shaolin Soccer"" is one of Hong Kong's all-time top-grossing films. People in Hong Kong's industry point to several causes for the comparatively leaner times: a lack of opportunities for new acting talent, inadequate training and schooling for people who produce movies and changing tastes within the Hong Kong public. At the same time, local film-makers have had to refocus their cameras for a new audience: mainland China. ""The Hong Kong film industry came to a rude awakening [in the late 1990s] that the world was changing faster than it was in the age of new delivery systems for home entertainment and the Internet,"" says Bede Cheng, a local film archivist and curator. ""Unfortunately, it seemed to be blinded by the 'golden age' of the '80s, where any film could easily rack in over $1.3 million."" The box office numbers are sobering. In the early 1990s, Hong Kong released around 200 local features a year. By 1997, that number dropped to 85 films grossing $69 million, according to the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Motion Picture Industry Association (MPIA). By 2006, those figures slumped to 51 films grossing $37 million. Ten years ago, the top 10 grossing films accounted for 47 percent of the total box-office return; today, the portion is 58 percent. ""1997, unfortunately, coincides with the beginning of the collapse of the local film industry -- a well-documented fact,"" says screenwriter Jimmy Ngai. ""On the other hand, it also commenced the opening up of the mainland market. ""The result is that the industry has grown more and more accustomed to looking north for both investment and box return -- nothing political, but more of a survival instinct. What needs not to be spelt out for film-makers venturing north is that one plays according to what goes with the territory."" The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng. ""Today production is down, with many majors like Chinastar and Golden Harvest scaling back,"" he says. ""Most films are high-end productions with big stars, or low-end made with a shoestring budget for an easier return. ""The number of screens is also down, with the consolidation of more multiplexes, usually owned or partly owned by distributors, which already have a steady supply of foreign films to fill the screens. Some once video distributors like Mei Ah and Universe have gone into production as a way to keep the pipeline flowing."" In 2006, Hong Kong closed five small cinemas and re-opened one multiplex. Gary Mak, director of Broadway Cinematheque -- Hong Kong's last-remaining alternative-screening venue -- remains optimistic about more adventurous programming and distribution. But Mak points to a shortage of creativity in the local industry. ""No talents, no formal training, in most areas such as script-writing, directing, acting, etc,"" he says. ""Even the independent scene still needs more real talents -- or at least, real producers to pull together a really good project."" Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry. ""Audiences have become increasingly dismissive of local movies, often referring to them as poor quality, and there are much fewer paying cinemagoers these days. ""So the hometown audience shows less support for local movies, whether by not seeing local films or opting for piracy, while the declining number of films means less opportunities for film-makers, fewer chances to try out new things, and damage to confidence."" Elizabeth Kerr, film critic and curator formerly based in Seoul, South Korea, agrees with Youngs' assessment. ""For all the risk-taking businessmen out there [in Hong Kong], no one is willing to put their money where their mouth is and throw in some support. ""The industry for the most part suffers from the cleave between that fluff -- which makes money -- and the more adult film-making of the smaller studios, distributors and indies."" How is South Korea's film industry different from its Hong Kong counterpart? ""The drive to attain world adoration,"" Kerr says. ""Koreans truly believe they're making great art all the time. South Korea launched an active campaign on all levels -- corporate, government, education -- to train and cultivate a modern film industry."" Still, Kerr sees reason for optimism. Films that best retain a Hong Kong style, Kerr maintains, likely carry ""Category III"" (under 18 not allowed) ratings: Movies that are ""grown up and smart,"" she says. ""Even if the films don't work, someone tried."" In the end, it may be culture that poses one of the greatest challenges for Hong Kong's movie industry. ""Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself,"" says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu. ""The film industry was already almost dead in the '90s. Why work for a sunset industry?"" Chan's own first feature in 2005, ""A Side, B Side, Sea Side,"" includes a scene with a gaggle of girls on Hong Kong's Cheung Chau island who are unable to communicate in Chinese with an Australian man speaking fluent Mandarin. The two parties end up conversing in English. ""That's me,"" says Chan, referring to the girls. ""I speak English better than Putonghua [China's official common language, also known as Mandarin]. Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China, Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua. I disagree. In Hong Kong we all speak Cantonese. Hong Kong already has a bad reputation for Putonghua, but I don't feel ashamed. I'm proud to have grown up during the transition between 1997 and SAR. ""Why do we have so many problems with China? Because our language, our culture, our values, our way of thinking are different. So we are not good at speaking Putonghua. Even in the cinema, we see Western movies, Japanese movies, Korean movies... but not many Chinese movies."" Adds independent director Yan-yan Mak: ""We are monsters. China says: 'You are not Chinese.' Gweilos [Hong Kong slang for Caucasians] say: 'You are Chinese.' After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people.""

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Chandler, Arizona, said they believe the gunman who held hostages at a restaurant is the same man who fled into a mall after opening fire on members of a crime task force. The man who surrendered at the Baja Fresh restaurant is not the federal fugitive that U.S. marshals thought they might have spotted earlier outside the Chandler Fashion Center, said Chandler Police Sgt. Joe Favazzo. After a thorough police sweep, the mall reopened later Wednesday, Chandler Detective David Ramer told CNN. ""We believe there is only one suspect here,"" Favazzo said. A woman who fled the restaurant, which is near the mall, told CNN she witnessed the man being taken into custody. Police identified the suspect as Adam Hernandez. Baja Fresh customer Leyda Schultz told CNN that a gunman held at least two employees after ordering customers to leave. Schultz said she witnessed the man being taken into custody shortly before 2 p.m. Favazzo said it was not clear whether the two were patrons or employees. The gunman apparently fired warning shots at the restaurant. Marshals and other members of a task force had confronted a suspect outside the Sears store on the west side of Chandler Fashion Center, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Robert Bailey. The suspect opened fire, and officers returned it, Bailey said. The suspect was being sought in an armed robbery, Chandler police said. The suspect entered the Sears, and the mall was evacuated and surrounded, Bailey said. A hostage situation was reported about 12:30 p.m. at the nearby Baja Fresh, he said. Favazzo said officers lost sight of the suspect in the mall. Marshals earlier Wednesday said the suspect seen at the mall may be fugitive Daniel Munoz Perez, who was mistakenly released last month. Marshals were trailing a vehicle known to be driven in the past by Perez, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. Perez is being sought for aggravated assault for allegedly shooting at a police officer in December, authorities said. According to U.S. Marshal David Gonzales, Perez was released from the Pinal County Sheriff's Office on December 16. The U.S. Marshals Service has been looking for him since. Perez is accused of shooting at Arizona Department of Public Safety officers December 11 outside a home in Casa Grande, according to KPHO. Perez, 25, was injured by gunfire in the shootout with the public safety officers, according to KPHO. He was admitted to a Phoenix hospital and was later held in another county's jail before being turned over to Pinal County, KPHO said. But the Pinal County Sheriff's Office said it never received the charging paperwork for Perez, and he bonded out on an misdemeanor warrant. The bond was $320, KPHO said, .","NEW: Chandler Fashion Center reopens after police sweep .

"(CNN) -- For the 300 fans who are accompanying talk show host Oprah Winfrey on what is being billed as the Ultimate Australian Adventure, the trip is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take in the sights and wonders the country has to offer. But for Australia -- a country that heavily relies on tourism -- the investment is expected to pay off manifold in publicity, the government said Monday. The eight-day trip began last week and ends with two taped shows at the Sydney Opera House, which has been renamed Oprah House. Footing the bill for Oprah and her guests will collectively cost the government AUS $5 million, said Andrew McEvoy, managing director of Tourism Australia. But the value equivalent in exposure has already made it a smart investment, he said. ""Just before Oprah turned up into our country, the number was $38 million,"" McEvoy said Monday. ""So that was three or four days ago. I can imagine that to double in the time that she's been here. And I can imagine that to treble."" He said the number could further skyrocket next year if Oprah commits to making ""at least four hours of Oprah Winfrey television, which will go to 145 countries around the world."" Oprah and her group have visited the Great Barrier Reef, gone on a wine-tasting excursion to Hunter Valley, taken in a scenic flight over the Australian outback, partied in the Royal Botanic Gardens and trekked up the Sydney Harbour Bridge, which adorned with a big 'O' in her honor. ""I can't believe the energy of Oprah herself, her crew -- they're phenomenal,"" McEvoy said, adding ""everyone is full of adrenaline."" During the media mogul's career, many have cashed in on the ""Oprah effect,"" which has launched sales of what she promotes. Oprah is in the midst of her farewell season of her show. Earlier this year, she showed her gratitude to her audience by announcing the all-expenses paid excursion. Journalist Tracey Holmes contributed to this report.","Oprah and her group are on an eight-day visit in Australia .

"(CNN) -- As the ""B"" in BRIC (one of the world's fastest-growing economies alongside Russia, India and China), Brazil may very well owe its force to an emerging business and technology district in the heart of Sao Paulo, centered around an upscale avenue called Luis Carlos Berrini in the neighborhood of Brooklin. The modern buildings of Morumbi in Brooklin line the Marginal highway along the Pinheiros River. ""There's been a transformation from a sleepy outpost in Sao Paulo to perhaps the city's most dynamic area in terms of new growth, new buildings and new companies,"" observes Bill Hinchberger, the founding editor of Brazilmax, an online travel guide to Brazil. Of course, this transformation didn't happen overnight. Development began in the 1930's, from a quaint rural outpost to a middle-class residential neighborhood of predominantly single-family, chalet-style homes of German and British expatriates, alongside a favela. The commercial growth of Brooklin -- named after the now-defunct New York trolley-car line which terminated in that neighborhood -- began with the general movement of banks from Rio de Janeiro to Brazil's biggest city near the country's newly established (yet diplomatically dull) capital of Brasília in 1960. In the following decades, more brands and businesses moved over from Rio to Sao Paulo, hotels took over vacant lots, and the favela was razed to make way for more office buildings. While residential (as well as dining and nightlife) development has been slow to develop in comparison, the influx of outsiders and renewal of generations has resulted in a stimulating mix of new residents and commuters. ""Since the development of the late 1990's, Berrini is becoming the fourth downtown of Sao Paulo, after Centro, Paulista (a symbol of the 20th century city) and Faria Lima [in neighboring Pinheiros],"" says Hinchberger, who lived in Brazil from 1986 to 2008, most of that time in Brooklin. Today, the region around Avenida Berrini hosts a quorum of high-technology multinational firms and their executives, including AT&T, HP, LG Electronics, Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle, Philips, Samsung, Sun Microsystems, and even Coca-Cola and Pepsi. But perhaps more telling is the shift of headquarters of Brazil's largest and internationally renowned media conglomerate, Globo, from its traditional home in Rio to its new stronghold in Brooklin, Sao Paulo. Other Brazilian media and IT giants such as Terra Internet and Abril have also set up shop on Avenida Berrini, with a slew of software start-ups filling in the side-streets. So is Berrini set to be Brazil's own up-and-coming Silicon Valley? ""I think it's overblown to call it a Silicon Valley,"" responds Hinchberger. ""Brazil has a problem in terms of IT with fairly restrictive laws on the importation of hardware, which just makes everything more expensive. The price of any computer is about twice as much as in the U.S. Even local manufacturers don't charge cut-rate prices, because they know they can get a free ride [on the market rates]."" But if general access to hardware hinders distribution, Hinchberger agrees that software for Web and mobile development is soaring. This should come as no surprise, given that Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country in both area and population, and ranks fifth worldwide in number of mobile phone and Internet users. Mobile mecca . With a population of 190 million, Brazil registered over 152 million mobile phones (of which 3.2 million 3G devices) as of February 2009, resulting in a market penetration rate of 80 percent, according to the Brazilian telecommunications portal Teleco. Teleco also reports that Brazil's four major carriers -- Vivo, TIM, Claro and Oi -- together hold 91 percent of the market. And let us not forget, Sao Paulo is the world's fourth-largest city, as well as Brazil's biggest and richest megalopolis. Among the foreign companies with their foot in the door of this exploding online and mobile market is the year-old start-up Nimbuzz -- headquartered in the Netherlands, with its first overseas office in Sao Paulo -- which offers a free, mobile solution for instant messaging, VoIP calling, file sending and social networking through existing platforms. ""Nimbuzz is located about five minutes from Avenida Berrini,"" says Marcelo Calbucci, Nimbuzz's Brazilian marketing analyst. ""Many direct-to-consumer companies (D2C), operators, Internet companies and general technology companies are located around Berrini, so the location has helped in meeting new opportunities and building business relationships more frequently, with companies that relate directly to Nimbuzz's core business."" But while some 152 million Brazilians may have a mobile handset, a staggering 80 percent of them use a pre-paid phone card, making the public's investment in mobile services a challenge. Nimbuzz, however, remains optimistic about evolving mentalities, as the company's Berrini branch focuses on shifting Brazilians' already buzzing online activity to their handheld devices. ""The online social habits of the Brazilian population match Nimbuzz features, mainly with Orkut and MSN, but with good participation also from Skype, Facebook, Twitter, MySpace and others,"" says Calbucci. Just around the corner from the Nimbuzz office is Brasigo, another year-old start-up, which offers an online space for Brazilians to interact and share with each other, beginning with a user-generated question-and-answer service. Like Nimbuzz, the company may be starting small, but unlike global models such as Yahoo! Answers, Brasigo has the advantage of being born and raised in Brooklin.","Avenida Berrini in Brooklin, Sao Paulo, is Brazil's up-and-coming high-tech hub .

"(CNN) -- Ten people were killed and 18 injured in clashes between ""criminal gangs"" in a southwestern Mexican town, Mexico's federal government said Saturday. Mexico's interior ministry issued a statement blasting what it called ""reprehensible acts"" that it said contributed to the deaths, which occurred Friday night in Tecalitlan in the state of Jalisco. Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora contacted Jalisco Gov. Emilio Gonzalez Marquez to offer the federal government's help in improving safety and security in the town, the statement said. Federal authorities also offered help tracking down ""the criminals responsible."" The violence came one day after federal troops gunned down an alleged drug cartel boss in the state of Michoacan, which neighbors Jalisco. The death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez and two other Familia Michoacana members came during a joint operation involving members of Mexico's federal police, army, air force and navy.

"(CNN) -- Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa is injecting his cachet as a newly minted Nobel Prize winner into the political sphere, in a strong criticism of the political aspirations of the daughter of a disgraced former president. Keiko Fujimori, a congresswoman and daughter of ex-president Alberto Fujimori, is one of the leading candidates in next year's presidential election, according to polls. ""If the daughter of the dictator who is condemned to prison for being a criminal and a thief has the possibility of becoming the president of Peru, I will be one of the Peruvians who will go out to try to impede it through all the legal channels available,"" Vargas Llosa said Monday. ""I think that would be a real catastrophe for our country,"" he added. Vargas Llosa, who lost to Alberto Fujimori in a runoff in his previous presidential campaign, received the Nobel Prize for Literature last week at a ceremony in Norway. According to various polls published in Peru, Keiko Fujimori is currently the leading or second-place contender in the race. Her father was president of Peru from 1990 to 2000, a period that was highlighted by the defeat of terrorists who disrupted society, but stained by an authoritarian streak and human rights abuses. Alberto Fujimori fled Peru in the midst of a scandal involving his spy chief, and was extradited years later back to his country to face trial. He was convicted in four separate trials for a litany of corruption and human rights abuse charges. Among the sentences he received was a 25-year prison term for authorizing the operation of a death squad responsible for killing civilians. Representatives for Keiko Fujimori said she would respond to Vargas Llosa's comments Tuesday. CNN en Español's Maria Elisa Callejas contributed to this report.","Mario Vargas Llosa received the Nobel Prize for Literature .

"Rome (CNN) -- One of the men convicted of killing British exchange student Meredith Kercher in Italy three years ago has lost his appeal, his lawyer said Friday. It means Rudy Guede, originally from the Ivory Coast, will continue serving his 16-year sentence for the crime after the court refused Thursday to overturn his conviction. ""Rudy is very disappointed,"" said his lawyer, Walter Biscotti. ""We don't agree with the verdict because, starting today, there is an innocent man in jail."" Guede was originally sentenced to 30 years in prison for murder and attempted sexual assault, but he successfully appealed last year to cut the term to 16 years. He is one of three people convicted of killing Kercher in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Guede was tried in October 2008. Kercher's American roommate, Amanda Knox, and Knox's former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted in a separate trial that concluded a year ago.

"(CNN) -- Voters in Belarus head to the polls Sunday to cast their ballots in presidential elections. The race will determine the political fate of Alexander Lukashenko, regarded as ""the last dictator in Europe"" by U.S. lawmakers. Lukashenko, who has been in office since 1994, is running against nine other candidates, according to the Central Election Commission. National polls show that he enjoys wide support of the electorate. Andrei Sannikov, a former diplomat who wants to see Belarus as a member of the European Union, is one of the main opposition leaders. The two others are Yaroslav Romanchuk and Vladimir Neklyaev. Economist Romanchuk, a candidate from the United Civil Party, has been prolific in publicizing his views on economic reforms. Lukashenko's other opponent, Neklyaev, runs a social campaign ""Tell the Truth!"" He was arrested for participating in public protests earlier this year and later released. According to the electoral commission, the official election day is December 19, but early voting was held between Tuesday and Saturday for voters unable to go to the polls Sunday. Preliminary results show that at least 10 percent of eligible voters cast their votes in the early elections. On December 4, state television broadcast live pre-election debates for the first time since the 1994 presidential race. Lukashenko and Neklyaev chose not to participate. The contestants were also allowed two half-an-hour slots on the prime-time national television to address the Belarusians, according to a news release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All candidates except for Lukashenko used this opportunity during the campaign. Legislation of Belarus allows presidential candidates to campaign until the day before the elections. However, during the Sunday elections, all public events have been banned, said official news agency BelTa. Protests are not allowed in the aftermath of the election either. According to BelTa, organizers of public events must receive official permission 15 days before holding a public event. ""No organization has applied for the permission to the Minsk City Council,"" Central Election Commission chairwoman Lidia Yermoshina told BelTa. Any social activity will be deemed illegal, the news agency said. In 2006, security forces cracked down on protesters in the aftermath of the elections, fearing the replication of a Color Revolution in Belarus. In neighboring Ukraine, Orange Revolution deposed the regime of Leonid Kuchma two years earlier and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan brought down president Askar Akayev and his government. The Central Electoral Commission issued a statement Wednesday saying that it had accredited 1,015 international observers. Many remain skeptical despite the unprecedented number of contestants and international observers invited to participate in the elections. Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has repeatedly expressed concerns over the status of civil and political rights in Belarus.","The race will determine the fate of President Alexander Lukashenko .

"London, England (CNN) -- They are the jewels of a royal love affair, one that led Britain's King Edward VIII to abdicate the throne more than 70 years ago so he could marry the woman he loved. Now, the diamonds, gold, and precious gemstones that expressed the love between Edward and American Wallis Simpson are going up for auction. The 20 items being offered at Sotheby's in London on Tuesday include 11 pieces by Cartier, some of which are estimated at more than £1 million ($1.5 million) each. ""The offering comprises not only incomparable examples of the genius of Cartier in collaboration with the Windsors, but also pieces whose inscriptions tell the story of perhaps the greatest love story of the 20th century, the romance that led Edward VIII to abdicate the throne of Great Britain,"" said David Bennett, the chairman of Sotheby's Jewelry in Europe and the Middle East. The couple commissioned jewels from the great European jewelry houses during their courtship in the 1930s and after they were married, Sotheby's said. Cartier was one of their favored jewelers, and the company's high jewelry director Jeanne Toussaint created some of her best work just for the couple, who came to be known as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. One of the pieces she created was an onyx and diamond bracelet in the form of an elongated panther. Designed in 1952, the bracelet was among the finest of Toussaint's ""great cats"" jewels and is in the sale at an estimated £1-1.5 million ($1.5-2.3 million). Also up for sale is a diamond flamingo brooch with feathers of rubies, sapphires and emeralds, and a beak of citrine. The brooch, also estimated between £1 and 1.5 million, was the showpiece of an earlier sale of the couple's jewels, held in Geneva in 1987. All the items up for auction Tuesday belonged to a single owner, but Sotheby's did not disclose that person's identity. Edward had been on the throne for just 11 months when he decided to give up the crown in December 1936 to marry Simpson, an American divorcee. He chose to abdicate because, as supreme governor of the Church of England, he was not permitted to marry a divorced woman. The abdication speech he gave Dec. 11, 1936, revealed his love for the woman who would later become his wife. ""I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love,"" Edward said. The auction includes a favorite bracelet of Simpson's, made of diamonds and supporting nine gem-set Latin crosses -- each with an intimate inscription on the back, Sotheby's said. The crosses represent special moments in her life, including her marriage and the assassination attempt against the king. A heart-shaped brooch of rubies and diamonds was commissioned for the couple's 20th wedding anniversary and features the initials W.E. -- for Wallis and Edward -- in emeralds on the front. Cartier also created a six-piece diamond-encrusted dress suite comprising a pair of cufflinks, three dress buttons and a stud, given by Simpson to Edward in 1935 to wear for the Royal Silver Jubilee celebrations and his birthday. Each cufflink features an E on one end and a W on the other. One of the buttons is inscribed on the back with the phrase ""Hold Tight,"" a favorite phrase of the couple in their correspondence before marriage. Another gift Simpson gave to her husband traces the routes of European trips they had taken together on an 18-carat gold and gem-set cigarette case. Each city is marked with a gem or diamond and is connected to the next by enamel lines. The inscription on the back reveals it was a Christmas present in 1935. Other items in the sale include a purse made by Van Cleef and Arpels of gold mesh, rubies, turquoise and diamonds, and a series of silver items and medals once owned by Edward.","The pieces belonged to Britain's King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli authorities are investigating whether the attack that left an American woman dead and her friend injured was ""nationalistic,"" a police spokesman said Monday, using a term for crimes in which a victim is targeted based on an Arab or Israeli background. American Kristine Luken died in the attack. Her body was found Sunday after Kay Susan Wilson, Luken's friend and co-worker at a Christian ministry, stumbled into a picnic area with her hands bound, bleeding from multiple stab wounds and asking for help. Wilson told authorities the two were hiking in a forest near Beit Shemesh, west of Jerusalem, when two men attacked them, tied them to a tree and stabbed them, according to police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. Wilson told reporters from her hospital bed Sunday that one of the men was armed with a long serated knife and that she believes they were Arab. ""It was clear that they came to kill,"" the Israeli newspaper Haaretz quoted Wilson as saying. ""Who carries around a knife like that?"" Wilson said she was wearing a Star of David on a necklace when she was attacked, according to the newspaper. ""He took it off like a gentleman and then turned me around and stabbed in the place where the Star of David had been,"" Haaretz quoted her as saying. Rosenfeld confirmed Monday that investigators' primary focus is that the attacks may have involved nationalistic intent, but he said investigators have not yet completely ruled out other possibilities. Luken and Wilson both worked for CMJ UK, a Christian ministry based in England. Wilson, a British citizen living in Israel, was a senior tour guide for the group, according to a statement posted to the group's website by its CEO, Robin Aldridge . Luken was an administrator for the group and had recently taken over responsibility for managing the group's tour operations in Israel, Aldridge said. ""She had a beautiful and gentle spirit as well as a strong and vibrant faith,"" Aldridge said of Luken. ""She loved Israel and had visited on several occasions both as a tourist and as a member of CMJ."" ""It is a tragedy that such a lively, caring and faith-filled person should have been struck down in such a way,"" he said. The Foreign Office in London said it was ""aware of the hospitalization of a British national"" and was ready to provide assistance if needed. Luken had worked for CMJ UK for one year, having previously been a government employee, according to Aldridge. ""She had to cope with a move to a new country as well as a new job but quickly made the adjustment and became a key member of our team,"" Aldridge said. He said the group's work sharing the Christian faith with the Jewish people in Israel would continue despite the attack.","NEW: Police confirm they are focusing on whether the attack was ""nationalistic""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Following the breakdown of direct talks with Israel, Palestinians have begun seeking international recognition of an independent state from European nations. Officials from the Palestinian Authority told CNN Thursday that the governments of France, Britain, Sweden, and Denmark had formally been asked to recognize a Palestinian state based on borders that existed prior to the 1967 war between Israel and it Arab neighbors. Senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'ath told CNN that the requests were part of an ongoing strategy to achieve statehood outside the framework of talks with Israel. ""These were the last ones, but I have been asking all European countries to do the same,"" Sha'ath said. He said that while most countries in Africa and Asia had already recognized Palestine as an independent state many countries, including the United States and a number of European nations, did not. ""We still have pockets which have not done so -- we are pursuing each of them"" Sha'ath said. Earlier this week the European Union ruled out recognizing an independent Palestinian state for now, fearing a unilateral declaration might adversely impact efforts to get the Middle East peace process back on track. ""The EU commends the work of the Palestinian Authority in building the institutions of the future State of Palestine and reiterates its full support for their endeavours"" read a statement released Monday in Brussels by the 27 EU foreign ministers. ""... the Council reiterates its readiness, when appropriate, to recognize a Palestinian state."" The statement was released the day after the top Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erakat, sent a letter to EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, urging the body to back Palestinian Authority attempts to gain international recognition of a sovereign state. Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay have all moved to recognize an independent Palestinian state in recent weeks, and Palestinian Authority officials are hoping to convince more countries to follow suit. Both the Isareli and the American governments have opposed such moves insisting that the only way forward is though continued negotiations. ""There is no substitute for negotiations with Israel,"" Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN. ""The fundamental cause of the of breakdown in talks was because of the consistent refusal of Palestinians to engage with Israel."" American sponsored talks between the two sides fell apart in September when Israel resumed settlement construction the in the occupied West Bank after a ten-month freeze. Saeb Erakat told CNN that is the reason Palestinians would not return to the negotiating table. ""The Israeli government had the choice between settlements and peace and they chose settlements. And they alone are responsible for the derailment of the peace process,"" he said. Earlier this month the Obama administration announced it would be abandoning efforts to persuade Israel to renew the settlement freeze as a precondition for jump-starting Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Instead the United States is now focusing its efforts on separate talks with each side in hopes of developing a framework agreement on core issues of the conflict that could lead to the resumption of peace talks.","Palestinian Authority seeks recognition from European countries .

"(CNN) -- U.S. defender Jay DeMerit became the first Major League Soccer signing of the Vancouver Whitecaps on Thursday, with the Canadian club set to join the lucrative North American football franchise at the start of the 2011 season. The Whitecaps were unveiled as part of the MLS in March 2009, one of three clubs from across Canada who bid for a place in the league as part of its ongoing expansion program. New signing DeMerit has spent the last six years at English Championship side Watford, but his contract at the London-based club -- who played in the Premier League in the 2006/07 season -- expired in June. The 30-year-old -- who has played 23 times for his country, including at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa where the U.S. reached the last 16 of the competition -- told the official MLS website that he was excited about playing for a new team. ""Vancouver ticked pretty much every box that I could think of as to what I wanted. An aspiring club trying to be a part of something new and something special,"" Wisconsin-born DeMerit told the official MLS website . ""There's something inspiring about being a part of something new and having ambition to make it even bigger. I feel I'm in the right place and I'm looking forward to getting started."" Awarded top allocation ranking, the Vancouver-based team had priority in signing any U.S. international returning to the country to play in MLS and club president Bob Lenarduzzi was quick to express his delight at having snapped up DeMerit on the Whitecaps official website .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday the situation in the Ivory Coast is increasingly volatile and the country risks a return to civil war. The West African nation has fallen into chaos since a presidential runoff election there last month. The country's Independent Electoral Commission said opposition candidate Alassane Ouattara won the election, but its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared incumbent President Laurent Gbagbo the winner. The United Nations, the African Union and other international bodies recognize Ouattara as the victor, but Gbagbo is refusing to step down. ""In the past week, there has been an alarming increase in the use of intimidation by elements of the national security forces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo against the civilian population, and in particular against supporters of President-elect Ouattara,"" Ban said in New York. ""The tactics include abductions and killings and the propagation of hate speech through the state broadcasting corporation,"" he continued. ""There is a real risk of a return to civil war."" Meanwhile, in the Ivory Coast, Gbagbo dug in his heels, declaring ""I am president,"" in a defiant speech. He stressed he is the legitimate winner of the election, but said he would be willing to welcome an international committee to review the results to avoid any further violence. ""I don't want any more bloodshed. I don't want any more war,"" he said. U.N. peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy referred to Gbagbo's remarks when he spoke to reporters in New York. ""Mr. Gbagbo has been very clear. He wants no violence, no more blood,"" Le Roy said. ""So all the forces loyal to him should stop immediately provocation, instigating violence, violation of human rights and provoking the UNOCI mission. We have a mandate to fulfill, and we will fulfill that mandate."" Le Roy said Gbagbo's allies have been handing out rifles to members of a ""Young Patriots"" group, and mercenaries from Liberia and Angola have been hired ""to provoke the civilian population and UNOCI personnel."" He said the United Nations appreciated Gbagbo's call for restraint, but said it should be accompanied by a halt to incitement and attacks on Ouattara's supporters. His and Ban's comments echoed those made by Amnesty International earlier in the day. Citing eyewitnesses, the rights group said it has heard an increasing number of stories of people arrested or otherwise taken by gunman, often with the cooperation of security forces in the Ivory Coast. Amnesty said police are accused of attacking a mosque in Grand-Bassam, opening fire on crowds and groping female protesters. ""It is clear that more and more people are being illegally detained by security forces or armed militiamen and we fear that many of them may have been killed or have disappeared,"" Salvatore Sagues, Amnesty International's West Africa researcher, said in a written statement. Two U.N. military observers were hurt Saturday in an attack by what Ban called ""Young Patriots,"" according to a statement from the secretary-general. On Friday, six armed men wearing military uniforms and traveling in a civilian vehicle opened fire on U.N. peacekeepers in Sebroko, the peacekeeping operation reported. The U.N. troops returned fire. The U.N. Security Council has extended its peacekeepers' mission in Ivory Coast through June 30, despite an expulsion order by Gbagbo. The Gbagbo government accuses the United Nations of providing military and logistical support to former rebels who are backers of Ouattara -- a charge Ban denied. ""The United Nations has stood on the side of Africa against this attempt to overturn the democratic process and the will of the Ivorian people,"" he said. Ban also accused forces loyal to Gbagbo of obstructing the movement of United Nations' personnel and operations in the Ivory Coast, blocking the delivery of key supplies. ""The international community must act ... and act decisively,"" he said.","NEW: Incumbent president says he is willing to have election results reviewed .

"(CNN) -- A blast of harsh winter weather socked Europe Friday, causing travel chaos and sending temperatures into the deep-freeze. From Northern Ireland to Bulgaria, blizzard conditions left airports with heavy delays or shut them entirely. In Belgium, truck drivers were forced to spend a freezing night in their cabs when authorities banned trucks over seven tons from travelling on icy roads. At London's Heathrow Airport, snow caused the cancellation of many short-haul flights. These cancellations sparked a domino-effect that left passenger aircraft unable to get to the gates, prompting further delays. Hundreds of passengers who did manage to land were still unable to claim their luggage after baggage-handlers ended their shifts. Meteorologists say the cold weather is caused by a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, which means that cold Arctic air is flowing into southern latitudes that are normally much warmer. Forecasters don't expect conditions to change anytime soon. The next wave of snowy weather is expected to bring up to 20 centimeters to some parts of the U.K., with London expected to receive 5-10 centimeters of snow. The weather system will move across France and Germany on Saturday night and Sunday. Below-normal temperatures are expected to continue in northern Europe into the beginning of next week.","Travel chaos reigns across northern Europe amid harsh winter weather .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Human remains found in Georgia on Saturday are being tested to see if they belong to a woman who went missing nearly a year and a half ago, a Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman said Sunday. Passersby found human bones about nine miles from where Kristi Cornwell of Blairsville, Georgia, was last seen in August 2009, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said. Bankhead said the results of tests on the bones will be announced Monday morning. The site where the bones were discovered and Blairsville are both in Union County, in far northern Georgia.

"New York (CNN) -- A propane gas tank leak that prompted the evacuations of an estimated 900 homes in Shirley, New York, was contained, officials said Saturday night. After conducting an air quality sampling of 100 residences, officials decided to allow all residents to go home, said Suffolk County spokesman Dan Aug. Electricity was restored, with the exception of a shopping center that holds the 30,000-gallon underground storage tank. Fire and other workers were able to close a leaking valve on the tank in the Long Island town, Suffolk County Executive Steve Levy said in a statement. The leak was discovered at 1:15 a.m. by a driver of a propane delivery truck, the county said. Red Cross spokesman Craig Cooper arrived at a local high school about 3 a.m. Saturday to help some of the evacuees, many of whom were without important medications. ""People literally showed up in their pajamas,"" he said, estimating that about 150 residents had registered at the school. The leak affected a five-mile radius around Shirley on Long Island's southern shore, according to Sgt. Greg Heller of the Suffolk County Police Department. Heller told CNN that the leak was not suspicious, but because propane gas stays low and close to the ground, authorities decided to evacuate nearby homes. The leak also shut down rail service between Patchogue and Speonk, according to Long Island Rail Road spokesman Mike Lewi. ""I commend our county, town, American Red Cross and volunteer emergency services personnel for this tightly coordinated response,"" said Levy.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's doctors took ""one last shot"" at saving the ailing actress' leg with powerful antibiotics her publicist said Monday afternoon. If the newest treatment at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center does not heal a ""very deep"" lesion in her lower leg, it will be amputated below the knee, according to spokesman John Blanchette. ""She has to be on very strong antibiotics for the next few days and then they will decide what kind of operation to go ahead with,"" Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, told HLN's ""The Joy Behar Show"" Monday. Gabor, whose 94th birthday is next month, has not been told that amputation is a possibility, Von Anhalt said. ""I'm not going to tell my wife that she probably could lose her leg,"" he said. ""She's going to get a heart attack."" Doctors recommended that Gabor check into the hospital before Christmas, he said, but she didn't want to go. ""She was crying and begged me 'Please don't bring me to the hospital over the holidays,'"" he said. Her condition worsened in recent days as gangrene set in, he said. ""It smells already bad,"" In November, Gabor was hospitalized for a swollen leg, her husband said at the time. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt has said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge;"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953; ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In responses to four suits accusing him of coercing young men into sexual relationships, prominent Georgia pastor Eddie Long denies the claims and asks that the suits be dismissed. ""The plaintiff's claims of sexual misconduct are not true,"" each of the four responses filed by Long's attorneys says. The responses, each about 30 pages, offer a point-by-point response to each of the allegations and claims in the lawsuits. The documents were posted on the website of CNN affiliate WSB. Four members of Long's New Birth Missionary Baptist Church -- Anthony Flagg, 21; Maurice Robinson, 20; Jamal Parris, 23; and Spencer LeGrande, 22 -- filed suit against Long and the 25,000-member megachurch in September, claiming he used his position as their spiritual counselor to pressure them into sexual relationships. The suits allege that the relationships, which began when the men were in their teens, lasted over many months. According to the lawsuits, Long traveled with the young men to locations in the United States and abroad, sharing a room and engaging in sexual contact with them, including massaging, masturbation or oral sex. The suits also claim Long provided the youths with gifts including cars and money. Long, one of his attorneys and a church spokesman have already publicly denied the allegations. In the responses filed Monday in DeKalb County, Georgia, Long's attorneys maintain the pastor was attempting to be a father figure to the youths, providing them with financial assistance and encouragement and helping them navigate their troubles. Long has ""been successful at building a ministry at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church that places a special emphasis on outreach to men, reinforcing to men the importance of partnering with a ministry that will grow them spiritually and will help them develop the life skills needed to become successful in the workplace and teach them how to become entrepreneurs and leaders,"" the court documents said. ""Bishop Long admits that he mentors many young men from challenged backgrounds, who have often been without the benefit of a male role model,"" according to the documents. ""The mentor/mentee relationship between Bishop Long as mentor and the mentee is firmly grounded on expressed promises of honesty and truthfulness."" Long provided cars for the youths so they would have transportation to school and work, according to the responses, and provided them housing when they needed it -- in the case of LeGrande, for instance, because his school had no dormitory and he was living in a hotel room, and in the case of Flagg, because he could not return to his mother's home after he was arrested for allegedly assaulting her during a confrontation. Long provides many church members with employment, the responses said. Attorney B.J. Bernstein, who represents the four men in their suits against Long, told CNN Tuesday she had not yet received copies of Long's responses to the suits. Bernstein has alleged Long groomed the youths for sex, telling CNN in September, ""he gets to know them and gets the trust, and then bit by bit -- first it's a hug. It's just like any sexual predator ... Ask any victim of sexual abuse. It is a progression."" Long admits that he ""provides opportunities for travel, education and personal growth to many members of his congregation"" and claims in the responses that he often shares hotel rooms with members of his congregation when traveling. Some of the young men have said that Long encouraged them to call him ""Daddy."" In his responses to the suits, Long's attorneys say that the ""entire New Birth membership calls Bishop Long 'Daddy' or 'Bishop.'"" Participants in the pastor's LongFellows Youth Academy call him ""Pop,"" according to the documents, and members of other churches call Long ""Granddaddy."" ""The references to and association between Bishop Long (and other religious leaders) and a 'Spiritual Father' is based upon the crisis in the African American community of fatherlessness,"" the documents said. LeGrand claims that Long provided him with Ambien, a sleep aid, during a trip to Kenya.

"(CNN) -- German champions Bayern Munich have confirmed the signing of Brazilian defender Luiz Gustavo from Bundesliga rivals Hoffenheim. As part of the deal, which the German media have reported is worth an estimated €15 million ($20 million), Bayern's 18-year-old Austria midfielder David Alaba will move in the opposite direction on loan until the end of this season. ""Luiz Gustavo is the player we always wanted, and he's making the team stronger,"" Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge told the club's official website when the January transfer window opened on Monday. Bayern will be hoping the new acquisition can help revive their domestic fortunes, with Louis Van Gaal's team fifth in the table and 14 points behind runaway leaders Borussia Dortmund during the winter break. Who will be the bargain signings of the January sales? Gustavo arrived at Hoffenheim from Brazilian team Corinthians Alagoano in 2007, and was part of the side which gained promotion to German football's top tier in 2008. He will fill the boots of Argentina's Martin Demichelis, who has completed a transfer to Spanish side Malaga after seven years with last season's UEFA Champions League runners-up. Inter Milan, who beat Bayern in the 2010 final, have sealed the capture of Italy center-back Andrea Ranocchia from Genoa.

"(CNN) -- Mid-table English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers want to sign former world player of the year Ronaldinho and persuade football icon David Beckham to come to them on loan from Los Angeles Galaxy. Rovers' manager Steve Kean said the prospect of AC Milan star Ronaldinho and Beckham coming to Ewood Park during the January transfer window was a sign of the ambition shown by the club's new Indian owners. ""If you asked any Premier League manager if they wanted somebody who had been the world player of the year twice, then I reckon they would say 'yes I'm interested,"" he told the club's website on Tuesday. ""It is something that puts us on the map as far as trying to bring players of great stature to the club."" Who will be the bargain signings of the January sales? Poultry giants Venky's took control of the Blackburn in November and sacked former boss Sam Allardyce the following month when they handed the role to Kean. Ronaldinho, who was named FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004 and 2005, has struggled to recapture his best form at the San Siro and has also been linked with a likely return to former club Gremio in Brazil. ""It shows our intent,"" said Kean on Blackburn's bid for the former Barcelona playmaker. ""It shows we are trying to go to a different level and I think that can only be positive. ""In some areas it has been perceived and written about as if it is something of a negative, but I just can't see that."" Former Real Madrid and Manchester United midfielder Beckham, who has been linked with a return to England during the Major League Soccer close season, has emerged as another target for Rovers. The British media reported Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United are also chasing the 35-year-old, but Venky's chair Anuradha Desai told the BBC that Blackburn were ""open whenever he is ready to come."" Desai also confirmed the club's interest in Ronaldinho and outlined the financial package on offer to the 2002 World Cup winner. ""He (Ronaldinho) is keen to play in the English Premier League and I think that goes in our favor. ""To be precise (it is) €7.6m ($10.1m) for the first year and about €8.5m ($11.4m) for the second and third years,"" she added.","Blackburn Rovers have launched a bid to bring AC Milan's Ronaldinho to England .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio man pleaded guilty Thursday and was sentenced to life without parole for killing and dismembering a woman, her son and her friend and hiding their bagged remains in the hollow of a tree. Matthew Hoffman, 30, pleaded guilty to all 10 counts, including three counts of aggravated murder and the kidnapping of one of the victim's 13-year-old relatives, in Knox County, Ohio, in November. According to his attorney, Hoffman said he committed the crimes after encountering Tina R. Herrmann when he entered the house during a burglary attempt. But the sister of Stephanie Sprang, one of the other victims, said there was no excuse for him killing Herrmann and waiting for the other victims to come to the house. ""Death is too easy for him and we would rather pay tax dollars and let him suffer and live and deal with what he did every day,"" Sherrie Baxter told CNN affiliate WSYX. The remains of Herrmann, 31, her son, Kody, and Stephanie Sprang, 41, were found November 18 in a rural area after they had been missing 10 days from Herrmann's home. Autopsy results indicated they had been stabbed to death and dismembered. Hoffman, who worked as a tree trimmer, was indicted Monday and the plea and sentencing agreement were detailed during a hearing Thursday. ""The indictment alleges that Hoffman purposely caused the deaths of Tina R. Herrmann, Ms. Herrmann's son Kody Maynard, age 11, and her neighbor Stephanie L. Sprang, on November 10, 2010,"" prosecutors said about the indictment. ""The aggravated murder charges further allege that Hoffman murdered the victims while he was committing the offense of aggravated burglary in Herrmann's residence."" The indictment did not include death penalty specifications, authorities said, ""in accordance with the wishes of the victim's families."" CNN left a message for Hoffman's attorney, Bruce Malek, who told WSYX that Hoffman had remorse for what he did and felt it was important for the victims' remains to be found. Police previously had said Hoffman provided information leading to the recovery of the remains. The 13-year-old girl was found bound and gagged in the basement of Hoffman's home in Mount Vernon, Ohio, about 20 miles from Herrmann's home in Howard, Ohio. Hoffman was charged with one count of rape for allegedly assaulting the girl, prosecutors said. Besides the aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, kidnapping and rape charges, Hoffman faced a charge of tampering with evidence for allegedly removing some clothing and bedding from Herrmann's residence in order to hinder the investigation, authorities said. He also pleaded guilty to three counts of abuse of a corpse. Prosecutors those charges were filed because ""the victims' remains were not intact when recovered by authorities in a hollow tree"" in Kokosing Lake State Wildlife Area. According to the Columbus Dispatch, in a statement read by Knox County Prosecutor John Thatcher, the girl said: ""This has changed my whole life and my family's life, too."" In the statement, the teen related memories of the victims and said she's no longer frightened of Hoffman. ""This is so sickening, Matthew, to know you even had the guts to do this to a family,"" she said in the statement. Herrmann failed to report to work at a Dairy Queen in Mount Vernon on November 10, Knox County Sheriff David Barber told CNN affiliate WBNS. A deputy twice went to her home and saw her pickup truck there. No one answered the door, though lights were on in the home. Later in the week, blood was found in the home, leading authorities to suspect foul play. Sprang's father, Steve Thompson, said he was satisfied with the sentence. ""They are many answers that I still need,"" he told WSYX. ""I am confident and sure we will find them later on down the road.""","Matthew Hoffman enters guilty pleas in November killings .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- A woman sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery has not been executed, Iran's official news agency reported Wednesday, rejecting ""Western media"" reports that Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani had been executed. ""She is currently enjoying full health and is at the Tabriz Prison,"" the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the head of the judiciary in the province as saying. ""Her case is being processed by the relevant judicial authorities of the province and is going through the due process,"" Hojatoleslam Malek Azhdar Sharif said. Her sentence of death by stoning drew worldwide outrage earlier this year. Authorities in Iran were reported to have given the go-ahead this week to execute Ashtiani as soon as Wednesday, although the method of killing her was not clear. French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Wednesday that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart to urge Iran not to execute her. Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki assured him ""that a verdict in the case concerning Sakineh Ashtiani had not been reached by the Iranian legal authorities and that the information on her alleged execution did not correspond to reality,"" Kouchner said. Human rights groups and various governments have also urged Iran not to execute Ashtiani. Wednesday, European Union High Representative Catherine Ashton demanded that Iran stop the execution from going ahead and convert her sentence, a spokesman said in a statement. British Foreign Minister William Hague called the proposed stoning a ""barbaric punishment."" ""I think it will damage Iran in the eyes of the world,"" Hague told reporters. ""It will be much better not to proceed with it. I think many people across the world are outraged by the punishment and the prospect of it being carried out, and I would urge them even now to desist from it."" Iran said Wednesday the global reaction is just a way to pressure its government. ""They have become so shameless regarding the subject of human rights that they have turned the case of Sakineh Ashtiani, who has committed murder and betrayal, into a human rights issue and are using it against our nation,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast told the ISNA news agency. ""This case has been turned into a symbol of seeking freedom for women in the West and they are shamelessly demanding her freedom. They are, therefore, trying to turn an ordinary (court) case into a lever to pressure our nation."" Ashtiani initially was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery. The Iranian government later said she was also convicted of murdering her husband, but her lawyer and family dispute that. Ashtiani, 43 and a mother of two, drew international attention when she was sentenced to death by stoning. She concedes that she was convicted of adultery, as initially reported, but says she was acquitted of murder. ""The man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned, but he is not sentenced to death,"" she said in August. The Iranian government's claims that she was convicted of murder are a lie, she told The Guardian newspaper through an intermediary. ""They are embarrassed by the international attention on my case, and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret."" Ashtiani's son and her attorney are still in jail after being arrested last month, said Mina Ahadi, a spokeswoman for the International Committee Against Stoning. Also still detained are two German journalists who tried to interview them. Before his arrest, Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Ghaderzadeh, said court officials stole documents and files pertaining to the murder of his father in order to ""promote his mother as a murderer."" Ahadi also said the Iranian regime ""fabricated"" the murder charges. In August, Ashtiani appeared on state TV confessing that she knew about a plot to kill her husband but felt she had been misled. Amnesty International condemned the interview. Ghaderzadeh and attorney Hootan Kian will not be issued a lawyer, because the government claims they do not need one, according to Ahadi. Ashtiani's other former lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran. Mostafaei claims that Iranian authorities tried to arrest him without cause. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr in Tehran, Iran, and Saskya Vandoorne in Paris, France, contributed to this report.","NEW: Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani is in ""full health"" and her case is being processed, IRNA reports .

"(CNN) -- Looking to get away this holiday season? Who better to find the deals than agents catering to notoriously cash-strapped students? We spoke with Patrick Evans of the student travel agency STA Travel, Danielle Carlson of StudentUniverse and Anne Banas of Smarter Travel, who offered recommendations for five places around the globe that offer an especially great value for trips from December 1 through January 25. The first two weeks of December and the first week of January are known as ""dead weeks"" in the travel industry, and are the ""absolute best time to travel in the entire year,"" Banas said. So why not follow college students during their winter break to visit awesome destinations at low prices? 1. Costa Rica . With an average temperature of 72 degrees during the winter, travelers will enjoy a wonderful climate during a holiday retreat to Costa Rica. Visitors can explore tons of outdoor activities including beaches, canopy tours and national parks. ""Latin American countries are a great value right now because a lot of airlines are increasing service to these locations,"" Banas said. Carlson added that Costa Rica is her company's top selling Latin American location, followed by Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Lima, Peru. 2. Lima, Peru . Speaking of Lima, why not spend winter break visiting the largest city in Peru? Adventurous travelers can venture beyond the metropolis to explore the jungle, climb the Andes Mountains, and discover the lost city of the Incas. ""Air travel is great in Lima, with tons of low-cost carriers flying there,"" Banas said. Check out other great travel tips and destinations at Five To Go . 3. Panama City, Florida . Panama City and neighboring Panama City Beach aren't just for spring breakers. Indulge in shopping, helicopter tours, or spend a day at Ripley's Believe It or Not Museum. With highs in the 60s even during winter, there's always something to do in the area. Florida also boasts another destination with good values during winter break: Orlando, Carlson said. Many of the major attractions in the area offer deals this time of year. You can avoid the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds right after the New Year's holiday, when theme parks often reach capacity. 4. Boston, Massachusetts . ""Boston is really, really cheap and affordable to get to,"" Banas said. While travel prices tend to be rising nationwide, it is actually getting less expensive to travel to Boston. ""Jet Blue is now using Logan Airport in Boston as a secondary hub,"" Banas explained. Additionally, AirTran has had a strong presence in Boston, and with Southwest just starting to fly into the airport last year, it makes Logan a powerhouse of low-cost airlines. So if the cold doesn't bother you, winter break would be the best time to come check out the museums and all this city has to offer. 5. London, England, and Paris, France . Wave at the Queen during a trip to London or visit Paris for some pastries and French berets. ""For Europe, we're seeing a huge interest in flights to London, with Paris ranking second,"" Carlson said. Additionally, London and Paris are among StudentUniverse's top destinations in Europe for hotels offering a great value. ""British Airways is offering some crazy cheap hotel packages, with roundtrip flights from 20 major U.S. cities and two nights in a London hotel for $412 if you book by November 3,"" Banas said. London and Paris are year-round destinations, so why not visit during the off-season for tourists? ""During the winter travel months -- excluding holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas -- many of the European destinations are going to be just as beautiful as they are during the summer, but with less tourists you'll have shorter lines for the sites and often find more welcoming local businesses since they aren't overrun with tourists,"" Evans said. In fact, December is said to be the best time to visit France, as the already beautiful country is decorated with lights, holiday ribbons, and is full of Christmas markets. Banas said the post-holiday deals are often posted right after Thanksgiving. Add that to your Black Friday shopping list!","Many airlines are increasing service to Latin America, making it a great value .
While travel prices tend to be rising, it is getting less expensive to travel to Boston .
London and Paris are just as beautiful in the winter, but offer better values and fewer tourists ."

"(CNN) -- A national soccer league in Algeria has canceled matches scheduled for Friday and Saturday after riots in the capital and elsewhere this week. The Algerian National Football League announced the cancellations in Al Watan, a local newspaper. The matches were canceled in an effort to prevent large groups of young people from gathering. The streets were mostly calm in the Algerian capital on Friday, and many imams appealed for calm during morning prayers. Rising prices for food staples like milk and sugar sparked protests in the nation this week, and some fear more violence will erupt. Algerian Minister of Trade Mustapha Benbada said the price of staples will go down next week, but he did not provide any further details . The demonstrators were mostly young men. ""They are burning tires, breaking into buildings, breaking everything. ... We can hear the screams,"" journalist Lania Tagzout said a few days ago. Adding fuel to the protesters' anger are the high rates of unemployment and housing issues, socioeconomic problems that have been festering for some time. The government has blamed the rising prices and other issues on the global economic crisis. The demonstrations began Tuesday night, and are largely are unorganized, without any clear leaders, Tagzout said . There have been injuries among the protesters as well as police, but authorities aren't disclosing any numbers, she said. Police aren't engaging the demonstrators so far, but are using tear gas to contain them. And even though businesses are shuttered and many people are staying off the streets in the capital, there's not much anger toward the protesters, she explained.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- At the foot of Mount Fuji, in the Chubu region of Japan, a lush and expansive forest named Aokigahara sits dauntingly. Local residents are told from an early age to avoid it altogether, as its sheer volume leaves little question that a curious youngster will be unable to find his or her way out of thickets that have become synonymous with a dark mythology. Though the area has served as a respite for the peaceful elderly suicides of yore, today it has devolved into the country's ultimate destination of despondent citizens suffering under the pressures of Japan's notoriously driven and achievement-based culture. Aokigahara is now the site of 50 to 100 suicides each year. Earlier this year, VBS contacted Azusa Hayono, a geologist who for more than 30 years has patrolled Aokigahara studying the land, serving as an environmental conservationist and stumbling upon the not infrequent dead body. A sweet, conscientious and demure man, it is strange to consider the amount of solitary carnage he has encountered. He's come to act as a sort of counselor to the many people he finds contemplating death along Aokigahara's pathways. See the rest of Aokigahara Suicide Forest at VBS.TV . As he led us into Aokigahara, so creepily scored with the echo of birds and crackling brush, the idea that Azusa was sane at all seemed almost impossible. That we'd find a dead body, to us at least, was entirely possible -- so much so that when we did in fact stumble on what Azusa judged as a suicide from at least a year before, and were left staring at the decomposed corpse, we were shocked it hadn't happened sooner. Over the course of our time with Azusa, this eerie side of Japanese culture came into clearer focus. He explained to us the numerous ways its citizenry is called on to excel -- and how the subsequent feelings of inadequacy mislead and often overwhelm. It paints a sweeping and telling portrait that a sole stretch of forest, born centuries before in the wake of a volcanic eruption, could come to represent to so many the only way of escaping the ways and pressures and apparent failures of an entire nation.","The Aokigahara Forest is Japan's most popular suicide destination .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Heavy flooding has left at least 50 people dead and hundreds homeless in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province as residents continue to battle adverse weather conditions that have plagued the country since mid-December, authorities said Friday. ""We have requested the national government to declare the Eastern Cape a national disaster,"" said Provincial Minister of Social Services Pemmy Majodina. ""We are going to need billions of Rands to help residents reconstruct their homes and repair the damage caused by the floods."" Dozens were killed as homes and buildings collapsed around them as a result of the flooding, which washed away bridges and destroyed roads, she said. Authorities continue to search for at least two flood victims, Majodina said. Many rural residents in the Eastern Cape live in mud hits that are unable to withstand heavy flooding. Eighteen others have died during recent electrical storms, Majodina added. In the neighboring province of KwaZulu Natal, at least 13 people have been killed by flooding and storms.","Adverse weather has plagued the country since mid-December .

"(CNN) -- Don't underestimate the power of a spilled cup of coffee. A United Airlines flight from Chicago to Frankfurt, Germany, was diverted to Toronto this week after the pilot dumped a cup of coffee on the plane's communication's equipment. The unwanted liquid triggered a series of emergency codes, including one for a hijacking, according to Transport Canada, the agency that regulates transportation in Canada. ""With the help of their company dispatch staff, the flight crew was confirmed the problem to be a NAV(navigation)/communication issue and not a valid code 7500 (for a hijacking or unlawful interference),"" Transport Canada said on its website. Flight 940 initially was going to return to Chicago, but then diverted to Pearson International Airport in Toronto where it landed without incident around 10 p.m. Monday. United had little to say about the coffee spill that led to the diversion, and did not acknowledge that the caffeinated beverage had anything to do with it. ""Our review of the communications issue encountered on flight 940 continues, so it's too soon to comment on any particulars that led to the captain's decision to divert,"" United spokesman Rahsaan Johnson said late Tuesday. ""But important to note the crew did maintain contact with controllers, and the decision to divert to Toronto was the captain's."" The Boeing 777 had 255 passengers and crew aboard.

Edison Pena was a special guest during Elvis Presley's annual birthday celebration in Memphis, Tennessee, on Friday. Elvis would have been 76 this weekend. ""I can't describe it,"" Pena said through an interpreter. ""It's something that makes an impact on me, visually. And being able to see it myself, is like, I feel in the clouds."" The story of the miners, known simply as ""the 33"" in Chile, transfixed much of the world during their 69-day ordeal about half a mile below ground. They have been popular on the American talk show circuit since their rescue in October and have been honored by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and on the ""CNN Heroes"" show. The miners and their families toured Los Angeles in November. The entourage visited Hollywood landmarks such as the Walk of Fame stars on Hollywood Boulevard, including one belonging to Elvis Presley. It was an appropriate pilgrimage for Pena who asked for the music to be sent down into the mine during the ordeal. ""He is the king; he is the best,"" Pena, 34, said in November, as he posed for photographs beside Elvis' star on Hollywood Boulevard. ""The sweetest of dreams."" Later this month, the miners are headed to Disney World. Disney is picking up the tab for the miners, their rescuers and their immediate families during a six-night stay January 27 to February 2.

"(Mashable.com) -- John wants to share some level seven Energizing Lotion in FarmVille! How many times have you seen a similar sentence in your Facebook News Feed and either wondered what it means, or (if you're familiar with Farmville and other popular Facebook games) removed the message in disgust? Facebook is aware of the problem. While some users -- 200 million of them, revealed Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg at a Gaming Event in Palo Alto -- enjoy playing games on the service, others aren't interested. According to Facebook, users either ""love playing games or hate them,"" and the company so far didn't have ""the right tools to enable developers to grow their games while at the same time providing a great user experience for non-gamers."" Thus, Facebook has devised a plan to make games less annoying to non-users, and more engaging to gamers at the same time. The first part is relatively easy: Facebook will simply be showing application stories only to users who are already engaging with the application, meaning that people who don't play Farmville won't have to endure Farmville-related posts in their feeds. If Facebook decides you are interested in games, it will be displaying full game stories (instead of collapsed ones) in the News Feed, as well as adding prominent counts to those stories to highlight tasks that need to be completed within a game. Bookmarks will get smarter -- apps will be automatically bookmarked and reordered based on actual usage. Finally, Facebook will start notifying users when their friends start playing a game (in addition to highlighting their activity within the game). From the users' perspective, these are welcome changes, especially for non-gamers who won't be pestered by constant game-related notifications. From the game developers' end, it remains to be seen whether these improvements will alleviate the fact that gaming-related notifications will now be less aggressive than before. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Delaware authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the recent discovery of the body of a former Pentagon official in a landfill, according to a statement released Monday by the Newark, Delaware, Police Department. The Delaware medical examiner's office has ruled the death of 66-year-old John P. Wheeler a homicide. Wheeler was discovered at Wilmington's Cherry Island Landfill on December 31. Wheeler, who lived in New Castle, worked under three Republican presidents -- Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush. He served as a special assistant to the Air Force secretary from 2005 to 2008. Among other things, he also served as head of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and was the first chairman of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. A staff officer in Vietnam, Wheeler was a graduate of West Point, as well as Harvard Business School and Yale Law School. ""We are asking for the public's assistance"" in the case, Newark police spokesman Lt. Mark Farrall told CNN. ""We don't know where the crime scene occurred. The body was dumped within our jurisdiction."" Newark is about 12 miles southwest of Wilmington. Farrall noted that Wheeler's body was seen jutting out of a garbage truck at the landfill by a spotter whose job it is to ensure that hazardous material is not dumped there. Police believe Wheeler's body was most likely picked up by the truck at one of the first of ten specially designated dumpster pick-up spots before heading to the landfill. Farrall said police do not know when Wheeler was last seen. He noted that Wheeler had been scheduled to take a train from Washington to Wilmington near the time of the death, though he dismissed reports that Wheeler had actually been seen on a train. Farrall said an apparent dispute between Wheeler and a neighbor was ""one facet of the investigation."" Wheeler's attorney, Bayard Marin, told CNN that his client had been involved in a lengthy legal fight with a couple building a new home across the street in a historic district of New Castle. Wheeler had adamantly opposed the new construction. The dispute may have become contentious, but ""I can't recall a confrontation,"" Marin said. ""Everything seemed to be kept within normal bounds."" The Newark Police Department released a statement on behalf of Wheeler's family. ""As you must appreciate, this is a tragic time for the family. We are grieving our loss. Please understand that the family has no further comment at this time. We trust that everyone will respect the family's privacy,"" the family said. Veterans advocates offered statements of praise for the former official, who served in Vietnam. ""It is only fitting that we pause now and remember Jack Wheeler, who served his country honorably, then dedicated himself to ensuring that our nation's service members are always given the respect they deserve,"" said Jan Scruggs, president of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. What Wheeler ""cared about was civic values and civic virtue,"" wrote James Fallows, national correspondent for The Atlantic. ""He was a complicated man of very intense (and sometimes changeable) friendships, passions, and causes. ... I feel terrible for his family and hope they will eventually find comfort in knowing how many important things he achieved.""

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Authorities in Argentina's capital are searching for at least three people who allegedly broke into a bank through an underground tunnel, state media reported. Investigators believe the thieves entered the bank through a 30-meter (98-foot) tunnel -- replete with rugs, lighting and ventilation, the state-run Telam news agency said. ""It was truly impressive,"" prosecutor Martin Niklison told Telam. Authorities traced the tunnel to a rented business space on the same block in Buenos Aires where the bank is located. It was rented in July, Niklison said, according to Telam. The suspects broke into more than 130 safe-deposit boxes during the robbery, which occurred when the branch of Banco Provincia de Buenos Aires was closed over the New Year's holiday weekend, Telam said. Bank security cameras recorded images of the suspects leaving with money and stolen objects, the news agency reported.","Investigators find a tunnel between a bank and a nearby rented business .

"(Mashable) -- If you thought Apple would be absent from the news during CES (which it traditionally doesn't attend), you were wrong. Apple may not have any new products to show off at the moment, but the iPhone 3GS just became a lot more affordable, as AT&T cut its price to a mere $49, the Wall Street Journal reports. Right now, the price tag on the 8 GB version of the iPhone 3GS is still $99, but, starting Friday, the price will be cut in half, making the iPhone 3GS quite an attractive option for users on the lookout for an affordable smartphone. The new price tag, of course, also comes with a two-year service contract and data plan. It's a logical move for AT&T, which is expected to lose iPhone exclusivity in the U.S. soon. The phone went on sale in June 2009 for $199, but Apple cut its price to $99 last year. AT&T announced at CES that it plans to start offering 20 new smartphones this year, which should reduce its dependence on Apple's smartphone. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Arizona schools superintendent John Huppenthal has told the Tucson district to stop teaching its controversial Mexican-American studies program or face losing $15 million in annual state aid under a new law, he said Tuesday. Huppenthal told CNN he was backing this week's decision by exiting state superintendent Tom Horne giving the state's second largest district 60 days to comply with a new 2011 law banning certain ethnic studies programs in public schools. Horne is now Arizona's new attorney general, and Huppenthal was sworn in Monday as the newly elected Arizona schools superintendent. Both men are Republicans. The new schools law is the latest controversy in a state already roiled by an immigration crackdown law, known as SB 1070, that is being challenged on constitutional grounds in federal court. The Arizona-Mexico border is considered the nation's busiest for illegal immigration. Tucson school board member Adelita Grijalva charged that the new law provided no due process and was unconstitutional. She said the new law was part of an anti-immigrant political climate in the Arizona statehouse. She and Huppenthal said they expected this new law to also end up in court. ""People of color in the state of Arizona are under attack,"" Grijalva told CNN. ""We're basically going from one battle to the next."" The law authorizes the state superintendent to stop any ethnic studies classes that promote the overthrow of the U.S. government, promote resentment toward a race or class of people, are designed primarily for pupils of a particular ethnic group or advocate ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of pupils as individuals. In written findings Monday, Horne said the Tucson program violated all four criteria. Huppenthal said the Tucson program is ""in clear violation"" of the new law because they're designed for pupils of a particular ethnic group. Tucson educators who have challenged the constitutionality of the new law in court have defended the Mexican-American studies program as no different than African-American or Native American studies classes. Added Grijalva: ""What we're doing is teaching a course that is a history course with a Mexican-American perspective. I don't understand what is so scary about that concept."" Huppenthal, who was a state legislator for 18 years and was the chairman of the Arizona Senate education committee, said he was serious about enforcing a $15 million-a-year penalty that both sides agree would devastate Tucson schools, if the district doesn't end the ethnic studies program. That penalty is 10 percent of the state's aid to the Tucson system, whose total operating budget is $450 million a year, officials said. ""Make no doubt about it. They shouldn't be under any illusion on this thing,"" Huppenthal told CNN. ""We're going to proceed forward. These are serious issues."" The Tucson Unified School District's governing board has told the state in a letter that it ""supports"" the classes, which it says complies with the new law. ""TUSD administration supports its ethnic studies programs, and we are encouraged by the real and lasting impact that these programs provide to all TUSD students,"" the letter stated, according to the board's website. Also Monday, Tucson superintendent John Pedicone told administrators and employees that he wouldn't tolerate any student walkouts protesting the state superintendent's actions. Pedicone also encouraged principals to arrange a time in the school gym for students to ""express their view and discuss the pros and cons of the new law in a constructive manner,"" he said in a letter that was posted on the system's website. ""If a student leaves campus to participate in a protest or walkout, there will be consequences in accordance with school procedure and governing board policy,"" Pedicone said. Huppenthal said he observed one of Tucson's ethnic studies classes last year. ""When I came into a classroom, they were portraying Ben Franklin as a racist,"" Huppenthal said. ""Ben Franklin was the president of the Abolitionist Society in Pennsylvania. ... So they are vilifying Ben Franklin in this classroom, and up on the wall, they got a poster of Che Guevara, and the historical record is that he helped direct the communist death camps in Cuba by killing many dissidents. ""We just have a lot of concerns about the classes,"" Huppenthal said. Huppenthal said he was going to broaden his public discussion about the Tucson district to include how some Tucson public schools, particularly those serving low-income minority students, are among the worst in the country. He said he was planning a new accountability system measuring the performance of each school district. ""When we do our rankings and compare the data, a number of the schools in the Tucson Unified School District are among the bottom three in the nation,"" Huppenthal said. ""In their failure to serve these kids academically, we see the same failure in their response to the community concerns about these (ethnic studies) classes,"" Huppenthal added. ""I'm a fan of Ronald Reagan and he primarily relied on persuasion. I want to use the energy associated with this one issue to get the Tucson Unified School District to examine itself."" Tucson's ethnic studies program, created in 1998 and initially called ""Mexican American/Raza Studies,"" has been effective in reducing dropout rates among Latino students, as well as discipline problems, poor attendance and failure rates, teachers said. In October, 11 Tucson teachers sued the state board of education and superintendent over the new law, calling it an ""anti-Hispanic"" ban on Mexican-American studies.","A new 2011 Arizona law bans ethnic studies programs that ""advocate ethnic solidarity""

"(Oprah.com) -- On my way to interview Dr. Ethel Person, M.D., the celebrated psychoanalyst and Columbia University professor who teaches and writes about love, I took a little detour into my past. Around the corner from Person's home was the quaint old brownstone where, long ago, a handsome stranger arrived on my doorstep. He wasn't looking for love; he was looking for an apartment. My latest bad-news boyfriend had just suggested I get silicone implants; suddenly, I was ready to supplant him. The apartment hunter and I talked, we had coffee, and a year later, we got married. Where did I go right? Ethel Person can answer that. She is a dark-haired woman with warm eyes and an air of absolute confidence. If love is a battlefield, she's a five-star general. Her mission, these days, is to help people understand how love can turn their lives around -- though not necessarily in the ways they expect. ""I think romantic love is one of the great change agents,"" she says as we sit in her book-lined living room overlooking Central Park. ""We come to know ourselves in a different way when we fall in love, and whatever happens to that relationship, we are changed. We know something we didn't know before. We discover capacities that we didn't think we had. You did it,"" she tells me. ""You had a relationship that didn't work, and you changed. You said, 'Enough!'"" Oprah.com: Romance rehab . ""True,"" I answer, ""but look at all the years I wasted."" Ethel Person disagrees. ""People should not judge failed love affairs as failed experiences but as part of the growth process. Something does not have to end well for it to have been one of the most valuable experiences of a lifetime."" Try telling Cinderella that. Most people I know still cling to the idea that love has to have a happy ending. When a relationship breaks up, they feel cheated of their future. And if they've never fallen in love, they become desperately afraid they never will. ""People can love more than once,"" Person assures me. ""And love happens to people of all ages, because one's internal life changes, as well as one's opportunities. I don't see love as something that if you don't get it by the time you're 30, cross it off the list."" When you're a therapist, she says, people come to you in anguish about a love affair that's gone sour, a marriage that's gone wrong. And some people worry that they'll never be able to let go enough to love anybody: ""The reason is usually buried in their childhood, in some fear of being found wanting, or in parental disapproval. Not that the parent doesn't love the child, but that the parent doesn't see the potential beauty or the soul in a child, can't really endorse her in some way. ""People may also find it hard to love if they've been abused by their parents or were so overmonitored that they feel any relationship means being imprisoned. Or someone may have had parents who were miserably mismatched and says, 'I will never let myself be in the situation that my mother was in. To get married is to give away my autonomy, and I'm not going to do it.' So our capacity to love often depends on having a good enough childhood -- not a great one, just good enough."" Oprah.com: The biggest love myths . Can we ever undo the effects of a really disastrous childhood? (I've been married for 27 years now, and I'm still working on that one.) ""Yes, through experience, sometimes through therapy,"" Person says. ""Some people go away from home for college or a job and find out that not everybody is like the family they grew up in. What's great is that we can relearn, recondition, and see other possibilities."" Okay, but how do you preserve your hard-won sense of self and still experience the enraptured merging that most of us see as the essence of romance? ""In fact,"" says Person, ""all love has this internal dynamic between togetherness and oneness, and independence and separateness. I think that for a love affair to flourish, there have to be independent interests that can be shared, as well as interests that are the same. ""One person described it well in talking about his parents. He said they were looking out in the same direction instead of always staring into each other's eyes. Intense physical passion waxes and wanes. Once you've had it, it can always come back. But what sustains you in between is having something that interests you both enough that you can share it, talk about it, do it together."" A confession: My husband and I have had some of our biggest arguments about which video to watch. Mention the Three Stooges if you want to see my hackles rise. Oprah.com: Finding and keeping the love of your life . ""Well, you have to pick your fights,"" Person says, confessing that she herself is perfectly capable of fighting to the death over the color to paint a bedroom. ""Look, in any good relationship there have to be bursts of anger and disagreement. And in those moments, if somebody asked, 'Are you in love?' you'd say, 'Are you kidding me?' But those become part and parcel of the journey. We have the capacity to repair relationships -- it's like having a scratch that heals. In other words, our psychological makeup has built-in healing mechanisms the same way our body does. You have to have enough conviction in the strength of the bond that you can risk some disagreement. You have to be able to take a hit."" A tall order if you're already one of the walking wounded. Having grown up with parents whose fights were soul shattering, I thought relationship was a code word for pain. Giving up that preconception felt like a giant leap into the dark. It took years of dead-end love affairs (and a healthy dose of therapy) to push me over the edge. I not only had to find someone who could love me, I finally realized, I had to take the risk of loving him back. That's the kind of risk Ethel Person fully approves of. ""People are so different in their ability to let go. They need to know in the back of their minds that if it doesn't work, it's not the end of the world. If I sorrow for anyone, it's for someone who has never rolled the dice, rather than for someone who has rolled the dice and lost a hand or two."" Oprah.com: How to make love last .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Some call the Consumer Electronics Show ""Christmas for geeks."" On the eve of the largest gadget conference on earth, CNN was here in Las Vegas to figuratively shake the presents under the tree and eavesdrop on gift givers to try to figure out what will define this year's show. Many companies will be unwrapping their big-ticket items at their own news conferences on Wednesday, with still more to debut at the Las Vegas Convention Center starting Thursday. In the meantime, we put together a list of gadgets and applications that stood out from the crowd at the pre-show events on Tuesday. A Windows-Android mutant tablet-laptop . Tablets are hot, and Chinese computer maker Lenovo managed to draw crowds to its booth at CES Unveiled with one of its own. The LePad hardware is a spitting image of Apple's iPad, but the software is anything but. The touch-screen tablet runs a version of Google's Android that's been heavily retooled and not necessarily for the better. It splits the application list into two tabs: work and play. The former consists mostly of productivity software, and the later has a heavy focus on multimedia. But the LePad is rooted in Lenovo's comfort zone. The tablet acts as the screen for a IdeaPad U1 hybrid laptop running Windows 7. Users can then detach the LePad from the clamshell hardware to tote it as a touch-screen gadget. The transition from the Android software to the more desktop-centric Windows 7 can be jarringly slow. But this is a prototype. The final version will be available in China first and in other countries later. The LePad was one of the only tablets we got to touch on Tuesday, but expect plenty more in the next couple of days. We've already had sightings of some from Motorola Mobility and Vizio. A blood pressure reader that tweets . Withings is in the business of connecting unexpected stuff to the internet. Its break-out product, a Wi-Fi-enabled bathroom scale, lets people post their current weight directly to Twitter and Facebook. On Tuesday, the company announced a smartphone-connected blood pressure monitor that transfers home blood pressure readings onto the iPhone. Users then can send that data to a doctor, personal trainer and friends on social networks. The app charts a person's blood pressure over time, giving doctors more-granular data about a patient's health and letting the product's users watch these changes, too. The effects of stress, eating and exercise on a person's health start to materialize in the app's charts, letting users see otherwise invisible connections, said Withings CEO Cédric Hutchings. This became apparent as Hutchings demonstrated the device during a pre-CES event for the media. His blood pressure at this high-stress event: 119/78. The day before: only 100/66. The Smart Blood Pressure Monitor will be available at the end of the month and is expected to cost $129. Ski goggles that shoot HD video . Making a home movie of a ski trip used to be a dangerous endeavor -- one that requires skiers to hold a camcorder in a mitten while looking through a tiny camera viewfinder and careening down the hill. While it's not the safest of practices, some new products are making this high-speed art more practical. A new pair of ski goggles from Liquid Image is equipped with a high-def video camera between the eyes. Click one button on the side of the lenses to turn the camera on. Click another to start shooting. A tiny blue light inside the goggles tells you it's working. ""I can see it's recording, but it's not going to distract me,"" Christina Groff said as she demonstrated that feature on Tuesday. ""So I'm not going to get distracted and run into a tree or something."" The ski and snowboard goggles are expected to sell for $250 to $400 (you get 1080p resolution at the top of that range) and will hit stores later in January. An app for TV socializing . Software generally isn't a hot commodity at CES. But we found a bunch of app developers showing their wares at the pre-show events. One standout is called Yap.tv. The iPad app is a self-contained social network for television junkies. Plenty of apps are targeting TV fans, including Miso and GetGlue. With Yap.tv, in addition tying into personalized Facebook and Twitter feeds, it has functions for text-chatting with friends during a show and a very attractive channel guide. For the TV obsessive, trying to talk shows on more generalized social networks -- like Facebook and Twitter which are sometimes called ""horizontal"" networks -- can be a challenge. ""Horizontal really bothers me,"" Yap.tv co-founder Shawn Cunningham told CNN on Tuesday. ""They're vacuous."" Adding to Yap.tv's iPad app, the company released a version for iPhone last week, with a revamped website and Android app on the way. A small speaker that likes to lay flat . Tiny speakers usually lack one quality: rich bass sounds. WOWee ONE speakers aim to address this shortfall by turning their surroundings into musical instruments. Set the company's iPhone-sized speaker on a desk, coffee table or even a surfboard and it transfers sound waves into that material -- creating an on-the-fly subwoofer. Scott Friedman, CEO of SoulR Products, which makes the speakers, demonstrated the concept on Tuesday by playing a bass-guitar-heavy section of ""House of the Rising Sun."" It sounded tinny and small until he set the device down on a table. Then you could feel deeper vibrations. He proceeded to stick the gadget on all sorts of surfaces -- glass, metal, rock, an elevator wall -- like a doctor with a stethoscope. Each gave a different tone. ""A surf board's great"" as a subwoofer, he said, ""but a skateboard isn't so great because there are layers of wood with glue in the middle."" A special gel inside the speaker transfers the sound smoothly, he said. WOWee speakers, which connect to any gadget with a headphone jack, sell for about $80 to $90. A thinner version of the product is coming out soon, Friedman said.","Several companies gave sneak peeks at wares they'll be showing off at CES .
More goodies will show up in the next few days once CES kicks off .
In the meantime, we got to play with tweeting appliances and camera-equipped goggles ."
"New York (CNN) -- Officials in New York said Tuesday they are looking into what happened to cleanup efforts during last week's monster blizzard. The New York City Department of Sanitation has drawn sharp criticism since the storm that blanketed much of the Northeast. Workers there have been accused of deliberately slowing down the response in retaliation for the city's belt-tightening measures. New York City Councilman Dan Halloran said three sanitation workers and two Department of Transportation supervisors came to his office saying their bosses ordered the slowdown, telling workers that ""the mayor will see how much he needs us"" and ""there will be plenty of overtime."" ""This office is reviewing information provided to it by City Councilman Dan Halloran, among others, with respect to last week's snowstorm and the City's response thereto. In addition, we have been in contact with the City's Department of Investigation,"" Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said in a statement. He added that his office has not yet reached a decision as to whether a formal investigation is warranted. Sanitation Commissioner John Doherty has said he had not seen evidence of a worker protest. Similarly, the head of New York's sanitation workers union, Harry Nespoli, has said he was not aware of any slowdown and doubted there was a protest by workers. Department of Investigation Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn said her office was looking into reports of wrongdoing and asked anyone with information to step forward. ""DOI is continuing its multi-borough investigation into whether there is any evidence of intentional acts of commission or omission related to the snow clean up and has been conducting its investigation since last week,"" the department said in a statement Tuesday. ""As we always do, we will provide our factual findings when we have concluded. In addition, we have heard from various prosecutors' offices and if we find a violation of state or federal law will work closely with the appropriate agency,"" it continued. Authorities in Brooklyn also said they would review what happened with respect to snow removal last week. Robert Nardoza, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office Eastern District of New York, declined to say if officials there would pursue a criminal investigation related to the response. CNN's Jordana Ossad contributed to this report.","Authorities in Queens and Brooklyn are reviewing snow removal after blizzard .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A task force made up of local and federal law enforcement agencies is actively pursuing leads into the 1997 slaying of hip hop artist Christopher Wallace, better known as Biggie Smalls or Notorious B.I.G., according to two sources familiar with the investigation. According to one law enforcement source, the investigation into the 13-year-old unsolved case was ""reinvigorated"" months ago as a result of new information, but the source would not elaborate further because of the ongoing investigation that includes the Los Angeles Police Department, L.A. County District Attorney's Office and the FBI. On March 9, 1997, Wallace, 24, was shot and killed while riding in a Suburban that was driving away from a music industry party at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. Los Angeles police said a lone gunman in a Chevy Impala pulled alongside the Suburban and opened fire on Wallace, who was in the passenger seat. Witnesses described the suspect as being an African-American man wearing a suit and bow tie. The main theory behind shooting was payback in a so-called rap war between East and West Coast hip hop artists and their record companies- Bad Boy Entertainment in New York, which represented Wallace, and Death Row Records, headed by Marion ""Suge"" Knight, in Los Angeles. Six months earlier in Las Vegas, a gunman opened fire on a car driven by Knight, killing one of his top artists Tupac Shakur. That murder remains unsolved also. ""East Coast was Biggie, West Coast was Tupac,"" Wallace's mother Voletta Wallace told a filmmaker in the 2002 documentary ""Biggie and Tupac."" ""Come on now, you're messing with lives here and that's exactly what happened. Two lives were lost as a result of what? Stupidity?"" Voletta Wallace told the filmmaker. Retired Los Angeles Police Detective Russell Poole, who worked on the Wallace case, told CNN that he believes Knight was behind the murder, even though the Death Row Records' boss was serving time on a probation violation at the time. ""Suge Knight ordered the hit,"" Poole said, adding that he believes it was arranged by Reggie Wright Jr., who headed security for Death Row Records. Reggie Wright Jr. told CNN he had nothing to do with the murder, and Knight has repeatedly said he had nothing to do with the crime. Poole said he retired early from the LAPD, in part, because he was thwarted in following leads in the Wallace case involving police officers, some of whom worked off-duty for Death Row Records. ""I think I was getting too close to the truth,"" Poole said. ""I think they feared that the truth would be a scandal."" One of the officers Poole said was involved is David Mack, who was sent to prison for robbing a bank in 1997, the same year Wallace was killed. Poole said Mack owned the same type of car driven by the gunman who shot Wallace, and Poole said a friend of Mack's resembles a police sketch of the shooter. CNN was unable to reach Mack for comment, but when allegations of his involvement in Wallace' slaying originally surfaced more than a decade ago, his criminal defense attorney Donald Re called the claims ridiculous. Poole also assisted Wallace's family in their wrongful death lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department alleging a cover-up in the investigation. Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks was the chief of police when Poole was investigating, and he told CNN the accusations about a police cover-up are ""absurd."" ""We would have never ignored a lead that could have helped us solve that murder,"" Parks said. Perry Sanders, Voletta Wallace's attorney, told CNN the family's lawsuit, which was originally filed in 2002, was put on hold in April after Los Angeles police said turning over evidence from the case would interfere with a beefed up investigation. Mack was released from federal prison on May 14. Watch Anderson Cooper 360° weeknights 10pm ET. For the latest from AC360° click here.","Christopher Wallace was shot and killed in 1997 .

McVay was apparently killed by a single gunshot wound to the head, Zimmerly said in a statement on Monday. She was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency personnel. McVay's son was later brought into custody after he allegedly asked a neighbor for help, telling the neighbor that he had just shot his mother, the statement said. Defense attorney Andrew Hyde said he entered a denial that the boy purposely killed his mother, allowing him time to investigate the incident. ""He is very emotional at this time,"" Hyde said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency has not attempted to recoup some $643 million in payments that were improperly given to 160,000 individuals for housing and other aid following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, an independent government investigator says. In a letter to FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate, Inspector General Richard Skinner wrote that a federal court in 2008 ordered FEMA to change its process for recovering the money. But Monday, three years after that court ruling, ""These payments remain uncollected because your office has not given final approval of a new recoupment process,"" Skinner wrote. Following the back-to-back storms in 2005, FEMA disbursed more than $7 billion in assistance to survivors. At the time, the government placed a premium on distributing the money quickly because of the dire needs of residents of the Gulf Coast. The money was intended for rental assistance, home repairs, housing replacement, moving costs, medical costs and other individual assistance. But in the storm's wake, FEMA estimated that approximately $643 million of the payments were improper due to human error and fraud. Early efforts to recover the money were themselves flawed, and in June of 2007, a federal judge ordered FEMA to discontinue its debt collection until changes were made to the process. FEMA immediately complied, Skinner wrote, and in 2008 the agency announced that it was stopping its recoupment of improper disaster payments until it could establish new procedures. FEMA also announced it would review each case of suspected fraud to confirm the validity of the debt. But, Skinner wrote, FEMA's new recovery process has been awaiting approval by the administrator since late 2008. While FEMA has established a strategy, identified the necessary staff and initiated a review of the 160,000 cases, ""your office has not instructed the responsible parties to restart the recoupment process,"" Skinner wrote to Fugate. ""Further delay only makes aging debts more difficult to collect,"" Skinner wrote. In a statement to CNN, FEMA spokeswoman Rachel Racusen said FEMA is ""committed to being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars."" ""Not only do we agree with the Inspector General's recommendation to recoup disaster assistance payments that were improperly disbursed... but we are and have been actively working with state and local leadership and other stakeholders to finalize plans to recoup misspent funds, while continuing to support Gulf Coast communities as they recover,"" she said. ""Under our current leadership, we have worked diligently to put protections in place that will safeguard against fraud and abuse, significantly reduce the percentage of improper payments, and develop a fair, open and transparent process for recovering these payments,"" Racusen said. Racusen said she did not have a date for when Fugate would authorize collection of debts, but said, ""We are well underway in taking the steps we need to begin this new process."" In Skinner's letter to Fugate, Skinner wrote Fugate should ""promptly take action"" to recover the money. Noting that President Barack Obama signed a presidential memorandum in March of 2010 asking departments to identify and reclaim misspent funds, Skinner said Fugate should ""promptly authorize the collection of this debt,"" he wrote.","FEMA disbursed more than $7 billion in aid after hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit in 2005 .

"(CNN) -- Officials with the National Transportation Safety Board are expected to arrive Thursday morning to investigate a small plane crash that killed one person in Birmingham, Alabama.

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal recovered from a second-set whitewash to reach the quarterfinals of the Qatar Open, while his arch-rival Roger Federer also battled into the last eight on Wednesday. Nadal, who lost in the final of the season-opening event last year, needed a tie-break in the opening set against 89th-ranked Slovakian Lukas Lacko and won just 11 points in the second before sealing a 7-6 (7-3) 0-6 6-3 victory. It was only the 10th time in 575 career matches that the Spaniard suffered a ""bagel"" but he fought back to win in two hours and 19 minutes. The 24-year-old, who has been struggling with illness since beating Federer in an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last weekend, will next face Latvian fifth seed Ernests Gulbis. Was Nadal's U.S. Open win the sporting highlight of 2010? ""It was a very difficult match, but I resisted. I just made up my mind to do my best in the final set. I came back but it was very tiring for me,"" Nadal told reporters. Second seed Federer also had an early-season workout ahead of 2011's first grand slam in Australia later this month as he earlier beat fellow Swiss player Marco Chiudinelli 7-6 (7-5) 7-5. Two-time Qatar champion Federer set up a clash with Serbian sixth seed Viktor Troicki as he came back from 5-4 in the tie-break and 3-1 in the second set to win in one hour and 49 minutes. ""It was really difficult today, under the circumstances,"" Federer told the ATP Tour website. ""Playing such a good friend is so rare for me. I'm happy the match is in the past and I can look forward."" Roddick through to Brisbane quarterfinals . Third seed Jo Wilfried Tsonga continued his comeback from a knee injury as he also progressed into the quarterfinals with a 6-2 6-4 win over Ukrainian wildcard Sergei Bubka. The Frenchman will next play Spanish seventh seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, who beat the Ukraine's Illya Marchenko 6-1 6-4. Big-serving Croatian Ivo Karlovic won an epic match against German eighth seed Philipp Kohlschreiber, triumphing 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (2-7) 7-6 (7-4) to set up a quarterfinal with Russia's defending champion Nikolay Davydenko. The fourth-seeded Russian won through with a 6-4 7-5 win over Finland's Jarkko Nieminen in the day's final match. In India, top seed Tomas Berdych reached the quarterfinals of the Chennai Open with a 6-2 6-4 win over Croatia's world No. 88 Ivan Dodig on Wednesday. The 2010 Wimbledon runner-up will next face Slovenia's Blaz Kavcic, ranked 112th.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A security guard accused of assassinating the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province was banned five months ago by a provincial police official from providing security to VIP personnel, authorities said Wednesday. The director inspector general of Punjab Police said the guard had extremist views and it had been determined it was unsafe for him to guard important officials, the Pakistani president's special political adviser, Faisal Raza Abidi, told CNN. Despite the assessment, the Punjab Police employed Muhammad Mumtaz Qadri for security this week. He is accused of killing Gov. Salman Taseer on Tuesday, allegedly because the governor had spoken out against the country's controversial blasphemy law. Taseer was buried on Wednesday. He had been governor of Punjab province since May 2008. The warning signs about Qadri go back even further, said Rana Shahid Pervez, senior police official in Rawalpindi. Pakistani intelligence agencies had warned officials in 2004 not to use Qadri after they uncovered connections between him and the religious group Dawat-e-Islami -- a Sunni group that claims it has a closer connection to the Prophet Mohammed than other Muslims. Pervez said Qadri came from an area of Rawalpindi called Sadiq Abad, adjacent to the capital of Islamabad. He came from a poor family and his father is a laborer who built homes. Qadri joined the police force in 2002, and was selected for the elite force course in 2008, four years after the warning from intelligence agencies, Pervez said. Qadri was one of 468 elite force guards in the Rawalpindi Police, which randomly assigns them as escorts to VIPs and officials like Taseer. Qadri was assigned to the governor on Tuesday. He had been his security guard many times before the shooting, according to Pervez, who disputed the reported link to Dawat-e-Islami. Qadri ""killed the governor totally from his own beliefs regarding Mohammed, and no group was behind him,"" Pervez said. The shooting occurred at a market in Islamabad. Qadri confessed to assassinating Taseer because ""he did blasphemy of the Prophet Mohammed,"" Naeem Iqbal, spokesman for Islamabad police, said Tuesday. Qadri told police Taseer had described the blasphemy law as ""the black laws."" The blasphemy law makes it a crime punishable by death to insult Islam, the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed. After the shooting, Qadri immediately surrendered to authorities, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported, citing Malik. Taseer was leaving the market when he was shot. The APP said he had had lunch with a friend at a cafe in the market. Earlier, Iqbal had said Taseer had gone into the market to make some purchases. He was taken to a hospital after the shooting, but died, apparently from blood loss, officials said. However, Dr. Sharif Astori, spokesman for Poly Clinic Hospital, told CNN Taseer was ""already dead when he was brought into the hospital."" Astori said doctors accounted for 26 bullets in his body. Most of the fatal wounds were to his chest, face, neck and legs, he said. Some bullets passed completely through his body. A spotlight was put on Pakistan's controversial law in November when a Christian woman, Asia Bibi of Punjab province, was sentenced to death for blasphemy. A court found the 45-year-old woman guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with fellow Muslim field workers. An investigation by a Pakistani government ministry found the charges against Bibi stemmed from ""religious and personal enmity"" and recommended she be released. The government also said it would review the law. Taseer said he would like to see the law ""changed in such a way that it just basically says, if you insult any prophet, no matter who he is, that's a criminal offense, but certainly not punishable by death."" Reaction to Taseer's death was swift. Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani said in a statement he ""strongly condemned"" the incident. The Pakistan People's Party, the nation's ruling party, said it would observe two weeks of mourning over Taseer's death, according to GEO TV Pakistan. ""I am shocked to hear of the assassination of Salman Taseer,"" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. ""His death will be a loss to the leadership of Pakistan.""

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A leaked video is circulating in cyberspace, showing a boat collision that sparked a recent diplomatic battle between China and Japan. The YouTube video shows the same collision that Japanese lawmakers watched on video last week, said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan. The Japanese Coast Guard shot the video, which is authentic and not doctored, said Kawauchi, who is a member of the House of Representatives in the Diet, Japan's legislature. ""The fact that the video was leaked is a big mistake for the government,"" he added. ""It is totally different from presenting it to the public in an official manner, and it leads the people's further erosion of faith in Japan's government."" In September, Japan detained the crew of a Chinese fishing boat off disputed islands in the East China Sea. China calls the islands the Diaoyu; Japan calls them the Senkaku. In response to the detainments, China made increasingly aggressive diplomatic threats. Beijing also halted ministerial-level talks with Tokyo, and both sides canceled trips to each other's nations. Japan has since released the fishing crew, who China says were stopped illegally. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. But authorities later said that releasing him was in the interest of maintaining relations with China. The crash video that Japanese lawmakers saw has not been released to the public. The video, posted on YouTube, shows what is thought to be the Chinese fishing trawler ramming into a ship, thought to be a Japanese Coast Guard vessel. The Chinese government dismissed the video after Japanese lawmakers saw it, saying it had been edited and that it did not change the ownership of the islands. On Friday, China's Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs Cui Tiankai said: ""I think the China-Japanese relationship has to overcome the current difficulties and move forward. This will serve the fundamental interests of both countries. So [we] hope [the] Japanese side will do everything possible to make sure that there's no further disruptions of the relationship."" The Chinese Embassy in Tokyo has contacted the office of Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan about the leaked video, making an ""official inquiry,"" Kan's office said. No official protest was lodged. Kan's office is investigating the leaking of the video, which has been shown on Japanese television. The man apparently doing the videotaping says on the video that the date is September 7, 2010. That matches the detaining of the fishing crew. The man also says on the video, in Japanese: ""We've ordered them to stop, in Chinese language, but they didn't stop."" As the Chinese boat approaches, shouting is heard in Japanese. Unidentified voices shout: ""Stop,stop!"" CNN's Jo Ling Kent contributed to this report.","The YouTube video is authentic and not doctored, a Japanese legislator says .

"(Mashable)  -- In an update to one of the more iconic ""year-end"" magazine editions, People has launched a ""Sexiest Man Alive on Facebook"" campaign to complement its ""Sexiest Man Alive"" issue, which hits newsstands later this month. For the campaign, People has chosen five celebs that aren't just ""sexy"" (as defined by the editors, we presume), but also have a big presence in social media. Notably, the Old Spice guy is on the list, as well as Vin Diesel (who we've long noted is disproportionately popular on Facebook) and NFL social media super user Chad Ochocinco. Enrique Iglesias and ""Jersey Shore's"" Pauly D round out the five celebrities that People's Facebook fans can vote for through November 10.

"Washington (CNN) -- On Friday, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry said the Senate is prepared to vote on a nuclear arms treaty with Russia. ""We are certainly prepared to move for a vote,"" he said on the Senate floor. ""I want to emphasize that there are no amendments from colleagues on the Democratic side. We are prepared to vote on this treaty ... We will take any amendment at any time."" Sen. Richard Lugar, the ranking Republican on the committee, added that the Senate needs to get some sort of an amendment or ""perhaps move to close off debate and have our last 30 hours."" Under Senate rules, 30 hours of debate are needed before taking up a vote. All it takes, though, is one senator to use the full 30 hours. The treaty would resume mutual inspections of U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals while limiting both nations to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers each. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said he believes they will get the 67 votes needed to pass the treaty ratification. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also weighed in, saying there is ""nothing more important than the START treaty."" He is confident the Senate will move quickly through debating the treaty, but it all depends on his colleagues across the aisle. Some Senate Republicans have opposed bringing the measure up with so little time left in the lame-duck session. Opening debate on the measure was stalled Thursday night when the chamber moved on to other issues. Senate Democrats were trying to make progress on considering the treaty despite a Republican threat to block any legislation brought up before the Senate acts on a measure authorizing continued government spending. On Wednesday, senators voted 66-32 to take up the treaty. The treaty cleared the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in September and has been endorsed by leading Republican figures, including former President George H.W. Bush and Lugar of Indiana. Republicans had pledged to block consideration of any other legislative items until passage of both the spending measure and a tax package negotiated by the White House and congressional Republicans. The current resolution authorizing government spending runs out Saturday, requiring congressional approval of a new one to cover the rest of the fiscal year. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, told reporters Wednesday that a rushed schedule to debate the treaty would prevent Republican senators from being able to offer substantive amendments that require serious debate. He expressed ""great frustration and disappointment"" with what he called the refusal of Reid and Senate Democrats to put off the debate until there is time to do it properly in the new Congress that convenes in early January. However, Senate Democrats said Kyl and Republicans have been given plenty of opportunities to discuss and influence the treaty, and now must show that they truly want it to go forward instead of continuing to delay it. Ratification requires support from two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 votes. Democrats currently control 58 seats and need nine Republicans for ratification. In the new congressional session, the Democrats will have only 53 seats and would need 14 Republican votes to ratify the treaty. CNN's Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Ed Hornick, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry says they are prepared to vote .

"Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic (CNN) -- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon said Monday the shooting death of a 25-year-old man over the weekend was an accident. ""In truth that young man was my friend, like a brother,"" he said of Michael Esteban Castillo.  ""It wasn't a thing like we began arguing and I started shooting.  It was some accident; it happened by accident,"" Simon said, speaking at the police station where he turned himself in.  ""That's why I came here -- to open my soul,"" he said. Simon surrendered to Dominican National Police early Monday morning to face murder charges.  Simon is also accused of wounding Castillo's 17-year-old brother, Starlin. The injuries to the brother are not life-threatening, police said. Simon's attorney said the major league baseball player had fired his gun into the air. Puerto Plata District Attorney Victor Mieses said Monday that he will seek three months of incarceration against Simon and widen the investigation. Puerto Plata Assistant District Attorney Juan Carlos Hernandez, who is handling the case, said of Simon, ""So far he's the one.  There's no doubt about the incident.""  Hernandez added that it's ""normal"" to seek temporary incarceration when there's a shooting death. Police spokesman Maximo Baez said Simon turned in his gun as part of the investigation into the shooting in the Los Salados section of the town of Luperon, in the province of Puerto Plata, early Saturday. Simon was accompanied by his attorney, Carlos Olivares, and by fellow Oriole Julio Lugo, Baez said. ""The projectile's trajectory was only up into the air, so much so that he left,"" Olivares said of his client.  ""He understood that nothing had happened at the moment.  And 45 minutes later, when he was eating at a some restaurant or discotheque, somebody tells him, 'Hey, you're the one who killed so-and-so.'"" Lugo said, ""We're concerned about his career or whether he's going to have to go to jail.  We don't know if it was him.  He wants to clear up what happened, but no one really knows if it was him for sure."" Simon was scheduled to appear at the courthouse in Puerto Plata for arraignment Monday, Baez said. Simon, 29, hails from Santiago. He joined the Orioles in 2008. The Baltimore Orioles declined comment.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The 22-year-old man under arrest in Saturday's massacre in Arizona railed against government ""mind control"" and illiteracy in online missives and had ""kind of a troubled past,"" as the local sheriff put it. ""There's reason to believe this individual may have a mental issue,"" Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik told reporters Saturday night. An Arizona law enforcement source and a U.S. law enforcement source have identified the suspect as Jared Lee Loughner, a 22-year-old former community college student. He was taken into custody after the massacre at a Tucson supermarket that killed a federal judge, a 9-year-old girl and four others and seriously wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who was hosting a meeting with constituents at the Safeway. ""Good-bye friends,"" read a Saturday morning posting on Loughner's MySpace page, just hours before the shooting. ""Dear friends ... Please don't be mad at me. The literacy rate is below 5%. I haven't talked to one person who is literate."" And a December 30 posting read, ""Dear Reader ... I'm searching. Today! With every concern, my shot is now ready for aim. The hunt, a mighty thought of mine."" Dupnik told reporters that the suspect had ""kind of a troubled past"" that included brushes wtih the law. Though he provided no details, he said, ""We understand that there have been law enforcement contacts with the individual where he made threats."" Online, Loughner complained about the ""second Constitution,"" a term legal scholars sometimes use to describe the post-Civil War amendments that ended slavery, extended the right to vote and required equal protection under the law. Its meaning to Loughner could not be clearly discerned. ""In conclusion, reading the second United States constitution I can't trust the current government because of the ratifications: the government is implying mind control and brainwash on the people by controlling grammar,"" he wrote in a Decmber 15 video message on YouTube. ""No! I won't pay debt with a currency that's not backed by gold and silver! No! I wont trust in God!"" And in an apparent reference to Giffords' congressional district, he wrote, ""The majority of people, who reside in District-8 are illiterate -- hilarious."" On his YouTube page, a list of his favorite books included both ""Mein Kampf"" and the ""Communist Manifesto,"" along with works by George Orwell, Ray Bradbury, Ken Kesey, Herman Hesse, Ernest Hemingway, Plato and Aesop's Fables. But while the writer complained frequently about poor grammar and illiteracy, he wrote on MySpace on December 26 that he wouldn't correct his own errors. ""I think the CIA watches my-space,"" he added. Loughner dropped out of high school in 2006, after his junior year, said Tamara Crawley, a spokeswoman for the Marana United School District in suburban Tucson. Court records indicate he had been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia in 2007, but the charge was dismissed. In 2008, he tried to enlist in the U.S. Army. The Army rejected him, and privacy laws keep the military from disclosing the reason, the service said in a statement to CNN. He also enrolled at Aztec Middle College, a partnership between Tucson schools and Pima Community College that helps high school dropouts transition to community colleges, PCC President Sylvia Lee told CNN. He took classes at the college from 2005 until October 2010, when withdrew after five contacts with police ""for classroom and library disruptions"" at two campuses between February and September, the school said in a statement issued Saturday night. Loughner was suspended after authorities found a YouTube video in which he called the school ""illegal according to the U.S. Constitution, and makes other claims,"" the PCC statement said. He quit during an October 4 meeting with his parents and school administrators, and a follow-up letter warned that to return, he had to present a doctor's note stating that ""his presence at the College does not present a danger to himself or others."" CNN's Emily Smith, Barbara Starr, Thelma Gutierrez and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","""Good-bye friends,"" was posted Saturday morning on the suspect's MySpace page .

"London (CNN) -- Singer Gerry Rafferty, famous for the 1970s hits ""Baker Street"" and ""Stuck in the Middle With You,"" has died, his agent said Wednesday. He was 63. A cause of death was not given. Rafferty was born in 1947 in Paisley, Scotland, near Glasgow, the son of an Irish-born miner, according to Michael Gray, his manager in the late 1970s. Gray wrote Rafferty's obituary Wednesday in The Guardian newspaper. He was an ""unwanted third son"" whose mother would take him out of the house on Saturday nights when his father would come home drunk, Gray said. The father died when Rafferty was 16. That same year, Rafferty started work at a butcher's shop and the tax office, playing music on the weekends with a school friend in a band called the Mavericks, Gray said. Rafferty later joined another band, the Humblebums, with comedian Billy Connolly, Gray said. It was in the 1970s, however, that Rafferty had his heyday. He was a member of the soft-rock group Stealers Wheel when they recorded ""Stuck in the Middle With You,"" an upbeat song that did well on the U.S. charts. The song became a hit for a second time in 1992 after director Quentin Tarantino used it in his movie ""Reservoir Dogs."" Stealers Wheel fell apart in 1975, and that's when Rafferty embarked on the solo career that would make him famous. He recorded the demos for the 1978 album ""City to City"" in his wife's parents' house using a four-track machine, playing every instrument himself, Gray wrote. The saxophone-fueled ""Baker Street"" drove sales of the album, which sold 5 million copies and made Rafferty an overnight millionaire, Gray wrote. In ""Baker Street,"" Rafferty sang about disillusionment in the big city, describing a man's failed search for his dreams. The city has ""got no soul,"" he sang. ""It's taken you so long to find out you were wrong/When you thought it held everything."" The song ends with hope, however, with Rafferty ultimately singing about a ""new morning"" and that the man is going home. The follow-up album, 1979's Night Owl, included the hits ""Days Gone Down,"" ""Get it Right Next Time,"" and the title track. Gray called the songs ""gorgeously produced works of Gerry's prime."" Wrote Gray, ""The voice, redolent of both Lennon's and McCartney's, yet unmistakably his own; the music, a shimmering delta of sound; the songs, romantic yet pushily sardonic -- all came to fruition thanks to Gerry's gift of perfect pitch and an obdurate determination to stick to his guns."" iReporter: ""Rock N Roll heaven has a new member"" The following years saw a few more albums and a job producing the Proclaimers' 1987 hit ""Letter from America."" His sales and standards declined, however, and he ""spiralled into alcoholism,"" putting on weight and alienating his longtime wife, Carla, Gray said. She finally left in 1990 but the two remained in touch, Gray said. In August of 2008, Rafferty hit the tabloids after a ""five-day binge at a five-star London hotel"" led management to admit him to a hospital. He retreated to Dorset, England, where he was ""relatively well"" but ultimately sapped of talent. ""For two decades,"" wrote Gray, ""alcohol had dominated this creative and intelligent man's life.""","Rafferty had a hit in the 1970s with ""Baker Street""

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Moments after returning from visiting Rep. Gabrielle Giffords at the hospital, the congresswoman's six-time campaign chairman said Sunday that he is confident that she will survive, though the extent of her recovery remained unclear. ""The doctors are pretty clear that we just have to wait and see,"" Mike McNulty told CNN in an exclusive interview. The impact on Giffords' family has been huge, he said. Asked how her husband, astronuat Mark Kelly, was faring, McNulty said, ""He is a Navy combat fighter and he can take about anything, but this is a terrible experience."" Asked about Giffords' ability to survive a 9mm slug to the head, McNulty said, ""I can only think that God has more important things planned for her in the future."" Even as he acknowledged that the motive for the shooting remains unknown, McNulty faulted Giffords' opponents in last year's elections for stirring up emotions in the campaign to an unacceptable level. ""There were rallies around her office that seemed designed to intimidate her staff, which simply doesn't seem very American to me,"" he said, though he added that he never felt threatened. The rallies were organized by members of the Tea Party around Giffords' support for President Barack Obama's health care bill, he said. ""There was a level of vituperation that no one has ever seen, and there was, you know, the famous incident of people showing up with handguns and losing control of handguns that just fall in the street and brandishing handguns."" He added, ""That's where the Tea Party, I think, went over the edge. They thought it was fun to talk about using your firearms to solve political problems, and I don't think that's fun."" Tea Party advocates have condemned Saturday's shootings. ""These heinous crimes have no place in America, and they are especially grievous when committed against our elected officials,"" said Amy Kremer, chairman of the Tea Party Express. ""Spirited debate is desirable in our country, but it only should be the clash of ideas. An attack on anyone for political purposes, if that was a factor in this shooting, is an attack on the democratic process. We join with everyone in vociferously condemning it."" McNulty credited Giffords with having a special ability to work from the center with all sides in politics, a strength that served the Democrat well in an overwhelmingly Republican state. ""If you look at the demographics, you would not think that she could get elected,"" he said. ""The way she inspires people reminds me a little bit of when I worked for Mo Udall (the former Democratic Arizona congressman) and the people that worked for Ted Kennedy (the late Democratic senator from Massachusetts) -- people who would walk through a wall for the people they believed in. But, unlike them, she doesn't inspire by leading from one of the fringes.

"(CNN) -- At least three people have been killed and 300 others injured in riots that erupted across Algeria amid rising food prices and a housing crisis, according to state-run media. The protests began last week over spiraling costs of basic food items, including milk, oil and sugar. Some staples are subsidized by the government. To curb the escalating prices of sugar and oil, the government slashed duties for sugar and oil by 41%, Algerie Press Service reported Sunday. The suspension and exemption from customs duties and taxes until August 31, according to APS. Meanwhile, the government reports a third person has died from the rioting: ""I can confirm the deaths of three young people in M'sila, Tipasa and Boumerdes,"" Interior Minister Daho Ould Kablia told the television channel Canal Algerie, according to APS. ""In the first two provinces, the dead corpses were found during the riots. Investigations are underway to determine the causes."" The third person was found burned in a hotel set on fire by the rioters, he added. Similar protests, some violent, have erupted in neighboring Tunisia, where at least four people have died. Human rights groups have said the Tunisian government has cracked down on demonstrators with force. Reporters Without Borders condemned the arrests and disappearances of bloggers and online activists across a number of Tunisian cities. The worldwide press freedom organization said police arrested the bloggers to question them about hacking into government websites. One of those arrested was Hamadi Kaloutcha, who who has not been heard from since his arrest at 6 a.m. Friday, the group said. U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley has said Washington was monitoring the situation in both countries. The Tunisian ambassador was summoned to the State Department. He said the United States was also concerned about the reports of cyber intrusion and was urging everyone -- from the government to activists -- to respect freedom of expression. Crowley said it was ""difficult"" to say whether the protests in Tunisia were related to those in Algeria. ""We're not going to say that there's kind of an overlapping dynamic across the two countries,"" he said. ""But we continue to review this and both engage the government in Algeria and as well as look after the safety of our own citizens."" Adding fuel to the protesters' anger are the high rates of unemployment and housing issues, socio-economic problems that have been festering for some time in Algeria. The government has blamed the rising prices and other issues on the global economic crisis.","State-run media: The Algerian government reduces duties on sugar and oil .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid went down to a 2-0 second leg defeat to Levante, but still eased into the quarterfinals of the Spanish Cup, 8-2 on aggregate. Levante's two second-half goals by Xisco Nadal and Sergio Gonzalez were not enough to overturn Real's massive first leg advantage, but it was a boost for the Valencia-based side after an 8-0 first leg rout in the Bernabeu. Last season's runners-up Atletico Madrid, who took a 1-0 lead to Espanyol, are also through after a 1-1 away draw. But Real Betis put out top-flight Getafe with a 3-1 win that wiped the Madrid's club's 2-1 advantage from last month's first leg. The Seville-based side are now the only lower-tier club left in the competition. Jorge Molina and a double from Ruben Castrol were enough for Betis with  Getafe substitute Francisco Casquero scoring his side's only goal as they lost 4-3 on aggregate. ""They were much better than us. We have been humbled,""  Getafe coach Michel Gonzalez told AFP.

AAA recommends motorists pack a winter driving kit made up of the following: a bag of abrasive material (sand, salt or cat litter), a snow shovel and brush, traction mats, an ice scraper, booster cables, a flashlight, window washing liquid, cloth, warning flares or triangles, a cell phone, gloves and a blanket. Try to ease your vehicle out of parking spaces without spinning the wheels. Drive back and forth for several feet in either direction to clear a path. Spread sand or salt near the wheels if additional traction is needed. If you do get stuck, you can contact AAA via phone, iPhone app or at AAA.com. De-ice vehicles before driving, urges the Mississippi Department of Transportation. Iced-over vehicles can limit driver visibility, and ice flying off cars can be hazardous to fellow drivers. If you have to drive in conditions with low visibility, go slowly, with your headlights on low beam, AAA advises. Allow at least double the usual following distance between cars. Never use cruise control on a slick surface. Steering around an obstruction is often safer than braking suddenly at speeds above 25 mph on a slippery surface, according to AAA's pamphlet ""How to Go on Ice and Snow"" (PDF). When you do brake, don't remove your foot from the brake or pump the pedal if you have antilock brakes, AAA advises. Drivers of cars that don't have antilock brakes should keep their heel on the floor and apply firm pressure to the brake pedal to the threshold of locking. In case of skidding, steer in the direction you want the front of the car to go, keeping your eyes on your travel path. And don't slam on the brakes; you're likely to make it harder to get back in control.","Georgia officials urging drivers to avoid travel until at least Tuesday .

"Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- The loser and the winner of Guinea's disputed presidential runoff election have both filed court complaints alleging fraud, party officials told CNN on Saturday. In a press conference Saturday in Conakry, European Union officials called the election credible and transparent. Still, weeks after voters went to the polls, the campaign continues to stir discord and, in some cases, violence in the west African nation. Guinea held its much-delayed presidential runoff election between two candidates, Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde, on November 7. Provisional results issued November 15 by the electoral commission declared Conde the winner with 52.5 percent of the overall vote. The African nation's Supreme Court must now look at fraud allegations put forth by both Diallo and Conde, and will finalize the results by December 2. And the candidates also have voiced their disputes with authorities outside Guinea. As of Saturday, Diallo had filed dozens of official complaints with the Supreme Court, while Conde had filed three fraud complaints. This comes after three days of clashes between Diallo partisans and supporters of Conde and security officials in multiple cities around the country. At least nine people have died and dozens more were injured. Diallo also plans to file a complaint with the International Criminal Court for alleged abuses in the post-election violence. The Guinean government has declared a national state of emergency and a curfew restricting movement of people from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., but residents of ethnic Peul neighborhoods in the Conakry suburbs of Enco5, Bambeto, Hamdallaye and Cosa said that security forces entered the homes of civilians and shot at innocent people before and after the curfew was called. Amnesty International, the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights and the International Crisis Group have all detailed what they say are examples of arbitrary arrests, excessive force, incitement of ethnic hatred and killings by Guinean security officials. Diallo's UFDG party (the French acronym for the Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea), has said that the government backed a bloody repression by security forces against its supporters, who are largely from the Peul ethnic group. On Saturday, Oury Bah, UFDG's vice president, told CNN that the party would make an official complaint to the International Criminal Court. ""There have been cases of [security forces] raping women, shooting at unarmed persons and inciting [ethnic] hatred,"" Bah told CNN on Saturday. Guinea's prime minister, Jean-Marie Dore, denied UFDG's accusations on national TV recently, saying that Diallo's supporters were responsible for the violence. If necessary, ""we will ask the ICC to prosecute those who put people in the streets,"" Dore said, referring to Diallo's supporters. In addition to accusing Diallo of inciting violence, Dore singled out journalist Mouctar Bah (no relation to Oury Bah) of French radio RFI for calling the government repression of post-election protesters ""bloody."" ""What he said was a violation of the law because he cannot show a pool of blood in any Conakry neighborhood,"" Dore said. Mouctar Bah told CNN that the prime minister's comments put him in a dangerous position. ""I'm scared for my personal security ... if a prime minister talks about you, attacks you on television, he is leaving you vulnerable to extremists, to police, to the army and to political officials ... I don't have any confidence in the government,"" Bah told CNN. The ICC, based in The Hague, Netherlands, opened its file on Guinea after the September 28, 2009, massacre in Conakry, when security forces killed more than 150 peaceful protesters and injured more than 1,000, according to Human Rights Watch. The Guinean government said about 50 protesters died and that they were acting violently. Fatou Bensouda, deputy prosecutor for the ICC, visited Conakry on November 19, when she released a statement saying, ""The Office of the Prosecutor is keeping a close eye on the situation in Guinea and deplores that at least seven persons have been reportedly killed since the announcement of the election results."" ""All reported acts of violence will be closely scrutinized by the office in order to determine whether crimes have been committed that fall under the Court's jurisdiction and should warrant an investigation."" Guinea is still waiting for the Supreme Court to validate provisional results. It must review charges of fraud from both Diallo's and Conde's parties. Despite the provisional results, Diallo's party is confident that it will emerge as winner. ""We have given the Supreme Court a document 50 centimeters (20 inches) wide with proof of fraud according to what the law demands. We are sure that with that, a dignified official will see that there has been fraud and the results will give El Hadj Cellou the victory,"" Oury Bah said. Guinea has been ruled by a military junta, led by Gen. Sekouba Konate, since the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008. The presidential election is meant to complete the transition from military to civilian rule. Despite immense mineral wealth, Guinea is one of the poorest countries in Africa.","Both the losing and winning candidates have filed complaints .

"(CNN) -- NATO officials said Monday they have sent a team to investigate an incident in central Afghanistan where troops thought they were battling militants, but instead may have exchanged gunfire with Afghan police. The operation, which took place Sunday in Daikundi province, led to the death of three Afghan police officers and wounded three others, the International Security Assistance Force said. NATO troops were conducting a patrol in a village when they came across nine armed people who were setting up what ""appeared to be an ambush position,"" the force said in a statement. The service members called in aerial support. Later, troops determined the air strike may have been carried out against an Afghan police team, the force said. ""While we take extraordinary precaution while conducting operations to avoid friendly casualties, it appears innocent people may have been mistakenly targeted,"" said U.S. Army Col. Rafael Torres, the director of the force's Joint Command Combined Joint Operations Center director.","The operation takes place in Daikundi province .

"(CNN) -- A Virginia man who allegedly threatened during a Facebook chat to detonate explosives in the Washington area was arrested last week and is undergoing a mental evaluation, according to federal court documents that came to light Tuesday. Awais Younis, also identified as Sundullah Ghilzai, told an FBI complainant through Facebook how to build a pipe bomb ""and what type of shrapnel would cause the greatest amount of damage,"" according to an affidavit from an FBI special agent. The threatened targets included the Washington Metro transit system. Younis, who is being held at the Alexandria, Virginia, Detention Center, was arrested December 6 on charges of communicating threats using interstate communications, according to prosecutors. Younis has not been charged with any federal terrorism violation. A law enforcement source says a handgun was found at his residence but no other weapons or explosives. The threat is judged to be ""minimal,"" according to the source. The suspect had a probable cause and detention hearing on December 9, said Peter Carr, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. A judge ordered a mental evaluation. The next hearing is scheduled for December 21, Carr said Tuesday. ""The public should be reassured that [Younis'] activities prior to his arrest were carefully monitored and that there is no threat against Metrorail or the general public in the Washington, D.C., area,"" Carr said in a statement. A call to Younis' attorney was not immediately returned, and a knock at his residence Tuesday was not answered. Court records say Younis was born in Afghanistan in 1985, making him 25 or 26 years old. The alleged threat came to light in late November when, court documents say, a person contacted the FBI's New Orleans field office to say that Younis had described during a Facebook chat how he could build a pipe bomb and detonate it under a sewer in Georgetown, a neighborhood in Washington. Younis stated that a rush-hour explosion would produce the greatest number of casualties and that the ""third and fifth cars in the Metro trains had the highest number of commuters on them,"" the court document reads. Younis further said ""he could place pipe bombs in these locations and would not be noticed,"" the documents read. When Younis' Facebook acquaintance told him, ""You wouldn't do that,"" Younis allegedly replied, ""Watch me,"" the document says. Investigators said Younis' Facebook page, using the name Ghilzai, contained a photo of Younis in Afghanistan holding an AK-47 rifle, with his uncle standing in front of a tent containing explosives. A caption read, ""My family business,"" the affidavit says. A separate photo posted December 1 depicts a hand holding rifle rounds for a machine gun with the caption ""bullet behind every rock."" Younis' online acquaintance said Younis recently stated on Facebook that ""Christmas trees were going to go boom,"" according to the affidavit. The Younis case is the second this year involving alleged threats to Washington's Metro system. In October, authorities charged Farooque Ahmed, 34, a naturalized citizen and a native of Pakistan, with attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization after he allegedly assisted in planning an attack on Metro stations in the vicinity of the Pentagon. Ahmed has pleaded not guilty to that charge. The FBI said Ahmed had conducted surveillance for undercover agents whom he believed to be al Qaeda co-conspirators. According to the documents, authorities found three weapons at Ahmed's home at the time of his arrest: a Smith & Wesson pistol, a 12-gauge double-barrel shotgun and a Remington rifle, along with ammunition. Also discovered was a biography of American-born Yemeni cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who is believed to be a senior leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.","The suspect is undergoing a mental evaluation .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- Nineteen demonstrators protesting high unemployment and poor living conditions have been killed during the past two days in riots that broke out in two Tunisian cities near its border with Algeria, a government official said Monday. The incidents occurred in the cities of Thala and Kasserine, said Minister of Information Samir Abidi. All of the dead were demonstrators; more than 30 police were injured, he said. Amnesty International said at least 23 people died in protests over the weekend, and it had received reports of more deaths on Monday. Citing ""information gathered by Amnesty International,"" it said security forces fired tear gas and live ammunition to disperse demonstrators in the cities of Thala, Kasserine and Regueb in central Tunisia. ""The authorities must urgently ensure the safety of protesters and instruct security forces to act with restraint and not to use excessive force against them,"" said Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa deputy director. ""The authorities claim they acted in self-defense but the rising death toll and the images of demonstrations suppressed by the security forces cast serious doubt on this version of events,"" Hassiba said. In Kasserine alone, 13 people were killed in two days, Amnesty International said. The organization called for an investigation into the deaths and for those responsible to be punished. Major cities were unaffected by the unrest. The demonstrations included demands for the government to improve social services. Tunisia's government called the protesters violent troublemakers. Tunisia has been ruled for 23 years by President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an ally of Western powers and a target of activist and human rights groups that accuse him of running a corrupt police state that has infringed on citizens' rights. In his second speech since the riots erupted, he said on national radio and television that he was ordering the creation of as many as 300,000 jobs and called for greater freedoms for members of the news media. ""These violent, sometimes bloody events, which caused deaths among civilians and injuries among security officers, were perpetrated by hooded gangs that attacked, at night, public institutions and even citizens in their houses,"" he said. ""This is an intolerable act of terrorism."" He said he would lower taxes on employers who generate new jobs. Tunisia's 14% unemployment rate does not reflect the true problems faced by the nation, Abidi said. The government pays for college educations, but only about a third of the 80,000 students who graduate each year from the nation's universities are able to find work, he said. As a result, he said, unemployment among college graduates hovers around 25%. Abidi said the government does not oppose the right of demonstrators to express their opinions, but it will not tolerate violence. He said extremist groups like al Qaeda might use the riots to recruit young people. Human rights groups have said the Tunisian government has cracked down on demonstrators with force. Reporters Without Borders condemned the arrests and disappearances of bloggers and online activists across a number of Tunisian cities. The worldwide press freedom organization said police arrested the bloggers to question them about hacking into government websites. The wave of demonstrations was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in early December. Mohamed Bouazizi, 26, set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid in early December after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. He died from his injuries. The official news agency reported that the Tunisian government called in U.S. Ambassador Gordon Grey to answer questions about U.S. government criticism of the Tunisian government's handling of the unrest. In Washington, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed that Grey was called to hear complaints about U.S. characterization of the situation in Tunis. ""We again affirmed our concerns not only about the ongoing violence, the importance of respecting freedom of expression but also the importance of the availability of information, and we will continue that discussion,"" Crowley said. ""We understand the government has a very legitimate right to ensure the safety of its citizens. That  said, we do have concerns about some of the steps that the government has taken."" Amnesty International has urged the Tunisian government to respect freedom of expression. ""Tunisians must be allowed to express their grievances and freely protest,"" said a statement from the organization. ""The authorities made empty promises of work opportunities which were followed by a crackdown on protesters."" Tunisian authorities have said they are acting in self-defense. Security forces fired on protesters in December, the state-run TAP news agency reported at the time. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for restraint ""and urges all parties to seek to resolve differences through dialogue,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

"New York (CNN) -- Two African runners won the 2010 New York City Marathon Sunday, marathon officials announced. Runners Edna Kiplagat, from Kenya, and Gebre Gebremarian, of Ethiopia were the first female and male finishers to cover the 26.2-mile course that cuts through New York City's five boroughs. Having just won first prize in the 2010 Los Angeles marathon, Kiplagat was the first woman to finish the race coming first in 2 hours and 28 minutes. Gebremarian, the fastest man in the race, crossed the finish line in 2 hours and 8 minutes. Much of the celebrity limelight in the usually star-studded race was focused on a man whose fame derived from his sprints inside the gloomy pit of a Chilean mine. Chilean miner Edison Pena -- one of 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months before they were rescued -- completed the New York Marathon Sunday, taking five hours and 40 minutes to cover the 26.2-mile course. Pena, otherwise known as ""the runner"" by fellow miners who spent 69 days trapped with him in a gold and copper mine, set out to cover the course along with thousands of other runners.. During a press conference after the race, Pena said running the marathon was a way to cope with the trauma of being trapped and fearing for his life. ""What I did today was also a symbol of bravery and a struggle against myself against the pain that I have been feeling. This I want to make very clear,"" he said. With appearances on David Letterman, where he showed his devotion for Elvis Presley amid applause, Pena attracted attention from nearly every press outlet and every street fan who held signs while he ran the marathon. ""The experience was wonderful,"" said Pena. ""I am not from this country but I kept seeing signs that said 'Go Edison'...and people would say 'Let's go Pena'...the warmth of the north American people is amazing,"" said Pena. Pena -- a triathlete -- was invited by the NYC Marathon after stories spread about his daily runs in the mine to keep himself fit. ""When I ran, I thought I was going to beat destiny,"" he said. ""I told the mine, 'I'm gonna outrun you. I'm gonna run till you're tired and bored of me.'"" The 12th miner to be rescued, he also became known for singing Elvis songs during his confinement. Star-gazing part of the experience of watching some 45,000 runners in the marathon. Actress Katie Holmes, rapper entrepreneur P-Diddy, rocker Alanis Morissette, former Gov. Mike Huckabee and TV chef Bobby Flay have all competed in the marathon. The NYC Marathon is one of the most popualr marathons in the world, drawing more than 100,000 applicants annually.","Gebre Gebremarian of Ethiopia won the men's category in the 2010 NYC marathon .

"New York (CNN) -- A male model suspected of killing a prominent Portuguese journalist in his posh Manhattan hotel room was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation Saturday at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, according to an NYPD law enforcement source. Carlos Antonio De Castro, 65, was found dead in his room at the InterContinental Hotel in New York on Friday, according to the source. He was a Portuguese reporter and columnist. Police say 20-year-old Renato Seabra, a Portuguese model, was in custody Saturday after he was spotted leaving another New York hospital where he received treatment for lacerations to his wrists. Police arrested him and transported him to Bellevue. Castro's body was found after an acquaintance appeared at the hotel asking to see him, saying she had been in contact with him earlier in the day but was unable to reach him for some time, according to the law enforcement source. Hotel employees made the grisly discovery a short time later. Castro was found bludgeoned and castrated, the source said. Castro and Seabra were staying together at the hotel, another police source said. Castro was most recently a gossip columnist for the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha. Seabra was a recent finalist on a Portuguese model-search television show called ""A Procura de um Sonho."" It was unclear why the two men were in New York.

"New York (CNN) -- A county prosecutor in Michigan is proposing a law that could punish parents with jail time for repeatedly missing their children's parent-teacher conferences. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy introduced a proposal Tuesday at a Detroit City Council meeting that would require a parent to attend at least one parent-teacher conference a year or face up to three days in jail, according Maria Miller, Worthy's press secretary. The proposal, which Worthy has also sent to the state legislature and the Wayne County Commission, would exempt parents whose children are performing exceptionally well or who are actively engaged with their children's teachers. Parents who are unable to travel for health reasons also would be exempt. So far the proposal has met with mixed responses. Detroit Council President Pro Tem Gary Brown applauded Worthy's idea, saying he would support legislation. ""It's child abuse when your child is failing in school and you're not involved, because you are strapping that child to a life of poverty,"" Brown told CNN. He noted, however, that jailing parents for missing school meetings might not be practical and suggested altering the punishment. ""If it's not jail maybe it's something else, but we've got to do something to get the parents' attention,"" he said. Daniel Lessard, a member of the Livonia Public Schools board, said that he agrees with the need to get parents involved, but called the idea ""the dumbest thing I've ever heard."" ""You can't legislate parental involvement. I think this proposal is purely political and a real neat way to get your name in the paper,"" Lessard said. Wayne County Commissioner Laura Cox, R-Livonia, blasted the proposal because she feels that Worthy has bigger problems she needs to deal with first. ""Kym Worthy has a record of complaining that her office doesn't have enough funding to prosecute violent crimes, and now she wants to put parents in jail. It's despicable,"" Cox said. According to the proposed ordinance, teachers would work to accommodate parents' schedules by setting up conferences at any time during the day. Additionally, any parent convicted under the law would have their sentences delayed to give them another chance to attend a meeting. If they do, the charges would be dropped. At present there is no legislation pending in the state House, County Commission or City Council. Kym Worthy was not available for comment Thursday.","Parents of some children in Detroit schools could be sent to jail for three days .

"(CNN) -- Police arrested a suspect believed to be one of four men shown in a video apparently sexually assaulting disabled women in a care home and other places, authorities said in a statement. Ernie Lloyd, 27, was arrested at West Hollywood Sheriff's Station on Saturday evening, said a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. On Saturday morning, Lloyd went to a Los Angeles police station, ""saying that he had seen himself on the news and that he knew he was wanted,"" the statement said. During an interview with detectives, Lloyd ""implicated himself,"" authorities said. He was arrested on suspicion of rape of a person with disabilities, the statement said, and bail was set at $100,000. On Friday, authorities said another suspect had been identified as Bert Hicks, 41, who is now serving a state prison sentence in California's Tehachapi State Prison for fiduciary crimes, abuse and sexual assault in a residential care facility. Hicks allegedly took a disabled woman to Las Vegas, married her and then brought her back to the care facility, where she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by other men, said sheriff's Detective Ron Anderson. Authorities don't know if the crimes Hicks was convicted of are the ones depicted on video, he said. On Thursday, authorities issued a public appeal for help after the video was mailed to them by an anonymous tipster. City of Los Angeles police detectives saw Thursday's media coverage and told the sheriff's office that they could identify two of the four suspects shown in composite sketches, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Dan Scott told CNN. One of the victims was also identified. ""The investigation is still in its early stages, but detectives believe that it occurred in 2007 or earlier at a residential care facility in the city of Los Angeles, where both Suspect Lloyd and the female adult victim were living at that time,"" the sheriff's statement said. Police have identified the victim by name, but have been unable to locate her, as neither she nor Lloyd still resides at the facility where the alleged assault occurred, authorities said. Sheriff's detectives were working with investigators from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social Services and Los Angeles police to locate the woman. The 13 DVDs mailed by the anonymous tipster to the sheriff last March contain more than 100 hours of video of at least 10 men apparently sexually assaulting at least eight severely disabled women in a care home and several other locations, according to Scott and Anderson. Sheriff's investigators spent months reviewing the grainy video and were able to come up with composites of only four of the 10 suspects, authorities said. Investigators believe the sexual assaults occurred in the past three to five years, Anderson said. Since the information was made public on Thursday, ""scores of tips"" have come in to authorities, the statement said. ""The public is clearly shocked and disturbed by every aspect of this case,"" Scott said in the statement. ""We heard from so many people who want to help, as well as from people who fear their loved ones may have been among the women abused."" The identification of two suspects was considered a major break in the case, because the leads could allow authorities to determine identities of the other eight suspects and the locations of the alleged rapes, authorities said. More remains to be done, Scott said in the Saturday statement. ""There are still two more suspects whose images have been shared who have not yet been identified, as well as ... other suspects. Of great importance to us as well is that we need to find and help all of the victims."" The sheriff's department has made the inquiries ""a high priority,"" Scott said. Authorities are still asking for the tipster to come forward -- even anonymously, by contacting a hot line -- and provide more details on the video. A ""To Police"" letter accompanying the video states that the tipster was a computer technician who was hired by a man to wipe clean a hard drive on a laptop that the man bought for $20 from a ""crackhead"" on a street in Inglewood, California, Anderson said. When the computer technician saw the video, he was so disturbed that he made copies of the DVDs and mailed them to the sheriff, Anderson said. In the letter, the technician said the laptop purchaser was also aware of the video content. Authorities allowed CNN to see the letter, which contains grammatical errors. It says in part: . ""He saw what was on the hard drive and ask could I wipe it and restage Windows, etc. I did restage but I have to copy this stuff for a police action,"" the letter says. ""The video's found on the hard drive was disturbing and made me sick. I had to turn it in and I pray that you find these (expletives) in the video's molesting handicap people,"" the letter continues. Authorities said the graphic video even depicted one female victim in a wheelchair who was wearing a diaper. The suspects allegedly sexually assaulted ""people in bed unable to move. They can't pick up the phone,"" Scott said. Added Anderson: ""I've seen a lot of terrible, terrible imagery in my assignment, that involved children and all kinds of hideous things. This is among the most heinous I've ever seen. ... What I saw was just these poor people lying there being victimized in the most terrible way I've ever seen."" The video was shot by a security camera and a handheld camera, Scott said. Detectives asked the tipster to call the anonymous Crime Stoppers communication system at 800-222-8477 and provide details on the video's origin. Investigators said the public can also call the special victim bureau's hot line at 866-247-5877. Information can also be provided anonymously by texting the letters TIPLA plus the tip to CRIMES (274637) or by accessing the Crime Stoppers website at www.lacrimestoppers.org.

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia and Japan made stuttering starts to their bids to win a record fourth Asian Cup title on Sunday. The Saudis, beaten in the previous final four years ago by Iraq, suffered a shock 2-1 defeat by Syria in their opening game in Qatar. Japan, the 2004 champions, earlier needed a late equalizer to snatch a 1-1 draw with Jordan in Group B's first match. Syria have never made it to the quarterfinals in four previous attempts, the last being in 1996, but boosted their hopes of progressing thanks to two deflected goals from midfielder Abdulrazak Al Husein at Ahmed bin Ali Stadium in Al-Rayyan. Qatar welcomes half the world for 2011 Asian Cup . He broke the deadlock seven minutes before halftime when his shot from outside the penalty area went in off the head of Abdullah Shuhail, but Syria's goalkeeper Mosab Balhous gifted Saudi an equalizer with half an hour to play. The captain let a tame header by substitute Taiseer Al Jassam slip past him and into the net, but Al Husein saved his blushes just two minutes later as he again pounced on a loose clearance and saw his shot take a significant diversion into the Saudi net. Syria's Romanian coach Tita Valeriu was delighted after having only recently taken control of the team. ""I didn't expect to win but I expected us to play well,"" he said in quotes reported by the AFP news agency. ""I had only a very short time to coach the team but we used a formation that worked very well. That was the key."" The result puts more pressure on the Gulf nation's coach Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro, who was failed to guide the team to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. ""We didn't deserve to lose, but we lost,"" he said. ""We are disappointed with the result, but not the spirit. China defeat 10-man Kuwait .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama's commission investigating last year's oil disaster is giving environmental groups hope that some change is on the horizon, but not the full scope of what they're looking for, two groups told CNN Thursday. ""If you take the findings to heart, you wouldn't start drilling again,"" said Kert Davies, research director with Greenpeace. On Wednesday, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a chapter of its coming report, saying ""systemic"" problems caused the blowout and that only ""significant reform"" would prevent another. ""The Macondo blowout was the product of several individual missteps and oversights by BP, Halliburton, and Transocean, which government regulators lacked the authority, the necessary resources, and the technical expertise to prevent,"" the report says. Macondo was the name of the well. BP, Halliburton and Transocean all were involved in the drilling operation. Greenpeace and the Sierra Club told CNN there were no surprises in the released chapter. ""It kind of confirms our worst fears that we've had about the oil industry all along -- that they cut corners where they can,"" said Athan Manuel, director of lands protection with the Sierra Club. ""And that sometimes threatens the safety and operation of their rigs."" Manuel said he believes the president will take the commission's findings seriously. ""Administratively, we're confident that the Obama administration will change the way oil companies do business in the Gulf."" But, he said, his group is not holding out hope for major legislative change. ""I imagine that the Republicans in charge of the Natural Resources Committee, and now the new speaker, don't want to see any new restrictions on the oil industry,"" he said. Greenpeace's Davies said the chapter released ""puts an exclamation point on the fact that the corporations were at fault,"" though he noted that a lack of government oversight also is to blame. ""What we hope is that the commission's recommendations are taken to heart by the president,"" he said. But Davies added, ""We don't have very high hopes for the reforms that should happen -- a massive overhaul of the regulatory apparatus and oversight."" ""Ultimately,"" he said, ""I think the oil industry will succeed in blocking things like that."" The group Ocean Conservancy also weighed in with a statement, saying the early draft indicates the commission ""will recommend important reforms."" The group added, ""We now look to the government and industry to step up to the plate."" The American Petroleum Institute, the main group representing the oil industry, told CNN Thursday it did not yet have a response to the chapter released by the commission. Halliburton issued a response, accusing the commission of having ""selectively omitted information we provided to them."" The company also disagreed with certain specifics, saying the report mischaracterized foam stability tests. Transocean issued a statement saying its crew had taken ""appropriate actions to gain control of the well. They were well trained and considered to be among the best in the business."" BP spokesman Robert Sholars said Wednesday the oil giant ""has cooperated fully with the commission's investigation,"" stressing that ""the accident was the result of multiple causes, involving multiple companies."" ""BP is working with regulators and the industry to ensure that the lessons learned from Macondo lead to improvements in operations and contractor services in deepwater drilling,"" Sholars said. The U.S. Department of the Interior said it, too, is already implementing reforms. ""The agency has taken unprecedented steps and will continue to make the changes necessary to restore the American people's confidence in the safety and environmental soundness of oil and gas drilling and production on the Outer Continental Shelf, while balancing our nation's important energy needs,"" spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said.","A single chapter of a report into the Deepwater Horizon disaster is now public .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- If so-called ""smart TVs"" are so clever, why do we feel so dense when trying to compare them? Each television manufacturer has its own take on what the software that lets a TV connect to the internet should look like. These myriad smart TVs, with their varying degrees of technological intelligence, were on display throughout the Consumer Electronics Show. Many of the systems developed independently by the various companies look strikingly similar, but offer different features and content. Most provide access to YouTube's and Netflix's streaming video services. Some, like Sharp's Quattron series, have Pandora for internet radio and Facebook. Others let you tweet from the TV screen using a keyboard remote. Samsung's new Web-connected TV and LG's Smart TV platforms can stream video from a computer or from a few smartphone models using a protocol called DLNA. Setup isn't a cakewalk. Compounding the confusion is when TV makers put lesser-known services, like Vudu, Rovi or CinemaNow, front and center. To top that off, several major TV manufacturers produce separate models that run completely different platforms. Sony's Bravia TVs can access Hulu and a number of other services. But Sony's Google TV sets can't get Hulu. Toshiba's Net TV system can do Skype, along with other applications. But its Yahoo Connected sets have another set of apps that look and perform differently. Samsung introduced the fourth version of its connected TV platform at CES, and signed partnerships with Hulu and Adobe. Samsung also announced that it would make a Google TV set and a set-top box, both of which can run Adobe's software but not Hulu's. ""That is different than our smart TV,"" Samsung president Tim Baxter said in an interview, ""but for some consumers who are looking for that solution, we want to be able to serve that."" Another advantage of having products with Google's software on them: ""The brand name means something,"" Baxter said. The name Google resonates with certain potential customers that Samsung may not impact. Google and Samsung partner in various areas, most tightly in mobile. Samsung says it wants to offer a wide array of platforms. That's consistent with how it runs its phone business, building smartphones that use either Google's Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone 7. ""We want to offer choice,"" said David Steel, Samsung's marketing executive. ""You won't see us choosing one platform over another."" But Google TV is stumbling over obstacles from TV networks that don't want their internet content available on the big screen. Add to that, the search-centric software has been plowed by critics for being poorly design. Perhaps so the company can retool, Google TV's footprint at CES is small, being showcased sparingly by early partners. ""Being able to use your television set as an internet-search appliance really isn't what people think of when they come to the TV,"" TiVo CEO Tom Rogers said in an interview. ""They're looking for a television experience. ... That's something that you have to be very television-focused, very television-centric to deliver."" TiVo's Premiere box can access some internet services, in addition to recordings. Several other companies are producing Web-connected boxes that can hook up to TVs, but those could be less desirable as new TVs come with Wi-Fi functions and Web features built in. Google's inability to find the right formula for TV software, like it did for smartphones with Android, leaves a major opportunity for software makers. Google's longtime competitor, Yahoo, makes an operating system for the big screen. Startups like Boxee are trying to fill this niche by creating attractive internet software that is provided to manufacturers for free. So far, they've had limited success. So unlike the smartphone area, which is dominated by just a few players, there are at least a dozen platforms with different sets of apps, interfaces and features. After sales of LCD TV sets grew last year, sales are expected to slow 13% this year, according to a report by research firm DisplaySearch. In addition, smart TVs may not prove to be a big selling point. Samsung's Baxter says less than half of people who buy the company's internet-enabled TVs actually connect them to the Web. For Samsung, standing out in a sea of smart TV platforms could come down to unique methods for connecting its various products together. The Samsung TV platform can run third-party apps, like a smartphone does, and some of them can even interact with a phone. For example, there's a Samsung TV app that lets you draw on a Galaxy S phone and see your artwork on the big screen. ""Where we think we have a big opportunity going forward is the link between 4 inches, 7 inches and 55 inches,"" Steel said, referring to the screen sizes of Samsung's smartphones, tablets and big-screen TV.","Connected TVs have a major presence at CES .
The offerings can be confusing since there are so many platforms .
Several manufacturers produce similar TV models that run completely different software ."
"(CNN)  -- Top seeds Serbia have been forced to withdraw from Saturday's Hopman Cup final because of an injury to former world number one Ana Ivanovic. The 2008 French Open champion tore a stomach muscle during her straight sets loss to Justine Henin of Belgium at the annual team event in Perth, Australia on Thursday. Ivanovic went on to partner Novak Djokovic in a three-set mixed doubles loss to Henin and partner Reuben Benelmans, but after practicing on Friday morning made the decision to withdraw from the tournament. ""This morning, I was playing some points and on one serve I felt a sharp pain and I couldn't even hit or move after that,"" Ivanovic told reporters. Ivanovic and world number three Djokovic -- whose singles win over Benelmans on Thursday secured Serbia's final berth -- will be replaced in the weekend's title-clash by Belgium who finished in second place in group A. Henin and Bemelmans will now face the United States team of Bethanie Mattek-Sands and John Isner in the final, after Mattek-Sands's straight sets defeat of British teenager Laura Robson on Friday was enough for the American's to secure their place at the top of group B. The injury is an early-season blow for Ivanovic, who recently made a comeback to the WTA tour following a string of fitness problems. But the 23-year-old said she can recover in time for the first grand slam of the year, the Australian Open, which begins in Melbourne on January 17. ""It's definitely a scare,"" the current world number 17 told reporters. ""At this moment in time my chances are still very good because I stopped in time. I'm positive I will be fit. ""It's very frustrating because this has been the case for a long time now. But I have to stay positive."" Reigning French Open champion Francesca Schiavone was also forced to retire from her Hopman Cup singles match against France's Kristina Mladenovic on Friday, however, it is not thought her injury is serious. Elsewhere, at the Brisbane International top seed Robin Soderling of Sweden progressed to the semifinal of the Australian Open warm-up event on Friday. The 26-year-old brushed aside Aussie qualifier Matthew Ebden in straight sets and will now face Czech Radek Stepanek in the semifinal, after the former world number eight and two-time finalist of the Brisbane event put out seventh seed Florian Mayer 6-3 6-3. Saturday's other last-four clash will see American second seed and world number eight Andy Roddick take on Kevin Anderson of South Africa, after the pair had respective quarterfinal wins over Marcos Baghdatis and Santiago Giraldo on Thursday. In the women's singles draw Germany's Andrea Petkovic caused an upset by knocking out the tournament's fourth seed, Marion Bartoli of France in straight sets. The world number 32 will now face fellow unseeded player Petra Kvitova in Saturday's final after the Czech defeated fifth seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4 4-6 6-2. Meanwhile at the Auckland Classic in New Zealand Maria Sharapova's quarter final conqueror Greta Arn continued her winning streak with a straight sets victory over German fourth seed Julia Georges. Hungary's Arn will meet second seed Yanina Wickmayer of Belgium in the final of the event, after the world number 23 overcame the challenge of Chinese qualifier Peng Shuai 3-6 7-6 6-3. In the Hong Kong exhibition tournament, Venus Williams suffered a second straight defeat in her preparations for the Australian Open after a lengthy injury layoff. Williams, beaten by Vera Zvonareva on Thursday, went down in straight sets to Li Na of China, 6-3 7-6.","NEW: Venus Williams loses second consecutive Hong Kong exhibition match to China's Li Na .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer became the first tennis player to win the Qatar Open three times as he ended the reign of Nikolay Davydenko in Saturday's final. The world no. 2 was beaten by his Russian opponent in last year's semifinals, but avenged that result with a 6-3 6-4 win as he claimed the 67th ATP Tour title of his illustrious career. The Swiss star followed up his 2005 and 2006 triumphs to give himself a boost ahead of his Australian Open title defense in the opening grand slam of 2011 later this month. ""I have had a good week. I really appreciate the support I get here. I have had good preparation. I can't believe that I am on the board already this year,"" Federer told reporters. What were the top tennis moments of 2010? ""This was a strong tournament and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season."" The 29-year-old lost only one service game en route to the final, and did not even face a break point against fourth seed Davydenko -- who ousted world No. 1 Rafael Nadal in Friday's semis in a repeat of the 2010 final, but has now lost to Federer 15 times in 17 meetings. ""He was tough, really played fast,"" Davydenko told the ATP Tour website. ""He gave me no chance on the return, and also he was returning good. His first serve was very good."" Nadal has been suffering with illness, but he teamed up with fellow Spaniard Marc Lopez to win the doubles title, beating Italy's Daniele Bracciali and Andreas Seppi 6-3 7-6 (7-4) in Friday's final. ""It's a perfect feeling for me to win my third doubles title here in Doha after a not easy week for me,"" Nadal said. ""Now I'm going to work hard to try to be ready for the next tournament."" In Australia, defending champion Andy Roddick will take on world No. 5 Robin Soderling in the final of the Brisbane International event on Sunday. The American second seed beat South Africa's Kevin Anderson 6-2 4-6 6-2 on Saturday, while Swedish No. 1 Soderling ended Radek Stepanek's hopes of a third successive final appearance when he beat the Czech 6-3 7-5. Young Czech Petra Kvitova won the women's title, with the 20-year-old beating fellow unseeded player Andrea Petkovic of Germany 6-1 6-3 in the final. The United States won the Hopman Cup mixed teams event for the sixth time on Saturday, beating stand-in finalists Belgium 2-1 in Perth. With top seeds Serbia withdrawing due to Ana Ivanovic's stomach injury, Bethanie Mattek-Sands and John Isner won the decisive doubles 6-3 6-4 against Justine Henin and Ruben Bemelmans. Former world No. 1 Henin won the women's singles rubber 7-6 (8-6) 6-3, but big-serving Isner leveled the tie with a 6-3 6-4 victory. Tomas Berdych's preparations for Melbourne suffered a blow when the Czech top seed was beaten in the semifinals of the Chennai Open in India, losing 6-4 6-1 to last year's runner-up Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland on Saturday. Wawrinka, beaten by Marin Cilic in the 2010 final, will take on seventh seed Xavier Malisse after the Belgian beat Serbian No. 6 Janko Tipsarevic 3-6 6-3 6-2. In New Zealand, Hungarian veteran Greta Arn won her second WTA Tour title by beating defending champion Yanina Wickmayer 6-3 6-3 in the final of the Auckland Classic on Saturday. The 31-year-old followed up earlier victories over top seed Maria Sharapova, No. 4 Julia Gorges and No. 8 Sofia Arvidsson, saving five match-points in that second-round match. Arn is expected to break into the top-75 for the first time next week, having last won a title in Estonia in 2007.","Roger Federer avenges last year's Doha defeat by Nikolay Davydenko .

"(CNN) -- In Roseanne Barr's third book, ""Roseannearchy: Dispatches from the Nut Farm,"" the comedian candidly discusses everything from her half-Jewish, half-Mormon upbringing in Salt Lake City, to the sitcom that made her world famous, to ex-husbands and owning her very own macadamia nut farm in Hawaii. ""Roseannearchy"" certainly won't leave readers wondering how Barr, 58, really feels about the state of the world. ""My writing just comes out, and then I try to edit it and try to goose it up or down,"" she told CNN.   When the subject turned to politics, Barr said, ""I'm running for president of the United States and prime minister of Israel -- that's kind of a twofer -- on the Solutions Party and the Green Tea Party seeking solutions. And I would advise President Obama, if asked, to do the same, look for solutions."" Some fans might be surprised to learn that Barr's first husband, Bill Pentland, wrote the foreword to ""Roseannearchy."" Pentland was the inspiration for Dan Conner in the sitcom ""Roseanne,"" which ran from 1988 to 1997.   ""He was always a great writer, and that was our bond when we first met, we were both writers,"" Barr said. ""We had three kids together, and they were the blueprint for Darlene, Becky and D.J. So I thought it was apt [to have him write the introduction], and I think he did a great job."" In his foreword, Barr's ex-husband recounts the years the couple spent (pre-kids, pre-fame) living in the mountains of Colorado in the 1970s. (Read: No running water, just a pump.) ""We were big hippies and roughing it,"" Barr said. Barr also said she believes that the legacy of ""Roseanne,"" which lives on in daily reruns in the U.S. on TV Land and Oxygen, lies in the people who watched it and continue to do so to this day. ""That's kind of cool,"" she said. ""The fact that they found it and watched it is the best."" Barr keeps in touch with most of her ""Roseanne"" cast mates and is delighted that the show -- which tackled hot-button issues that other shows wouldn't touch in its day -- remains relevant. ""A lot of writers were made on the 'Roseanne' show,"" Barr said. ""A lot of good ideas were mined over and over and over from that show."" Barr also said she was flattered that ""Roseanne"" was spoofed on ""Family Guy,"" although she said didn't get to see the episode ""because I never know when anything is on, so someone told me about it, but 'Family Guy' is a good show."" Barr also discussed how the popular CBS sitcom ""The Big Bang Theory"" has become a ""Roseanne"" reunion of sorts. ""The Big Bang Theory"" stars Johnny Galecki as Leonard; Galecki played Darlene's longtime boyfriend David on ""Roseanne."" Sara Gilbert, who played Darlene, had a recurring guest role on ""The Big Bang Theory."" Laurie Metcalf, who portrayed Jackie on ""Roseanne,"" guest-starred as Sheldon's mother on ""The Big Bang Theory.""   Barr hinted at an interest in partaking in an episode when she said, ""it's kind of weird that they don't ask me."" Perhaps someone should start a Facebook group?

"ANTALYA, Turkey (CNN) -- Two men who hijacked a Turkish passenger jet have surrendered to authorities after releasing the remaining passengers and crew they had been holding hostage. The passenger jet was en route from Northern Cyprus to Istanbul. The hijacking occurred earlier on Saturday when the Istanbul-bound Atlasjet Airlines flight from Cyprus was forced to make an emergency landing in southeastern Turkish city of Antalya after the hijackers claimed to have a bomb. Most of those aboard had managed to escape soon after landing, but four passengers and two crew members had been held as hostages, local government officials said. ""The adventure that started early in the morning finally came to an end,"" Atlasjet CEO Tuncay Doganer told reporters. ""With the two hijackers having surrendered, the incident ended with no bloodshed."" The other 132 passengers and four crew members had fled to safety from the plane's emergency exits as the hijackers were releasing children and women. TV footage showed passengers running from the plane's side and back doors. The Turkish Ministry of Transportation said the pilots escaped through the cockpit windows. Turkish Interior Minister Osman Gunes said one of the hijackers was Turkish while the other had a Syrian passport but may have been Palestinian, Reuters reported. A civil aviation official said it was unclear whether the hijackers did have a bomb but that they appeared to have been armed with a knife. Witnesses said the incident started shortly after the flight had taken off from Ercan airport in Turkish-recognized Northern Cyprus when two men from the back of the plane rushed to the front and tried to break open the cockpit door. When their attempts failed, witnesses said the men began talking to the flight attendants in a mix of Arabic and English and asked to be taken to either Iran or Syria. Passenger Ercan Tekkan told Reuters the hijackers had said they did not want to hurt anyone. ""The plane made some maneuvers and we thought the plane was going to crash ... Then the plane landed and the pilots escaped from the cockpit while the hijackers kept kicking the cockpit door,"" he said. Barkin Inan, another passenger, said the experience had been ""terrifying."" ""They looked anxious and were sweating. They went towards the cockpit. I shouted 'hijackers' to warn the other passengers but most of them were asleep,"" he said. Antalya Governor Alaaddin Yuksel told reporters that one of the men had claimed to be a member of al Qaeda, Reuters reported. Police also arrested a passenger suspected of being linked to the hijackers, he said. E-mail to a friend .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- The Basque separatist group ETA said Monday it was declaring a permanent cease-fire. In a statement released to the Basque newspaper Gara -- where it typically releases information -- ETA said it declares a permanent general and verifiable cease-fire as a ""firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and toward an end to the armed confrontation."" Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said that the statement that the government wants to see is one where ETA calls for a definitive end, which he said the statement does not do . ""Am I more tranquil today than before? Yes,"" Perez said. ""Is this the end? I would say no."" Spain's Socialist government has repeatedly called for ETA to announce unilaterally a definitive end to its decades of separatist violence, blamed for more than 800 deaths, and a pledge to lay down its weapons. ETA wants Basque independence in northern Spain and southwest France. Various Basque leftist parties -- including the Batasuna party, outlawed for its links to ETA -- as well as four Nobel peace laureates and the Nelson Mandela Foundation also have called in recent months for the organization to establish a permanent and verifiable cease-fire. The Batasuna party's ban from running candidates in municipal elections will not be lifted because of ETA's statement, the interior minister said. The latest statement comes after weeks of speculation in Spain that ETA would issue a statement during the holiday season. ""It is time to act with historical responsibility. ETA calls upon those governing Spain and France to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the Basque Country,"" the statement said. Another part of the message said, ""The solution will come through the democratic process with dialogue and negotiation as its tools and with its compass pointed towards the will of the Basque people."" ""ETA will continue its indefatigable struggle and efforts to promote and to bring to a conclusion the democratic process until there is a truly democratic situation in the Basque Country,"" it added. The organization has announced cease-fires before and broken them, notably its unilateral 2006 cease-fire that was announced as ""permanent,"" only to be broken months later with a car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two people. Despite ETA's current cease-fire, in effect since September, the government has not eased up on the police pressure against ETA operatives in Spain and the organization's hideouts in neighboring France and Portugal. In the past few years, police have arrested many of ETA's suspected top operatives, as well as many of its foot soldiers, and seized bomb-making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches, virtually shutting off ETA attacks. There are about 800 ETA convicts or suspects in prison, mainly in Spain but also in France, the Interior Ministry said recently. ETA's statement comes two days after a march Saturday in the largest Basque city, Bilbao, by relatives and friends of the prisoners. They want the prisoners transferred to jails in the Basque region instead of being dispersed across Spain, which authorities have said is done for security purposes. ETA is listed as a terrorist group by the United   States and the European Union for its campaign of car bombings and shootings. The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero began a peace process in 2006 during ETA's earlier unilateral cease-fire, but after the organization detonated an airport bomb, the government called off negotiations. Since then, officials of Zapatero's government have said they would not accept another cease-fire, only a definitive statement from ETA that it would end its armed fight, and specifying when and where it would lay down its arms forever. The Basque region in northern Spain already has considerable home-rule authority, with its own police, parliament, taxing power and control of health and education. But ETA rejects those as partial steps, and has fought for full independence. ETA's goal is an independent Basque nation comprising the three-province Basque region and the neighboring Navarra region in Spain, along with three departments in southwest France that also have Basque roots. About 3 million people live in those areas now. Officials have said that in recent years, ETA has become weaker and more isolated from its traditional base of popular support.","The Basque separatist group ETA has announced and broken other cease-fires .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates held talks with his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday on the first stop of his weeklong trip to Asia. It is Gates' second visit to the country since he assumed the post in December 2006. The trip is intended to deepen the military relationship between the United States and China -- a relationship that suffered a setback last year when Beijing objected to Washington's sale of defensive weapons to Taiwan. Ahead of his arrival in Beijing, Gates told reporters traveling with him that he intended to discuss strategies and policies to avoid ""miscalculations and misunderstandings and miscommunications."" Gates also wants the two nations to hold more high-level visits, he said. ""My own view is that a positive, constructive, comprehensive relationship between the United States and China is not just in the mutual interest of the two countries, but in the interests of the region, and I would say the globe,"" he said. For his part, Chinese Defense Minister Liang Guanglie told Gates that the relationship will require efforts from both sides to resolve disagreements.

"(CNN) -- Harmon Parker is using his masonry skills to save lives. Since 1997, he has built 45 footbridges over Kenya's perilous rivers, protecting people from flash floods and predatory animals. The bridges also connect isolated communities with valuable resources. Below are Parker's thoughts on being named a Top 10 CNN Hero. CNN: Where were you when you got the call that you'd been selected as a Top 10 CNN Hero? Parker: I was in a grass-roof banda in West Pokot, where I'd been working on a new bridge project. I was staring at a bat hanging from the ceiling and listening to a rat run around on the floor, trying to fall asleep. It was at that moment, 10:18 p.m., when my cell phone rang. It's very interesting because I normally do not have cell phone reception in this area. ... I thought it might be my wife, so I answered the phone. I was surprised to hear a man's voice. He introduced himself and said he wanted to share some news with me, so I said, ""Fire away."" He then told me he was happy to say that the CNN Blue Ribbon Panel had selected me to be one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes for 2010. To say I was excited doesn't begin to describe my first reaction. My heart was pumping hard from the adrenaline rush, and I found myself repeating, ""You have to be kidding, you have to be kidding!"" So there I was, alone, in the middle of the African bush, and a very nice gentleman from New York is telling me that Bridging the Gap's story was going to be aired on the CNN Heroes tribute in [Los Angeles, California] on Thanksgiving evening. Sleep eluded me for the rest of the night, but who needs sleep when you've just been told that you're a Top 10 CNN Hero? To be honest, I'm still processing it all. I keep thinking, ""Harmon, this is CNN for heaven's sake; you know, Anderson Cooper, Ted Turner and all the others."" It's unbelievable. Sorry for the cliché, but I am incredibly humbled and honored by this recognition. I have only seen one CNN Heroes tribute show, and I was very moved by the amazing people who were being honored. To think I will soon join this prestigious family of Heroes is beyond my wildest dreams. CNN: What will this recognition mean to Bridging the Gap? Parker: This recognition will be a venue to tell the story of the millions of marginalized people around the world who suffer greatly due to the dangers that rivers pose. It's for them. I hope this story will inspire other people and organizations to start bridge-building programs like I have done. I also hope this will increase our financial resources so that Bridging the Gap can hire more staff and be even more effective. CNN: What do you want people to know most about your work? Parker: I want people to know that my work is saving lives by providing safe access over perilous rivers. Our simple bridges are incredibly effective and helping poor communities in so many ways. Bridges are vital for health, education and commerce. Bridges are beautiful! I am writing from a bridge site in West Pokot where four people, sadly, drowned earlier this year. I wish all of you could see this setting, hear the sounds of rural Africa and meet this very happy community that I'm serving. The scenery is breathtaking. I can see children mirrored in my computer screen standing behind my chair as I type under the shade of an Acacia tree -- children who will no longer have to worry about drowning in the river they paradoxically depend on as a source of life. When I arrived at the bridge site four days ago, I was surprised to be welcomed by more than 300 people, dressed in their bright traditional attire, singing and dancing as though it was the bridge-opening ceremony. This is another first for me! In all the years I've been building bridges, I have never been received with such enthusiasm that stems from grateful hearts. The 42-meter bridge that the community and I are building together will link schools, medical clinics, churches and a market center. I was told by an mzee (old man) that more than 150 people have drowned at this crossing since 1965. My typical motivational speeches to work hard were not necessary in light of this community's history and the memories of loved ones lost. I can't describe how much this simple bridge means to these people. It's their Golden Gate.","Harmon Parker is transforming Kenyan communities by building footbridges over perilous rivers .

"(CNN) -- Within seconds after the shooting began, at least one man who was grazed by a bullet grabbed the gunman, a middle-aged woman snatched ammunition away from him, and a group of people held him down while another man grabbed the gun out of his hand, a man and a woman who helped subdue the shooter told CNN Sunday. ""It was so surreal. You don't believe what's really happening in front of you. People are really dying,"" said Joe Zamudio, one of the people who helped restrain the suspect. ""As the police took him away, I looked up and it was just -- it hit me like a ton of bricks. All these people that were wounded, and all these people's lives were changed in an instant."" Zamudio had been inside a nearby Walgreens when he heard the shots ring out. ""I ran outside towards the shots and when I rounded the corner, the first thing I saw was the people wrestling with the gunman. Behind that it was just kind of like people laying everywhere and kind of falling and crawling. Kind of realizing you had been shot is a weird thing to go through, I think. The people didn't really know. They were saying, 'What happened? What was that?' And then it started, a lot of 'I'm bleeding.' Like, this is real -- this is real. And then it was just, you know, 'Where's the ambulances?' It was just like nobody really knew what was going on. Nobody could really come to terms with it for minutes it seemed like. Nobody really kind of realized the massiveness of what happened."" ""What really scared me,"" Zamudio said, was seeing a middle-aged, ""maybe elderly woman,"" wrestling the next magazine away from the gunman. ""I realized he was trying to reload his gun ... I just kind of fell on him too, like kind of put my weight over him, and made sure the gun was down and out of play."" The woman was Patricia Maisch, who said she didn't have time to think about what she was doing. ""He (the suspect) pulled the magazine out of his pants pocket and it dropped onto the sidewalk. And before he could reach it, I got it,"" she said. ""I just reacted. I didn't have an opportunity to think."" Maisch brushed off reports of her being called a hero. ""The two men that secured him were the heroes. I just was an assistant in being able to get that magazine or clip,"" she said, humbly. The gunman was already on the ground when Zamudio got there, he said. ""I laid on him and held him down, and made sure the gun was down."" The ""real hero,"" Zamudio said, was the man who grabbed the gunman first. ""There was a gentleman who was wounded on top of the head, I think he got hit with a ricochet or something, (a) bullet grazed the top of his head,"" but still he ""initiated the contact"" with the shooter. ""Then other people were able to grab on and they were able to kind of contain him and pull him down."" Zamudio's account differs slightly from Maisch's in that she said two men secured the suspect. A third man wrestled the gun out of the shooter's hand, Zamudio said. In the confusion, Zamudio explained, he grabbed that man's wrist at one point, not knowing who it was. ""He says to me, 'No, no, it's him, it's him. Just put it (the gun) on the ground. Put it on the ground."" It felt like three or four minutes before the police came, Zamudio said. ""I thought it seemed like forever. But I think when you're in the moment, your perception of time is off.""","NEW: The woman who took the magazine from the shooter says she didn't have time to think .

"Nashville, Tennessee (CNN)  -- Moses Chol hops into a van, rubs his hands together and signals the passengers to quiet down. As he leans back to address them, his face breaks into a grin, his teeth glistening in the dawn haze. ""Today, we say goodbye to the north,"" he says as young men and women cheer, peeking through woolen scarves and hats. Chol is among about 70 Southern Sudan natives gathered on a cold morning in a church parking lot in Clarkston, Georgia, a metro Atlanta enclave popular with refugees. The group is heading to Nashville to vote in a referendum that could split Sudan into two: the north and the south. Several million people in Southern Sudan are voting this week in the historic referendum on whether to declare independence from a government based in the north. About 55,000 Southern Sudanese are casting ballots in the United States and seven other countries. Chol drives in a convoy of more than a dozen cars. As it snakes out of the parking lot, some passengers sing a song by former guerrilla fighters who now lead the government and army of semi-autonomous Southern Sudan. ""We will never surrender; we will keep fighting until we get what we want,"" they sing in Arabic, the national language. At the end of the song, they pump their fists in the air and chant: ""Yes to separation!"" The referendum is part of a 2005 peace agreement that helped end two decades of civil war, which left about 2 million dead. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians or animists in the south. For Chol, the referendum is more of reparation. He's one of the so-called Lost Boys: a generation of children who fled the nation's civil war and are now scattered across several continents. The United States resettled nearly 4,000 of them about a decade ago. The men -- now mostly in their 20s and 30s -- have spent the past decade rebuilding their lives. The war forced Chol and others to trek hundreds of miles through deserts and swamps, fending off lions and other animals, during their journeys into neighboring countries. Once there, they lived in sprawling refugee camps for years. Chol, 32, says he has been dreaming of the referendum for years. ""It's time for them to hear our voices, for us to revolt against all the pain we suffered,"" the graduate student says. ""A lot of people have died for this day. ... I don't care what government comes after this. No government will be worse than what we have."" His voice trails off as he pauses and stares into space. ""Passing this referendum means my father did not die in vain. It means our children will not live scarred lives. ... We will be the last 'lost boys' Sudan will ever see."" The conflict scarred an entire generation in remote Southern Sudan, which is the size of Texas but only has 30 miles of paved roads. Through the years, hundreds of thousands of Sudanese fled the south to escape fighting and famine. About 80 percent of Sudan's oil reserves are in the south, another flash point in the war. Although the north has flourished, the south has not changed much over the years, according to Chol. ""This north claims they want to be one nation,"" he says. ""How can we be when they have schools and clean water, and their children are not dying of simple diseases? In the south, people still drink stagnant water. They have nothing."" Passengers chime in to add to the list of grievances with the north. Some cite the north's attempts to impose sharia, or Islamic law, on non-Muslims -- a key reason the nation erupted in civil war in 1983. Sharia remains the law of the land in northern Sudan. ""You see my hair. It would get me in trouble in the north because of sharia law,"" says Grace Ajawin, a bakery employee, as she points to her red cornrows. ""I want my children to walk out of the house without being forced to cover their hair, to wear what they want, to go to church without being forced to convert to Islam."" Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has warned that he will tighten the application of sharia in northern Sudan if Southern Sudan votes for independence. Everyone in the vans believes that the south will split from the north. Any attempt to introduce a different scenario is brushed off as negativity. Ajawin is admonished when she says she will ""never"" go back to Sudan if al-Bashir does not honor a vote to split. ""How can (al-Bashir) not honor the vote when the whole world is watching?"" Marko Ayii, 25, shoots back. ""You need to stop your negative thinking."" Chol says he will move home if Southern Sudan is reborn as a new nation. ""When I graduate, I'll thank the Americans for being kind to us, and go help my people,"" he says. After about four hours, the convoy pulls up at the Lost Boys Center, a one-story red brick building just south of the office towers of downtown Nashville. The center is one of eight polling stations across the United States that will be open until Saturday. More than 900 Southern Sudanese are registered to vote there, poll officials say. Other centers are in Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Omaha, Nebraska; Phoenix; Seattle and Washington. The vote is being organized by the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission. Outside the Nashville center, a crowd awaits. Some are dancing while others wave American and Southern Sudan flags. At the front of the line, Malual Machop, 42, of Nashville waits for his chance to vote, weeping quietly. ""My crying is not for sadness; it's for happiness,"" he says. ""I never knew I would vote for this separation in my lifetime. We have been slaves for so long. We are now being liberated."" Outside, Ngong Aguek, 42, a musician from Southern Sudan who traveled from Orlando to vote, is busy ripping up his Sudanese passport. The crowd claps and cheers as the pages flutter into the windy, wintry air. ""This passport has enslaved me for so long,"" he says. ""It has treated me like a second-class citizen, destroyed my dignity, and killed and separated my family."" The musician says he has been targeted by the northern government for criticizing it. ""But (the truth) needs to be told, regardless of whether it will set us on fire."" Aguek saunters into a waiting van and drives off, leaving shredded pieces of his passport outside the polling station. Inside, Chol casts his vote and triumphantly holds up his ink-stained finger for flashing cameras. ""Bye bye, Sharia law; bye bye, slavery,"" he says. ""Now (the north) should leave us alone, and we'll leave them alone. We can't be one nation, but we'll be good neighbors."" He makes his way out to the waiting vans. And in an unconscious defiance of the government he wants no part of, he steps over the pale green and pink passport pages scattered outside.","About 70 Southern Sudan natives travel from Atlanta to Nashville to vote in referendum .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona remained in critical but stable condition in a Tucson hospital Monday as her alleged would-be assassin made his first appearance in court. The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, 22, briefly appeared in a Phoenix courtroom to formally hear the charges against him. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. A preliminary hearing was set for January 24. Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents Saturday. Six people -- including a federal judge -- were killed and 14 others were wounded in the attack. In addition to Giffords, seven other patients remained hospitalized, doctors at University Medical Center said. Five of the patients were in serious condition and two in good condition. Two patients remain in intensive care, they noted. President Barack Obama, meanwhile, led the nation in a moment of silence Monday morning as flags across the country flew at half-staff to honor the victims. He is planning to travel to Tucson on Wednesday, according to two senior administration officials. The Supreme Court, which rarely alters its public sessions, observed the occasion by convening 10 minutes early to ensure that first arguments were completed before the moment of silence. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer was scheduled to give her official ""State of the State"" address Monday, but instead she used the occasion to call for unity and express sympathy for the victims. Debate has swirled around the question of whether Saturday's massacre was partly the consequence of what many observers characterize as a trend of increasingly toxic political rhetoric. In his first public statement since the weekend shooting rampage outside the Arizona supermarket, Giffords' husband thanked supporters and expressed condolences to the families of other victims. ""Many of you have offered help. There is little that we can do but pray for those who are struggling,"" wrote astronaut Mark Kelly. Giffords, who was shot through the left hemisphere of her brain with a 9mm pistol, is currently in a medically induced coma in order to minimize discomfort, according to Dr. Michael Lemole Jr., chief of neurosurgery at University Medical Center. ""I'm happy to say she's holding her own,"" Lemole told CNN Monday. She is ""functioning at a high level."" ""We're not out of the woods yet,"" but doctors are optimistic about her prospects of recovery, he later added at a news conference. Lemole noted that potentially dangerous brain swelling typically peaks roughly three days after a person is shot in the head. ""(We) can breathe a collective sigh of relief after about the third or fourth day,"" he said. Doctors removed part of Giffords' skull during surgery in order to keep the brain from pressing against it if it swells, but the bullet's front-to-back trajectory did not do as much damage as would have a shot that crossed from one hemisphere to the other, Lemole noted earlier. The next big milestone for Giffords, Lemole told CNN, will come when doctors decide her condition has improved to the point that breathing tubes can be removed. That would be ""a huge step forward,"" he said. Doctors noted earlier that Giffords has been following simple commands, and a longtime adviser said Sunday he was confident she would survive her wound. ""The doctors are pretty clear that we just have to wait and see,"" Mike McNulty said. But he added, ""I can only think that God has more important things planned for her in the future."" Meanwhile, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Monday morning that the investigation was ""winding down,"" and that authorities have evidence that suspect Loughner specifically targeted the congresswoman. ""He's a very troubled individual,"" Dupnik said. Giffords, a three-term Democrat, was among the 20 people shot at her constituent open house Saturday. Federal authorities have leveled murder and attempted murder charges at Loughner, a former community college student who posted online screeds about government mind control. Authorities have said the federal charges Loughner faces include two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempting to kill a member of Congress -- all stemming from the shootings of federal employees at the scene. One member of Giffords' staff was killed and two more were wounded. The gunfire also claimed the life of a federal district judge, John Roll. State prosecutors could also bring charges in the remaining cases. Loughner had railed against government ""mind control"" and illiteracy in online missives and had ""kind of a troubled past,"" Dupnik said. The suspect was not talking and had invoked his right against self-incrimination, he said. A federal public defender known for handling high-profile cases, Judy Clarke, has been appointed to represent Loughner. Clarke previously defended the ""Unabomber,"" Ted Kaczynski, and assisted in the case of confessed al Qaeda operative Zacarias Moussaoui. Court documents released Sunday show that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at the house where Loughner lived with his parents, thanking him for attending a 2007 event, similar to Saturday's meet-and-greet. ""Also recovered in the safe was an envelope with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'my assassination' and the name 'Giffords,' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature,"" the affidavit states. A law enforcement official said Loughner asked Giffords a question at the 2007 event and was unhappy with her response. ""He never let it go,"" the source said. ""It kept festering."" The source did not know the nature of Loughner's question. The law enforcement official said earlier that investigators are interviewing ""anyone, everyone, we can."" Loughner's parents were cooperative when interviewed, the official said. Investigators have not found anything connecting Loughner to extremist groups, the official said. They believe Loughner was unemployed at the time of the shooting, according to the official. One of Loughner's former teachers at Pima Community College said he saw Loughner as a threat and kicked him out of class months before Saturday's shooting rampage. Loughner was ""physically removed"" from an algebra course in June -- less than a month after it began -- instructor Ben McGahee told CNN. Loughner voluntarily withdrew from the school in October after being suspended, the college said in a statement. McGahee said Loughner sometimes shook, blurted things out in class and appeared to be under the influence of drugs at times. ""I was scared of what he could do,"" McGahee said. ""I wasn't scared of him physically, but I was scared of him bringing a weapon to class."" Lorraine Morales, vice president of student development at Pima Community College West Campus, said the school has in place provisions for immediate suspensions. ""Hindsight is always 20/20,"" she told CNN. ""The process is very clear for what needs to be followed."" The 9mm pistol used in Saturday's shootings was purchased at a gun store in November, FBI Director Robert Mueller told reporters Sunday. A law enforcement source said the suspect tried to buy ammunition at a Walmart store, but was turned down because of his behavior. Another Walmart store later sold him the ammunition, the source said. A source within Walmart offered a slightly different account of events. The man believed to be Loughner entered a store and requested to buy ammunition. While the employee was getting it, the suspect left the store, according to the source within Walmart. When Loughner tried to enlist in the Army in 2008, the service rejected him for reasons it says it can't disclose due to privacy laws. But an administration official told CNN on Sunday that the suspect had failed a drug test. In addition to Roll, the dead from Saturday's massacre includes Gabe Zimmerman, 30, a Giffords staffer who was engaged to be married; Dorwin Stoddard, 76, who was fatally shot in the head while trying to shield his wife; Dorothy Morris, 76; Phyllis Schneck, 79; and a 9-year-old girl, Christina Taylor Green, who was born on September 11, 2001. Giffords won her third term in November in a closely contested race against a Tea Party-backed Republican candidate. She was one of three Democratic legislators who reported vandalism at their offices following the March passage of the Obama administration's sweeping health-care law. Sheriff Dupnik suggested Saturday night that ""vitriolic rhetoric"" in political debates could have deadly consequences. ""When you look at unbalanced people, how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government, the anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous. Unfortunately, Arizona, I think, has become sort of the capital,"" he said. ""We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" Following the shootings, all legislation on the House schedule for the coming week was postponed, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said. The decision was made by leaders of both parties and means the House will not vote this week on the repeal of health care reform. Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer said lawmakers will consider at least one resolution on the House floor Wednesday honoring Giffords and those who were killed in Saturday's attack. CNN's Kevin Bohn, Drew Griffin, Casey Wian, Jessica Yellin, Susan Candiotti, Alan Silverleib, Jeanne Meserve, Dana Bash and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama to travel to Tucson on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Top Pakistani officials on Wednesday dismissed fears over the safety of the nation's nuclear weapons revealed in U.S. diplomatic cables. ""Pakistan's nuclear assets are safe,"" said Qamar Zaman Kaira, the information minister. ""All major countries, including the U.S., have shown they're satisfied with the security of our nuclear assets."" U.S. diplomatic cables cited by The New York Times reveal concerns over Pakistan's uranium stockpile, its role in the struggle against Islamic militants and its economic crisis. The documents are among the vast cache of U.S. State Department papers that WikiLeaks, a website known for leaking official secrets, began releasing Sunday to widespread condemnation from the United States and its allies. CNN cannot independently verify the content of all the cables from the website. Cables revealed by The Times show that the U.S. ambassador in Islamabad was concerned over a supply of highly enriched uranium at an aging research reactor, allegedly enough to build several ""dirty bombs."" The Times cites a cable dated May 27, 2009, in which Ambassador Anne Patterson said the Pakistani government was dragging its feet on an agreement that would allow the U.S. to remove the material. She said the Pakistani government was concerned that the ""sensational' international and local media coverage of Pakistan's nuclear weapons made it impossible to proceed at this time."" A foreign ministry spokesman said fears over the nation's nuclear weapons are misplaced. ""Their fears are misplaced and doubtless fall in the realm of condescension,"" spokesman Abdul Basit said. ""There has not been a single incident involving our fissile material which clearly reflects how strong our controls and mechanisms are."" Basit said Pakistan has ""extended experience in handling nuclear stuff."" Nuclear safety was not the only concern linked to Pakistan in the cables. One document cited says Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari had told U.S. Vice President Joe Biden that the Pakistani military might ""take me out."" However, Kaira said, the nation was not at risk of a coup. ""All of Pakistan's institutions, including military, have learned lessons from the past,"" the minister said. ""There would be no military coup today. The people of Pakistan will not allow a coup."" Other governments are also preoccupied by Pakistan, including Saudi Arabia, according to a CNN survey of the leaked cables. In a cable sent to Washington in February, Ambassador James Smith writes: ""King Abdullah firmly believes that Asif Zardari is the primary obstacle to the government's ability to move unequivocally to end terrorist safe havens there ('when the head is rotten, it affects the whole body')."" Kaira refuted the accusation, saying the government is committed to the war against terrorism. ""We have won the war in many parts of the country and we are winning in other parts of the country. I admit the success is slow because the war is very long."" A cable from June 2009 said Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told U.S. diplomats that Pakistan was his ""private nightmare,"" suggesting that the world might wake up one morning ""with everything changed"" after a potential Islamic extremist takeover. CNN's Reza Sayah and Tim Lister contributed to this report.","'Pakistan's nuclear assets are safe,' top official says .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Asking fans for $75,000 to fund your next record takes a lot of chutzpah. Getting them to meet the goal in 53 days takes a lot of charm. Jill Sobule raised $75,000 from fans through a Web site to fund her latest album. Singer-songwriter Jill Sobule has both in spades. Before Katy Perry topped the charts with her sassy single, ""I Kissed a Girl,"" Sobule scored a Top 20 hit with a song of the same name back in 1995. Since then, she's been on four record labels and has seen some modest success -- mostly recently as a songwriter/composer for the Nickelodeon series, ""Unfabulous."" These days, Sobule is a free agent. Translated, that means the 40-something entertainer must now think of creative ways to make ends meet and pay for her artistic endeavors. In January 2008, she started her fundraising drive on jillsnextrecord.com. Visitors to the site were greeted by a message that read, ""Hi, I'm Elaine, Jill's mother. As you know, my daughter is a real talent."" During the next six weeks, donations flooded in via PayPal.  Watch Sobule surprised at the effectiveness of her pitch » . To sweeten the pot, Sobule offered prizes to contributors -- or ""gifts,"" as she calls them. For 10 grand, you got to sing on the record. Five thousand dollars earned you a private living room concert. A $100 donation meant a T-shirt from Sobule with the words ""Junior Executive Producer"" emblazoned on it. We interviewed the Denver, Colorado, native at her home in Los Angeles -- in the living room, and not out by the pool. ""I don't want people to think I'm rich,"" she said, her blue eyes growing wide with horror. While the $75,000 she raised was enough to record her new album, ""California Years,"" it didn't include money for a makeup artist or hair stylist. Instead, we had Sobule come into the CNN bureau in Hollywood to use the glam squad we have on staff. Later, she blogged about sitting in Larry King's makeup chair. The following is an edited version of the interview with Sobule. CNN: So Jill, your next record that's coming out in April (""California Years"") was funded entirely by fans. How did you come up with that idea? Jill Sobule: Well, after being on two major labels that dropped me, and then two indie labels that went bankrupt, the thought of maybe getting another deal seemed ridiculous. Originally, I thought I would try and have them invest -- just like stocks -- but I couldn't figure out how to do it. So the next thing was a different level of donations, and they would get gifts. For $10,000 [the ""Weapons Grade Plutonium"" level], you could sing a duet with me on my record, and someone actually did it from the UK. CNN: Did you know this person? Sobule: No, I didn't know her, but what was great was that she was not a singer professionally. She wanted to give, and I brought her over from the UK, and she was fantastic. My first donation was from my friend Kenny and my mother, and really when I first started, I thought this could be a humiliating experience. Within six weeks, I reached the goal [of $75,000]. I was totally surprised and shocked. Some of my favorite things were, ""I really don't like your music, but I like what you're doing, so here's five bucks."" CNN: Did you know a lot of the folks who donated? Sobule: I don't have a Madonna-sized fan base, so I can actually e-mail and talk to everyone that e-mails me, because I am totally appreciative and I like my fans! They seem to have the same interests as me. They are kind of nerdy and cool -- and have good taste, obviously. Someone asked me the other day, ""Have you ever had a bad stalker experience?"" And I said, ""Well, I had two people, but I put them to work helping me sell T-shirts. Now I'm stalking them!"" CNN: Your plea for money on jillsnextrecord.com starts off with a little note from your mother saying, ""Hi, I'm Elaine, Jill's mother. As you know, my daughter is a real talent."" Sobule: I thought it sounded too conceited -- in a seventh grade sort of way -- to try and tout myself. So I called my mother and asked her, ""Will you write me a little letter?"" CNN: Tom Bergeron [the host of ""Dancing With the Stars""] gave you $1,000. What did he get for that? Sobule: For $1,000, Tom gets his own theme song that he can put on his answering machine. There are actually going to be two different versions. There is a spy version, that is kind of 007-like with horns, and then there is ""That Girl,"" this Mary Tyler Moore '60s-type theme song. I am making myself do a lot of work, but it has been really fun. CNN: For $5,000, donors got a private concert in their living room. How many of those did you have to do? Sobule: About five or six. That is a good bargain, actually. If they have a large enough place, they invite a lot of people and charge 10 bucks to come in, so they get their money back. I always say that is the one you should choose. CNN: Fred Savage, the ""Wonder Years"" kid, coughed up a hundred bucks? Sobule: He coughed up a hundred bucks. CNN: Have you gone through all the money? Sobule: I have pretty much gone through all of it. I did not know how expensive it was to do all of this. CNN: No wonder the record labels are broke. You could have done it for less than 75 grand if you did it in your home office on Pro Tools [computer-based recording equipment]. Sobule: Yeah. I could have done it for less than $75,000 -- and I probably will for my next one -- but I wanted to do it the old-fashioned way one last time, and do everything that the label does -- publicity, promotion, marketing, distribution, printing the old CDs. I guess that's what an indie budget would be at a label. CNN: It's hard to make any money selling CDs these days. Sobule: I have never made a cent off a record in my life. I have never recouped enough, and I never sold enough. When people see you have a song on MTV, they think you are doing well -- but you know, the way the traditional label deal was set up, it is really hard for an artist, unless they sold a lot, to see anything. CNN: So what you're saying is that you're seeing your first dollar from record sales with this album? Sobule: I will see my first dollar. CNN: Because you're eliminating the record company as the middleman. Sobule: Other artists -- I think this is completely a model for them to do. I think that it's very hard to be an artist more than ever, but it is also a very exciting time. It feels like the Wild West in a way..","Singer Jill Sobule set out to raise money to record an album .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The death toll from a plane crash in northwestern Iran has risen to 77, news agencies in the country reported Monday. Twenty-seven others were injured when the IranAir jet crashed near the city of Orumiyeh, in a snowy and mountainous part of the country, state-run Press TV reported. Bad weather forced the Boeing 727 to give up its first landing attempt. It was circling for a second approach when air-traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, according to an account on Press TV. Investigators have recovered the flight data recorders and plan to analyze them to determine what caused the crash, the news agency said, citing Ahmad Majidi, deputy for crisis management in the Road and Transportation Ministry. The semi-official Fars news agency said the plane went down in farmland after making a second attempt to land. Official Iranian news agencies reported Sunday that the plane carried 105 passengers and crew members, but Press TV reported a toll Monday -- 77 dead and 27 injured -- that suggests 104 passengers and crew were on board. The discrepancy could not immediately be clarified.

"(CNN) -- The oldest daughter of the Austrian family portrayed in the 1965 film ""The Sound of Music"" died of heart failure Tuesday, a friend confirmed. Agathe von Trapp, 97, was in a Gilchrist Hospice in Towson, Maryland, when she died, her friend Mary Louise Kane told CNN Thursday. She fell ill November 9 and was moved on December 2 to the Gilchrist Hospice, said Kane, who ran a kindergarten with von Trapp in Glyndon, Maryland. The 16-year-old Liesl von Trapp character in the movie was based on Agathe, but the writer and director took great artistic license with the portrayal, Kane said. ""(Von Trapp) was nothing at all like the Liesl character,"" Kane said. ""She was a very private person and a bit shy. She didn't like being in the limelight at all."" Contrary to the movie, she was not the oldest of the von Trapp family. An older brother was made younger in the script. ""Liesl was a made-up character,"" Kane said. ""I never thought of her being Agathe because they were too unlike."" Four siblings survive, including Maria, 96, who lives in Vermont, Kane said. Three half-siblings still alive are Rosemarie, Eleonore, and Johannes, she said. The von Trapp family fled Austria in 1938 to escape Nazi persecution. They toured the United States as the Trapp Family Singers after World War II. Agathe von Trapp wrote her life story in a book published in 2003 and republished last September, Kane said. ""She was hoping to do some book signings,"" Kane said. ""She did enjoy the book signings because people would come and tell her how much they enjoyed her concerts."" Kane is hoping to hold a memorial service for her friend on March 12, which would have been Agathe von Trapp's 98th birthday.","Agathe von Trapp was oldest daughter of family portrayed in the ""The Sound of Music""

"(CNN) -- When John Isner played Nicolas Mahut in 2010, the American finally staggered off the court victorious -- 11 hours and a staggering 168 games later in the longest match in tennis history. But his 2011 reunion with the Frenchman proved to be a relatively brief encounter, with the world No. 19 registering a routine straight-sets win in a brisk 90 minutes on Monday. The 25-year-old, who edged the June marathon at Wimbledon with a 70-68 win in the final set, was relieved after rattling off a 6-3 7-6 (7-5) result at the Hopman Cup mixed teams event in Australia.

The Americans, seeking their country's sixth title in Perth, followed that up by winning the doubles rubber 2-6 6-3 10-8 to clinch a 3-0 victory and take top spot from Italy's Francesca Schiavone and Potito Starace in the round-robin standings. Earlier in the day, the Italians beat second seeds Britain 2-1 as Schiavone and Starace won the decisive doubles rubber against teenager Laura Robson and Andy Murray 6-7 (1-7) 7-6 (8-6) 7-6 (7-2) in just over two hours.

Belgium's Justine Henin and Ruben Bemelmans will seek to build on Saturday's 2-1 win over Australia. Meanwhile, Russian star Maria Sharapova eased into the second round of the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand with a 6-2 6-3 success against Italian lucky loser Alberta Brianti on Monday. Sharapova was set to face fifth-seeded Spaniard Carla Suarez Navarro in the opening match of the hardcourt tournament, but the draw was rearranged after Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova withdrew through illness. Another big name to advance at the ASB Tennis Center was top seed Sharapova's compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova, who overcame local favorite Sacha Jones with a 6-4 6-2 win. Third seed Kuznetsova, who finished last season outside of the top 10 for the first time in seven years, praised the efforts of her 20-year-old opponent. ""For almost the whole first set I had to watch and adjust to how she was playing,"" the 25-year-old told the WTA Tour's official website. ""She had the home crowd, I had never played her before and had no idea what to expect. In the second set I was able to put more pressure on her.""

"(CNN) -- Robin Soderling will be hoping to improve on a dismal record at the Australian Open next week after an impressive display saw him clinch the Brisbane International title in Queensland, Australia. The Swede brushed aside Andy Roddick in straight sets 6-3 7-5 in Sunday's final at the Pat Rafter Arena to claim his seventh career title and raise expectations of a good run at the Australian Open, which starts in Melbourne on January 17. The victory means Soderling moves up to fourth in the world rankings ahead of Scotland's Andy Murray. The Swede will also be seeded fourth in Melbourne. The 26-year-old's improved ranking and good form should, in theory at least, give him an excellent chance of bettering his best performance at the Australian Open and make it past the second round for the first time. ""I'm playing really well and it makes me really happy. I've never really played well in Australia before and now finally I won a tournament playing really good tennis. It gives me a lot of confidence for Melbourne,"" Soderling said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. In an impressive service display, Soderling didn't face any break points on his serve, while creating ten on his opponent. Roddick was taken to deuce in his first service game and then lost his second as Soderling seized early control of the match. Faultless serving by the Swede ensured he wrapped up the first set in just 35 minutes. There was no let up in the second set and Roddick did well to stay in the set as long as he did. The American saved three break points in the fifth game but was finally broken in the 11th to allow Soderling to serve out the match. ""I've had the best possible preparation I could have with five good matches here, now I'll have a week of rest and practice in Melbourne and I'll be more than ready to go. I know I have a chance to do really well if I play good tennis like here,"" Soderling said, ATPWorldTour.com reported. Roddick was full of praise for the in-form Swede. ""He served great. Conditions were heavy and he served through it better. I think that was the difference; I wasn't able to get into any return games and he got into two and was able to break in those,"" Roddick said, ATPWorldTour reported. Earlier in the week Roddick pledged $100 for every ace he served in the tournament to go towards Queensland's flood relief fund. After the final, having served 54 aces during the week, the World No.8 doubled the pledge to $200, raising his donation to $10,800.","Swede sees off American Andy Roddick in straight sets to claim Brisbane crown .

"(Mashable)  -- Along with hearing the announcement about the Verizon iPhone Tuesday, we've learned that Apple's iPad -- which has been marketed by Verizon for some time -- will now actually be able to connect directly to the Verizon network. We realize that connecting the device to the network sounds like a no-brainer. However, for the past few months, folks with Verizon iPads have had to buy separate external Verizon MiFi devices in order to connect when Wi-Fi wasn't available. Now, as Apple's exclusivity with AT&T comes to a close, the iPad will be able to connect directly to Verizon's 3G -- and who knows, perhaps even its 4G LTE -- network. The latter would bring it to parity with Motorola's Xoom, a new Android-powered tablet recently announced at CES. iPads with embedded Verizon chips will be coming soon; however, an exact release date hasn't yet been set. The iPad first came to Verizon in October 2010. Although connecting to the network when Wi-Fi wasn't present did require a bundled MiFi, costs were comparable and data plans were better than what AT&T customers were getting. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"Washington (CNN) -- The child-abduction alert system used by law enforcement, broadcasters and transportation departments is now available on Facebook. AMBER Alerts have previously been available to many users via their local law enforcement Facebook pages. But now, Facebook users can receive the announcements directly from state AMBER Alert pages, by choosing which state's alerts they want to see. The District of Columbia and the U.S. Territories also each have an alert page. ""As we all know, social networking has few boundaries, and now AMBER Alerts will benefit from that reach,"" said Laurie Robinson, the National AMBER Coordinator for the Department of Justice. The AMBER (America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response) Alert system started as an agreement between broadcasters and law enforcement agencies to quickly release information to the public on child abductions so citizens can assist in the search for the child. It is named for Amber Hagerman, a 9-year-old from Arlington, Texas, who was kidnapped and murdered in 1996. The Facebook announcement comes on the eve of the 15th anniversary of her abduction. Facebook users who want to receive the alerts must will sign up at http://apps.facebook.com/amber_alert/. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said designers of the program wanted to be sensitive to people who would see the alerts as spam, so users must sign up to receive the alerts. Once they receive a bulletin, Facebook users can easily share it with their Facebook friends. An estimated 800,000 children are reported missing every year. The AMBER Alert program has been credited with the recovery of 525 children since it began.","Facebook users can sign up to get AMBER Alerts .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal over a federal law banning felons from having bulletproof vests or body armor. The 7-2 decision on Monday not to intervene was a reaffirmation of congressional authority over a wide range of commerce. The order was one of several hundred pending appeals the court summarily disposed of by the court. By refusing to accept the case for review, the justices let stand the conviction of Cedrick Alderman, a Washington state man who was stopped by police in 2005 on suspicion of selling cocaine. Officers then discovered he was wearing a bulletproof vest. That in itself did not violate state law, but because Alderman was an ex-felon -- convicted of armed robbery in 1999 -- and the vest was manufactured in California, he was convicted under federal law. He was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison. Congress had passed the law in 2002 in response to a series of high-profile shootings involving police, including bank robbers wearing body armor. Alderman's lawyers argued owning such equipment had nothing to do with interstate commerce, and that Congress had no power to intervene. ""The federal power claimed is the authority to regulate anything -- from possession of french fries to the local theft of a Hershey's kiss,"" his lawyers told the high court. Opponents of the sweeping health care reform law promoted by President Obama have made similar arguments, saying constitutional authority by the government has been improperly exceeded. In particular, nearly a dozen states and private groups have challenged a provision of the law requiring Americans to have some form of health insurance by 2014 or pay a tax penalty. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia strongly dissented from the court's refusal to intervene in the Alderman case. ""Today, the court tacitly accepts the nullification of our recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence,"" wrote Thomas in a seven-page dissent. The court's failure to step in ""threatens the proper limits on Congress's commerce power and may allow Congress to exercise police powers that our Constitution reserves to the states,"" he said. The case is Alderman v. U.S. (09-1555). In other pending cases: . The justices let stand the criminal conviction of an Oregon man who was found guilty despite votes from two jurors to acquit him. At issue was whether the Constitution requires a unanimous jury verdict to convict a person of a felony. Oregon and Louisiana alone among states allow criminal convictions by non-unanimous verdicts in some crimes. Alonso Herrera was convicted by a 10-2 jury vote in 2008 for unauthorized use of a vehicle -- borrowing a friend's car and not bringing it back. He served 13 months behind bars. The case is Herrera v. Oregon (10-344). The justices rejected for a second time the appeal of an outspoken figure in the ""birther"" movement involving whether President Obama is in fact a U.S. citizen. Attorney Orly Taitz has been challenging a $20,000 fine imposed by a federal judge who determined the California attorney had filed a frivolous lawsuit. Taitz had represented Capt. Connie Rhodes, an Army physician from Columbus, Georgia, who protested her pending deployment to Iraq. Taitz had argued in court the deployment was illegal because Obama had no authority to act as commander in chief because he was unconstitutionally serving as president. A motion for a restraining order was ultimately rejected by Judge Clay Land of the Middle District of Georgia. According to court records, Taitz then filed for a rehearing, and publicly labeled the ruling an ""act of treason."" Rhodes later said that second motion, which also was rejected, was filed without her consent. Land then ruled the lawyer had filed ""frivolous"" litigation, had abused the civil judicial process, and fined her. The high court in August had rejected a similar motion for relief from Taitz. The justices had also dismissed earlier, unrelated lawsuits from individuals questioning Obama's citizenship. State birth certificate records show he was born August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii. His mother is a native of Kansas; his father was born in Kenya. Among the claims of various ""birther"" movement organizers are that the president was born in Kenya or Indonesia; that his birth certificate is a forgery; and that he had dual American-British citizenship at birth because of his father's Kenyan heritage and therefore is not a ""natural born"" citizen, as is required to be eligible for president under the U.S. Constitution. The case is Taitz v. MacDonald (10-541). And the high court said no to the claims of a Native American inmate who wanted to grow his hair long behind bars, for what he said were a necessary part of his religious rights. Iron Thunderhorse, a 66-year-old practitioner of Native American shaminism, also claimed Texas corrections officials denied him the right to wear a colored headband and to use a pipe in his cell as part of his tribal ceremonies. At issue was whether a prison grooming rule violated a federal law protecting the rights of prisoners to religious practice. The inmate claims corrections staff has harassed him about his religion, confiscating his medicine bag, religious medallion, and quartz crystal. According to Thunderhorse, an altercation with a guard four years ago resulted him being denied the right to conduct pipe ceremonies in his cell, or being allowed to have musical instruments. The opinion says it does allow the man to wear a plain white headband. Thunderhorse is serving a 99-year prison term for robbery, rape, kidnapping and attempted escape. The Connecticut native says in his legal filings he is ""Hereditary Grand Sachem and Powwamanitomp (shaman) of the Quinnipiac Thunder Clan."" Lower federal courts have had differing views over the level of deference owed by prison officials to inmate religious practices that conflict with grooming rules. The Obama administration had recommend the court turn aside the appeal, which it did without comment. The case is Iron Thunderhorse v. Pierce (09-1353.)","Thomas and Scalia dissent from rejection of appeal on felons owning body armor .

Fernandez de Cevallos, a former senator and congressman and a close ally of Mexican President Felipe Calderon, disappeared on May 14 near his ranch in the state of Queretaro in central Mexico. Blood and other signs of a struggle were found, police said. Federal prosecutors had been investigating the case but later backed off at the request of the ex-senator's family members. Sporting a white beard, Fernandez de Cevallos seemed thin and much older Monday than in previous public appearances. He was a presidential candidate in 1994. He belongs to the same political party as Calderon, leading some officials to speculate that he may have been abducted by narcotraffickers. More than 30,000 people have been killed since Calderon declared war on the drug cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006.

"(CNN) -- A gap in communication between the National Weather Service and the Army Corps of Engineers undercut forecasts of the deadly flood that struck middle Tennessee in 2010, the National Weather Service reported Wednesday. The Corps of Engineers was forced to increase the flow of water from a dam on the Cumberland River amid record rainfalls over Nashville and the surrounding region on May 2, according to a newly released National Weather Service review of the disaster. But forecasters weren't told about the additional releases, and the Cumberland passed its predicted crest of 41.9 feet within two hours of their advisory, the report states. ""If they had been able to provide that data back to the Weather Service, we could have had a better chance of producing a more accurate and timely forecast for the Cumberland River,"" said Weather Service meteorologist Jane Hollingsworth, the report's author. ""But again, because of the rapid evolution of the event, we could not create that communication exchange."" The Cumberland eventually crested at nearly 52 feet in downtown Nashville, nearly 12 feet over flood stage. The resulting flooding killed 11 people in the city and inflicted more than $2 billion in damages, with another 15 people killed in the surrounding region. Both Hollingsworth and Jack Hayes, the Weather Service's director, emphasized that the communication breakdown occurred during an ""unprecedented"" situation, when two-day rainfall totals more than doubled their previous record. The Corps had to increase water flows at the Old Hickory Dam in Hendersonville ""to protect the structural integrity of this dam,"" Hollingsworth told reporters. In its own November assessment, the Corps of Engineers acknowledged that ""misunderstandings"" between its Nashville district office and the Weather Service threw off forecasts ""to some degree."" Lt. Col. Anthony Mitchell, the district commander, told CNN that the Weather Service's report was ""pretty fair"" and consistent with the Corps' own report. ""Obviously, our normal protocols in how we would communicate were taxed, and they were taxed to a degree that we recognize that we need to improve upon,"" Mitchell said. But, he added, ""Our actions and the actions of those Corps employees that were out there on the spillway gates, making adjustments, saved those projects and saved lives as well."" The Corps is working on ways to share real-time data with forecasters and other agencies that need it, he said. Hollingsworth said that while the Weather Service issued flood warnings, many residents of the affected areas said they could not relate those warnings to the impact on their neighborhoods. As a result, she said, ""All perceived that they had no warning."" Hayes said the Weather Service, the Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Geological Survey have taken steps to improve communication and to learn more about each others' operations in the wake of the event. And he said the service has developed forecast maps that relate predicted crests to maps, allowing residents to see a clearer picture of how far floodwaters will reach. ""They need to know, when the river reaches 48 feet, what that will mean for their homes and businesses,"" Hollingsworth said. CNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.","Forecasters didn't know about increased releases from a dam upstream, the report finds .

"(CNN) -- Affidavits in the case of a missing 13-year-old Texas girl indicate her mother and live-in boyfriend failed polygraph exams on her whereabouts and they had a New Year's Eve party a few days after she disappeared. But Hailey Dunn's mother, Billie Dunn, told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" on Wednesday that the party was a family gathering and that alcohol was not served. ""We were pretty upset,"" about Hailey, Dunn said. According to the affidavits, boyfriend Shawn Adkins ended two polygraph exams by walking out. On the third try, he failed the initial part of the test, but he then ""made a positive indication"" that the girl could be found in Scurry County, Texas. Billie Dunn said Adkins was on anxiety medication at the time of the first test. Billie Dunn was under the influence of narcotics on her first polygraph examination, and she failed the second, according to a law enforcement affidavit posted on the website of CNN affiliate KTAB in Abilene. The affidavits were filed by law enforcement officials for the purpose of securing search warrants for evidence related to Hailey's disappearance, according to CNN affiliate KTXS. Adkins was the last person to see the eighth-grade cheerleader on December 27 at Dunn's home in Colorado City, according to local reports. Colorado City -- a rural central Texas town -- is about 70 miles west of Abilene, Texas. Hailey was reported missing by her mother December 28. Authorities indicated Wednesday they are looking at several ""persons of interest."" The Colorado City Police Department responded to a domestic dispute in February 2010 after Adkins allegedly threatened Billie and Hailey Dunn, the released documents show. Adkins confirmed he did make the threats, according to documents. Billie Dunn said she has no idea what happened to her daughter. ""Somebody knows where she is,"" she told HLN. The mother said she and Adkins were interested in stories about violent crimes and murder. The affidavits claim her interest in such topics is a ""hobby."" The affidavits also indicated Billie Dunn and Adkins made ATM withdrawals on December 27 to purchase drugs. Hailey reportedly told Adkins she was going to visit her father and then a friend. Hailey's father, Clint Dunn, says she often came to his home but did not on that day. Billie Dunn said she took the polygraph test after she was informed that Adkins had failed. Woodrow Tripp, a polygraph expert, told ""Nancy Grace"" that troubles him. ''That absolutely would cause major problems emotionally as she's administered one. You want to try to minimize that as much as possible,"" Tripp said last week. The night Hailey vanished, Dunn says she thought her daughter was sleeping over at a friend's house. Dunn met Adkins on the MySpace social networking site more than two years ago, and he moved in with her several months ago. Hailey is 5 feet, 2 inches tall and weighs 120 pounds. She has hazel eyes and brown hair with blond streaks. When she disappeared, she was wearing navy blue sweatpants, a light-colored short sleeve T-shirt and pink and white tennis shoes. Colorado City Police, who said they could not discuss the affidavits, said there is no evidence the girl is in hiding or ran away. ""Law enforcement has treated the disappearance of Hailey Dunn as a criminal investigation and will continue to make every effort to follow all investigative leads,"" it said in a statement. Authorities on Wednesday said they have searched 80 square miles across multiple counties. They have conducted hundreds of interviews and have followed more than 200 viable leads.","Hailey Dunn was last seen December 27 .

"(Wired) -- Wikipedia turns 10 Saturday, a decade during which the globally crowdsourced online encyclopedia weathered fierce criticism about its reliability and banishment from academia. At the same time, it's so popular it turns up pretty consistently in the top 10 Google results for nearly any search. In a wide-ranging interview with Wired.co.uk, founder Jimmy Wales talks about censorship, staying relevant, and why nothing keeps him awake at night. Wired.co.uk: Did you ever think Wikipedia would be as big as it is, 10 years ago? Jimmy Wales: I remember looking at a list of the top 100 websites and seeing an encyclopedia reference-style site ranked around number 50 and thinking that if we did a really good job we could be in the top 100 or maybe even top 50. But today Wikipedia is the fifth most popular website in the world. What has been the biggest challenge over the last 10 years? I would say that the biggest challenge has been dealing with the growth, and particularly in building an organization behind Wikipedia that is as strong as Wikipedia itself. Hiring Sue Gardner to run the Wikimedia Foundation was one of the best things we ever did. What has been the biggest surprise for you? Although I always wanted Wikipedia to be global, I think I never really grasped what that would mean for the project and for me personally. I never thought about how I might need to travel all over the world to meet people. Do you get tired of defending the integrity of Wikipedia articles? How do you counter the criticism? No, I don't really get tired of it, because I think that our responsibility to help make Wikipedia as good as it possibly can be means that we have to take seriously every legitimate criticism and think about how we can improve. In terms of countering the criticism, I think that today most people understand that Wikipedia is pretty good but not perfect, and that it is getting better all the time. It's really important that our community remain steadfastly committed to taking quality really seriously. Do you see a time when Wikipedia could be a credible academic source? I think it is already generally used and accepted far more in academia than any conventional encyclopedia ever was. What people sometimes forget is that citing [Encyclopaedia] Britannica in an academic paper is not what students should be doing, either. What are your main areas of focus at the moment? I'm focused increasingly on the growth of Wikipedia in the developing world. We are experiencing a lot of growth in a lot of different places, and at the Wikimedia Foundation it is a part of our five-year strategic vision to put resources behind assisting local communities grow and flourish in languages where we are currently small. We're opening our first office outside the U.S. this year, in India, and I'm super excited about that. Are there any legislative issues that threaten the Wikipedia model? I worry about censorship in many parts of the world. It's a major human rights issue and one where we try to be at the forefront of terms of advocating for the free right to share information and learn from others. While I'm optimistic about the direction the world is headed, generally, I think there is a need for constant vigilance and pressure on repressive governments. How did you know that people would give up their time and expertise to create the collaborative encyclopedia? I always thought that people would contribute. I didn't know, before Wikipedia, how to help them contribute, but a lot of my belief in Wikipedia came from participating in some high-quality mailing lists where I met really smart people who were perfectly happy to share what they knew. How do you encourage a more-diverse range of contributors? There are many ways to look at this.... Diversity across languages means that we need to look at technical and performance issues in various places around the world, and that we need to assist local communities with recruitment and publicity. Diversity within the major languages is also desirable ? we want to make it easier for more people to edit ? people who are geeks but not necessarily computer geeks! To what extent do you think Wikipedia represents the best aspects ofthe web ? e.g., democratization of information, power of the crowds? To a very strong extent, I think that Wikipedia shows a hopeful set of possibilities for the future. I'm not a big fan of the terminology ""crowds"" in this context. I think it can be disrespectful to talk about communities in those terms. We aren't a crowd. We are thoughtful and noble individuals working together in peace and by choice for a common goal. How do you stay relevant? We stay relevant mostly by sticking with intense passion to our mission-driven culture. We are here to provide a free, high-quality encyclopedia to every single person on the planet in their own language. It is a simple and powerful charitable mission. Are you never tempted to take advertising? If not, why not? No, not at all. We like being supported by small donors. It's good for Wikipedia and good for the world. What keeps you awake at night? My superpower is sleeping, so nothing really keeps me awake at night. Sometimes, jet lag. Where do you see Wikipedia in 10 years? More languages, more information, higher quality.

"(CNN) -- The Christmas Eve attacks in the volatile Nigerian city of Jos have claimed at least 31 lives, a bloody aftermath in a region long torn by Christian and Muslim hostility. Gyang Choji, a special adviser to the governor of the west African country's Plateau state, confirmed the death toll on Saturday, and said 74 others were wounded. Most of the injured have serious wounds, and some of them suffered leg amputations. Seven blasts rippled through the city as residents celebrated Chrismas Eve, four in the Kabong area and three in Angwa Rubuka. Choji cited a ""lapse in security"" by a special task force not ""doing what they were expected to do."" ""Five different bombs blasts in the heart of Jos. This is the height of insecurity in this city,"" Choji said. Most of the injured have serious wounds; some of them got both legs amputated and the authorities are concerned about their conditions. Choji said no one has claimed responsibility but Islamic fundamentalists are suspected of carrying out the attacks. ""For long, they have been threatening to use violence against Christians and free the region from the shackles of Western imperialism,"" Choji said. The Jos region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. On March 7, at least 200 Christians villagers were massacred near Jos, and more than 150 Muslims were killed in an attack in a nearby town, Kuru Karama, on January 19. Hassan John, a Jos resident and journalist with the media department of the Anglican Diocese of Jos, described a scene of chaos in what was expected to be a joyous Christmas Eve. He had just come out of church about 7 p.m., when he heard the sound of the first explosion. He rushed to the site, which he described as a beer parlor frequented by locals. ""By the time I got there, there were women crying, people screaming. It was all chaos, people were screaming, blood everywhere."" ""I counted eight corpses all over, seven in the building,"" John said. A second blast went off within a couple of minutes after the first one. John said residents, especially young men, became agitated over the lack of security in what has been a volatile area. ""Soldiers fired a couple of rounds into the air because a riot was developing,"" John said. Choji, who is special adviser on religious affairs to the governor, said it was unclear who set off the blasts or whether they were related. But the bombs detonated in the ""same manner,"" Choji said, and they ""all went to where people were concentrated."" In recent weeks, the governor's office had received letters purported to be from some Muslim organizations threatening attacks against Christians, Choji said. ""The security officials didn't take the threat letters seriously. They were thought of as gimmicks, and at the end of the day, they became reality."" A special task force sent to Plateau state by the federal government in the preceding two days had gone on radio telling residents to go about their business and not to worry about the security situation in the area, Choji said. The government had increased security and checkpoints throughout the past week, including additional patrols in various areas of Jos, Choji said. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, more than 13,500 people have died in religious or ethnic clashes since the end of military rule in 1999, the Human Rights Watch said in a report earlier this year. There have been other deadly sectarian clashes in Nigeria over the years, including one outbreak in Jos in September 2001 that left about 1,000 dead, the Human Rights Watch said.

She gives him the prestige that a glamorous woman bestows upon her beau, a few virility points (if we believe that's part of the bargain) and the daily flattery of having a beautiful, and we hope nice, woman fussing over him, holding his hand and making sure he gets his vitamins. Not a bad deal for either of them actually. But the May-December couple also offers a bit more to chew on when we think of large age gaps between partners in general and the urge to marry versus cohabit. In order to think about this kind of relationship more seriously, we have to use the much-mated, just-twice-married Hugh Hefner as a jumping off point, rather than wrestle with his particular motives -- not the least of which might be the fact that his marriages are not a bad advertisement for the Playboy brand. As a sociologist who specializes in studying sexuality, love and relationships and as a consultant to AARP, I do not find late-in-life love or marriage ridiculous, nor do I think age gaps between partners are always a mistake. Hefner brings up these issues, but he certainly shouldn't define them for us. Passion does not necessarily dim over the life cycle. I have a widowed friend who has just turned 83 and has fallen in love again. She had been dating online and asking friends to introduce her to potential partners, because after two years or so of grieving for her husband of many years, she wanted the comfort and thrill of another romantic partner. She found a lovely man, 86, and they have fallen in love and are enjoying life together. They recently returned from a trip to Italy. They live in different urban communities designed for older men and women and spend a lot of time in each other's place. They are a wonderful couple. OK, so they are ""age appropriate,"" but that they are in the market for romance at their age is part of the point. I know other successful couples with large age gaps whose marriages would strike envy in the hearts of anyone who met them. My friends Ray and Gail have a 25-year-plus spread and have been married for over 15 years. He is in his early 80s, she in her 50s. They are spectacularly well-suited for one another and have an active life in the state of Washington and doing charitable dental work in the African bush. Love, when it truly happens, is precious at any age. It is possible at any age. And even if it is not passionate love, even if it is just the comfort of companionship and spending time with someone you respect, it is a boon to the heart, health and happiness of both partners. And it can run both ways: A study released in 2003 by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics concluded that the proportion of women in England and Wales marrying younger men rose from 15% to 26% between 1963 and 1998. I hesitate to congratulate Hefner, not because of his age (he's 84), or even because of his partner's age --but rather because it is hard to know the motives of the rich and famous and the people who marry them. Whether these motives will bring either person in the relationship the support and love that late-life marriage can bring is not known. One final thought: You might be saying, ""But why should they marry? If it's love, can't they just live together? They are probably not going to have children..."" I agree that living together is a good answer for many older people. It is less complicated financially and legally, and it doesn't arouse as much fear in adult children that possible inheritances will be compromised. But there is nothing in our society that certifies the intent of two partners in the same way marriage does. Only marriage presents a clear definition of how a couple wants to be seen and treated by the world, their families, their friends and community. Only marriage brings with it a complete body of law, with traditional privileges and obligations. So yes, if that's what someone wants to say to the world at 84, the same way they would have said at 34, why not? They have the right as adults and citizens. Whether they are making a wise choice of partner is another issue entirely. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pepper Schwartz.","Pepper Schwartz: Easy to joke about Hugh Hefner's plan to wed a much younger woman .
But whatever the motivations, she says, late-life marriages not ridiculous, not always a mistake .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro initially rejected a colostomy procedure when he fell ill in 2006, putting his own life at risk, according to an unnamed medical source quoted by U.S. diplomats in cables released by WikiLeaks. The cables were made available by the Spanish newspaper El Pais Thursday. In one cable dated March 16, 2007, almost eight months after Castro was forced to cede power to his younger brother, the head of the American diplomatic mission quotes unnamed sources as saying the elder Castro fell ill on a short domestic flight after a long day of giving speeches. ""They had to land urgently once they knew of his bleeding,"" the cable says.  ""He was diagnosed with diverticulitis of the colon."" Four of the five diplomatic missives were sent from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The United States does not have formal diplomatic relations with Cuba. Castro's health has long been considered a state secret, and for months there was wild speculation about his illness.  But by the time the March cable was written, it was widely believed that he was suffering from diverticulitis. The same cable quotes an unnamed medical source as saying that Castro ""won't die immediately, but will progressively lose his faculties and become ever more debilitated until he dies."" The author of the cable, U.S. diplomat Michael Parmly, adds, ""We are missing too many variables to be able to predict accurately how many more months Fidel Castro will live."" More than three years later, Castro is alive and well. He has not resumed power, but he began to appear fairly regularly in public in July to deliver speeches on global affairs, particularly about his fear of a looming nuclear war. The cable also says that it was Castro himself who initially rejected a colostomy, a procedure in which one end of the large intestine is surgically cut and brought outside the body through the abdomen.  A bag attached to the opening collects waste. The decision was backed by Castro's main doctor, the cable said, but opposed by the rest of the medical team. ""Fidel Castro, capriciously, did not permit the colostomy,"" the missive said. Diverticulitis is the swelling of pouches in the lining of the intestine that are formed as a result of abnormal pressure in the colon.  A colostomy is sometimes recommended in the treatment of diverticulitis if the colon wall is perforated or if an abscess is formed. Instead, the cables said, Castro chose to undergo an operation to remove the infected part of the colon and splice it back together. ""With the passage of time, as the colon was infected, the operation collapsed and the reattached part separated. They had to operate again, but found a fistula,"" according to the cable.  A fistula is an abnormal connection between two separate parts inside that body that can occur due to inflammation, injury or infection, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Castro himself has since said that he was on death's door and had to undergo various operations because the first one didn't work.","The decision risked Castro's life, the cables say .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. is keeping close watch on the case of an American relief worker jailed in Haiti under suspicion of kidnapping a 15-month-old boy, the State Department said Friday, but it remains unclear whether the U.S. is working for Paul Waggoner's release. ""We have monitored his court appearances and continue to track the case closely,"" said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the State Department. A Haitian judge concluded after a hearing Wednesday that sufficient evidence exists to hold Waggoner while investigators evaluate a man's complaint that the American kidnapped his critically ill son from a hospital, according to Jon Piechowski, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Haiti. Waggoner is the co-founder of Materials Management Relief Corps, a humanitarian organization that seeks to provide logistical support to medical workers in Haiti, where a major earthquake caused extensive damage in January. Waggoner was working at the Haitian Community Hospital in Petionville in February when a Haitian man sought treatment for his 15-month-old son. Accounts differ as to what happened next, but the father believes the child survived and that Waggoner kidnapped him, Piechowski said. Waggoner's supporters, including two physicians, have said the child died, and his body was cremated because the father would not claim the remains. Dr. Kenneth Adams, a volunteer physician on staff at the Haitian Community Hospital, said he was present when the child's father returned to see his son and ""witnessed as the father looked at the baby for several minutes, waiting for the baby to breathe."" The man took pictures with the deceased baby before he left, Adams said. The father filed a complaint against Waggoner in March. Piechowski said Waggoner left Haiti without answering the accusations and was arrested December 12 after returning to the country. Repeated efforts to contact Haitian government officials were unsuccessful Friday. One account provided by supporters say the father handed Waggoner the child at the hospital. Another says Waggoner may have transported the child to the hospital. Regardless, Waggoner had nothing to do with the child's care, according to his supporters. ""I was there through the whole thing, and what kills me is that Paul basically had nothing to do with the whole situation,"" said Jeff Quinlan, who said he was working as director of security at the hospital when the child arrived. Quinlan said he told the father that the boy had died and instructed him to return within 24 hours to take the body. But he said the father instead returned with a ""witch doctor"" claiming the child was still alive. Quinlan and Waggoner's organization said a doctor who treated the boy has signed an affidavit confirming that the child died, saying that the father had viewed the body and that he had declined to claim the remains because he did not have resources to bury the child. Quinlan said he believes Haitian authorities are trying to extort money from Waggoner, who is being held in the National  Penitentiary in Port-au-Prince. Waggoner's sister said she is concerned for his well-being. ""The cells are made for about 10 people, and an average of 70 per cell is the current population,"" Randi Waggoner Lightner said. ""There is nowhere for them to sleep; they don't get baths; water is unsafe if existent."" The State Department has maintained contact with Waggoner's family, Crowley said, and has ""kept his family fully informed."" In February, 10 U.S. missionaries were charged with kidnapping over accusations that they tried to take 33 children out of the country without their parents' approval. Ultimately, all were released and have since returned to the United States. CNN's Danielle Dellorto, Salma Abdelaziz and Umaro Djau contributed to this report.","NEW: Doctor says child's father waited for baby to breathe .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani government has reversed a recent hike in fuel prices, an effort that could help shore up the country's crumbling governing coalition. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani announced the move on Thursday in the National Assembly. It comes days after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement quit the government over fuel price increases and other complaints -- a move that cost Gilani's Pakistan People's Party its majority in the assembly. Gilani called for the establishment of a team that would devise a strategy to combat fluctuation in world petroleum prices and avoid harsh measures, such as the fuel price increase. The government crisis comes at a turbulent time. The U.S. military has been counting on the government to do a robust job of taking on militants in the Pakistani tribal region, but the loss of support is putting Gilani's government on shaky ground. The MQM is one of the largest and most liberal parties in Pakistan, with its stronghold in the southern city of Karachi. Its exit follows December's withdrawal of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal ur Rehman, a leading religious party. Muhammad Anwar, a senior coordinator for the MQM, told CNN that the last straw for the party was the fuel price increases that took effect Saturday. Pakistan's government had raised gasoline prices by 9.2% and increased kerosene prices by nearly 6%, blaming higher crude oil costs for the move. Anwar also said the government had failed to crack down on ""rampant"" corruption and maintain law and order -- particularly in Karachi and the surrounding southern province of Sindh. Businessmen in Karachi ""are virtually hostage"" to extortion and kidnapping rings, he said. MQM leader Faisal Sabzwari said Sunday that the PPP-led government also has imposed unfair taxes on the poor and allowed an energy crisis to fester. The Pakistan Muslim League, another political party, said Wednesday said it will not support the government in its quest to regain a majority. Gilani said recently the ruling PPP would be able to function without a majority in the National Assembly.","One party quit governing coalition over fuel price hikes and other issues .

"(CNN) -- 2010 began with promise for advocates of immigration reform, but it ended with a stark reminder of the obstacles they face. In the two weeks since a Senate filibuster killed the DREAM Act (it stands for Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors), commentators and political strategists have already shifted their focus to the next Congress, where any legislation including legalization of undocumented people is unlikely. To chart a path for the future, however, it's useful to take stock of what DREAM's failure reveals about the bill's opponents. In letting this piece of legislation die, 45 senators allowed restrictionist sentiments to prevail over economic rationality and showed why it is so hard to have a sensible national conversation about immigration. (It won't help them much with the Latino electorate either.) In actual fact, considering immigration through an economic lens makes sense these days, as Americans and their political leaders grapple with an economy climbing out of crisis. It should have been a no-brainer for Congress to promote the development of skilled workers and encourage them to stay here. Instead, they killed the bill that directly confronted what to do with the immigrant potential we already have within our borders. DREAM was not about the relative merits of bringing in new immigrants -- an important question for another day. The most recent version of DREAM offered a way to bring roughly 1 million motivated high school graduates into our formal economy. Conditional upon completing two years of university or military service, undocumented immigrants brought here by their parents as minors would be offered an earned path to citizenship. The students would have been able to go to college, serve in the military, and go on to use their education and talents to contribute to our economy and national security. DREAM was based on the simple premise that we do not punish children for the actions of their parents. But allow me, for the moment, to set aside the critical questions of justice, inclusion, and compassion and focus instead on the economic question. DREAM students have been educated in this country for up to 12 years, and the vast majority of them want to go on to college. In fact, tens of thousands of ""DREAMers"" have already completed at least an associate's degree. By voting against DREAM, the Senators -- 39 Republicans and 6 Democrats -- who either abstained or voted against limiting Senate debate effectively told those immigrants to either remain in the shadows or take their education, motivation, and ingenuity elsewhere. The senators revealed a willingness to squander the investment our country has already made on these young people. The economic effects are quantifiable. First, on the budget: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated that passage of DREAM would have reduced the government deficit over the next 10 years by $2.2 billion because DREAMers would contribute more in taxes and social security payments. Meanwhile the longer-term implications for the deficit are less clear, but the DREAM Act's principal economic benefit would have gone beyond public revenues and spending. As DREAM Act participants attended college and either joined the workforce or continued studying, they would have helped fill our impending labor shortages of nurses, teachers, and computer technicians. No wonder, then, that a recent UCLA analysis found that granting DREAMers legal status would generate at least $1 trillion in income for the U.S. economy over their working lives. Even the conservative United States Chamber of Commerce -- which supported the DREAM Act -- sees the economic benefits of legalizing immigrants like those eligible for DREAM. The Chamber, like outspoken leaders of many Fortune 500 companies, knows that the baby boomers will soon retire and that our increasingly service-based economy needs more young skilled workers here at home. By sending educated young people away we would be doing the opposite of what sensible governments strive for: keeping the skilled labor that all economists identify as critical for economic growth. Meanwhile, allowing them to stay, complete their education, and join the workforce would bolster segments of our economy for which we will soon lack enough qualified workers. But virtually all Republicans and a few conservative Democrats in the Senate refused to heed this simple economic argument. The bill's death-by-filibuster marked the low point for an outgoing Senate that has pandered with nothing but short-sighted enforcement policies. The big question, now, is whether Republican leaders in the new Congress will recognize the need to shift from their current suicide path of alienating Latino voters. Here, the role of conservative advocates of comprehensive immigration reform could be critical. Conservative religious groups, some of whom have begun advocating policy that would show compassion and respect for what they called the ""God-given"" dignity of immigrants, could be a powerful voice in advancing the moral case for reform. Meanwhile, business leaders must further amplify their message about the need for immigrant labor and a sensible system to legalize and regulate it. These two groups would face steep odds in achieving any pro-immigrant legislation in the next two years, but they could begin the important work of bringing shared values and common sense back to this debate -- and setting the stage for the Dream Act's next act. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Altschuler.","Daniel Altschuler says it helps to look at what DREAM Act's failure says about its opponents .

"Sydney (CNN) -- Vast flooding covering much of eastern Australia could remain for weeks, as more than 1,200 residents remain out of deluged homes Wednesday. As of late Wednesday night, the Fitzroy River was hovering around 9.2 meters (30 feet), CNN meteorologist Jennifer Delgado said. ""The river has crested, it appears, and it looks like it is going to be slowly falling as we go through the next several days,"" Delgado said. Are you there? Send us your video and photos via iReport . By next week, floodwaters could remain at levels of about 8.5 meters (28 feet), Delgado said, but flooding could still affect the region for ""several weeks."" The seasonal flooding in the state of Queensland intensified last month after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. The floodwaters cover an area the size of France and Germany combined and now stretch into the state of New South Wales. Images from CNN affiliate Seven Network Australia showed residents traveling down the streets in boats. From the sky, the tops of houses and trees poked out from seas of murky brown water. Snakes whipped about from under the water's surface. Flooding fueled by cyclone, La Nina . Neil Roberts, Queensland minister for police, corrective services and emergency services, said Wednesday that 1,200 to 1,500 people had to be evacuated in parts of Queensland. Roberts said some residents probably can't return to their homes for at least another week. He said the recovery could take ""many months, and potentially over a year."" Roberts said the government had an emergency cabinet meeting Wednesday and appointed a major general to lead a recovery task force. The flooding has affected the global transport of commodities such as coal and steel, as rail lines used to move such goods out of Queensland have been destroyed. Forecasters predict even more rain in the coming days. Delgado said 20 centimeters (8 inches) could fall through Thursday. On Tuesday, relief teams continued rushing supplies into the eastern city of Rockhampton. In some of the state's more rural areas, farmers said they were scrambling to send tons of crops out before waters damaged them and flooding made their transport impossible. Police said 10 people have died as a result of flooding since November 30 -- many of them swept away by swift waters. An airport in Rockhampton, a city of about 75,000 people, closed Sunday and was expected to remain closed for weeks, according to Emergency Management Queensland. At least 200,000 people have been affected by prolonged flooding, police have said. Police have warned residents who have been allowed to return to their homes about placing valuables outside to dry, saying some people could be tempted to take such items. Additional police have been deployed to affected communities. Prime Minister Julia Gillard has urged residents to stay away from the floodwater. On Friday, she toured the devastation and said the flooding in Queensland will cost ""hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.""

"(CNN) -- The new chief of Israel's secret intelligence service is said to be preparing to apologize for the agency's suspected use of forged British passports in an operation that led to the assassination of a founding member of Hamas' military wing in January, according to a report in the UK newspaper the Telegraph. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office declined to comment on the report -- written by a leading Mossad expert -- saying only that it has reiterated its request ""for formal assurances that in the future (the United Kingdom) never would be party to the misuse of British passports."" In Saturday's report, the Telegraph cites unnamed sources as saying that recently appointed Mossad chief Tamir Pardo plans to apologize to UK officials during a trip to London next month ""in an effort to rebuild relations"" between the two countries. Background: UK accuses Israel . The UK expelled an Israeli diplomat in March after concluding Israel had probably forged the country's passports during part of a suspected Mossad operation against Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of the militant group Hamas' military wing. Al-Mabhouh was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. Police believe he was killed the night before, allegedly by Mossad agents. ""Such misuse of British passports is intolerable,"" then-Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in March, adding that the fact that Israel was an ally of the United Kingdom ""only adds insult to injury."" As many as 33 suspects in the case were identified by Dubai police. Most are believed to have acquired faulty passports to go to Dubai for the killing and then fled to far-flung locations, police said. The suspects used British, Irish, French, Australian and German passports. Israel has a stated policy on security matters of neither confirming nor denying involvement.","Tamir Pardo intends to apologize to UK officials next month, newspaper reports .

"London, England (CNN) -- A trial against six environmental activists accused of conspiring to shut down a power station in the UK has collapsed amid questions over the role of an undercover police officer in infiltrating the group. The six were among 114 people originally arrested in a police raid at a school in Nottingham, central England, in April 2009. The protesters planned to trespass and shut down a coal-fired power station at Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Twenty protesters received suspended sentences and conditional discharges earlier this month after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit aggravated trespass at the power station. But a spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement that information which had ""significantly undermined the prosecution's case"" against the six had come to light on January 5. ""In light of this information, the Crown Prosecution Service reviewed the case and decided there was no longer sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. We offered no evidence at a hearing this morning, thereby discontinuing the case."" Defense lawyer Mike Schwarz said he believed the prosecution's actions were influenced by defense plans to disclose material relating to the discovery that one of those arrested in the raid had been undercover police officer called Mark Kennedy, known to the protesters as Mark Stone. ""My clients were not guilty. They did not agree to join in any plan to occupy the power station. The evidence of PC Kennedy presumably confirmed this,"" Schwarz said in a statement. ""Yet that evidence, had it been kept secret, could have led to a miscarriage of justice."" Danny Chivers, one of the six defendants, questioned police motives for the raid, telling CNN: ""This investigation was not in the public interest. It was political policing -- we had done nothing wrong."" Bradley Day, one of the activists involved in plans to protest at the power station, told CNN that Kennedy had played a ""key role in organizing the action,"" including taking part in a recce to the power station. He also offered to pay more than £700 ($1,090) for the cost of a rental vehicle, he said. But most of those at the school had not been aware of the plan prior to that evening's meeting and so had not actively committed to any illegal action, he said. Day said defense lawyers had become aware of Kennedy's role as an undercover police officer while researching the backgrounds of all 114 who had been initially arrested. In an anonymous statement forwarded to CNN by Chivers, one of the defendants said they had known ""Mark Stone"" for five or six years and ""liked and trusted him."" ""Mark was at the meeting for the Ratcliffe action in the late afternoon/early evening of 13/04/09 (so he knew the plan in detail),"" the statement said. The defendant said the pair planned to suspend themselves in a hanging climbing tent beneath the power station's coal conveyer. ""We were going to climb together and I think he was also driving one of the vehicles,"" the statement continued. After their release from police custody, the defendant said he had slept the night on Mark Stone's sitting room floor: ""I remember being awake at about eight the next morning and seeing Mark sitting at the bottom of the stairs with his head in his hands. I assumed that this was him being upset about the arrest rather than anything more complicated."" Schwarz said the case raised ""serious questions relating to the policing of protest, from the use of undercover officers, to the use of expensive and legally questionable mass pre-emptive arrest of protesters, to the use of stringent and unaccountable pre-charge police bail conditions, to the seemingly arbitrary nature by which the 114 initially arrested were reduced to the final 26 who were eventually charged.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The State Department says it has helped relocate a number of people in other countries who, it says, could be in danger because their names have appeared in diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks. ""We are focused on people who have been identified in documents,"" spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, ""and assess whether there's a greater risk to them of violence, imprisonment, or other, you know, serious harm, particularly in repressive societies around the world."" ""In a small number of cases, we have assisted people in moving from where they are to -- to safer locations,"" he said. He declined to say precisely how many people have been re-located but described it as ""a handful."" The State Department refused a request from WikiLeaks to help redact sensitive information before the documents were released in November, saying the documents were illegally obtained and should not be published. WikiLeaks began releasing what it says are 250,000 cables in small batches to four media outlets that, in turn, did some redaction on their own before publishing their stories. WikiLeaks published the redacted documents only when the outlets -- The New York Times, Germany's Der Spiegel, Spain's El Pais and Britain's The Guardian -- published their stories. Crowley said the Department has identified ""several hundred"" people around the world who could be affected and it continues to pour through documents to assess their situation. Potential targets include, Crowley ""civil society, journalists, government officials."" ""In a few instances, we have provided assistance to individuals at risk, and we will continue to reach out to them, to monitor their situation."" In particular cases, Crowley said, the United States has ""made it clear to governments that any adverse actions against individuals identified by WikiLeaks will affect, you know, future relations with those governments."" Crowley denied that informing governments could reveal the identities of potential victims. ""We make clear to governments, without discussing particular identities that, you know, if -- if they do for some reason move on individuals that may be exposed in cables, that that will be something that affects our relations."" ""In certain cases, the people who might be identified are already well known to us and well known to specific governments."" The information is being compiled by a State Department team created in November. It is analyzing Wikileaks documents, Crowley said, and it is ""intensively focused on this on an ongoing basis."" The team includes 30 to 60 staff at any given time. Much of the team's activity, he said, ""is focused here at the State Department.

"Abidjan, Ivory Coast (CNN) -- Ivorians appeared Monday to be ignoring the call for a general strike by the man widely recognized as the Ivory Coast's legitimate leader following last month's presidential run-off election. ""The call for the strike was not followed,"" the assistant press officer for the LIberian Embassy in Washington, Cinthia Guibi, told CNN. ""People went to work; it was just normal."" A reporter in this port city said businesses appeared open as usual, despite Alassane Ouattara's call over the weekend for the strike to force incumbent Laurent Gbagbo from power after his apparent loss in the November 28 presidential runoff. The Ivory Coast's Independent Electoral Commission has named Ouattara, an opposition leader, as the winner. But its Constitutional Council invalidated those results and declared that incumbent Gbagbo won. Ouattara's demand came amid mounting international pressure on Gbagbo to step down. In Paris, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Bernard Valero told reporters Monday that the ministry had received an official request from Ouattara's backers to put his ambassador into place, and was reviewing the person's credentials. The Ivory Coast has been paralyzed by the political stalemate, and scores of people have died in related violence. International powers, including the United States, the United Nations and the African Union, have recognized Ouattara as the winner and urged Gbagbo to cede power. About 14,000 Ivory Coast residents escaping the instability and violence have fled to eastern Liberia, according to the U.N. refugee agency. A few deaths have been reported among the refugees, including a child who drowned during the crossing of the Cestos River into Butuo, Liberia. Observers saw malnourished children and people with malaria, respiratory infections and diarrhea. Sixty-two percent of the refugees are children and 55 percent are female, Liberia's representative to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ibrahima Coly, told CNN on Monday. ""So far, the Liberian population has welcomed these people in a very warm way and they are sharing whatever they have,"" he said from Monrovia. In general, the refugees are ""physically OK,"" he said. ""We have come across a few people who have their feet swollen because they have been walking for more than two or three days before reaching the border. We have seen also some kids who look a bit tired or malnourished, but these are really a limited number so far."" Last Friday, the 15-member Economic Community of West African States said it would not hesitate to use ""legitimate force"" if necessary to defuse the crisis. The African Union has suspended Ivory Coast from the organization ""until such a time the democratically elected president effectively assumes state power."" The World Bank has halted lending and disbursing funds to Ivory Coast and has closed its office in the country. Kyung-wha Kang, the U.N. deputy high commissioner for human rights, has said that between December 16 and December 21, human rights officers had ""substantiated allegations of 173 killings, 90 instances of torture and ill treatment, 471 arrests and detentions and 24 cases of enforced or involuntary disappearances."" She added that the actual numbers may be higher since restrictions on movement by U.N. personnel have made it ""impossible to investigate all the allegations of serious human rights violations, including reports of mass graves."" While acknowledging ""the situation is very, very difficult to live"" in, Charles Ble Goude -- the nation's youth minister under Gbagbo -- disputed the U.N. report's findings. He said Gbagbo supporters were not to blame for the violence. Instead, he accused Ouattara's supporters of using weapons at what had been billed as peaceful rallies to attack soldiers.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Perhaps no one better understands what the family of U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is going through like the widow and children of Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer. ""I mean, my heart is totally with the congresswoman,"" says daughter Sara Taseer. What do an American lawmaker from Arizona and a Pakistani governor have in common? Both outspoken elected officials were gunned down in broad daylight, within days of each other. Taseer died; Giffords clings to life. Separated by half a world, they are united by similar crimes. Taseer was assassinated by his own security guard last week in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital. He was coming out of a popular market when the guard, Mumtaz Qadri, opened fire and shot him 27 times. Governor's accused killer makes unscheduled court appearance . Taseer had been an outspoken critic of Pakistan's blasphemy laws, which make it a crime to insult Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. He argued that in a country that's 98% Muslim, these laws are used to discriminate against minorites. That's dangerous talk in a nation increasingly swayed by a more conservative brand of Islam, and several clerics targeted Taseer as a blasphemer himself. Qadri confessed in court Monday that he killed Taseer because of his support to change the blasphemy laws. And that, Taseer's family says, is where his shooting diverges from Giffords'. Sara Taseer says, ""The difference is in Pakistan, this is not a message just to my father or my family. This is a message to all liberal and progressive people to keep quiet, and scare and intimidate them."" She says Giffords' shooting was an isolated incident, which has no chance of gaining popular support in the United States. ""The impact is different. And the fear among the people. I'm sure in Arizona the general public is not feeling threatened, or not fearing that they can voice their views or openly condemn it. We are in a totally different situation. People who support us can lose their own lives."" Shooting rampage suspect to make first court appearance . Another difference: even Giffords' political opponents publicly and forcefully condemned the man who shot her. The Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner went on TV to say, ""An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve."" But in Pakistan, even Taseer's supporters have been mostly silent: perhaps calling his loss a tragedy, but stopping short of criticizing the man who killed him. ""It's because they fear for their lives,"" says Taseer's son Shehryar. ""There's also been a warning issued [by clerics] against anyone who has any further vigils, and anyone who takes up the case of the governor and his family, their offices will be burned and their person killed."" Shehryar says that was the real tragedy of his father's shooting: it's forcing liberals to stay quiet and hide. ""I think they'll be hunted. Without a doubt in my mind I believe that."" Taseer's shooter has been hailed as a hero by many conservative Muslims in Pakistan. He has been cheered, and showered with rose petals on his way into court. ""That's ...it makes me sick. It makes me sick to my stomach,"" says Taseer's youngest daughter Shehrbano. ""Some people genuinely believe this was 'the right thing' to have been done. That's the most scary and upsetting aspect of it. It's disgusting."" Shehrbano graduated from college in Massachusetts, and now works as a journalist in Pakistan. She reserves some of her strongest criticism for Pakistan's legal system. ""There were over 200 lawyers who went and put garlands and rose petals around my father's assassin's neck. And these men are the so-called vanguards of justice."" Shehrbano has little to no faith that the Anti-Terrorism Court where Mumtaz Qadri is being tried will produce a fair result. ""They have a sorry record of convictions. The investigation teams, they don't hand in enough evidence. The lawyers are scared. The judges are bribed. People are terrified of taking a stand."" Now his family is looking back at the life of Salmaan Taseer, a businessman and governor of one of the most-populated provinces in the world. His widow Amna says, ""When I started my marriage, he was arrested and put in a Lahore fort for four months. It was a very difficult period, but we made it through that. And it's kind of ended in such a dramatic way also. But on top of it all I say one thing: that he was a great father and even better husband."" The family says privately, they've received thousands of messages, letters and visits to console them. Shehrbano says a Christian woman approached her after the assassination. ""She told me 'Your father was all we had.'"" They're also looking ahead, to what legacy Taseer leaves for the future. His daughter Shehrbano says, ""I hope his passing doesn't mean that the room for debate is over. I believe there's room in the public sphere for moderates, for liberals. I really hope that this doesn't mean that debate in Pakistan is over."" His son Shehryar says he refuses to back down from the causes his father stood for. ""It's not a Taseer trait. Taseers are fighters. He believed in Pakistan too much to ever back down. In fact his last tweet was 'Even if I'm the last one standing, I'd still support it.'"" And daughter Sara says, ""He had a liberal and progressive and secular vision. And he ...this country needed him. This country needed people like him. The region needed people like him. The world, I think, needs people like him.""","Taseer and Giffords were both gunned down .

"(CNN) -- LeBron James is going home to Cleveland Thursday night wearing a Miami Heat jersey, and no less an authority than the basketball-loving president of the United States predicts a rough night. ""It's going to be brutal,"" Barack Obama told reporters Thursday, hours before tip-off. Just to make sure the court is safe for King James, the Cleveland Cavaliers say they will beef up security at Quicken Loans Arena, NBA officials have said. Mary Schmitt Boyer, Cavaliers beat writer for the Cleveland Plain Dealer newspaper, said local fans' anger could surface Thursday. ""There is a good deal of anger. And I think despite many pleas from fans for sort of nonviolent protests, I think they are probably going to just let LeBron have it,"" Boyer said. Former NBA great Kevin McHale agreed that James has more to fear from the fans than the Cavaliers themselves. ""This is their chance to express how they feel. This is the one chance for the fans to yell and scream and boo and get all that off their chest,"" he told CNN. His former teammates will want to beat James, McHale said, but as a friendly rivalry, ""like wanting to beat your brother."" James used to be the toast of Ohio but became public enemy No.1 this summer when he announced on a television special that he was leaving for South Beach to play with the Miami Heat. The decision brought much criticism and sent some Cleveland fans to the streets to burn James' jersey. Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert seemed to add fuel to fire when he released an emotional statement on the team's website the night James made the announcement. Gilbert called James' decision a ""cowardly betrayal"" and a ""shocking act of disloyalty,"" part of the statement said. He then added, in all capital letters:""I PERSONALLY GUARANTEE THAT THE CLEVELAND CAVALIERS WILL WIN AN NBA CHAMPIONSHIP BEFORE THE SELF-TITLED FORMER 'KING' WINS ONE. You can take it to the bank."" Gilbert, who was fined by the NBA for that statement, has since softened his tune. He recently urged Cavaliers fans to be classy when James arrives home Thursday, according to NBA.com. James joined the Cavaliers straight out of high school and played forward for the team for seven seasons. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player when he was with the Cavaliers but he never won the NBA championship. He led the Cavaliers to the NBA finals in 2007, where they lost to the San Antonio Spurs, but never reached the finals again, despite Cleveland management bringing in supporting stars such as Shaquille O'Neal and Antawn Jamison. James said he will be dealing with his emotions when he returns home for the much-anticipated game. ""It's going to be very emotional for myself,"" James told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""I got a lot of great memories in that city. I give a lot of thanks to that city, a lot of thanks to those fans for giving me the opportunity to not only showcase my talents but grow from a boy to a young man.""

"(CNN) -- David Villa continued his remarkable scoring run against Deportivo La Coruna as Spanish champions Barcelona won 4-0 on Saturday night to move five points clear in La Liga. The Spain striker reached the milestone of 150 career league goals as he notched his 11th in 14 encounters with the Galicians. Lionel Messi made it 2-0 in the second half with a superb free-kick before late strikes from Andres Iniesta and Pedro put more pressure on Real Madrid, who host third-placed Villarreal on Sunday night. Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola rested Xavi, Sergio Busquets and Daniel Alves ahead of Wednesday's Spanish Cup quarterfinal first-leg against second division Real Betis, giving midfielders Javier Mascherano and Seydou Keita a rare start along with Brazilian Adriano at fullback. Who is the world's best footballer? Xavi is one of three players on an all-Barcelona shortlist vying to win the inaugural FIFA Ballon d'Or award for the world's best player on Monday along with Messi and World Cup hero Iniesta. Mascherano was involved in the opening goal in the 26th minute as he threaded a pass to Messi, who found Villa in space in the penalty area and the former Valencia star fired a shot under the body of goalkeeper Daniel Aranzubia. It was Villa's 12th goal in the league this season and his 14th overall. He has some way to go to match Messi, who curled his 18th of the La Liga campaign past a bemused Aranzubia in the 51st minute. Iniesta cut in from the right to lash in a fierce left-foot shot with 10 minutes to go for his fifth league goal this season, and barely 60 seconds later winger Pedro pounced for his ninth and 14th overall. In the first half, French fullback Eric Abidal thought he had followed up his first goal for Barca in the midweek cup draw at Athletic Bilbao but was flagged for offside to deny him just a third career strike. The result left Deportivo, who had conceded only five goals in eight previous home games this season, in 12th place on 21 points after 18 rounds. Sevilla moved up to ninth place with a 3-2 win at Real Sociedad, who suffered a fourth successive defeat. Two goals in three second-half minutes turned the match as the visitors came from 1-0 and 2-1 down, with Fredi Kanoute netting twice and strike partner Luis Fabiano scoring the other. Diego Rivas gave Sociedad the lead in the 23rd minute with a right-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area, but Kanoute leveled two minutes later with a volley from Fabiano's header down following a lofted corner. Joseba Llorente caught out the Sevilla defense just before halftime as he won the race to a speculative long clearance and poked in a volley, but Fabiano stabbed home from close range on 63 for his fifth league goal of the season. He had been set up by Alvaro Negredo, brought on as a third forward, and the former Real Madrid player was also a provider for Kanoute's winner as the Malian calmly slotted in the winner off the near post. Athletic Bilbao snatched a last-gasp equalizer to earn a 1-1 draw at Malaga which left the Basque club on 26 points with Sevilla and Getafe -- only five points off the top four. Malaga's Argentine defender Martin Demichelis headed an 80th-minute opener on his first appearance since signing from Bayern Munich, but Spain midfielder Javi Martinez struck at the end to leave the hosts just four points above the bottom three.","Barcelona striker David Villa scores the 150th La Liga goal of his career .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- A laptop with two touch-screens in lieu of a keyboard, tablets running an unfinished version of Google's Android, 3-D TV sets that don't require glasses. These are some of the most buzzed-about gadgets at the Consumer Electronics Show, but many of them aren't fully developed yet or primed for firsthand testing. And electronics makers are going to great lengths with smoke and mirrors to hopefully distract audiences from noticing the unknowns -- like how a product actually works when not under carefully controlled conditions. CNN spotted this trend early with tablets we weren't allowed to touch. On Motorola's popular Xoom units, only videos of the new Android system are shown, not usable software. Research in Motion finally let people get their hands on its BlackBerry PlayBook, but some online blogged their disappointments when they discovered that things like standalone calendar and e-mail clients are seemingly missing from these versions. Getting sneak peeks at unpolished work is part of the fun of CES. But enthusiasm should be tempered because many of the concept products shown in years past have never materialized. Perhaps gadget enthusiasts prefer captivating concepts rather than actual products that may not end up being executed perfectly. The winner of the Last Gadget Standing contest on Saturday was the product that seemed to be the furthest from reality. Acer's Iconia, a touch-screen laptop with two displays where one replaces a keyboard, won the top honors. Winners are determined through a largely unscientific measurement of crowd enthusiasm. The Iconia would let users type on a touch-screen keyboard similar to the iPad, or draw, flick and zoom with their fingers. Acer didn't announce details regarding pricing or availability. The device was demonstrated onstage using concept videos. Acer presented a corn-ball act, with pretty girls dressed in ""Star Trek"" garb and two men posing as the characters Spock and Captain Kirk. (Because all nerds love ""Star Trek,"" right?). After a first video ran showing the Iconia, the two actors said they would demonstrate the device onstage. As they moved their hands around the laptop set on the podium, the video behind them showed the Spock actor's fingers manipulating Iconia software. That was until a cameraman for the event began shooting from behind the actors to reveal that they were waving their hands in front of a regular, old laptop with a keyboard. ""You've got to show our video, guys!"" the fellow dressed as Kirk shouted to the event organizers. ""Iconia is way ahead of its time, Spock."" An actual version of the computer was on display and open for testing at Microsoft's CES booth. Typing on it is difficult and somewhat uncomfortable. Visually, the software looks like a version of Windows with touch-screen features, like a button to activate the keyboard, duct taped on top. Despite that, Acer still won the Last Gadget Standing competition. The audience was unimpressed with Fujifilm's FinePix 3-D camera or Samsung's Nexus S Google phone, both of which are already available on the market. Samsung brought out a guy dressed as a gingerbread man (a costume that looked more like a spastic beaver) to promote the smartphone, which is the only one that comes with the Gingerbread version of Android. Then Samsung spokesman Kim Titus made a series of nauseating puns. ""No biting questions,"" he said. Maybe Samsung should have invested in some Stormtrooper costumes instead.","Acer's Iconia laptop, with a touch-screen instead of a keyboard, was well received .

"New York (CNN) -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Thursday that some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems in a pilot program meant to better track sanitation vehicles as officials brace for a winter storm. ""It gives us the ability to check on the location and progress of our snow plows,"" Bloomberg told reporters, saying that the devices will be added to some trucks in New York's Brooklyn and Queens boroughs where heavy snowfall last month left many residents snowbound. The city will also deploy scout teams to transmit video images of neighborhoods back to City Hall during clean-up efforts, the mayor said. He added that John Doherty, Sanitation Department chief, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn following sharp criticism for the city's slow reaction to the holiday blizzard. That response has prompted an investigation into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed clean-up efforts over frustrations of demotions and citywide budget cuts. ""These are only initial improvements,"" Bloomberg said. ""Certainly not the last word on the subject."" He said Department of Investigations Commissioner Rose Gill Hearn is also conducting an independent review over allegations of a slowdown. Joseph Mannion, president of the Sanitation Officers Association, said there was no coordinated effort to deliberately delay clean-up efforts among supervisors. The association later posted comments, saying: ""When you look around your neighborhood and wonder what the heck happened with the City's snow fighting ability you don't have to look any further than City Hall."" The heavy slow hampered morning commuters, delayed first responders and even prevented aircraft service personnel from reaching airports where 29 international flights were stuck on the tarmac for more than three hours, officials said. On Wednesday, Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano replaced the man who led the Emergency Medical Service after 170 ambulances became trapped during the blizzard. ""This city will be better off with a different person in charge,"" the mayor said. The states of New York and New Jersey had loaned the city 35 ambulances to help reduce the backlog of emergency medical services requests during the storm. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, said Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut starting early Friday. Forecasters project between two and four inches of snow, with heavier amounts of snow expected over eastern sections of Long Island.","Mayor Bloomberg: Some city snow plows will be fitted with global positioning systems .

"(CNN) -- David Beckham's proposed loan move to Tottenham has been called off, but the soccer superstar will still train with the English club to maintain his fitness during the U.S. off-season. Tottenham had hoped the former England captain would join up in a temporary three-month move to boost the club's Premier League and Champions League hopes. The 35-year-old LA Galaxy player could have made his debut against former team Manchester United, where he made his name, next Sunday. However, the London side's website said the midfielder's Major League Soccer club would not let Beckham stay longer than February 10. Who will be the bargains of the January sales? ""We'd love to have him here for longer but we respect his commitments to LA Galaxy. They wanted him back in early February so that made it difficult to do a playing deal on the basis of three weeks,"" manager Harry Redknapp said on Sunday. ""David is a fantastic professional -- he will be a great influence around the place and I am sure we will all benefit from his winning mentality. I think everyone will enjoy having him here."" However, Redknapp said on Sunday night that he still hoped the deal could be resurrected. ""Hopefully it could still happen. The situation is ongoing,"" he told reporters following the 3-0 FA Cup win over third division Charlton. Beckham is still hoping to win his England place back, having been discarded by national coach Fabio Capello after suffering an Achilles injury in his second loan stint at Italian club AC Milan last year which ruled him out of the World Cup in South Africa. ""It's important that I maintain a high level of fitness during the MLS off-season. I'm thankful to Tottenham and Harry Redknapp for giving me the opportunity to train with the team over the next month,"" he told the Tottenham website. ""I'm grateful to the LA Galaxy for allowing to me to train with Spurs. I look forward to getting to work as soon as possible."" Redknapp had told reporters earlier on Sunday that the deal was unlikely due to insurance problems, with the Galaxy worried Beckham might suffer another long-term injury. The player trained with Tottenham's London rivals Arsenal at the start of 2008, which helped him win his 100th international cap when Capello recalled him at the start of the Italian's tenure. Meanwhile, Beckham and his wife Victoria announced on Sunday that they are expecting a fourth child later this year. The couple already have sons Brooklyn, 11, Romeo, 8, and Cruz, 5.","Los Angeles Galaxy want David Beckham back in February ahead of new MLS season .

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund moved seven points clear in the German Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over fellow title hopefuls Hamburg in front of a sellout home crowd of 80,720 on Friday night. Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scored the opener four minutes after halftime, and was also involved as Paraguay forward Lucas Barrios killed off the visitors with 19 minutes to play. It was Dortmund's 10th victory in 12 league matches this season, with Jurgen Klopp's team unbeaten since losing on the opening day in August. ""It took us a while to get into the game, but things worked better for us after the break,"" Klopp told AFP, with the club seeking a first league crown since 2002. ""Hamburg came back into the game late on, which made life hard for us. But we are very happy with the win."" In the 49th minute, Lukas Piszczek found space to pick out Kagawa, and the midfielder fired in a shot that deflected off Hamburg defender Heiko Westermann for his sixth goal this season. Kagawa initiated the move that doubled the lead, with Barrios claiming his seventh of the campaign from Kevin Grosskreutz's cross. The result left Hamburg in seventh place in a group of four clubs on 18 points ahead of Saturday's matches. Second-placed Mainz, who have 24 points, host Hannover and third-placed Bayer Leverkusen travel to St. Pauli. Elsewhere, Werder Bremen host Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg are at home to struggling Schalke, Cologne face Borussia Monchengladbach in a battle of the bottom two clubs, and Stuttgart travel to Kaiserslautern in another lower-table affair.

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's top military man warned Monday of a potentially dangerous gulf between the civilian world and men and women in uniform. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said most Americans know ""precious little"" about the military. ""To the degree we are out of touch I believe it is a very dangerous force,"" Mullen said in a speech to a conference on military professionalism at the National Defense University in Washington. The disconnect between the civilian and military worlds is partially because only a fraction of the population serves and those in uniform increasingly hail from fewer, primarily rural, areas of the country, Mullen said. ""Our audience, our underpinnings, our authority, everything we are, everything we do, comes from the American people,"" Mullen said. ""Fundamentally I believe that. Everything we do, and we cannot afford to be out of touch with them."" Fewer Americans have personal contact with members of the military, he said. ""They know that we are in two wars, we've sacrificed a lot, lost a lot of people, over 5,500 people. They are very supportive of that,"" Mullen said. ""They care a lot about great young men and women that they know. Many of them don't know that many, and it just speaks to the disconnect."" The comments echo that of Defense Secretary Robert Gates who, in a September speech, told a college audience the volunteer forces carry an unfair burden in fighting the protracted wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. ""Whatever their fond sentiments for men and women in uniform, for most Americans the wars remain an abstraction, a distant and unpleasant series of news items that do not affect them personally,"" Gates said at Duke University. ""Even 9/11, in the absence of a draft, for a growing number of Americans, service in the military, no matter how laudable, has become something for other people to do."" Mullen was one of the movers behind the day-long conference at the National Defense University. He used the span of his own career to show how public support for the military had risen dramatically from the lows of the Vietnam era. ""American people are extraordinarily supportive of our men and women ... there is a sea of good will,"" he said. The military must work to build and sustain trust or risk negative consequences, he said. Mullen predicted, ''We will find out that, yes we are less than 1% and we are living in fewer and fewer places and we don't know the American people and the American people don't know us.""","Fewer people serve from fewer parts of the country, Mullen says .

"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's Constitutional Court Thursday struck down key parts of a law that would protect Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi from prosecution. The law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court. But Italy's top court ruled that 18 months is too long, and that judges, not politicians, should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court. The law will automatically be modified to conform with the ruling when the Constitutional Court publishes its verdict. The court heard arguments Tuesday about the legality of the ""legitimate impediment"" law, which would have granted top Italian government officials what amounted to immunity while they were in office. The Berlusconi-backed law said top government officials could not be prosecuted because their official duties made it impossible for them to attend court hearings. The law was approved in March 2010, but prosecutors in Milan challenged the constitutionality of the measure, saying it should be judges, not politicians, who determined whether someone had time to attend court. Two separate trials against Berlusconi are pending. He's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case, and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another. Both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed. Berlusconi has called the charges politically motivated. A third case against the prime minister, also related to tax fraud, is in preliminary stages. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994, but remains very popular with the Italian public. The immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed, which would have been in October.","NEW: The law will automatically be modified by the court ruling .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- In between consoling those touched by Saturday's Arizona shooting and warning the nation against politicizing the tragedy, President Barack Obama delivered some good news in his address at a Tucson memorial event on Wednesday. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona has opened her eyes for the first time since being shot four days ago. ""There is nothing I can say that will fill the sudden hole torn in your hearts,"" Obama said. ""But know this: The hopes of a nation are here tonight."" Did you watch the speech? Share your thoughts in a short video . The attack killed six and left Giffords fighting for her life. Obama told a crowd of thousands that he visited Giffords earlier on Wednesday and that her husband told him that shortly after the president left her room, ""Gabby opened her eyes for the first time."" ""Gabby opened her eyes so I can tell you know she knows we are here, she knows that we love her and she knows that we are rooting for her through what will undoubtedly be a difficult journey,"" Obama said. Obama and his wife, Michelle, sat next to Giffords' husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, throughout the ceremony, and next to Daniel Hernandez, an intern in Giffords' office who tended to the congresswoman's wounds after she was shot. Obama called Hernandez a hero in his speech Wednesday, though Hernandez rejected that description in an earlier speech at the memorial event. The president spoke at the University of Arizona's McKale Memorial Center, which the school said held just under 14,000 people on Wednesday night, with an overflow crowd of 13,000 outside. Obama spoke about Giffords and briefly eulogized each of those killed in the attack before moving on to warn Americans against assigning blame for the attacks to those other than the gunman. ""At a time when our discourse has become so sharply polarized -- at a time when we are far too eager to lay the blame for all that ails the world at the feet of those who think differently than we do -- it's important for us to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds,"" Obama said. ""Scripture tells us that there is evil in the world, and that terrible things happen for reasons that defy human understanding,"" he said. "" ... Bad things happen, and we must guard against simple explanations in the aftermath."" ""What we can't do is use this tragedy as one more occasion to turn on one another,"" he said later. Obama's speech was frequently punctuated by applause and cheers from the crowd, at times seeming to belie the somber reason for the memorial. But Obama sounded an uplifting tone, saying of the victims: ""Our hearts are broken by their sudden passing. Our hearts are broken -- and yet, our hearts also have reason for fullness."" Beyond Hernandez, the president praised those who tackled the gunman as he stopped to reload and the medical staff who treated the wounded. ""These men and women remind us that heroism is found not only on the fields of battle,"" Obama said. ""They remind us that heroism does not require special training or physical strength. Heroism is here, all around us, in the hearts of so many of our fellow citizens, just waiting to be summoned -- as it was on Saturday morning."" ""It was pretty much what the nation needed to hear at this time,"" said Lorenzo Cotton, a retired architect who attended the speech. ""Tucson is a great place with a lot of great people,"" Cotton said, adding that Obama's speech ""put Tucson back in a positive light. It is a community and it is a place where we all get along and, together, care for each other."" Other public officials took the stage before Obama, with many invoking scripture. ""We will remember how to smile again,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said. ""We will go forward together."" Secretary of Homeland Security and former Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, Brewer's predecessor as governor, read from the book of Isaiah, while Attorney General Eric Holder reads from the Second Letter of Paul to the Corinthians. The crowd was dotted with other prominent Arizonans, including Sen. John McCain and retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Earlier Wednesday afternoon, the Obamas visited with Giffords and with other survivors of the shooting and the medical staff that treated them at Tucson's University Medical Center. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, said they were with the congresswoman when she opened her eyes for the first time since the shooting. ""You could see she was focusing and Mark said, 'Gabby if you can see me, give me the thumbs up' and not only did she give the thumbs up she raised her entire hand,"" Gillibrand said, referring to Giffords' husband. ""The doctors couldn't believe it,"" Gillibrand said. ""She went from opening her eyes really just in slits to opening them nearly fully."" Obama visited about 100 people at the hospital, a White House aide said. Napolitano and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi traveled with the Obamas. Giffords' recovery is ""going as anticipated,"" and doctors are seeing what they want to see so far, the hospital treating her said earlier in the day. Peter Rhee, chief of emergency medicine at University Medical Center in Tucson, said ""none of the downward events have occurred at this time"" in her recovery. Doctors have decreased the amount of sedation they are giving her, and she is ""becoming more and more spontaneous all the time,"" Rhee added. Also Wednesday, Giffords' congressional office released a statement thanking Americans for their support since the shooting. ""The outpouring of support from the people of Arizona and Americans across the country has been truly moving,"" the statement said. ""We appreciate everyone's thoughts and prayers during this difficult time."" Giffords' office acknowledged the bipartisan response in the Congress to the tragedy. "" ... Starting with Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi, staff and Members from both sides of the aisle have reached out in words and deeds to help our office in our time of need,"" the statement said. Of the six patients the hospital is still treating from Saturday's shooting, Giffords is the only one in critical condition. Two others are in serious condition, the other three are in fair condition, Rhee said. A 9-year-old girl and Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll, were among those killed at a constituent meeting Giffords was holding at a Tucson supermarket. Authorities say Giffords was the target of Saturday's shooting. Thirteen people suffered gunshot wounds, the Pima County Sheriff said in a statement Tuesday night. Some other people were injured trying to flee the scene, the sheriff said. Tucson resident Jared Loughner, 22, has been charged in the attack. Giffords' Chief of Staff Pia Carusone, meanwhile, said the Giffords family is ""very strong, very supportive. You know, she's a young, healthy person who is not only physically strong, but mentally resilient and, you know, they're rising to the occasion."" Carusone added, ""They've got a long road ahead of them, not just the physical recovery, but the tragedy that this community is having to absorb is -- it's monumental and it's going to be ... a difficult thing to get through."" Meanwhile, Arizona state lawmakers passed legislation Tuesday barring protesters at funerals from getting within 300 feet of services. Brewer, who visited the injured Tuesday, later signed the bill. The action, according to Arizona House Republican spokesman Daniel Scarpinato, was in direct response to the controversial Westboro Baptist Church's announcement that it would picket the funeral of 9-year-old victim Christina Green on Thursday. Shirley Phelps-Roper, a spokeswoman for Westboro, told CNN that the church has decided not to protest at the girl's funeral. She said her group made a deal with a radio host not to protest there in exchange for airtime. However, she said church members would protest at the funeral of U.S. District Judge John Roll and other victims on Friday. The Steve Sanchez Radio Show on KXXT AM in Phoenix offered the group 30 minutes on his show on Saturday in exchange for not protesting at Green's funeral. The deal was established through an e-mail exchange, which was forwarded to CNN. In one e-mail, a representative of the show informs Phelps-Roper that the group will have to avoid profanity and that the platform will ""allow you to express your views and allow you as guest and Steve Sanchez as host to have a civil dialogue and discord."" Phelps-Roper responded that the group had no problem with the rules. CNN's John Sutter contributed to this report.","Obama says Rep. Giffords has opened her eyes for first time since shooting .

"(CNN) -- China took advantage of a Kuwait sending-off to make a winning start to the 2011 Asian Cup on Saturday. The 2-0 victory mirrored the result of Friday's tournament-opening match, leaving two teams on three points in Group A following Uzbekistan's surprise win over hosts Qatar. Kuwait had to play for almost an hour with only 10 men at Al Gharafa Stadium after defender Musaed Neda was sent off in the 35th minute for kicking out at Yang Xu following a tussle for the ball. Defender Zhang Linpeng put China ahead in the 58th minute when his shot took a big deflection to leave goalkeeper Nawaf Al Khaldi stranded, with Kuwait having failed to properly clear a corner. Qatar welcomes half the world . Deng Zhuoxiang sealed victory eight minutes later with a curling freekick after substitute Hao Junmin was fouled just outside the penalty area. ""I'm very happy to win this game,"" China coach Gao Hongbo told the AFP news agency. ""The first match is always very tough, very hard. ""For the first 30 minutes the Kuwait team did very well, but after that our team controlled the match. The four teams in Group A are very close, so any result can help. We will have to wait until the last game to see who will qualify."" Kuwait's Serbian coach Goran Tufegdzic was unhappy that Australian referee Benjamin Williams did not award his team a penalty in the opening 20 minutes when China skipper Du Wei brought down Bader Al Mutawa. Hosts Qatar shocked in Asian Cup opener . ""I don't want to make comments about referees but lots of people said he made many, many mistakes,"" Tufegdzic told AFP. ""I think the relevant commission will have to look at the match and give a punishment for this referee."" China next play Qatar on Wednesday, when Kuwait face Uzbekistan. The Group B matches kick off on Sunday, with Japan playing Jordan and 2007 runners-up Saudi Arabia taking on Syria. The 16-team tournament, played every four years, sees defending champions Iraq facing Iran in Group D on Tuesday.","Kuwait's Musaed Neda becomes first player to be sent off at 2011 Asian Cup .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- This is a story of two test drives, albeit two very different ones. Recently I got behind the wheels of two highly anticipated new-model electric cars -- the first of what could be a new wave of electric vehicles in the United States. Made available for my scrutiny as a typical driver were the all-electric Nissan Leaf and the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt. I drove the Leaf about five miles around the city streets of Atlanta (with a brief highway detour) and the Chevrolet Volt 630 miles from Orlando, Florida, to Raleigh, North Carolina. It was 15 minutes in the Leaf versus 10 hours in the Volt. Both driving experiences showed me that these cars are very much like piloting a ""normal"" vehicle -- with one difference -- it's much easier to sneak up on people. Electric range/gas mileage . We drove the Leaf at a Georgia Power/City of Atlanta/Nissan event near the CNN headquarters. The route was about 2 miles and we deviated another couple of miles by taking it exit-to-exit on the Downtown Connector (luckily it was before our 180-minute rush hour). With such a short drive, neither we nor any of the other 20 drivers who came out to the test drive came close to wearing down the battery. When I took my turn behind the wheel, we had 73 miles of electric range left. When I exited the vehicle, there were 68 miles remaining. Nissan says the car should go 100 miles on a full charge, but that depends on weather conditions and driving style. A few days later we hopped in the Volt in Orlando. A team of Chevy engineers and PR folks were traveling north to Raleigh for some public events. Heading east on I-4, I had about 40 miles of electric range. As I accelerated I paid scant attention to the green ball on the digital display that tells you how economical you're driving. With a half-day's drive in front of me, I wasn't interested in saving power, only time. About 38 miles east of Orlando, driving about 70 mph, the batteries were down to the minimum. Now, in a purely electric-powered car you'd have to pull over and charge up. But the Volt has a gas-powered generator that comes on when the batteries are nearly depleted. It creates electricity to keep the batteries minimally charged to drive the car (and at certain points it helps turn the wheels). We traveled the remaining 600 miles on gas-powered electricity, and at speeds about 8 to 10 mph over the limit, we averaged about 37.1 mpg. Related story: Range-anxiety a concern for electric car buyers . Noise . It's nearly impossible to describe the absence of noise, but both cars are eerily silent. It's like riding in a golf cart; you turn it on but there's no sound. Even when you're merging into traffic at 70 mph in the Leaf (hey, I was going with traffic), the vehicle makes very little noise. When I ran down the Volt battery, the gas engine kicked on without much fanfare. I was told it was about to happen and I still didn't really hear it start. I pretended to notice, but I was guessing. With the radio on, I doubt you'd hear it at all. When we drove into Savannah, Georgia, for lunch, we took the car down an alley to park. A happy couple -- full of local food and sunshine -- sauntered aimlessly in front of us, oblivious to the fact that our car was creeping up three feet behind them. So I pulled the bright lights bar to activate the horn designed to let pedestrians know there's a Volt nearby. The pedestrian horn is quieter and more polite sounding than the regular Volt horn, which is accessed from where you'd expect it to be on the steering wheel. Pickup . Electric cars can get up and go. At least initially. Both cars responded impressively to a foot mash on the pedal from a dead stop. I never got a chance to test the Leaf's passing ability on the highway, but I sure did during the Volt journey. We encountered a few slower cars in the left lane. I drive an old Acura TL, with 210,000 miles accumulated in my own journeys to North Carolina. Based on my car's performance, I guessed the amount of time my TL needs to make a highway pass and applied it to the Volt. Most of the time, I'd clear the car enough to pass -- but not with the same amount of room to spare. And a couple of times I had to slow down, fall back and get in line again. It just seemed to take a long time to go from 60 mph to 70 mph. Comfort . The Leaf and the Volt are smaller cars and I'm a semi-big man (6-1, 240). Both had comfortable front seats, but the leg room in the back was a little cramped, especially if the driver is my height or taller. My back did get a bit tight after three hours straight in the Volt's driver's seat, but I switched on the heated seats. Although my glutes got a bit toasty, it did help with my lower back. We drove about four hours at a time and each time I got out to stretch my legs, I wasn't stiff or leg wobbly at all. My colleagues who came along on the Leaf ride were a bit shorter than me, and they had no problems with legroom or headroom. Styling . These cars aren't going to get looks at stoplights, until people realize they are electric cars. That's when you get the questions. But to me, they're both nicer looking cars when you see them in person. The Leaf was red -- and it drew raves from the test drivers. One said she thought even her teenage daughter would approve. We caught a few people on the highway snapping camera-phone pictures of the Volt. (There were four Volts in the caravan, so by the time you passed the third one, you had time to figure out what was going on). Many buyers will care more about how the cars are fueled than they will about the cars' styling. But they also won't be caught driving a car as ugly as some of the previous electric vehicles on the market. Overall . Both cars live up to their hype. The Leaf is cute and peppy and has enough room for five people for a short trip. The extras -- like satellite navigation that can find charging stations and the ability to start the air conditioning or heater a few minutes before you get in the car -- are great. It will cost $32,780 before a federal credit of $7,500 and state credits of up to $5,000. Details on electric car tax breaks . A hundred miles should cover most commutes and errands, so the Leaf would make a good second car, a car for a high school driver, or the in-town resident who has easy access to charging. The Volt is a car for people who want to run on batteries during the workweek and be able to go on a weekend trip without renting another car. It's a small car on the outside, but has the feel of an expensive car on the inside (although at $41,000 before a federal tax credit, it is a bit pricey for most people). Chevy is throwing in bells -- like a free OnStar driver assist package for five years -- and whistles -- like an automatic climate system that warms the front seats and passenger cabin to a comfortable temperature when it's cold outside. Second opinion: CNNMoney's car critic drives the Volt . These cars will be on the road soon, and you might not even notice, unless you happen to see them plugging into to an electrical source to charge their batteries. While they have much in common with their totally gas-powered brethren, that's what makes these two electric cars significant, and possibly, game-changing.","Writer test drives Nissan Leaf in Atlanta and drives Chevy Volt up the East Coast .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Keith Fitzhugh could have spent this weekend at New Meadowlands Stadium, being regaled by some 83,000 fans as a member of the New York Jets. Instead, he chose to keep his day job, working on the railroad. No spotlights, no television cameras, no adoring throngs. The only waves that he could get -- seconds of attention, in between long stretches of quiet -- will be from kids standing alongside the tracks, asking the unnamed engineer to pull the horn. And he's not complaining. ""That was always my childhood dream,"" said Fitzhugh of playing pro football. ""Driving transit was always my second childhood dream."" For months, the Hampton, Georgia, resident -- like millions of Americans -- was living more of a nightmare, unemployed and struggling to get by. A star safety at Mississippi State, he had three stints over the past two seasons in the National Football League with the Baltimore Ravens and twice the Jets. But each time, Fitzhugh had been released. For someone who, for years, had lived and breathed football, rejection was not easy. What was even harder, he said, was living without the paycheck and without any clear prospect that NFL stardom and dollars were in his future. What he was certain about, though, was family. The 5-foot-10, 210-pound Fitzhugh was in the prime of his life healthwise, but not bringing home any income. His father disabled and unable to work, his mother was the only family member with a regular paycheck. Fitzhugh said he was used to getting such support, emotionally as much as economically. His parents had cheered him while he played football, encouraged him to think of life after football, took care of him. When his sister died after contracting West Nile virus while he was in college at Starkville, his mother held off on telling him until he played a key spring football game. She, his father, his grandmother and other family members were always like that: thinking and taking care of everyone else, all while keeping their heads up, said Fitzhugh. His sister's loss especially, he said, made him realize that while football was a game, family was everything. ""They were there for me, when I went through some of the lowest times of my life,"" Fitzhugh said. ""And I needed to be there for them, also."" So he was thrilled when he recently got a full-time job with Norfolk Southern, a position that allowed him to run trains around the country and also bring home regular income and benefits to help support his family. But his suddenly stable life got turned upside down Tuesday, when his agent called to tell him about the Jets offer. Fitzhugh was off and at home, his father resting in bed. His agent told him the 9-3 team wanted him, right away. Could he make a 2 o'clock flight? Not, said Fitzhugh, without checking with his new employer first. ""My heart started racing, I started sweating immediately,"" he recalled. ""This is not happening to me. I'd just got this new job, and I don't want to let them down (so they think) every time I get a phone call, I'm going to run away."" He'd learned that professional football jobs were fleeting. He knew his railroad job was not as glamorous, it might not pay as much, but it was stable and allowed him to help his family long-term. So, before he'd even found out from Norfolk Southern if he could take a leave of absence (he later learned that he could have), Fitzhugh made up his mind. ""I just felt that the best decision at that time, for me, was to keep my job,"" Fitzhugh said. ""Because the economy is so bad right now, jobs are very scarce. Once you have a good job like this, I (thought) that I should just keep it."" Money, fame, and the thrill of competition on the gridiron are great. And Fitzhugh says that he hasn't closed the door on pro football totally, not if the time is right. But he said that he's comfortable with his decision to stay off the sidelines and stay on the tracks. Doing so will be different than battling the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, but Fitzhugh believes he will still get a rush and he'll still have the support of family and ""fans."" ""You have families that go outside in their yards or go by the tracks, and just wave at the conductors and engineers as they are riding by -- that feeling is really good,"" said Fitzhugh. ""Like the experience in the NFL, you still have fans out there.""","Keith Fitzhugh is a new employee with Norfolk Southern railroad .

"(CNN) -- There is a new speaker in town. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, will be the new Speaker of the House, replacing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, as the GOP rolled in Tuesday's midterm elections, gaining a majority for the first time in four years. The Republican Party will pick up more than 60 seats in the legislature, a statistical analysis of exit polls by CNN projects. That's a comfortable margin over the 39 seats needed to wrest control from the Democrats. Unrest over the economy and government spending, as well as the surge of Tea Party politics, helped propel the GOP. Tuesday's outcome was comparable to the 1994 so-called ""Republican Revolution,"" when the GOP took 54 seats from the Democrats. It is also the largest number of House pickups since Democrats picked up 75 seats in 1948. As of 2 a.m. ET Wednesday, the Republicans held 231 seats to the Democrats' 169. At least 218 seats are needed for a majority. ""It's clear tonight who the winners really are, and that's the American people,"" Boehner said Tuesday night in front of a crowd chanting, ""Speaker! Speaker!"" The election was a repudiation of big government and politicians who refuse to listen to their constituents, he said. The message to President Barack Obama was clear, Boehner said: ""Change course."" Under a Republican majority, ""the people's priorities will be our priorities,"" an emotional Boehner said. Obama called Boehner and said he was ""looking forward to working with him and the Republicans to find common ground, move the country forward and get things done for the American people,"" the White House said. Boehner's camp described the call as ""brief but pleasant."" The Republican leader told Obama that he's always been straightforward with him in the past, and will continue to be so. The ramifications of a Republican majority were tempered by the projection that the Senate will remain in Democratic hands. With a Democrat in the White House and a Democratic Senate, both parties will have to reach compromise or risk gridlock in the legislature. Key Republicans have already hinted that compromise is not a priority on their agenda, as many of them were swept into office precisely because of dissatisfaction with Obama's policies. The GOP made sizable inroads in Virginia, where a trio of Democratic incumbents were projected to lose, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. Reps. Tom Perriello, Rick Boucher and Glenn Nye, of the state's 5th, 9th and 2nd congressional districts, respectively, are projected to be out of office. Republican Robert Hurd won the 5th District, and Morgan Griffith won the 9th District, CNN projected. Republican challenger Scott Rigell won in the 2nd District. In Florida's 8th District, Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, a lightening rod for his confrontational and sometimes rude attitude toward his political opponents, lost his seat, CNN projected. Republican Dan Webster, whom Grayson chided as ""Taliban Dan"" in what many considered an unfair attack ad, will be the area's new congressman. Two other seats in Florida also switched hands in the Republican's favor. Democratic Rep. Allen Boyd was projected to lose to GOP candidate Steve Southerland. In Florida's 24th district, GOP challenger Sandy Adams will take the place of Rep. Suzanne Kosmas. With about 100 of the 435 House seats at stake considered ""in play,"" or competitive, an anti-Democratic mood was predicted to result in big Republican gains. In a statement early Wednesday, Pelosi defended the work Democrats have done in the House. ""Over the last four years, the Democratic Majority in the House took courageous action on behalf of America's middle class to create jobs and save the country from the worst economic catastrophe since the Great Depression,"" she said. She urged lawmakers to help move the nation forward. ""We must all strive to find common ground to support the middle class, create jobs, reduce the deficit and move our nation forward."" In Texas, a moderate Democrat, Chet Edwards, who has been a member of the House since 1991, saw his time in Washington come to end. Republican Bill Flores ousted Edwards, who long had represented a conservative district by siding with Republicans on some key votes, including voting against the health care bill. Other moderate Democrats were able to save their seats. Rep. Heath Shuler, D-North Carolina, was among those in his party who campaigned by running away from it, distancing himself in a debate from Pelosi. He kept his seat Tuesday night, CNN projected. One moderate Republican wasn't as lucky. Joseph Cao, a Republican from Louisiana's 2nd district, was the only GOPer to vote in favor of the health care bill. On Tuesday, his constituents elected Democratic challenger Cedric Richmond. That Democratic gain in the state was offset by the projected outcome in the 3rd district, where an open Democratic seat went to Republican Jeff Landry. Heading into election day, the Democrats had a 255 to 178 advantage in the house, not including two vacancies. Republicans needed to win an additional 39 seats to claim the House majority. In addition to anti-Democrat sentiments due to a slow economic recovery and what is seen as increased government spending, the advent of the Tea Party movement also played a role in these elections. The Tea Party has boosted little-known candidates to victory in primaries over mainstream figures across the country. How they fare in the general election will be seen Tuesday. Win or lose, the impact of this group is expected to shift the Republican agenda to the right. That means little chance of compromise or bipartisan approaches on major issues, observers say. Already, Boehner, has signaled he is not planning to negotiate with the White House or congressional Democrats on his party's top issues. ""This is not a time for compromise, and I can tell you that we will not compromise on our principles,"" Boehner said last week on Sean Hannity's program. Recognizing that discontent with Democrats comes from the economic situation and record deficit spending, a priority for the Republicans will be to focus on fiscal issues. House Republicans have promised to cut $100 billion from the federal budget in the first year, rolling back spending to 2008 levels. CNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.","NEW: The GOP picks up more than 60 seats, CNN projects .

"KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN)  -- A bat that apparently had trouble flying instead tried to hitch a ride on the space shuttle Discovery, NASA officials said. The free tail bat was last seen clinging to the space shuttle Discovery's external fuel tank just before launch. The animal was last seen clinging on the foam of the external tank of the space shuttle moments before the Discovery launched, officials said. NASA officials had hoped the bat would fly away on its own, but admitted the bat probably died quickly during Discovery's climb into orbit. Discovery's seven-member crew, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center on Sunday, is on a 14-day mission to deliver supplies needed to expand the International Space Station. NASA officials noticed the bat before shuttle's liftoff and brought in a wildlife expert to look at video images of it. The expert said it appeared to be a free-tailed bat that probably had a broken left wing and an injured right shoulder or wrist. The launch pads at the space center are near the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, so NASA has sirens to scare away animals that get near the shuttles. The bat isn't the first to try hitching a ride into space. NASA officials said they noticed one of the creatures on a tank of a shuttle in 1998. That bat flew away as the shuttle's massive engines ignited. The crew of the Discovery safely docked at the International Space Station on Tuesday. It was unclear whether its stowaway was still clinging to the shuttle.","NASA: Bat was last seen clinging on space shuttle Discovery before launch .

"(CNN) -- A woman convicted of murder and adultery and sentenced to die by stoning said Saturday she would sue the two German journalists who interviewed her son, Iran's government-backed Press TV reported. The men, identified only as a reporter and photojournalist, were arrested in October after they interviewed the son and lawyer of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, who was convicted of adultery in 2006 and sentenced to death by stoning. Her case has drawn sharp criticism from the international community. No date has been set for her execution. Ashtiani told reporters in the northwestern city of Tabriz that she planned to sue the German nationals, Press TV reported. The men, who work for the Bild am Sonntag newspaper, are charged with espionage and are accused of working illegally as journalists in Iran. Germany-based anti-stoning activist Mina Ahadi said that government and prison officials were also at the press conference. ""This regime has a history of pressuring innocent people into confessing on television. This is just another example of their propaganda,"" she said. Speaking outside the prison, Ashtiani criticized her lawyers for politicizing her case and denied she had been pressured to give interviews, Press TV said. Ashtiani's son, Sajjad Qaderzadeh, was released from jail three weeks ago on humanitarian grounds, according to Press TV. He had served more than a month in prison for granting the interview, Press TV reported. Qaderzadeh appeared with his mother on Saturday and similarly said that he would sue the German nationals as well as his lawyers, who asked him to do the interview, Press TV said. The son also added that he plans to take legal action against Issa Taheri, who Press TV said murdered Qaderzadeh's father in collaboration with Ashtiani. Germany's Bild newspaper, a sister publication of Bild am Sonntag, published an editorial Sunday criticizing the reported lawsuit plans. ""The woman who has been sentenced to death was allowed to leave her jail cell for a few hours to declare in front of western TV cameras that she would file a suit against our reporters,"" the editorial said. It concludes, ""Does Iran really think that a strange farce like this will improve the credibility of its justice system abroad?""

"(CNN) -- Election Day will be consequential, perhaps a nail biter. Senate control may turn on a fistful of ballots in key states. Millions of Americans will be reminded again of their ramshackle election system. Lines are long, registration lists are error-filled, machines break down, and puzzled poll workers offer little help. This year, private citizens seeking to stop ""voter fraud"" could worsen the mess. Such unofficial and perhaps overheated activism may prove a far worse problem than phony voting itself. Nobody condones voter fraud. Every citizen has a right to know that ballots are legitimately cast and fairly counted. But illegal voting simply is not a widespread problem. An epidemic of voter fraud is an urban myth, like alligators living in the sewer. Fear of imaginary fraud must not be an excuse to block actual voting by real people. A recent example of the confusion sown by politically overheated allegations of fraud can be found in the much-ballyhooed charges by John McCain of voter fraud in 2008, all of which proved to be false. Some canvassers were arrested for submitting fake registrations, a practice made worse by state laws requiring private groups to submit all registration applications, even the ones they know might be wrongly filled out. But phony voters never showed up to vote. One reason: First-time voters must always show ID. If Mickey Mouse registers to vote, he still must show ID. (Even in Orlando, where they know him!) Of course, from our democracy's earliest days, politicians zestfully have stuffed ballot boxes. Boss Tweed bragged: ""So long as I count the votes, what are you going to do about it?"" Robert Caro, in his masterful biography, recounted how Lyndon Baines Johnson won his Senate seat in 1948 when officials ""found"" a lost box of votes, in which every single voter supported Johnson -- conveniently in alphabetical order. Even JFK joked about how Mayor Daley had stolen votes on his behalf. When misconduct occurred, it was overwhelmingly by politicians, rarely by rogue individual voters. And it is largely a thing of the past. Far more worrisome is another ominous strain in American history: ugly efforts to block legitimate voters, often targeting racial minorities. Evidence abounds. Future Chief Justice William Rehnquist got his start in politics striding up to Hispanic voters and demanding they prove their eligibility. In 2004, partisans planned to challenge voters in Ohio. A federal judge who blocked the move found that less than one in five voters in majority white precincts would have had their eligibility questioned, while nearly every voter in African-American majority locations would be challenged. All of which brings us to today. In 2010, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud -- none. That's not because nobody was looking. The Bush administration made vote fraud a top Justice Department priority. Yet from 2002 to 2005, federal prosecutors convicted just 17 people nationwide for casting fraudulent ballots. Recall that it was the failure of prosecutors to move against nonexistent fraud that led to the political purge of U.S. attorneys in 2006, a scandal that prompted the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Yes, many registration lists contain mistakes or wrong names. But that is a product of slipshod and inaccurate paper records, not because crooks wrongly sought to vote. Statistically, an individual is more likely to be hit by lightning than to vote fraudulently. Yet fear of fraud continues to grip many activists. According to a 2009 poll by Public Policy Polling, an astonishing 52 percent of Republicans believed the now-defunct group ACORN stole the presidential election for Barack Obama in 2008, even though there's no evidence that such a theft occurred.  During its voter registration campaign that year, ACORN said it signed up 1.3 million voters, a small percentage of which were fraudulent -- an amount that independent analysts said had negligible effect. Hardly a stolen election. On Election Day, some conservatives may fan out to polling places, demanding proof of eligibility and generally raising a ruckus. The Michigan GOP website describes a plan to post 3,600 challengers at Democratic-leaning polling places. The Illinois Republican candidate for Senate brags he will mount the largest ""voter integrity program"" in 15 years. More troubling are new efforts by angry private citizens. Tea Party groups have hosted challenger training sessions in at least four states. Talk show hosts are urging vigilance. People can now report voters they deem suspicious with two new iPhone apps. ""Ballot security"" squads manned by angry, under-trained activists at a polling place could easily spawn intimidation or chaos. How can we make sure this doesn't happen? Tea Party members and others must take care that monitoring does not cross the line into intimidation. Law enforcement should make clear what is illegal, including strong presence by local police when appropriate. And in the longer run, conservatives and liberals alike should agree on reforms to voter registration so that all eligible citizens are on the rolls permanently, minimizing any possibility of fraud while maximizing participation. Many states are moving in this direction already. When it comes to voting, let's all agree: vigilance, yes; vigilantism, never.

"Washington (CNN) -- The manufacturers of seven caffeinated alcoholic beverages labeled a ""public health concern"" have stopped producing or shipping the products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday. Last week, the FDA sent warning letters to four beverage makers saying the addition of caffeine to alcoholic beverages was not approved by the agency and it was an ""unsafe food additive."" The agency said discussions with the companies resulted in these actions: . -- Phusion Projects of Chicago, Illinois, has ceased producing caffeinated alcoholic beverages, is no longer shipping such products and expects to have all of its caffeinated alcoholic beverages off retail store shelves by December 13. Phusion Projects is the maker of Four Loko. -- San Diego, California-based United Brands has ceased shipping its caffeinated alcoholic beverage Joose and expects to have its product off retail store shelves by December 13. United Brands also said that it no longer markets Max, another caffeinated alcoholic beverage listed in the warning letter. -- Charge Beverages Corp. of Portland, Oregon, ceased producing its caffeinated alcoholic beverages, Core High Gravity HG, Core High Gravity HG Orange, and Lemon Lime Core Spiked, in September and has not shipped any caffeinated alcoholic beverages since early November. -- New Century Brewing of Boston, Massachusetts, has ceased manufacturing its caffeinated alcoholic beverage, Moonshot. The warning letters last Wednesday followed a year-long review by the FDA, which gave the companies 15 days to either reformulate their products or face possible seizure under federal law, said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, the agency's principal deputy commissioner. Experts have said the caffeine in the beverages can mask the effects of alcohol, leaving drinkers unaware of how intoxicated they are. ""FDA does not find support for the claim that the addition of caffeine to these alcoholic beverages is 'generally recognized as safe,' which is the legal standard,"" Sharfstein told reporters. ""To the contrary, there is evidence that the combinations of caffeine and alcohol in these products pose a public health concern."" New Century proprietor Rhonda Kallman told CNN last week she was puzzled by the FDA's decision to include Moonshot on its list. Kallman described Moonshot as a craft beer that has about 4 percent alcohol by weight and about two-thirds the caffeine of a cup of coffee, and is sold in only three cities -- ""and yet it's being singled out with Four Loko and Joose."" Wednesday, Kallman claimed the FDA has not had a clear policy on caffeinated alcohol. ""They have not done their homework,"" she said. ""I'm not going to stop forever."" Moonshot is ""absolutely, positively"" safe and was marketed to ""beer lovers who want a caffeinated choice,"" she said. Phusion Projects announced last week that it was dropping caffeine and two other ingredients, guarana and taurine, from Four Loko in the face of ""a difficult and politically charged regulatory environment."" Four Loko has been nicknamed ""blackout in can"" by some users. Sharfstein called Phusion's decision to drop those ingredients a ""positive step."" And in a statement issued after the decision, the company said it was pleased by FDA's response. ""As we stated yesterday, we have stopped the production and shipment of all our products containing these ingredients,"" the company said last week. United Brands previously said it was unaware ""of a single incident of injury or other harm associated with its products.""  The company declined comment Wednesday. Messages left Wednesday with Phusion Projects and Charge Beverages were not immediately returned. The FDA began its review in November 2009 after complaints from officials in several states. The controversy exploded last month, when nine underage students at Central Washington University were hospitalized after drinking Four Loko, both on its own and mixed with other drinks, police reported. Critics say drinks like Four Loko mix caffeine equal to the amount in three cups of coffee with the alcoholic equivalent of three cans of beer and are designed to appeal to younger consumers accustomed to consuming high-caffeine energy drinks. A 23.5-ounce can of Four Loko contains either 6 or 12 percent alcohol by volume, depending on state regulations. Phusion has compared Four Loko to popular drinks like rum and cola or Irish coffee that also mix caffeine and alcohol. But ""we didn't see these kinds of events when people were drinking Irish coffees,"" Rob McKenna, Washington's state attorney general, told reporters earlier this month. ""What we're seeing now is striking, and we need to take quick action,"" McKenna said. Washington and four other states -- New York, Utah, Michigan and Oklahoma -- already had taken steps to remove Four Loko and similar drinks from store shelves. And Gil Kerlikowske, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, praised the FDA for moving against products he said are ""designed, branded, and promoted to encourage binge drinking."" CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","The FDA has called the seven caffeine-alcohol drinks unsafe .
Manufacturers have agreed to stop shipping them, the agency says .
The companies had been given two weeks to reformulate products ."
"Rome (CNN) -- Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will learn the fate of a controversial law that would shield him from prosecution on Thursday, the country's Constitutional Court said Tuesday. The court heard arguments Tuesday about the legality of the ""legitimate impediment"" law, which would effectively grant top Italian government officials immunity while they are in office. The Berlusconi-backed law says top government officials cannot be prosecuted because their officials duties make it impossible for them to attend court hearings. The law would suspend criminal trials until the official leaves office. The law was approved in March 2010, but prosecutors in Milan challenged the constitutionality of the measure, saying it should be judges, not politicians, who determined whether someone had time to attend court. Two separate trials against Berlusconi are pending, and a third one is in the works. He's accused of bribing a witness to commit perjury in one case, and of tax fraud and other financial irregularities in another. Both trials began but were suspended when the immunity law was passed. Berlusconi has called the charges politically motivated. A third case against the prime minister, also related to tax fraud, is in preliminary stages. Berlusconi has been tried on at least 17 separate charges since first taking office as prime minister in 1994, but remains very popular with the Italian public. The immunity law was due to expire 18 months after it was passed, which would make it expire in October. The Constitutional Court can rule it is unconstitutional and strike it down, uphold it, or rule it partially unconstitutional and modify it, Italian media reported.","Silvio Berlusconi's government passed a law protecting officials from prosecution .

"(CNN) -- Three suspects appeared in a Mauritius court Wednesday in connection with the death of Michaela Harte-McAreavey, daughter of a leading Irish sports figure and wife of Gaelic football star John McAreavey. The three men are all employees of a luxury hotel where the 27-year-old newlywed was found strangled Monday, according to the Mauritius Police Force. Room attendant Avinash Treebhoowoon, 29, and Sandip Moneea, 41, a floor supervisor, have been charged with murder. Room attendant Raj Theekoy, 33, faces a conspiracy charge. The men appeared Wednesday morning at Mapou District Court in northern Mauritius, police said.  They've been remanded in custody to appear again in court January 19. ""We believe we have substantial evidence to connect them to the case,"" said police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation. Soopun said the three men were employees of the Legends Hotel, and authorities believe they were inside the teacher's hotel room when she returned alone. ""We presume they were inside and burgling the room when the lady returned and were surprised and attacked her,"" Soopun said. The killer used an electronic key card to enter the room, authorities said. The former beauty queen's husband was in the restaurant of the hotel when his wife was killed and was not a suspect, Soopun said. She had returned to their room to fetch biscuits to go with her tea. When she failed to return, her husband went to look for her and found her dead, Soopun said. A post-mortem examination showed that she had died from asphyxiation, said Dr. Sudesh Kumar Gungadin. Harte was the daughter of one of the best-known figures in Irish sports, Mickey Harte, the Tyrone Gaelic football manager. In a statement outside his house Tuesday, Harte said his family was ""devastated,"" and offered support to his son-in-law. ""What a day she had on her wedding day. She was just radiant, a beautiful girl, and I just love her to bits. So did her whole family,"" Harte said. ""We will miss her so much,"" he added. ""This is the worst nightmare that anyone can imagine. If you think things can be bad, then you go beyond that because that is where we are. ""This is too horrible to contemplate. We are just all devastated. It is the worst of the worst and our hearts are broken,"" Harte said. Harte asked the media to refrain from contacting his son-in-law, who's ""isolated out there"" in Mauritius, he said. ""Our hearts go out to him,"" Harte said. ""The lad is devastated. He is our son-in-law. He is a wonderful young man. Please lay off."" Harte-McAreavey taught Irish at St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland.  She won the Ulster Rose of Tralee contest and participated in other beauty pageants.","The 27-year-old was on her honeymoon with Gaelic football star John McAreavey in Mauritius .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- A top court has banned any corporal punishment in schools in Bangladesh, a country where millions of children are exposed to physical abuse, officials said Thursday. Despite official instructions to teachers on alternative approaches to child discipline, many children continue to live in fear of violence in schools, the High Court said. The court said caning, beating, chaining, forced haircuts and confinement are used to punish children in primary and secondary schools as well as in Islamic religious schools, known at madrassas. ""Such punishment is a clear violation of children's fundamental rights to life and liberty,"" said the order handed down by Justices Imman Ali and Sheikh Hasan Arif. They said teachers' involvement in corporal punishment should be treated as ""misconduct"" and asked the government to take action against those teachers. The court judgment followed a public-interest litigation filed by two leading rights groups, Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust and Ain O Shalish Kendra. As the High Court started hearing the rights groups' petition last July, it asked the government to take steps to stop corporal punishment, noting allegations that a 10-year-old boy had committed suicide after he had been beaten by his teacher. A spokesman in the ministry of education said that in response, it had issued a circular asking teachers to stop physical abuse in schools. ""In fact, teachers are not well-trained and they need deftness to understand child psychology and alternative approaches to child discipline,"" Shafiq Rahman, a banker in Dhaka, told CNN. He has a child in the school system. A survey conducted by the United Nations Children Fund, or UNICEF, in Dhaka couple of years ago involving nearly 4,000 families found that 91 percent of children experienced physical abuse in schools. It said the poorer children were more likely to experience physical punishment, with greater frequency and severity, than richer students.","Bangladesh's High Court bans caning, beating and chaining in schools .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Police arrested a suspected top computer programmer for the Basque separatist group ETA in France Tuesday, the Spanish Interior Ministry said. The arrest comes a day after the separatist group's latest cease-fire announcement. Despite the group's declaration of a permanent general and verifiable cease-fire, police will not stop pressuring ETA, the Interior Ministry said. The programmer is accused of playing a key role in the group's logistics by designing the computer codes that operatives used to secretly communicate, the ministry said. Police have been on the trail of the programmer for months, the ministry said. And authorities in Spain arrested the programmer's girlfriend, also suspected of aiding ETA, according to the ministry. Police are also investigating whether the programmer allegedly helped Colombian FARC rebels with computer issues, but they have not confirmed a link with the leftist guerrilla group, the ministry said. In a statement released to the Basque newspaper Gara -- where it typically releases information -- ETA said Monday that it declared a permanent general and verifiable cease-fire as a ""firm commitment towards a process to achieve a lasting resolution and toward an end to the armed confrontation."" Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said that the government wants to see a statement from ETA calling for a definitive end, which he said Monday's statement did not do. ""Am I more tranquil today than before? Yes,"" Perez said Monday. ""Is this the end? I would say no."" Spain's Socialist government has repeatedly called for ETA to announce unilaterally a definitive end to its decades of separatist violence, blamed for more than 800 deaths, and a pledge to lay down its weapons. ETA wants Basque independence in northern Spain and southwest France. Various Basque leftist parties -- including the Batasuna party, outlawed for its links to ETA -- as well as four Nobel peace laureates and the Nelson Mandela Foundation also have called in recent months for the organization to establish a permanent and verifiable cease-fire. The Batasuna party's ban from running candidates in municipal elections will not be lifted because of ETA's statement, the interior minister said. The latest statement comes after weeks of speculation in Spain that ETA would issue a statement during the holiday season. ""It is time to act with historical responsibility. ETA calls upon those governing Spain and France to end all repressive measures and to leave aside for once and for all their position of denial towards the Basque Country,"" the statement said. Another part of the message said, ""The solution will come through the democratic process with dialogue and negotiation as its tools and with its compass pointed towards the will of the Basque people."" ""ETA will continue its indefatigable struggle and efforts to promote and to bring to a conclusion the democratic process until there is a truly democratic situation in the Basque Country,"" it added. The organization has announced cease-fires before and broken them, notably its unilateral 2006 cease-fire that was announced as ""permanent,"" only to be broken months later with a car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two people. Despite ETA's current cease-fire, in effect since September, the government has not eased up on the police pressure against ETA operatives in Spain and the organization's hideouts in neighboring France and Portugal. In the past few years, police have arrested many of ETA's suspected top operatives, as well as many of its foot soldiers, and seized bomb-making materials and weapons from hidden arms caches, virtually shutting off ETA attacks. There are about 800 ETA convicts or suspects in prison, mainly in Spain but also in France, the Interior Ministry said recently. ETA is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union for its campaign of car bombings and shootings. The Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero began a peace process in 2006 during ETA's earlier unilateral cease-fire, but after the organization detonated an airport bomb, the government called off negotiations. Since then, officials of Zapatero's government have said they would not accept another cease-fire, only a definitive statement from ETA that it would end its armed fight, and specifying when and where it would lay down its arms forever. The Basque region in northern Spain already has considerable home-rule authority, with its own police, parliament, taxing power and control of health and education. But ETA rejects those as partial steps, and has fought for full independence. ETA's goal is an independent Basque nation comprising the three-province Basque region and the neighboring Navarra region in Spain, along with three departments in southwest France that also have Basque roots. About 3 million people live in those areas now. Officials have said that in recent years, ETA has become weaker and more isolated from its traditional base of popular support.","A computer programmer is accused of playing a key role in the group's logistics .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- The suspect in Saturday's shooting at an Arizona supermarket has had some contacts with law enforcement, the Pima County Sheriff's Department's lead investigator said Wednesday, but none so alarming that authorities were concerned about what he might do. Pima County Sheriff's Bureau Chief Richard Kastigar said that speculation law enforcement had enough information about Jared Loughner to stop the shooting is ""completely untrue."" ""I couldn't underscore that more,"" Kastigar told CNN's ""John King USA."" ""The events that led up to what happened Saturday as they relate to law enforcement contact really do not add up in their totality to anything that would cause a police officer to say. 'This guy is going to go out there and shoot 20 people.' There's nothing there,"" Kastigar said. The law enforcement contacts included episodes of underaged drinking and possessing drug paraphernalia, which Kastigar described as ""very minor occurrences or interactions with law enforcement."" Kastigar also said investigators had found no evidence Loughner followed up on suggestions from Pima College officials that he seek mental health help for behavioral problems. Six people were killed in the shooting on Saturday and 13 others -- including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords -- were wounded. Giffords, whom police said was the target of the shooting, remains in critical condition but her doctors have been pleased with her progress. Loughner, 22, appeared in a Phoenix federal courtroom Monday to formally hear the charges against him -- including two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempting to kill a member of Congress. He is now in federal custody. And on Wednesday, the Ninth Circuit Courts designated a district judge in California to hear Loughner's federal case. Judge Larry Burns is a 2003 Bush appointee serving in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, based in San Diego. The next scheduled federal hearing in the case is January 24 in Phoenix. All federal judges in Arizona have recused themselves from hearing the case. The chief federal judge in Arizona -- Judge John Roll of Tucson -- was among those killed in the Saturday shooting. Kastigar said that investigators are looking for a black bag Loughner was carrying early Saturday morning when he had a brief discussion with his father, Randy Loughner, in the Loughners' front yard, Kastigar said. ""The father asked him questions similar to 'What are you doing? What is that?' and Jared mumbled something back to his dad, and his dad said he didn't understand what was said,"" Kastigar said. ""It was unintelligible, and then Jared left."" The elder Loughner got in his vehicle and tried to follow his son, but could not find him, Kastigar said. Kastigar said that investigators found ""a locked box of some kind and within that box was an envelope and a piece of paper and hand-scrawled on those pieces of paper were a few phrases."" ""Die cop,"" ""die bitch"" and ""assassination plans have been made"" were among the phrases, he said. One of the pieces of paper found in the box was a letter from Giffords thanking Loughner for attending a 2007 event, he said. Mark Hart, spokesman for the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said Loughner was stopped by an officer for running a red light at 7:30 a.m. on the day of the shooting. He was given a verbal warning and released. Kastigar added that investigators are now certain that Loughner acted alone. A ""person of interest"" they had been seeking identified himself to police. He turned out to be a taxi driver who dropped off the suspect at the shopping center, Kastigar said. Loughner's parents said Tuesday they do not know why the shooting occurred and that they were ""very sorry"" for the loss felt by victims' families. ""There are no words that can possibly express how we feel. We wish that there were, so we could make you feel better. We don't understand why this happened,"" the family said in its statement. ""It may not make any difference, but we wish that we could change the heinous events of Saturday. We care very deeply about the victims and their families. We are so very sorry for their loss."" After the shooting, attendees at the Giffords event tackled Loughner and held him down until law enforcement arrived. The Pima County Sheriff's Department said Loughner used a Glock 19 with a magazine that held 31 rounds -- all of which were recovered at the scene. CNN's Bill Mears contributed to this report .","NEW: Loughner's father asked him about a black bag he was carrying Saturday morning .

"(CNN) -- Brazil need just three more points to clinch qualification for the 2010 World Cup after beating former South American Group leaders Paraguay on Wednesday, but Argentina's hopes suffered a big blow. Brazil's match-winner Nilmar, left, celebrates his goal with Elano and Daniel Alves, right. With four matches remaining, Brazil retained top spot with a 2-1 victory in Recife to lead second-placed Chile by a point, with Paraguay two further adrift on 24 and Argentina in fourth on 22. The top four teams automatically qualify for next year's finals in South Africa, while the fifth-placed nation -- Ecuador at this stage -- face a play-off against the fourth-placed side from the CONCACAF region. Mexico hold that spot following Wednesday's matches, following a morale-boosting 2-1 win against bottom nation Trinidad and Tobago. Brazil and Paraguay had been level on points at the top of the table of Wednesday's clash, and the visitors took the lead in the 25th minute when Salvador Cabanas's free-kick took a deflection off midfielder Elano and looped over Julio Cesar. Elano's Manchester City team-mate Robinho made amends with a superb volleyed equalizer four minutes before half-time from Daniel Alves' right-wing cross. The home side then went ahead four minutes after the interval with a scrappy goal as striker Nilmar scrambled the ball into the net after a fortuitous rebound off Paraguay's Julio Cesar Caceres when he tried to chest the ball down to Kaka. ""It was a match in which we had to be patient and persistent,"" Brazil coach Dunga said on FIFA.com. ""We had to try playing on the wings, at speed, changing sides. Everyone plays tight away from home and that makes it difficult to win. We need three more points to be sure (of qualifying)."" For Paraguay, who were four points clear at the top at the halfway stage, it was a second setback in a week after Saturday's 2-0 home defeat by Chile. Diego Maradona's Argentina were unable to follow up last weekend's 1-0 win over Colombia, crashing 2-0 away to Ecuador at high altitude in Quito. Carlos Tevez missed a first-half penalty before goals from Walter Ayovi and Pablo Palacios handed Maradona a second defeat in four qualifiers since taking charge. ""They didn't do anything in the first half,"" Maradona said on FIFA.com. ""In the second half, they got a couple of rebounds and they scored two goals. If we had scored a goal, it would have finished the game off."" Ecuador coach Sixto Vizuete, whose side closed to within two points of the Argentines, said: ""These three points are worth their weight in gold and we're satisfied because we beat great opponents."" Tevez was fouled by Ecuador goalkeeper Marcelo Elizaga just inside the penalty area in the 28th minute, but then saw his weak spot-kick saved and Lionel Messi fired the rebound over the bar to add to an earlier easy miss by the the Barcelona forward. Left-back Ayovi equalized in the 72nd minute with a superb 25-meter strike, then substitute Palacios -- who had teed him up for that effort -- fired the winner with seven minutes left and Antonio Valencia struck the visitors' woodwork with a long-range shot. Chile moved up into second place with a 4-0 crushing of 10-man Bolivia, as Alexis Sanchez netted twice. Jean Bonsejour headed the opener just before halftime from Matias Fernandez's right-wing cross, Mark Gonzalez made it 2-0 with a free-kick in the 74th minute before Sanchez struck four minutes later. Sanchez scored again just before the end, and midfielder Ignacio Garcia was sent off after clattering into him while he celebrated. In other games, Uruguay dropped to sixth place after being held to a 2-2 draw away to Venezuela and Colombia beat bottom team Peru 1-0. Diego Forlan put Uruguay 2-1 up in the 73rd minute, but Venezuela kept their hopes of a first World Cup finals appearance alive when Jose Manuel Rey scored from a trademark free-kick two minutes later. Radamel Falcao Garcia netted the only goal in Medellin from close range in the 25th minute, scoring just his nation's seventh of the qualifiers as Peru crashed to an eighth successive defeat.","Brazil need three more points to seal their place at the 2010 World Cup finals .

"(CNN) -- Mississippi Winn didn't get caught up in the amazing statistics that accompanied someone her age. Only 1 in 5 million people in the industrialized world live to be 110. About 60 people that age live in the United States, with another 300 or so scattered around the globe. Nine of 10 are women. Winn was believed to be the oldest living African-American when she died Friday afternoon in Shreveport, Louisiana, at 113. Investigator Milton Carroll of the Caddo Parish Coroner's Office said he was not permitted to disclose a cause of death, but a relative said Winn -- who was nicknamed ""Sweetie"" -- had been in declining health since last autumn. Robert Young, a senior claims researcher with the Gerontology Research Group and a senior consultant for Guinness World Records, visited Winn at Magnolia Manor Nursing Home in July 2010. ""She looked to be in very good shape,"" he said Saturday. ""It was a surprise she went downhill so fast."" Young believes Winn's parents were born into slavery. Her father was born in 1844 and her mother in 1860. But Winn ""never discussed it,"" said her great-niece Mary C. Hollins of Shreveport. ""She would say, 'I don't know about that.'"" Winn, who did not marry and lived independently until 103, appears to have lived a life that made her especially well-qualified for the elite club of supercentenarians -- those who live to be 110 or older. ""She had always been kind to others,"" Hollins said on Saturday. ""She was always respectful."" Shreveport Mayor Cedric Glover said the city has honored several centenarians. ""We have declared March 31 as Ms. Mississippi Winn Day since her 110th birthday,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with Miss Winn's family, relatives, her beloved Pastor Clarence Hicks and her church family and friends who all loved and cherished her,"" he said. The secret to living to and past 110, besides not having an unhealthy weight, said Young, is a positive attitude and emotional and physical stability. Most supercentenarians take little medication during their lives, he said. ""They do things in moderation,"" he said. ""They don't get upset."" Most were still walking at age 105, he added. Born in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, on March 31, 1897, Winn moved with her family to Shreveport after her father died in 1908. One of 15 children, eight of whom lived to adulthood, Winn had a sister who lived to be 100 and a brother who lived to 95. She worked as a domestic, cooking and helping families raise children. She worked in Kansas City for a time and lived in Seattle, Washington, from 1957 to 1975, helping to raise three boys, before returning to Louisiana. Winn had a child who died at age 2, Hollins said. Before she moved to the nursing home, Winn lived on her own, doing her own laundry and walking around a track for exercise. She never learned to drive. Instead, she got rides or took a bus to the grocery store. She liked bingo and sewing and loved to cook vegetables and stewed chicken. Said Hollins: ""She didn't make much over modern things."" Winn was clear about what she liked. ""She was a disciplinarian,"" said Hollins. Right or wrong, it was her way."" A member of Avenue Baptist Church, Winn received visits from church members and was able to attend a service on August 29. The chuch will hold her funeral next Saturday. She outlived many of her church friends. ""When each one passed I could see part of her leaving with them,"" said Hollins, whose grandmother was Winn's sister. In time, Winn came to enjoy the attention paid to her age. But she remained even-keeled, said Hollins, recalling what her great-aunt would say. ""I'm just going to stay here until he's ready for me."" The oldest known African-American is now Mamie Rearden of Edgefield, South Carolina, who is 112. The world's oldest known living person is Eunice Sanborn, 114, of Jacksonville, Texas, according to Young.","Mississippi Winn died Friday at age 113 .

"(CNN) -- In her thoughts and prayers over the past year, Nadine Devilme has thanked God countless times for saving her baby after Haiti's earthquake. She's also wanted to thank the doctor who treated Jenny Alexis after the 2-month-old spent four days alone, crushed in the rubble with nothing to drink. There was one problem: Devilme never knew the doctor's name, never knew exactly whom to thank for treating her daughter's fractured skull and crushed chest and then arranging for her to be airlifted to a hospital in Miami. Meanwhile, the physician who saved Jenny, Dr. Karen Schneider, an assistant professor of pediatric emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins, has spent the past year wondering how the baby was doing. ""I want to know, is she walking, starting to talk, is she playing, because when she first came to me, I didn't think she'd be able to do any of those things,"" Schneider said. ""I didn't think she would live."" Finally, on Monday, the baby many call a miracle and the doctor who brought her from the brink of death were brought together. ""One of the few success stories of that horrible time!!"" Haitian couple await baby's return . Last week, Schneider sent me an e-mail asking if I had contact information for Jenny's parents. ""I would love to connect with her parents and see how she is doing!!"" she wrote. ""It is one of the few success stories of that horrible time!!"" Schneider, also a member of the Catholic order the Sisters of Mercy, had a layover Monday in Miami on her way to Haiti to work with cholera victims. We decided to meet up with Jenny and her family. Jenny's parents have lived in Miami since April after obtaining visas to enter the United States. When we arrived at the family's apartment, Devilme brought us into Jenny's room, where she was taking her afternoon nap. ""Oh my gosh, she's so big! So big!"" Schneider exclaimed when she saw Jenny. ""Marche? Marche?"" she asked, using the Creole word for ""walk."" ""Is she walking?"" ""Yes, yes!"" Devilme told her. ""Her smile, it goes up on both sides? Or does it droop on one side?"" Schneider asked, concerned that trauma to Jenny's head during the earthquake might have damaged the baby's facial nerves. DNA testing confirms they're the parents . Devilme, who's learned some English in her nine months in Miami, assured the doctor that Jenny had a normal smile. Once Jenny awoke, she proved she's a normal toddler, grabbing toys, saying ""Mama,"" taking a visitor's keys off a table and walking outside even after she'd been told not to. ""She looks like nothing ever happened,"" Schneider said. ""And we didn't think she would live two hours."" Devilme called over an interpreter to translate from Creole to English. ""I would like to say thank you for saving my daughter, because I always wanted to meet you and I never had the opportunity,"" Devilme told Schneider. ""For me, it's just a great thing to be able to say thank you to you."" ""You're welcome,"" Schneider said as she hugged Devilme. ""It's such a gift to be able to see this baby."" When they met Monday, Schneider agreed to be Jenny's godmother. A risky procedure . When the earthquake struck, Devilme was in one part of her home in Port-au-Prince, and Jenny was in another part with her baby sitter. Devilme was injured and taken to a local hospital, and her husband, Junior Alexis, who was unharmed in the quake, returned to their ruined home to search for Jenny in the rubble. He couldn't find her, but four days later, someone else found Jenny amid the concrete and flagged down a journalist who was driving nearby, who took the baby to a makeshift hospital run by the University of Miami and Project MediaShare. Schneider, the head of pediatrics at the hospital, had been up for 30 hours straight and had finally lain down for a nap when a nurse woke her up to take care of Jenny. ""She wasn't conscious, and she had head trauma -- she had an indentation in her skull,"" Schneider told Devilme on Monday. ""And another thing that terrified me was her chest was completely caved in and everything was pushed to one side."" But Schneider's biggest concern was after four days without any liquids, Jenny was so dehydrated she couldn't even get an IV into her veins. With no other choice, she delivered fluids directly into Jenny's leg bones, a risky procedure. Once Jenny was stabilized, Project Medishare paid for a private jet to fly her to Miami. ""Miracle"" comes full circle with reunion . ""This was a big, fancy executive jet,"" she told her. ""And I laid Jenny down, and she peed all over the leather, and then she opened her eyes for the first time and smiled at me."" Seeing that the baby was hydrated enough to urinate, Schneider felt for the first time Jenny might survive the two-hour flight to Miami. ""I was so thrilled, but the pilot wasn't so happy she'd peed on his leather seat,"" she told Devilme, laughing. An uncertain future . Devilme said she hopes to find a job and send Jenny to day care, but she's had trouble finding both. Her husband already works at a local restaurant. The family has permission to stay in the United States for two years. The International Rescue Committee is supporting them while they're in the United States, including helping them apply for health care benefits for her physical therapy. Her arms, which had surgery, continue to heal. ""I lost everything in Haiti,"" Devilme said. ""I have nothing to go back to, so I don't know what's going to happen."" Schneider thinks Jenny has a bright future. ""She's a miracle baby,"" she told her mother. ""For almost four days, she had almost no fluid, and yet she survived. I've always said God has a special plan for her."" CNN's John Bonifield contributed to this report .","Doctor treated Nadine Devilme's daughter's fractured skull and crushed chest .
""We didn't think she would live two hours,"" Dr. Karen Schneider says .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Nine-year-old Christina Green was ambitious, and she liked to be in charge. She was the only girl on her Little League baseball team in Tucson, Arizona -- and she told others she wanted to be the first woman to play in the major leagues. Most believed she could do it, someday. But her life was cut short by a gunman's bullet Saturday as she attended a congresswoman's meet-and-greet in a supermarket parking lot. Christina's family, friends, classmates, and hundreds of mourners filled St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson for a funeral service Thursday afternoon, all of them passing under a giant American flag that was recovered in the aftermath of the terror attacks in New York on September 11, 2001 -- the day Christina was born. Dozens of mourners paid their respects by standing outside the church, which was was filled to capacity. Representatives from professional baseball also were in attendance. Green was the daughter of a Major League Baseball scout and the granddaughter of former baseball manager Dallas Green. The girl's father, John Green, was the only speaker. Before the tearful crowd, he spoke directly to his departed daughter: ""Christina-Taylor Green,"" he began, ""I can't tell you how much we all miss you."" ""I think you have affected the whole country,"" he said. Christina was ""a little girl with the wisdom of a wise woman,"" Bishop Gerald Kicanas said.  ""She has found her dwelling place in God's mansion.  She went home."" ""She wanted to make a difference with her life, to make her mark,"" he said of Christina. ""She has done so in such a powerful way that even she could not have imagined."" Pink and white flowers, along with pink bows, adorned the church. The University of Arizona choir sang ""Ave Maria."" Family friend Katy Martin sang Billy Joel's ""Lullaby."" ""Goodnight, my Angel, time to close your eyes,"" the song began. The young girl had recently been elected to the student council at Mesa Verde Elementary School, and a neighbor -- impressed with Christina's civic interest -- took her to the event to meet Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. ""Imagine: here was a young girl who was just becoming aware of our democracy; just beginning to understand the obligations of citizenship; just starting to glimpse the fact that someday she, too, might play a part in shaping her nation's future,"" President Barack Obama said at a memorial service Wednesday night for those killed and wounded in the shooting. ""She had been elected to her student council; she saw public service as something exciting, something hopeful,"" the president said. ""She was off to meet her congresswoman, someone she was sure was good and important and might be a role model."" Giffords, along with 12 others, was wounded when the gunman opened fire.  Six people -- including Christina -- were killed. Police say suspect Jared Loughner, 22, had complained for years about Giffords, after apparently getting a response he didn't like after asking her a question at a 2007 event. The shooting set off a political firestorm across the country, with pundits charging that extreme partisan politics somehow played a role in the mass killing. The president noted that Christina was just beginning to discover the political system -- something that she saw ""through the eyes of a child, undimmed by the cynicism or vitriol that we adults all too often just take for granted. ""I want us to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it,"" Obama said.  ""All of us -- we should do everything we can do to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations."" Christina's parents say they're just trying to get through it. ""It's minute-by-minute, day-by-day.  We're just taking it slow. We're hanging in there, we're trying to be strong. We have to be strong. Our country's being strong, our community is being strong for us, so we will, you know, get through this with our faith and our friends and our family,"" mother Roxanna Green told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday night, before the public memorial service. Most of the mourners arriving for Christina's funeral service Thursday paused to look up at the huge flag that rippled between the extended ladders of two fire trucks outside the church.  The banner, which has been patched with flags recovered from other disasters, was sent by the New York Says Thank You Foundation. The gesture is precious to the Green family. ""We both let out a gasp of emotion, because, you know, that meant a lot to us,"" Christina's father told CNN.  ""And for them to extend that courtesy to our daughter ... again, it's just another one of those things that will help for us. We feel like the country won't forget her."" Christina was to be buried in a custom-made red oak casket donated by a group of Trappist monks in Iowa. The lid of the casket was inscribed with her name, date of birth and death, and a cross.  The family also will receive five small keepsake crosses hewn from the same wood as the casket, according to Sam Mulgrew, the general manager of Trappist Caskets. Before the casket was sent from the monastery to Arizona, the Roman Catholic monks gave it a special blessing inside their chapel on Tuesday. Obama met with the Greens before the public service Wednesday night. ""He expressed that there are no words, and to stay strong and believe in our country. And we've -- one thing we promised him is we would do that,"" John Green said, adding that Michelle Obama extended an invitation to visit the Obamas in Washington. ""We would be proud to be a part of that,"" he said. ""I know Christina, you know ... that's something she would have loved to do."" The president also remarked on Christina's unique appreciation for life. ""She'd remind her mother, 'We are so blessed.  We have the best life,'"" Obama told the audience at the University of Arizona Wednesday evening.  ""And she'd pay those blessings back by participating in a charity that helped children who were less fortunate."" Her family has set up the Christina Taylor Green Memorial Fund, to help children in her hometown of Tucson.  The act seems to fulfill one of the child-like wishes that accompanied a photograph of Christina in a book published in 2002 called ""Faces of Hope: Babies Born on 9/11."" ""I hope you help those in need,"" the message read.","NEW: Father talks about his daughter .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid head coach Jose Mourinho claims it was in referee Paradas Romero's ""nature"" to send him to the stands during Wednesday's 5-1 Copa del Rey win over Real Murcia. Mourinho was protesting a 37th-minute yellow card given to Mali midfielder Mahamadou Diarra when Romero adjudged him to have overstepped the mark and banished him from the touchline. The Portuguese boss -- whose team advanced beyond the last-32 stage of Spain's premier cup competition for the first time in three years -- highlighted Romero's past record of handing out yellow cards as the reason behind his dismissal. The former Inter Milan coach stopped short of openly criticizing the match officials, and admitted he would not able to do a better job than Romero. The worst referee decisions in football? ""I cannot say he was a bad referee,"" Mourinho told Los Blancos' official website. ""I would make a terrible referee. ""[But] just look at this referee's statistics. It is in his nature. I'm not saying he is good or bad. I am not one to judge him, but I do usually analyze referee statistics. ""This one has officiated about 50 matches in the Spanish league and has shown more than 250 yellow cards, an average of more than six per match. He booked 10 players in his last match."" However, Spanish press reported that Romero claimed Mourinho abused him after being booked for protesting, forcing him to send the coach to the stands. Should referees be relegated too? ""In the 37th minute, the manager Jose Mario dos Santos Mourinho Felix was given a yellow card for the following reason: raising his arms in the air, complaining about a decision I made,"" Romero reportedly wrote in his after-match summary. ""Once he was given the yellow card, he faced me and said, 'Go to hell.' "" Real's win was emphatic, as goals from Esteban Granero, Gonzalo Higuain, Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Xabi Alonso ensured they avoided the humiliation of last year when they suffered a 4-1 aggregate loss to third-tier team Alcoron. Mourinho's men are currently sitting top of the Spanish first division, a point clear of arch-rivals Barcelona after 10 matches. Meanwhile, the first ""Clasico"" clash between the two Spanish heavyweights this season will be played on a Monday due to the Catalan elections taking place the day before on November 28. Barca will host Real with kickoff scheduled for 9 p.m. local time (2000 GMT, 1500 ET). ""This is due to the 13th round coinciding with the elections for the parliament of Catalonia and the security problems that would create,"" read a statement on Real's website on Thursday.","Jose Mourinho hits back at referee after being sent off during Madrid's win over Murcia .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Agriculture released a new proposed rule Thursday designed to strengthen school breakfast and lunch nutrition standards -- part of the Obama administration's attempt to crack down on an epidemic of childhood obesity. The rule would increase the availability of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat milk while cutting the amount of sodium and saturated fat. It would reduce the availability of traditional school lunch staples such as pizza and french fries. Under the rule, federal minimum and maximum calorie intake guidelines would be established for the first time. Younger children would be offered 550 to 650 calories for lunch, while most high school students would be offered 750 to 850 calories. Saturated fat would constitute less than 10 percent of the total calories in school meals for children at all age levels. Trans fat would be banned. If implemented, the rule will affect an estimated 32 million school lunches and 12 million school breakfasts every year, according to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. Public health advocates praised the proposal, arguing it will encourage better lifelong eating habits. If children ""eat healthy foods at schools and like them, they're going to be more open to eating healthy food at home and throughout the rest of their lives,"" said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. Some conservatives, however, contend that enforcement of nutrition standards in school meals is not an appropriate role for the federal government. The proposed rule is open for public comment through mid-April. Once the rule takes effect, school districts will be required to meet its standards to be eligible for federal assistance for school meals. Almost one-third of American children between the ages of 6 and 19 are overweight or obese, according to a recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obese children face an increased risk of a range of health problems, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and Type 2 diabetes. This is ""an issue that needs to be addressed,"" Vilsack said.  ""The United States is facing an obesity epidemic and the crisis of poor diets threatens the future of our children -- and our nation."" If the obesity problem isn't effectively dealt with, the country could face an additional $344 billion in health care costs by 2018, Vilsack told reporters. President Barack Obama signed a sweeping overhaul of child nutrition standards in December, enacting a law meant to encourage better eating habits in part by giving the federal government more authority to set standards for food sold in vending machines and elsewhere on school grounds. The new proposed rule is a consequence of the $4.5 billion measure. Among other things, the law provides more money to poor areas to subsidize school lunches.  To help offset the higher cost of including more fruits and vegetables, the bill increases the reimbursement rate for the program. The measure was a top priority for first lady Michelle Obama, who championed it as part of her ""Let's Move"" initiative to combat child obesity in the United States. CNN's Matt Cherry and Sally Holland contributed to this report .","The USDA proposes rule to increase availability of fruits, vegetables and grains in school lunches .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi celebrated his second successive world player of the year award with a hat-trick as Spanish champions Barcelona crushed division two team Real Betis 5-0 in the first leg of their Copa del Rey quarterfinal on Wednesday night. The Argentina forward, who headed off clubmates Andres Iniesta and Xavi to win the FIFA Ballon d'Or on Monday, proved the difference after the visitors provided stern early resistance. The 23-year-old finally broke the deadlock a minute before halftime with a delightful chip, and the tie was effectively over ahead of next week's second leg when he completed his treble with 17 minutes to play. Betis deserved better for their first-half efforts, highlighted by Ruben Castro crashing a shot against the crossbar soon after Messi's opener. Why were EPL players snubbed in all-star selection? But in the end they had goalkeeper Casto to thank that the scoreline was not even greater as he bravely thwarted a succession of Barca attacks. As it was, Pedro made it 4-0 on 76 with his 13th goal in 14 games after Casto blocked Daniel Alves' initial effort, and Seydou Keita headed the fifth with seven minutes to play as he rose high to meet Iniesta's outrageous scooped cross. Midfielder Iniesta also had an assist with Messi's first, while the second came in the 62nd minute following a pass from David Villa as the diminutive hero of the Catalan crowd squeezed home from an acute angle after Casto beat out his first attempt. Messi took his tally to 31 for the season when he won a one-on-one duel with the keeper, but Casto denied him a fourth from a similar situation before he was substituted. Messi claims World Player of the Year award . Josep Guardiola's team, seeking a 26th King's Cup crown, are now unbeaten in 29 matches in all competitions since the shock loss to Hercules in early September. In Wednesday's other quarterfinal tie, cup holders Sevilla battled back to earn a 3-3 draw away to third-placed La Liga side Villarreal. The home team twice led by two goals, as Cani and Italy forward Giuseppe Rossi made it 2-0 inside the opening half hour. Striker Alvaro Negredo replied with the first of his two goals six minutes before halftime but Marco Ruben restored Villarreal's advantage 10 minutes after the break. Blatter hails La Liga as 'best in the world' Negredo leveled on the hour mark and defender Alexis Ruano grabbed a crucial third away goal ahead of the decider at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan. On Thursday, 17-time winners Real Madrid host city rivals Atletico while Deportivo La Coruna travel to Almeria in a clash between two of La Liga's struggling teams. Inter Milan moved into the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup on Wednesday night as the defending champions won 3-2 at home to Genoa with two goals from striker Samuel Eto'o. The Cameroon star struck in the 15th minute and again just before halftime with a fierce half-volley for his 21st this season, but Genoa midfielder Houssine Kharja reduced the deficit nine minutes after the break with a penalty following a foul by debutant defender Andrea Ranocchia -- playing against his former club. Kenyan midfielder MacDonald Mariga restored Inter's two-goal advantage with a header from a corner five minutes later, and Giuseppe Sculli's reply in time added on was just a consolation. Palermo also progressed into the last eight of the Coppa Italia with a 1-0 win at home to Chievo, as Fabrizio Miccoli scored the only goal from the penalty spot with 10 minutes left.","World player of year Lionel Messi nets treble as Barcelona thrash  second division Betis .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- Former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay will serve three years in prison on his November conviction on money laundering and conspiracy charges, a Texas judge ruled Monday. Judge Pat Priest sentenced DeLay to three years on the conspiracy charge and five years on the money-laundering charge. But the judge will allow DeLay to serve 10 years probation with community service on the laundering charge in lieu of the prison sentence, and the two sentences will be served concurrently. Priest remanded DeLay into custody and set a $10,000 bond pending appeal. Defense attorney Dick DeGuerin left the courthouse quickly after the sentence was announced but he spoke briefly, saying, ""If I told you what I thought, I would get sued. This will not stand."" Addressing the court prior to the sentencing, DeLay argued that he still doesn't believe he did anything wrong and never did anything for personal gain. ""I always intended to follow the law,"" he said. ""I'm not stupid. Everything I did I had accountants and lawyers telling me what to do and how to follow the letter of the law, even the spirit of the law."" DeLay was found guilty in November of illegally funneling corporate money to help elect Republican candidates to the Texas legislature. ""Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did,"" he said. Earlier, prosecutor Steve Brandt urged the judge to send DeLay to prison, saying the once-powerful Republican showed too much disregard for the law to warrant community service and probation. ""He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever,"" said prosecutor Steve Brandt in his closing arguments. ""The man, according to him, does nothing wrong."" ""He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today."" ""If he gets probation,"" Brandt said, ""and those people who read the newspaper tomorrow ... will say, 'I told you. He wears a tie, he gets probation.'"" ""I'm going to use a quote from Alexander Hamilton,"" he said. ""'No one is above the law.'"" DeGuerin countered that ""no purpose would be served today by sending Tom DeLay to prison ... He lost it all already."" DeGuerin stressed DeLay's lifetime of public service, detailing ""his good works for his party, his state and his country,"" and claimed that the prosecution was ""political."" ""We accept the jury entered its verdict, but we do not accept it,"" he said. ""We will challenge it ... and we have the right."" DeGuerin said the prosecution was based on the redistricting that took place by the new Texas legislature after the 2002 election -- an effort that changed district lines and cost several Democrats their congressional seats. ""I say that the redistricting that came about ... is what motivated the prosecution to go after him,"" the attorney said, ""because for the first time in decades, the representation represented more of the voters' make-up of Texas."" At the outset of the trial, DeLay predicted he would be proclaimed innocent and called his conviction ""an abuse of power"" and ""a miscarriage of justice."" DeLay was found guilty of money laundering and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after being accused of funneling $190,000 to help elect Republicans to the state House and Senate in 2002. He faced a possible maximum prison term of 99 years on the money-laundering charge and 20 years on the conspiracy charge. The prosecution had asked for the full extent of punishment or ""no less than 10 years confinement."" The defense sought only probation. Two other men facing charges in the case are awaiting trial. DeLay, a conservative Republican, helped Newt Gingrich spearhead the GOP revival in 1994 that won control of the House and Senate in the first midterm election under Democratic President Bill Clinton. While serving as the GOP's congressional whip, DeLay earned the nickname ""The Hammer"" for his strict enforcement of party discipline. In 2004, he was admonished three times by the House ethics committee, which warned him to ""temper"" his future actions to comply with House rules. DeLay stepped aside as majority leader after his 2005 indictment on the money-laundering and conspiracy charges and resigned from Congress the following year. He fought the charges on procedural grounds for several years seeking unsuccessfully to have the trial held in his home county in suburban Houston instead of in the state capital, Austin, and blaming the indictment on a partisan prosecutor. This past summer, DeLay said a separate, long-running federal criminal investigation of his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff had been closed with no charges. Abramoff pleaded guilty in 2006 to charges of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy to bribe public officials. Two former DeLay aides who joined Abramoff's lobbying team after leaving Capitol Hill, also pleaded guilty during the wide-ranging influence peddling investigation. The Justice Department has declined to comment on the status of the Abramoff investigation, which also resulted in prison time for Ohio Republican Rep. Bob Ney and for Steven Griles, the No. 2 official in the Interior Department for much of the administration of President George W. Bush. On Monady, DeLay told the judge that his legal bills have topped $10 million. Despite his legal troubles, DeLay found time last year to appear as a short-lived contestant on the television show ""Dancing with the Stars."" He dropped out of the demanding dance competition due to stress fractures in both feet.

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton scored an early boost over his three Formula One world-championship rivals on Friday as he set the fastest time in practice ahead of Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Hamilton's lap time of one minute 40.888 seconds put him clear of Red Bull duo Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, who finished second and fourth respectively, with Fernando Alonso -- the favorite to take the 2010 crown at the season-ending race -- third fastest. Who needs to do what to win the F1 drivers' title . Two-time champion Alonso, 29, is the only one of the four who can seal the title at the Yas Marina Circuit with a top-two finish regardless of where the others finish, with each of the remaining drivers needing results to go their way for victory. Hamilton still holds a slim hope of winning his second championship; he is currently fourth in the standings, 24 points behind leader Alonso, with 25 points on offer for the winner of the season's final race.

The 25-year-old had to battle with his Ferrari counterpart as they traded fast laps, but it was the 2008 champion who eventually got the better of the Spaniard. ""The car feels good, so I'm hopeful for a good qualifying result tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon,"" said Hamilton in a McLaren statement. ""Of course, it will be tough, because the Red Bulls tend to pull out half a second in the third round of qualifying, but our pace is closer to theirs than it's ever been. ""Of all the weekends this year, this time I feel like we really do have the right package to challenge the fastest cars. I think we can fight for the front row."" The first practice session was dogged by unexpected rain on the track until the skies cleared and the driver's enjoyed a disruption-free second session. Webber was almost half a second slower than the British pacesetter and knows he will need to improve over the course of the weekend if he is to win his first title. A repeat of the Australian's fourth place in practice will require Alonso to finish ninth or lower in race for him to triumph. It was a decent start to the weekend for 23-year-old Vettel, who will more than likely need maximum points from Abu Dhabi to avoid the disappointment of finishing runner up for the second season running.","Lewis Hamilton set the fastest lap time in practice ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"Tunis, Tunisia (CNN) -- As clashes spread Tuesday, a Tunisian workers union called on President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali to order an independent inquiry into the deaths of demonstrators protesting high unemployment and poor living conditions in Tunisia. Union sources said the death toll had exceeded 50 since mid-December, but Minister of Information Samir Abidi said approximately 21 people were killed during two days of rioting in two Tunisian cities near its border with Algeria. He challenged Arab and international news media who were reporting higher tolls to provide a list of the dead. The unrest occurred in the cities of Thala and Kasserine, said Abidi. All of the dead were demonstrators; more than 30 police were injured, he said. State-run television and the information ministry reported that violent clashes between police and demonstrators occurred Tuesday in a suburb of Tunis. The union Tuesday demanded the release of demonstrators and said it will call a general strike in several southern cities in response to what it calls police brutality. It also condemned acts of vandalism. Amnesty International said Tuesday -- without citing a source -- that ""scores"" have been killed in the protests and at least 23 people died in protests over the weekend. The organization also said that ""scores have reportedly been detained in the protests, with authorities carrying out mass arrests and night raids."" Amnesty called for an investigation into the deaths and for those responsible to be punished. The demonstrations included demands for the government to improve social services. Tunisia's government called the protesters violent troublemakers. Tunisia has been ruled for 23 years by Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an ally of Western powers and a target of activist and human rights groups that accuse him of running a corrupt police state that has infringed on citizens' rights. Reporters Without Borders said Tuesday that a number of journalists and bloggers have been arrested for reporting on the events. But Ben Ali said Monday that ""certain parties ... have sought to involve our students and unemployed youth ... by spreading erroneous slogans of despair and concocting false news."" In his second speech since the riots erupted, he said Monday on national radio and television that he was ordering the creation of as many as 300,000 jobs and called for greater freedoms for members of the news media. ""These violent, sometimes bloody events, which caused deaths among civilians and injuries among security officers, were perpetrated by hooded gangs that attacked, at night, public institutions and even citizens in their houses,"" he said. ""This is an intolerable act of terrorism."" He said he would lower taxes on employers who generate new jobs. Tunisia's 14% unemployment rate does not reflect the true problems faced by the nation, said Abidi, the information minister. The government pays for college educations, but only about a third of the 80,000 students who graduate each year from the nation's universities are able to find work, he said. As a result, he said, unemployment among college graduates hovers around 25%. The wave of demonstrations was sparked by the suicide of an unemployed college graduate in December. Mohamed Bouazizi, 26, set himself on fire in front of a government building in the town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his fruit cart, saying he was selling without a permit, according to Amnesty International. In an interview with Al-Arabiya carried out Tuesday in Dubai, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she regretted that Tunisia on Monday summoned the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia to express its discontent over U.S. criticism. ""What the ambassador and what the State Department back in Washington did was just express concern that this is a protest that has, unfortunately, provoked such a reaction from the government, leading to the deaths of mostly young people who were protesting."" CNN's Richard Roth and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Clashes break out in suburb of capital .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia's quest for a fourth Asian Cup title, and first since 1996, is over after they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Jordan in Doha on Thursday. A mistake from goalkeeper Waleed Abdullah sealed Saudi Arabia's fate, as the kingdom slumped to their second successive defeat following their surprise 2-1 loss to Syria on Sunday. Last weekend's defeat saw the instant dismissal of Portuguese coach Jose Peseiro, but his replacement Nasser Al Johar failed to get the victory the Saudi's needed to keep their tournament alive, despite making four changes to his side. An ominous sign for the 2022 World Cup? The only goal of the game came three minutes before half-time against the run of play. There looked no danger when Baha Abdelrahman floated in a cross from the right hand side, but Abdullah completely misjudged the flight of the ball and could only watch on in horror as it looped into the net. Despite the shock nature of their exit, Al Johar was philosophical about the defeat. ""We played very well and we created opportunities to score, especially in the second half,"" he told reporters. ""But we were not lucky and this is football. Maybe we'll do better in the future,"" he added. The result means Saudi Arabia become the first team to bow out of the competition and puts Jordan level on points with Japan at the top of the group. Meanwhile, Group B favorites Japan claimed a hard fought 2-1 win over Syria in the day's other match to move onto four points after their two matches. Japan were never at their best against committed opponents, who would have qualified for the knockout stages with another victory, and a tense encounter saw both teams finish with 10 men. Captain Makoto Hasebe opened the scoring for the three-time champions in the 35th minute, finding the corner of the net with a well-placed strike after some superb individual play from Keisuke Honda. However, Syria levelled in controversial fashion with 14 minutes remaining, when Firas Al Khatib netted from the penalty spot after goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima had fouled Sanharib Malki -- despite the player being flagged offside. Japan's players protested vehemently but the Iranian referee stuck by his decision, sending off Kawashima in the process. Despite being a man down, Japan rallied and won the match in the 80th minute when Honda coverted another penalty, given after Ali Dyab had brought down substitute striker Shinji Okazaki. Syria were also to finish with 10 men after Nadim Sabagh was sent off in injury time for two quick yellow cards. Japan only need to draw with Saudi Arabia in their final match to qualify for the next stage, while whoever wins the match between Jordan and Syria will join them, although Jordan also just need a point from that fixture.","Saudi Arabia crash out of the Asian Cup after a 1-0 defeat by Jordan on Thursday .

"(CNN) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter believes Spain's La Liga is the best football league in the world, and claims that England's top division can learn from it. In an exclusive interview with CNN's World Sport, Blatter pointed to the eight Spain-based players in the 2010 FIFA World XI and Spain's World Cup success as justification. ""(Looking at the World XI) it must be the strongest league in the world,"" he said. ""And when you see the starting XI of the Spanish national team (who won the World Cup), all of them play their football in Spain. The Spanish league also has the highest number of local players."" Why were EPL players snubbed in all-star team? Blatter told World Sport's Pedro Pinto the lack of England-based players in the FIFA World XI undermined the quality of the country's Premier League. ""The Premier League is the best-marketed league in the world,"" he said. ""It's a good league, with good players, but when you consider not one player made the best XI of the world, maybe they should think about whether something can be adapted."" The FIFA World XI featured six players from Barcelona and two from Real Madrid, with the other three from Italian Serie A champions Inter Milan. Among their number was the 2010 Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, the 23-year-old midfielder who beat his Barcelona teammates Xavi and Andres Iniesta to be named the world's best player for the second year in a row. ""Leo Messi is what I identify as a wonderful football player and a good boy. He is really humble. It's not a game he's playing, he's not an actor,"" Blatter said. Have your say on Blatter's decisions . Blatter said Messi needed to win a World Cup before he could be compared to fellow Argentine Diego Maradona, captain of the 1986 champion side. ""When I compare Messi to Maradona, both are excellent, talented players. They could not be more talented. But the difference is their personal educational characteristics,"" Blatter said. ""One is still in football, modest and not trying to get into the extravaganza. The other did it.""","FIFA president Sepp Blatter believes Spanish La Liga is best in the world .

"Washington (CNN) -- A bevy of political and diplomatic heavyweights came together Friday to remember Richard Holbrooke, the veteran U.S. diplomat who died last month after surgery to repair a tear in his aorta. A memorial service at the Kennedy Center was attended by President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, former President Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Pakistani President Asif Zardari also attended, along with FBI Director Robert Mueller and Joints Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, among others. Holbrooke led ""an extraordinary life,"" Obama said.  He ""was the leading light of a generation of American diplomats who came of age in Vietnam."" ""The list of places he served and the things he did reads as a chronicle of American foreign policy"" in recent decades, Obama noted.  His ""coupling of realism and idealism ... always represented what is best in American foreign policy."" He ""made a difference,"" the president concluded.  ""Let us now carry that work forward."" Obama announced the creation of an annual Richard C. Holbrooke Award for Diplomacy to honor ""especially meritorious contributions to diplomacy."" In an interview with CNN last month, Zardari called Holbrooke an ""extremely hard-working man"" who can ""get things done which would otherwise take weeks to get through."" In a statement released last month, Hillary Clinton said the nation had lost one of its top champions. ""He was the consummate diplomat, able to stare down dictators and stand up for America's interests and values even under the most difficult circumstances,"" she said. ""Few people have ever left a larger mark on the State Department or our country."" Holbrooke, 69, died December 13. He most recently served as the Obama administration's point man in the volatile Afghan-Pakistani war zone. Holbrooke, however, was perhaps best known for his role as the chief architect of the Dayton Peace Accords -- signed December 14, 1995 -- which ended the deadly ethnic conflict that erupted during the breakup of Yugoslavia. One of the world's most recognizable diplomats, Holbrooke's career spanned five decades, from the Vietnam War era to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, from the presidency of John F. Kennedy to that of Obama. He also worked as a journalist and an investment banker. But as a diplomat, he was plain-speaking, accessible and known for his tough-mindedness. ""I had the honor and privilege of working with Richard through many international crises over several decades, most particularly the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo,"" Albright said after his death last month. ""He could always be counted on for his imagination, dedication and forcefulness."" After Obama took office in 2008, Holbrooke took one of the toughest diplomatic assignments -- U.S. special  representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, the region the president regards as critical to the fight against terrorism. Holbrooke's assertive style worked in the Balkans, but it brought perils for diplomats in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where long stretches of chatting and tea-drinking are the norm. He was frank in his assessments about the region and officials in both countries regarded him as abrasive, including Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In April 2009, there were reports of a heated argument between Holbrooke and Karzai after charges of fraud surfaced in the Afghan presidential election. Karzai's office issued a statement that described Holbrooke as ""a veteran and seasoned diplomat who had served greatly to the government and the people of the United States."" In an October interview with CNN, Holbrooke cautioned patience in the struggle against the militants and for democracy in the so-called AfPak region, a mission that he said was of the ""most vital importance to our national security interests."" ""We are determined to see it through,"" he said, and he made reference to the Vietnam War and the Dayton Accords in his comments. He noted that dealing with so many foes on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border made the process difficult. ""A peace deal requires agreements, and you don't make agreements with your friends, you make agreements with your enemies,"" he said. Holbrooke mentioned a range of militant groups, such as the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban, the Haqqani network, and Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and noted that ""an expert could add another 30."" ""There's no Ho Chi Minh. There's no Slobodan Milosevic. There's no Palestinian Authority. There is a widely dispersed group of people that we roughly call the enemy. There's al Qaeda, with which there's no possibility of any discussion at all."" ""There is no clear single address that you go to,"" he said.","Obama praises Holbrooke's ""coupling of realism and idealism""

"(CNN) -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has told CNN that the Red Bull team should have already tied up the Formula One drivers' title -- and can only blame themselves for not having done so. Fernando Alonso is in pole position to win his third crown, this time for Schumacher's former team Ferrari, at the 2010 season finale in Abu Dhabi this weekend. The Spaniard has an eight-point lead from Mark Webber, with the Australian's Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel another seven points off the pace. The Austrian outfit has already clinched the constructors' title, but Schumacher claims the drivers' battle should not have gone to the final race -- hinting at the widespread reports of tension between Vettel and Webber. ""I guess the main reason why the championship is still open is due to the fact that one particular team has made quite a few errors this year,"" he said. Blog: Vettel win ushers in new era . ""And if you think out of 18 races they took 15 pole positions and still only being second and third in the drivers' championship -- they want to win the championship, yes. ""But that shows a little bit that something has gone wrong somewhere ... not wanting to go into the details. But it's been exciting, and lots of happenings even from other teams -- so let's see what the final race will bring to us."" The F1 title race lowdown . Schumacher's return to F1 may not have been quite as successful as he would have hoped, but the German believes his past success has helped his younger compatriots. The 23-year-old Vettel has impressed as the best of a new line of German talent including Williams' Nico Hulkenberg and Schumacher's Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg. Add Virgin's Timo Glock and Force India's Adrian Sutil to the mix -- both of whom are still under 30 -- along with Sauber's comparative veteran Nick Heidfeld, and there will be seven Germans on the starting grid at Yas Marina. Latest F1 championship standings . Schumacher, who dominated motorsport's elite class with Ferrari before retiring in late 2006, said he deserved some credit for raising F1's popularity in his home country. ""No doubt I did, yes -- I mean the reason me being successful initiated a lot of manufacturers that we do have in Germany,"" the 41-year-old said. ""I mean we are probably the biggest manufacturers of road cars in Germany, in terms of high-end cars, and having F1 to be so popular in Germany obviously triggered interest of all those manufacturers. Alonso ignores talk of Red Bull team orders . ""And on this principal they initiated young driver programs where Sebastian is a result out of this one, and I guess I can take some credit from that."" Schumacher is ninth in the drivers' standings, having been unable to add to his record 154 podium finishes this year, while Rosberg is seventh with three third-place finishes. He is looking forward to the second year of his contract with Mercedes, which has struggled to build on the success of last year's world champion Brawn outfit since taking it over late last year. Is Ferrari's Fernando the best on the grid? ""Well the future is very clearly to make step by step the development that we really have initiated this year and take the fruits of it by starting [well] next year,"" Schumacher said. ""Who knows how quick we can recover from our slightly down performance this year ... whether we can immediately go back into the championship fight next year or it needs a little bit more build-up time and lead time until the year after. ""But I'm pretty sure next year we'll be much more competitive and we should be able to win races.""","Michael Schumacher hints at problems in Red Bull camp ahead of title decider .

"(CNN) -- Two-time world footballer of the year Ronaldinho has joined Flamengo on a four-year contract, the Brazilian club confirmed on Tuesday. The 30-year-old, whose star has fallen since being named the planet's best player in 2004 and 2005 while with Spanish club Barcelona, has left Italian league leaders AC Milan with six months left to run on his contract. The fee was not disclosed. The Brazilian forward fell down the pecking order at Milan following the arrival of compatriot Robinho, Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and, most recently, Italian bad-boy Antonio Cassano. He has stated that he wants to win back his international place back for when his nation hosts the 2014 World Cup, and initially had been expected to rejoin his hometown club Gremio, with Flamengo and Palmeiras also interested. English Premier League club Blackburn also made an ambitious offer to sign the former Paris Saint Germain player. ""We are pleased to announce the hiring of Ronaldinho for the next four years,"" Flamengo president Patricia Amorim told the club's official website. ""I thank the board for the discretion and wisdom throughout the negotiations. ""This project started from the first day I got the presidency. I thank the legal department to (head coach Wanderley) Luxemburgo and especially the fans of Flamengo.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama began working Monday night on the speech he will deliver during a memorial service Wednesday for the victims of Saturday's mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona. White House officials say Obama has determined the broad idea of what he wants to say and is working with his team of speechwriters on drafting his remarks. According to one White House official, the president will likely continue tweaking the speech throughout the day before his scheduled Wednesday evening remarks. While the details, tone and length of the speech have not been released, Obama ""will devote most of his remarks to memorializing the victims,"" a White House official said. ""As president of the United States, but also as a father, obviously I'm spending a lot of time just thinking about the families and reaching out to them,"" Obama said Monday. Obama will also meet with family members of victims in Tucson, according to a White House official. The official said details are still being worked out on how many families he will meet with and where. Like many presidents before him, Obama is thrust into the position of ""mourner-in-chief"" in the face of a national tragedy. President Ronald Reagan was the voice of a nation grieving after the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in 1986. ""We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God,'"" Reagan said from the Oval Office. President Bill Clinton's remarks following the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, bombing in 1995 were widely praised and were described by many as a defining moment in his presidency. ""Let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear,"" Clinton said at the nationally televised memorial service in Oklahoma City. ""When there is talk of hatred, let us stand up and talk against it. When there is talk of violence, let us stand up and talk against it. In the face of death, let us honor life."" From his impromptu remarks and rallying cry atop of mound of rubble at ground zero in New York to his memorable speech at Washington's National Cathedral, President George W. Bush faced a similar task of bringing the country together in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. ""It is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation as well,"" Bush said. ""In this trial, we have been reminded, and the world has seen, that our fellow Americans are generous and kind, resourceful and brave,"" he said. This will not be Obama's first time in this unfortunate territory: He spoke after the West Virginia coal mine tragedy in April 2010 and the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas, in which 13 people were killed, in November 2009. ""It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy. But this much we do know -- no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts,"" Obama said during the Fort Hood memorial service. As is always the case, the big challenge is striking the right tone, said presidential scholar Stephen Hess. ""He has to give a lovely, passionate memorial statement, a eulogy of grief, of hope perhaps for the future, said Hess, a former adviser to Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter. ""But it's not a political speech and it has to be carefully stated it's not a political speech. ""It's always a fine line like this. If he chooses to step over the line and talk about things that subsequently can be dissected as political ... then he's made a mistake and he's done a disservice,"" Hess said. ""But that, I think, is unlikely to happen,"" Hess said. CNN's Ed Henry contributed to this report.","President Obama continues to work on speech he will deliver at memorial Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Here's the thing: Blaming Arizona is easy. In the wake of the terrible shooting at that congressional town hall meeting, it is simple to point to a rampant culture of easy gun access, intolerance, and anti-government fever and say, ""Sure, this man was unbalanced, but the wild winds of the Grand Canyon State blew him over the edge."" Just ask Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik, who jumped into the fray with his reaction. ""Well, I think we're the Tombstone of the United States of America,"" he said, evoking his state's storied history. ""We have become the Mecca for prejudice and bigotry."" Since then Dupnik has been assailed on TV, radio, and the internet as a grief-blinded malcontent by some conservatives, and praised as a clearsighted analyst by some liberals -- both sides armed with broad generalizations about Arizona. But having lived out West for 10 years, I have a generalization of my own: Pundits in the East often make pronouncements about the world beyond the Mississippi, when their on-the-ground experience with such places consists of campaign visits, speaking engagements, and skiing trips. In other words, they're talking out of their Jackson Holes, if you know what I mean. So I thought I'd look at some of the evidence to see if Arizona really has become unmoored from the rest of us -- a rogue state in which the unthinkable not only happens, but may be a byproduct of social and political unrest run amok. I started with guns. In August 2009, President Obama spoke in Phoenix, only to find a guy outside the hall making off with the headlines by showing up with a semiautomatic rifle slung over his shoulder. He said he was exercising his Second Amendment rights. He picked the right place. Arizona has some of the nation's most lenient gun laws. You can buy, possess and carry a handgun there far more easily than in most places, and gun-control advocates were plenty worried long before these killings. As Paul Helmke from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence told me about the accused Arizona shooter, Jared Loughner, ""This individual broke no laws in purchasing the gun, broke no laws in carrying the gun, broke no laws in having an extended clip with 30 bullets in it. He didn't break a single law until he pulled the trigger!"" Gun-rights advocates counter that other places which have pioneered much more restrictive laws, such as the District of Columbia, still have higher violent crime rates. True. But the facts suggest that whatever problems Loughner faced, Arizona's laws made sure that getting a gun was not one of them. Next, I looked at Arizona's sociopolitical climate, which seems to be broadly accepted as one of the hottest in the country. Among the flashpoints: cuts for Medicaid transplants, Gov. Jan Brewer's bizarre election claim that headless bodies were being found in the desert, and the always entertaining adventures of hell-for-leather lawman Sheriff Joe Arpaio. But the biggest one has been, and continues to be, illegal immigration. Last year's controversial immigration law spurred protests, angry denunciations, and nationwide calls for a boycott. But often overlooked amid the noise: Polls found that a tremendous number of Americans all over agreed with the state's actions. And for anyone who wants to paint Arizona as the poster child for intolerance, this is worth noting: The FBI reports that there were 274 hate crimes in Arizona in 2009. That's pretty robust, but on a per capita basis, the state of Washington had about the same, and Massachusetts was considerably worse. The Southern Poverty Law Center says Arizona has 10 active Patriot groups embracing extreme anti-government doctrines, and the Center's Mark Potok has found echoes of Patriot ideology in Loughner's rambling writings. ""The relationship is indirect, and it is filtered through a mind that is not right,"" Potok tells me, but it is there. So is Arizona's murky right-wing counterculture partially to blame for the shootings? ""It doesn't seem unreasonable to look at something like this and consider its provenance,"" Potok says. Probably so. After all, the Oklahoma City bomber, Timothy McVeigh, believed his attack would spur a popular uprising against the government and that an army of fellow travelers was waiting in the wings; and he did much of his planning while living in Arizona. The problem is almost half the states, according to the Center's website, have as many or more Patriot groups, which would mean if we are going to connect these dots, that those states too are potential hotbeds in which violent, maybe mentally ill extremists could grow. For example, New York has 17 Patriot groups; Michigan, 47; Texas, 52. We reached out to one of Arizona's most well-known Patriot groups, the Arizona Citizens Militia, which clearly portrays big government as an enemy and urges citizens to be prepared to defend their rights, their homes, whatever. Its website is packed with military imagery. These groups, in my experience, are notoriously media-shy and difficult to reach. And yet within minutes of my request for their views on the shooting, they sent this response: . ""It makes your heart hurt for the entire country. This just keeps happening over and over again. The one common denominator seems to be that most of the shooters are mentally ill, but driven by current events. We don't have any answer either. We're just trying to do what we can to protect our country and our borders."" I suspect how people react to that message would tell me as much about the reader as it would about the writer. And maybe that's the whole point. The facts suggest that Arizona does have difficulties; certainly, it is near the upper end of states around which furious social and political debates are swirling. It is not unfair to consider that some of the language, actions, and laws connected to those debates can combine with a violent, deranged mind to produce awful consequences. But Arizona is far from alone. If the shots had been heard in any number of other states, we might also hear the same innuendoes that are now being sneered at Arizona. The viciousness of our public debates, the dirtiness of our politics, the anger of our people are not confined to one town, one state, or one region. They are everywhere. Only the degrees are different. How you see the facts on Arizona depends on how you come at them. As I said: Blaming Arizona is easy. But almost 7 million Americans live there, and all we know for certain is that one of them did something terribly wrong.","Some blame Arizona's culture for shootings, Foreman writes, but is that realistic?
Arizona has very lenient gun laws, but places with stricter laws have higher crime rates .
Arizona's rates of hate crimes, extremist groups are comparable to other states .
Anger, vicious political debate are found everywhere, Foreman says ."
"(CNN) -- Events are scheduled around the United States to commemorate civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. as the nation marks the 25th anniversary of a holiday in his honor. President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama planned to mark the day by participating in a service project in Washington. ""Martin Luther King, Jr. lived his life for others, dedicating his work to ensuring equal opportunity, freedom, and justice for all,"" Obama said in a statement. ""I encourage every American to observe this holiday in honor of Dr. King's selfless legacy by volunteering in their own communities and by dedicating time each day to bettering the lives of those around us."" A federal holiday to honor King, who was assassinated in 1968, was first observed in 1986. In 1994, Congress also designated it a national day of service. A video posted on mlkday.gov, the U.S. government website dedicated to the day, quotes King: ""He who is greatest among you shall be a servant. That's the new definition of greatness. ... By giving that definition of greatness, it means that everybody can be great, because everybody can serve."" The site calls on Americans to honor King by ""pledging to take at least 25 actions during 2011 to make a difference for others and strengthen our communities."" Vice President Joe Biden and numerous Cabinet secretaries and administration officials are also scheduled to participate in service events, the White House said. King's son, Martin Luther King III, is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at a memorial service at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church. The Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network said it planned to mark the day with a breakfast in Washington and a public policy forum in New York. In a statement Sunday, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar noted that a memorial in King's honor is under construction on the National Mall in Washington. ""When completed later this year, the memorial will serve to remind us of Dr. King's hope, sense of justice, and quest for equality,"" he said. A march ""for jobs and justice"" was scheduled to begin at that monument site Monday and end at the Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech.","The federal holiday was first observed in 1986 .

"(CNN) -- AT&T has been slow to adopt a feature that lets customers share a smartphone data signal wirelessly to other gadgets and computers. But a mobile hotspot feature is coming to at least two new AT&T phones running Google's Android operating system. The carrier is also mulling whether it will add the ability to Apple's iPhone through a software update. Verizon Wireless says its iPhone 4 models, which come out February 10, will have the hotspot feature. The next version of the iPhone's operating system, iOS 4.3, will have that ability built in, say developers who were provided with access to a beta version. But it's unclear whether AT&T will allow customers to make use of the feature. ""It's something we're taking a look at,"" said AT&T spokesman Mark Siegel. He declined to comment on negotiations with Apple regarding the feature's deployment. Once the hotspot feature is enabled, a phone creates its own Wi-Fi access point. Then as many as five devices, usually, such as laptops, iPods, Kindles or other Wi-Fi-enabled electronics, can get online. Enabling the feature generally reduces the phone's battery more quickly. HTC's Inspire 4G and Motorola's Atrix 4G, two upcoming AT&T Android phones, will allow owners to subscribe to a more expensive data plan in order to utilize mobile hotspot. Some AT&T phones, including the iPhone, offer a feature called tethering. This uses a phone's USB cable or a Bluetooth connection to share the internet connection to a single computer. The extra monthly fee for tethering is comparable to what AT&T will charge for hot spot. T-Mobile USA offered its free Hotspot feature on Google's Nexus One phone. However, a T-Mobile spokesman said in June that usage of that is ""not something the company encourages."" Now, T-Mobile offers the feature, with an upgraded data plan, to MyTouch 4G owners. Sprint Nextel's Evo and Verizon's Droid phones, among others, can act as hotspots. For Verizon's 3G phones, the internet signal is cut -- and the connected devices dropped -- when on a phone call. That's a limitation of the type of 3G network Verizon uses, but it shouldn't affect the carrier's upcoming 4G phones. Verizon, with Mi-Fi, was one of the first carriers out of the gate to offer standalone hardware that connects to its wireless data network and shares that signal with other devices. AT&T, which has perpetually struggled to meet data demand from iPhone customers in the last three years, began selling a Mi-Fi device in November -- more than a year after competitors. As AT&T rolls out faster networks, including 4G infrastructure with speeds to match Verizon's later this year, the second-largest U.S. carrier by subscribers is finally ready to encourage heavier data usage. That's especially an attractive proposition for the company now that it has a tiered pricing plan in place to charge heavy users more.","AT&T is preparing to allow customers to use a feature called mobile hotspot .

AT&T is late, compared to competitors, in adding this ability to its phones ."
"(CNN) -- Iran's bid for a record fourth Asian Cup final title began with a 2-1 victory over neighbors Iraq in Qatar on Tuesday, thanks to a late goalkeeping error by the defending champions' Mohammed Kassid. Kassid completely misjudged a dipping free-kick from out on the left by Iman Mobali, which bounced in front of him and appeared to go through his legs in the 84th minute. One of the fiercest rivalries in world football produced a relatively low-key affair, with the booking received by Iraq substitute Samer Saeed that led to the goal being the only yellow card brandished by Uzbekistan referee Ravshan Irmatov. Iran made the worst possible start in the long-awaited pivotal match in Group D when conceding the opening goal against the run of play in the 12th minute. An ominous sign ahead of the 2022 World Cup? Iraq skipper Younis Mahmoud, the player of the tournament four years ago after netting the only goal of the final against Saudi Arabia, was credited with the score after ramming the ball home from right on the line after Emad Mohammed's header back across the box appeared to be heading in anyway. However, Iran leveled three minutes before halftime when Gholam Reza Rezai beat the offside trap to collect Andranik Teymourian's clever pass into the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Kassid for his ninth international goal. Pitch warfare: Iran take on Iraq . The Iranians could not make their dominance count until Kassid's mistake, with Rezai coming closest to scoring shortly before that lapse when he hit the sidenetting. Al-Rayyan Stadium was barely half-full for a match between nations at war from 1980-88, with a brief period of silence before the kickoff in honor of the77 people who died in Iran after a plane crash on Sunday. ""When these two teams play each other there's so much rivalry and history, so it's very difficult to get the players to concentrate and focus on football and it becomes a fighting game,"" Iran coach Afshin Ghotbi said in quotes reported by the AFP news agency. ""I was very happy my players were able to concentrate and could get this very special three points."" North Korea and the United Arab Emirates earlier kicked off the Group D schedule with a 0-0 draw at the Qatar Sports Club in match between teams ranked 105th and 108th in the world respectively. Captain Hong Yong-Jo missed an eighth-minute penalty for the Koreans, who qualified for the 2010 World Cup but lost all three matches, after Hamdan Al Kamali fouled Germany-based striker Jong Tae-Se. Five football matches that changed the world . The Middle Eastern side, runners-up when hosts in 1996, went on to dominate the game after Hong's spotkick hit the bar but could not beat goalkeeper Ri Myong-Guk. The U.A.E. had won their only previous Asian Cup encounter in 1992 -- the communist country's last Asian Cup appearance, and second since it began in 1956. ""We didn't play well. It was our first match and the players showed about 80% of their skills,"" said North Korea coach Jo Tong-Sop, who took over from Kim Jong-Hun after the World Cup. ""After failing the penalty shot, it became psychologically tough for our players as they became nervous."" Qatar welcomes half the world . Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia have brought back Nasser Al Johar for a fifth stint as national coach ahead of Thursday's second Group B clash with Jordan. Portugal's Jose Peseiro was sacked after the shock 2-1 defeat by Syria on Sunday. Peseiro replaced Al Johar in 2009 when the Green Falcons failed to qualify for last year's World Cup.","Mohammed Kassid's late error gives three-time Asian Cup winners Iran a winning start .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- As the U.S. House of Representatives resumes regular business Monday for the first time since since the January 8 Arizona shootings, the congresswoman shot in the attack continued to make progress, and mourners said goodbye to a staff member who rushed to the aid of others and a retired construction worker who died shielding his wife. U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was upgraded from critical to serious condition Sunday, eight days after being shot through the brain at a public event. ""The congresswoman continues to do well,"" University Medical Center in Tucson said in a statement Sunday. Giffords was among 19 people shot at the ""Congress on Your Corner"" event at a Tucson supermarket. Authorities believe she was the target of the mass shooting that left six dead and another 13 wounded. A 22-year-old suspect, Jared Lee Loughner, is in custody. On Sunday, the funeral for Dorwan Stoddard took place in Tucson. Witnesses said when the gunfire rang out, Stoddard, 76, was trying to protect his wife, Mavy, when he was shot in the head and fell onto her. Mavy Stoddard was shot three times in her legs but is expected to recover. ""He threw himself over me,"" Mavy Stoddard said last week. ""I think it was the last shots that killed him. So he saved my life, and gave his for it. And you cannot ask for much more."" A memorial for Gabriel ""Gabe"" Zimmerman, 30, also took place Sunday. Zimmerman was director for community outreach on Giffords' staff and was engaged to be married. In addition to Stoddard and Zimmerman, those killed included 9-year-old Christina Green; Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll; Dorothy Morris, 76; and Phyllis Schneck, 79. The contentious issue of gun control was put in the spotlight Saturday when one of the 13 wounded in the attack was involuntarily committed to a county mental services unit after he made threats against a Tea Party member at a town hall event in Tucson. James Eric Fuller, 63, photographed Trent Humphries and said, ""You are dead,"" when Humphries began speaking at the event, according to Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jason Ogan. Humphries told CNN that Fuller's comment came when the town hall discussion turned toward the issue of gun control. ""I was asked to give my thoughts on gun control laws and perhaps the passage of new laws,"" Humphries said of the incident. ""I said something to the effect that although gun rights and laws are not necessarily the primary focus of the Tucson Tea Party, our community needs to be given the opportunity to allow some time to pass and people to heal before we start this type of political dialogue.""

"(CNN) -- Borussia Dortmund delivered a devastating blow to Bayer Leverkusen's title hopes with a 3-1 away victory that extended the German league leaders' advantage to 13 points. Leverkusen went into the match in second place on goal difference ahead of Mainz, but paid the price for poor second-half defending as Dortmund made the perfect start following the Bundesliga's mid-winter break. Two goals from Kevin Grosskreutz and another from teenager Mario Gotze gave Jurgen Klopp's team a ninth victory in 10 away trips and 15 from 18 matches overall, in front of a stunned sellout crowd of 30,210 at the BayArena. ""I have been going to watch Dortmund since 1994 and I know what it's like to win the league title as a fan on the terraces,"" Grosskreutz said of his team's hopes of a first championship since 2002. ""I have been dreaming of this since I was a little boy, and I'd love to hold the cup in my hands."" Dortmund hit the post early in the first half with a header by Sven Bender, but Leverkusen slowly got into the game despite leaving veteran Germany international Michael Ballack on the substitutes' bench. However, Grosskreutz broke the deadlock four minutes after the break when Leverkusen defender Manuel Friedrich failed to deal with a long throw by Lukasz Piszczek and actually diverted the ball into the midfielder's path with his arm. Grosskreutz then made it 2-0 in the 53rd minute after Poland striker Robert Lewandowski headed on a long clearance as the home defense was again caught out. The 18-year-old Gotze, who made his international debut for Germany last year, then effectively ended the match two minutes later as he calmly slotted the ball through the legs of Leverkusen keeper Rene Adler for his fifth goal this season after being set free by Grosskreutz. It was Gotze's last significant contribution as he was replaced by top scorer Lucas Barrios, who forced a fine save from Adler in the 70th minute. Stefan Kiessling finally pulled one back for Leverkusen with 10 minutes to play as he bravely poked in a cross by Renato Augusto before colliding with the goal-post. The striker had another chance soon after, but shot wide as Leverkusen dropped down to third place. In Saturday's fixtures, Mainz travel to Stuttgart while fifth-placed defending champions Bayern Munich will try to reduce a 17-point deficit on Dortmund with victory at Wolfsburg.","Kevin Grosskreutz scores twice as Borussia Dortmund extend Bundesliga lead .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: A problem that won't be solved, even if the solution is clear. The story and the reasons, leading off today's broadcast of CNN Student News! My name is Carl Azuz! First Up: Winter Storm Woes . AZUZ: Florida is the only state in the union without snow on the ground and that includes Hawaii! In the northeast, that snow is deep. When a weather emergency is called in New York, which gets more than two feet of snow a year, you know it's bad. More than 1,700 flights have been canceled at New York city's 3 major airports, though the city's public schools stayed open. They're closed in Philly and Boston, though. And across Massachusetts, 64,000 homes had their power knocked out. Forecasters expect 24 inches in some areas. Some of this can be blamed on the storm system that iced out the southeast. And Martin Savidge explains how and why, that's likely to happen again! (BEGIN VIDEO) MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Officials knew Atlanta wasn't prepared for the storm. In fact, over the years the city made a conscious decision not to be ready. Historically, what's been the attitude of the city when it comes to snow or ice? MAYOR KASIM REED, (D) ATLANTA: Well, I mean, when I was a boy growing up here it was a day off, a day or two off. But now that I'm mayor, that's fundamentally different. SAVIDGE: Atlanta has relied on two basic facts -- southern snowstorms are rare, and the best way to get rid of the snow is to simply let it melt. That logic fails about once a decade. This time the city remained shut down for days as roads became impassable. In fact the roads are still so bad I couldn't get to the experts I wanted to interview, so I called them. Do we have any idea of what this snow event for the city of Atlanta may cost? TOM CUNNINGHAM, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA [ON PHONE]: No, not right now. SAVIDGE: Cunningham says because a convention might have been snowed out doesn't mean the city lost money. Remember all those passengers stuck at the airport? Most would have just passed through. Instead they spent money on hotels and ate at area restaurants. What about all those businesses who couldn't work because their employees couldn't get in? CUNNINGHAM [ON PHONE]: There is certainly some lost income associated with hourly workers not being able to get in and get paid. A lot of that aggregate output is going to be made up over the course of the year. SAVIDGE: But why lose it at all? Why not just buy the equipment to handle the snow? I got that answer in my very next call to the Georgia Department of Transportation. JILL GOLDBERG, DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY, GDOT [ON PHONE]: A snowplow is $250,000. You would need so many of them it would be $100 million or more to shell out in order to truly cover all of the interstates. SAVIDGE: And that's not likely to happen in this economy. There are many businesses that were unable to do business, employees couldn't come in. Millions of dollars, maybe tens of millions, maybe more, lost over what appears to be this 3 day period? Still not worth buying the trucks: . REED: My answer right now is no. SAVIDGE: And you know what, the economist says the mayor's probably right. It appears that the business community, at least for now, is in agreement with the city that these events are so rare that its not worth the expense of investment of equipment and personnel. CUNNINGHAM [ON PHONE]: I think that's a fair assessment. (END VIDEO) House Condemns Shooting . AZUZ: A tone of coming together at the U.S. House of Representatives. Yesterday, lawmakers held a bipartisan Congressional prayer service in honor of the 19 shooting victims in Arizona. House Speaker John Boehner said, ""our nation mourns for the victims, it yearns for peace and it thirsts for answers."" Later, the House planned to vote on a Resolution, a statement, that spoke out against the Arizona shooting. President Obama left Washington, D.C. for Tucson, Arizona yesterday. Last night, he was scheduled to speak at a memorial service for attack victims. The president and first lady, whom you see here, were also planning to spend time at the University of Arizona in Tucson, where they were going to visit with victims' families. Blog Report . AZUZ: We're turning now to our Facebook page, for some of your comments on the Arizona shooting. Justin writes that even if the suspect is mentally unstable, he was stable enough to target the Congresswoman, and therefore should be tried and thrown into prison. Savannah lives in a town near Tucson, in Gabrielle Giffords' area. She said she was completely shocked and that this was a horrible tragedy that never should've happened. And Aubrey states, ""when things like this happen, I often wonder what were the signs that he was going to do this, and why could no one see them?"" All of these comments from Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews. And on our blog: Jacob believes that in order for someone to carry a gun, they need to have a mental stability test.

AZUZ: Parts of Queensland, Australia are suffering through what's being called the worst natural disaster in the state's history. Massive flooding has left huge areas of Queensland underwater. And it's not just the people in the middle of these floods who've been affected. Some areas that were able to stay dry have been completely cut off for weeks. Supplies had to be brought in by helicopter. Phil Black is where people are racing against the rising tide. (BEGIN VIDEO) PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The Brisbane river churned swiftly, sweeping away boats, their jetties and other huge pieces of debris. And the water steadily began creeping beyond its banks. But this was just the beginning. This marker on a riverside pub showed what to expect. 2011 is predicted to get very close to the floods of 1974. Very quickly the first streets were inundated and locals were shocked by the water's speed. It's well up there already isn't it? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:It is. It's coming up real quick. BLACK: All along the river people desperately packed what they could into cars and trailers. They raced the water, and some kept going even when they were clearly falling behind. Philip Johnston got his family out before the floods reached his home. PHILIP JOHNSTON, BRISBANE RESIDENT: We've got places to go to so we're right with that. Some of the lower lying guys are going to lose everything. ADAM BESWICK, BRISBANE RESIDENT IN ROW BOAT: Water was halfway up the driveway. Waist deep at the gate. BLACK: We rowed with Adam Beswick to his home, past others with water already up to the ceiling. Beswick's house is on a small hill and on stilts, but he believes it will be swamped. If the prediction is accurate, how high up will this come? How much of it will be covered? BESWICK: I would probably think up to this ridge here but not the main ridge. BLACK: And all of this is just one street. What you are seeing here is going to be experienced by, it's estimated, more than 20,000 homes and properties across the city. Some people were clearly taking things casually. Some were too casual and too slow to realize the seriousness of their situation. More proof of just how quickly this water is coming in. These rescue boats have been called out to help people who very suddenly found themselves surrounded by water. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We couldn't evacuate before and we just couldn't go anywhere so we ended up calling the police. BLACK: How would you describe what you've seen out there? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:It's pretty horrendous actually. Especially looking at the river. It's just frightening looking at the power of nature there.

"(CNN) -- Still reeling from the January earthquake, Haiti is now in the grip of a deadly cholera outbreak. Aid organizations, already struggling to provide the most basic necessities, now face the possibility of a catastrophic epidemic. With this health crisis unfolding, relief leaders shared with CNN their views of where Haiti stands today, and what the country needs to get through to tomorrow. The International Rescue Committee was concerned that a waterborne disease outbreak would occur. Workers stockpiled rehydration salts, cleared water channels, and dug hundreds of emergency latrines. Even with planning for the worst, the IRC's director of humanitarian affairs, Gerald Martone, was not surprised when the outbreak was identified as cholera. ""It is the most feared disease in disaster relief, because it spreads extremely quickly and is lethal. People can die in as short as four hours,"" he said. Much of the group's health staff is returning to Haiti for this outbreak, and the IRC is trying to help stop the spread of the disease by protecting water sources, educating about proper hygiene, and improving disposal of human waste. Martone's biggest concern is a possible outbreak of cholera in a crowded camp, which he likens to holding a match to a tinderbox.  Thousands of Haitians have lived in densely populated tent camps since the earthquake destroyed their homes. ""In addition to preventing the spread of this disease,"" Martone said, ""you have to aggressively treat the people affected, as you only have a few hours before someone can die. This challenge will overwhelm the Haiti health system."" For those wishing to help respond to the crisis, Martone suggests supporting charity medical organizations working in Haiti. The International Medical Corps is also responding to the outbreak, repositioning its doctors and nurses and setting up mobile clinics to create a perimeter around the contaminated zone. The group is calling for more nurses to volunteer and preparing its doctor and nurse networks abroad in case this becomes an epidemic. ""Cholera is not endemic to Haiti. It is a new disease and health professionals in Haiti do not have experience with it,"" said Margaret Aguirre, director of global communications for International Medical Corps. IMC's medical teams are teaching Haiti's health professionals how to identify, treat and prevent the disease, in addition to educating the community about proper hygiene and clean water. For Martone, the outbreak reflects the level of hygiene in Haiti. When he saw the squalid conditions in the camps in April, he realized that, despite the IRC's best efforts, the longer people were forced to live in these unhealthy, filthy conditions, the more likely it was that cholera would break out. Aguirre also sees the continual displacement of the Haitian people as a constant concern. ""Water and shelter has been the continuing problem, it is a health issue,"" she said. The IMC medical staff is trying to transition from the acute emergency phase to a transitional phase, with more emphasis on long-term care. ""There is less wound care and a great need for more mental health care and chronic disease care,"" Aguirre said. However, IMC is still addressing the struggles with nutrition and hygiene that were present immediately after the earthquake. CAN-DO founder Eric Klein finds advancing the relief process challenging, especially when the initial needs are still not met. ""Food, water, housing, jobs and medical -- those are still the same five things that they need,"" Klein said. ""But now we also have to look to the longer goals, more permanent housing and infrastructure. We have to move to another phase, but the first is still not finished, so we have two phases at once now."" His CAN-DO foundation is trying to do both. Workers are training Haitians to construct home, school and medical domes. ""You have so many camps with tents and tarps that have now rotted and are duct-taped together,"" Klein said. ""People will take anything. They need more tents, they will take them, tarps, anything, but that is like putting a Band-Aid on it. There needs to be a better solution."" While his team tackles housing and the CAN-DO Orphanage Revitalization Project, it is still trying to conduct water and food truck drops. On delivery runs, Klein said he finds areas that have not seen distribution in months. Charity organizations are in the midst of transitioning their work force to address the desperate need for jobs. The IMC staff has changed since the earthquake to a more local face. CAN-DO has been training Haitians for housing construction and plans to help bring a factory to the country. ""Jobs is the biggest thing -- every single person you talk to wants to work, they are looking for jobs,"" Klein said. Until now, IRC was focused on education and training programs, instead of direct aid.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Jared Lee Loughner was up all night before gunning down 19 people -- six fatally -- outside an Arizona supermarket, taking several trips to the supermarket's shopping plaza in between checking in at an area hotel and visiting two Walmarts to buy ammunition, according to a timeline released Friday by the Pima County Sheriff's Office. Loughner, 22, got a room at a nearby Motel 6, but did not spend much time there late the night of January 7 and early January 8, the Sheriff's Office timeline indicates. At 11:35 p.m., he dropped off a roll of 35 mm film at a Walgreens next door to the Safeway supermarket where the shooting occurred. After buying something about an hour later at a nearby Circle K convenience store and checking into the Motel 6 one mile to the west on Ina Road, he returned at 2:19 a.m. to pick up the photos and make other purchases. Fifteen minutes later, he stopped at a Chevron gas station where, according to a source with direct knowledge, he bought a doughnut, a soft drink and several energy bars. Surveillance video captured Loughner making the purchases, and he also used the pay phone at the store, according to the source. Then, at 4:12 a.m., Loughner posted a photo of the Walgreens on his MySpace page, with the caption ""Goodbye friends."" The shooting suspect headed out from his hotel room again, buying items at Walmart at the Foothills Mall, about three miles away -- once at 6:12 a.m. and again at 7:04 a.m., sandwiched around another trip to another Circle K store -- according to the timeline. He was unsuccessful at buying ammunition at that Walmart. He then headed to a different Walmart store -- this one nearly 6 miles away in the Tucson suburb of Marana, where, at 7:27 a.m., he bought ammunition and a black backpack-style diaper bag. Three minutes later, an officer with the Arizona Game and Fish Department pulled Loughner over for running a red light. He was given a verbal warning and released. He then headed home. He remained there until being confronted by his father sometime before 9:40 a.m., the timeline says. He ran away with the black bag in hand. A taxi driver picked him up around 9:41 a.m. from one of the Circle K stores he had visited and drove him to the Safeway, in the same plaza as the Walgreens. Both Loughner and the cab driver went inside the store, at 9:54 a.m., apparently so he could get change to pay his fare. Then, at 10:10 a.m., Loughner began shooting. The first 911 call went out a minute later, and by 10:15 a.m., Loughner had been detained -- but not before 19 people had been shot, including his alleged main target, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. She is in critical condition after being shot in the head, but her doctors have been pleased with her progress. Security cameras at the Safeway captured the shootings, according to Capt. Chris Nanos of the Sheriff's Department. The video was sent to the FBI for analysis. Earlier Friday, Nanos said that it could take 10 days to get DNA test results on the black bag, which contained seven boxes of 9 mm ammunition -- the same type Loughner allegedly used in the Tucson massacre. The bag, which is now in the FBI's possession, also contained a receipt for its purchase, according to Nanos. A teenager walking his dog spotted the bag Thursday in a dry riverbed near Loughner's family home, officials said. The teen gave it to a Qwest Communications worker, who called police. ""We certainly believe this is the bag"" Loughner was carrying, Nanos said. ""We got ammunition in there, and it matches the type used in the incident,"" added Richard Kastigar, the department's bureau chief, on CNN's ""John King USA."" Police say Loughner's father, Randy, told them his son was carrying a black bag Saturday morning, just hours before the attack. ""The father asked him questions similar to 'What are you doing? What is that?' and Jared mumbled something back to his dad, and his dad said he didn't understand what was said,"" Kastigar said. ""It was unintelligible, and then Jared left."" The elder Loughner got in his vehicle and tried to follow his son, but could not find him, he said. Motel 6 declined to provide additional details regarding Jared Loughner's stay at the motel, saying it ""is fully cooperating with authorities on their ongoing investigation into the suspect's activities prior to the tragic shooting,"" according to a statement from company spokeswoman Laura Rojo-Eddy. Police say they believe Loughner drove to the riverbed after being pulled over for running the red light and tossed the ammunition-filled bag. After Loughner's arrest Saturday, police discovered in his pockets two 15-round gun magazines, a four-inch Buck-style knife, a plastic bag containing currency, Loughner's Arizona driver's license and a Visa credit card, said Jason Ogan, a spokesman for the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Loughner appeared in a Phoenix federal courtroom Monday to formally hear the charges against him, including two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of attempting to kill a member of Congress. He is now in federal custody. Pima County on Thursday released records saying that Loughner visited the Rio Nuevo One-Stop Career Center in September, but was asked to leave because he was using a video camera and refused to turn it off despite being asked repeatedly. ""He pulled a crumpled copy of the Constitution out of his pocket and waved it at me, saying it was his right,"" a staffer's report on the incident said. Loughner's former community college also released records showing that he frightened fellow students and acted oddly in incidents throughout 2010. Pima Community College ultimately suspended him. His history at the college included an incident in February in which he reacted strangely to a poem read in one of his classes and made comments about abortion, wars and killing people. Two months later, a library staffer reported he was making loud noises at a computer. Also, a teacher reported Loughner became ""very hostile"" after being told his grade in a Pilates class would be a B. The incidents and disruptions continued into autumn, the records said, and college officials became concerned about Loughner's mental health. After an incident in September, a police officer delivered a suspension letter to him and recounted the events that had taken place. When the officer was finished, according to the report, Loughner responded, ""I realize now that this is all a scam."" On Wednesday, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals designated a district judge in California to hear Loughner's federal case. Judge Larry Burns is a 2003 Bush appointee serving in the U.S. District Court for Southern California, based in San Diego. The next scheduled federal hearing in the case is January 24 in Phoenix. All federal judges in Arizona have recused themselves from hearing the case. The chief federal judge in Arizona -- Judge John Roll of Tucson -- was among those killed in the Saturday shooting. Kastigar added that investigators are now certain that Loughner acted alone. A ""person of interest"" they sought immediately after the shooting turned out to be the taxi driver who dropped off the suspect at the shopping center, Kastigar said. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Loughner bought a doughnut, energy bars at a gas station at 2:34 a.m., source says .

"(CNN) -- Ever since an 18-foot chunk of fuselage ripped off an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 in mid-flight, aircraft metal fatigue has been a worry in the aviation industry. A flight attendant died and eight passengers were injured in the incident, which occurred in April of 1988. To address the problem of aging aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration says it has issued numerous regulations and 100 airworthiness directives. But on Friday the agency announced a rule to end the ad hoc approach to a critical issue of aviation safety. The final rule to prevent ""widespread fatigue damage"" requires aircraft makers and airlines to establish the number of takeoff-and-landing cycles or the number of hours a plane can operate without risk of fatigue damage. After the limit is established the rule will prevent airlines from flying the aircraft past that point unless they receive an extension. ""Safety is our highest priority. This rule provides a comprehensive approach to the problem of widespread fatigue in aging aircraft,"" said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. ""Requiring carriers to regularly inspect their aircraft for possible fatigue is essential to ensuring the highest levels of safety."" In June of 2002, three airborne firefighters over California were killed when their plane collapsed due to fatigue cracks in the wing structure. A similar accident killed two firefighters in Colorado the very next month. More recently, two Southwest Airlines Boeing 737s suffered serious fatigue cracks last year. One caused an 18-inch by 12-inch gap in the fuselage that depressurized the airplane and another led to the loss of a wheel-and-brake assembly during landing. There were no serious injuries in either event. Every flight of an airplane puts some stress on its structure. After numerous flights fatigue can trigger cracks, which can expand and connect. ""Widespread fatigue damage is increasingly likely as the airplane ages, and is certain if the airplane is operated long enough,"" said the FAA in its summary of the new rule. ""Existing inspection methods do not reliably detect WFD because cracks are initially so small and may then link up and grow so rapidly that the affected structure fails before an inspection can be performed to detect the cracks."" ""This is definitely a good thing they're doing this,"" said Chuck Horning, chairman of the Aviation Maintenance Science Department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""It's not uncommon as an airplane ages that you'll find those things."" American Airlines had argued ""the rule was not justified in terms of safety,"" according to the FAA's summary of industry discussion of the rule. Aircraft manufacturer Boeing supported the rule. ""We already have some very good plans that are approved by the FAA that address this issue,"" said American Airlines spokesman Tim Smith. American says its fleet, on average, is 14.5 years old and getting younger as it receives delivery of new Boeing 737-800s and retires old MD 80s. The average age of Delta's fleet also is 14.5 years while United's is 14.3 years, according to the website airfleets.net, which tracks airline fleets worldwide. The Federal Aviation Administration is giving airlines and manufacturers up to 60 months to come up with time-in-service limits.","The new rule is designed to end the ad hoc approach to aircraft metal fatigue .

"(CNN) -- A Marine was killed in California on Friday when the amphibious assault vehicle he was riding in submerged during a training exercise, the Camp Pendleton public affairs office said. Six Marines were in the vehicle during the incident, the base's public affairs office said in a statement, and no injuries were reported among the five survivors. The Marine who died was submerged in a boat basin, the office said. Camp Pendleton is along the Pacific Coast between Los Angeles and San Diego. The incident occurred at approximately 11:30 a.m. Friday, the base's statement said, and the Marine was recovered at approximately 2:15 p.m. He was flown to Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla, where he was pronounced dead at 2:47 p.m. The Marine's name is being withheld until 24 hours after notification of next of kin, the Camp Pendleton statement said. The incident is under investigation, the statement said.","Marine's amphibious assault vehicle submerged .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizonans paid tribute Friday morning to the federal judge killed in the deadly shooting rampage last weekend in Tucson. U.S. District Judge John Roll was one of six people gunned down Saturday when he dropped by U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' meet-and-greet in a supermarket parking lot. The funeral service for the revered 63-year-old jurist was held at St. Thomas the Apostle Parish in Tucson. Roll's service came a day after a memorial was held for Christina Green, 9, the youngest victim of the mass shooting. In addition to the six deaths, 13 others, including Giffords, were wounded in the gunfire. Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jon Kyl, both Republicans, said Friday they will introduce legislation to name a new federal courthouse in Yuma after Roll. The courthouse is about to be built, and Roll, as Arizona's chief federal judge, recently approved the plans for the building, according to Brooke Buchanan, an aide to McCain. President Barack Obama described Roll as ""the hardest-working judge"" within the 9th Circuit in a speech Wednesday night at a public memorial at the University of Arizona. McCain called Roll ""a man of great qualities and character."" He had recommended him for the federal bench 20 years ago. Chief Justice John Roberts said Roll was ""a wise jurist who selflessly served Arizona and the nation with great distinction, as attorney and judge, for more than 35 years,"" McCain said. President George H.W. Bush appointed Roll, a Pennsylvania native, to the bench, and he rose to become the state's chief federal judge. Two years ago, he received death threats after ruling that a $32 million civil rights lawsuit filed by illegal immigrants against a rancher could proceed, a ruling that sparked outrage from radio talk-show hosts and others. Roll was placed under protection by federal marshals for several weeks. No one was charged in the case. The jurist also received criticism recently when he asked to delay bringing felons to trial in Tucson, citing a judicial emergency. He said in a November letter to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the ever-increasing number of federal felony arrests had overwhelmed his court. Roll also had been assigned to hear a case on ethnic studies, according to the lead attorney in the case, Richard Martinez. The case, out of Tucson, involves a new law banning certain ethnic studies programs in public schools. Tucson resident Jared Lee Loughner, 22, is facing federal charges in Saturday's attack. Police said Loughner targeted Giffords and had complained about the lawmaker for years after apparently getting a response he didn't like to a question he asked her at a 2007 event. The shooting set off a political firestorm across the country, with some pundits saying that extreme partisan politics played a role in the mass killing. On Thursday, family, friends, classmates and hundreds of mourners filled St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in Tucson for the funeral service for Christina Green, the 9-year-old. All of them passed under a giant American flag that was recovered in the aftermath of the terror attacks in New York on September 11, 2001 -- the day Christina was born. Dozens of other mourners paid their respects by standing outside the church, which was filled to capacity. Obama noted Wednesday that Christina was beginning to discover the political system -- something that she saw ""through the eyes of a child."" ""I want us to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it,"" Obama said. ""All of us -- we should do everything we can do to make sure this country lives up to our children's expectations.""

"French footballing legend Zinedine Zidane has been appointed as ""presidential advisor"" to Real Madrid's first team, working alongside head coach Jose Mourinho. The 38-year-old has been working as a personal advisor to the Spanish club's president Florentino Perez since mid-2009, having retired from playing after the 2006 World Cup final. Mourinho, who has been given a two-match domestic ban for insulting a referee in a Copa del Rey match on Tuesday night, had requested that Zidane be involved in his backroom staff. ""The reasoning for his appointment is to assist in optimizing first-team working conditions,"" Real's website reported on Friday. ""Zidane will be readily available to the president and coach for all matters concerning Real Madrid's first team, with whom he will keep in frequent contact. ""The former player will participate in Champions League events and functions. He will also travel with the team on a regular basis for said competition and will participate in the pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach."" Sent-off Mourinho questions ref's record . Mourinho, who is unbeaten at Real since taking over from Manuel Pellegrini in the off-season, will not be present on the touchline for Sunday's trip to Sporting Gijon and the following weekend's match against Athletic Bilbao. However, he will be free to return for the first ""Clasico"" of this season against arch-rivals Barcelona on Monday November 29. The Portuguese coach was sent to the stands during the 5-1 win over Real Murcia after protesting against a yellow card and then insulting the referee. ""Mourinho was booked 'for formulating observations about the referee' and he has been suspended for the Sporting and Athletic matches 'for addressing the referee with disrespectful vocabulary,' "" Real's website reported. Meanwhile, Italian club AC Milan may face a striker shortage ahead of this weekend's derby with city rivals Inter with both veteran Filippo Inzaghi and Alexandre Pato sidelined. The 37-year-old Inzaghi is likely to miss the rest of this season after suffering a serious knee injury in Wednesday's 3-1 Serie A victory over Palermo. Brazil international Pato, who came off with a thigh problem in the same match, will be ruled out for six weeks -- meaning he will not likely return until early January after the mid-winter break. Inzaghi will now have an operation on his damaged knee, and looks set to be out for the next six months -- prompting concerns that his long career may be at an end. ""Inzaghi underwent a scan which revealed lesions on the ligaments of his left knee. After consultation with Doctor Piero Volpi, it has been decided that the player will undergo surgery,"" said an official release from the club. It is a cruel blow for the one-time Juventus striker, who scored a match-saving brace during Milan's 2-2 draw with Real Madrid in the European Champions League last week. He has already received a message of support from former Italy teammate and Roma talisman Francesco Totti, with the AC website relaying his kind words. ""Francesco Totti sent Filippo Inzaghi a greeting of support after hearing of the striker's knee injury and told him he was a great goalscorer and example to all young players,"" read the statement. Inzaghi has enjoyed a glittering career and has twice won the European Champions League with the Rossoneri, in 2003 and 2007. During the 2007 final he scored both goals in Milan's 2-1 win over Liverpool at Athens' Olympic Stadium.","Zinedine Zidane given post working alongside Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho .

"(CNN) -- World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko has told reporters that he believes rival David Haye is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing in October. International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) champion Klitschko will defend his titles against Dereck Chisora on April 30, prompting World Boxing Association (WBA) champion Haye to announce that the unification fight between the duo will now not happen because he intends to retire when he turns 31 later this year. But Ukrainian Klitschko has poured scorn on Haye's claims, saying: ""This is total nonsense and he is playing the media. ""He will not retire because he is a liar. He has no legacy whatsoever from boxing -- beating Audley Harrison has not given him a legacy. ""David Haye has accomplished nothing in the heavyweight division other than to present himself with his stupid t-shirt and comments,"" Klitschko continued. ""This guy will eventually fight me because everything coming out of his mouth is a lie, but if he does retire, he will be a loser with no legacy in the heavyweight division at all."" Haye made the comments after Klitschko chose to honor an agreement to face the Briton's compatriot Chisora, in a fight that was postponed from last year after Klitschko suffered a back injury in training. However, Klitschko maintains that if he beats Chisora, he can still fight Haye later in the year. The Ukrainian added: ""I don't need a half a year to prepare for Haye. Me facing Chisora first is good promotion for the fight because the guy is also British and also very loud."" Haye could be forced to fight mandatory WBA challenger and former world champion Ruslan Chagaev, with a preliminary date set for July 2, although Klitshcko maintains that could be side-stepped. ""I don't take David Haye as a super-special fight. I'm always in shape anyway. He could give Chagaev step-aside money and then I'm going to be there with nobody to fight,"" continued Klitschko. ""Because of our history before, I would fight him on July 2 and we would work on the contract, but I would still fight Chisora first.""","Wladimir Klitschko believes David Haye is only bluffing with his threats to quit boxing .

"(CNN) -- For some fans, tailgating is something to do before a football game. For others, a football game is something to do after tailgating. It's a religion at various schools, complete with copious amounts of food, games and flat-screen TVs. Even though the weather is cooling off, tailgating season is still heating up. We're months away from the beginning of the Bowl Championship Series, which begins on January 1 with the Rose Bowl and ends on January 10 with the BCS National Championship. Until then, the best college programs in the country are still fighting for a spot in one of the highly competitive bowl games. And the fans are there every game, diligently camped out for hours -- sometimes days -- to show their support for the home team. CNN.com, with the help of experts at Sports Illustrated, chose five football programs with top tailgating institutions worth a trip. 1. Louisiana State University Tigers -- Baton Rouge, Louisiana . Tailgating is of prime importance at LSU, and the ritual continues throughout generations of Tiger fans. ""It's a tradition we want to pass down to our children,"" says Rusty Welch, the creator of Tigertailgating.com. ""We want them to see the camaraderie and spirit that's centered around the game."" Welch has been tailgating in the same spot before every home game for 19 years. He and his companions prepare everything from fried shrimp to whole pigs to white chili, changing the menu with every game. ""People in Louisiana take very seriously our food and our football,"" says Randy Rosetta, a football reporter for The Advocate, Baton Rouge's newspaper. ""Tailgating is a perfect opportunity to wed those two seven or eight times a year."" The tailgate begins on Thursday night for some diehard fans. Motor homes descend upon Baton Rouge and surround the stadium, setting up camp for the weekend. Season parking sells out quickly, but some spots are available on a game-by-game basis. Walking through the tailgate area offers some of the benefits of actually tailgating. You'll smell smoke -- either hickory or mesquite -- and bourbon, and if you're lucky, you'll get invited to partake in a tailgate already in progress. ""We try to invite the visiting teams to our tailgate as they stroll by, because eventually we'll be going to their campuses,"" Welch says. ""You hope you meet somebody who will reciprocate."" A few hours before the game begins, Victory Hill houses a procession for the team and coaches. Fans press in on both sides, cheering the team as it heads to the stadium. ""It's a Louisiana thing,"" Rosetta says. ""People love to have their parties. It can be a football game. It can be if the sun comes up two days in a row. Football is the heart and soul for a lot of people, and they love to combine an eating party and football."" Check out other great destinations and tips at Five To Go . 2. Auburn Tigers -- Auburn, Alabama . There are two types of tailgates taking place at Auburn, though both have the same goal in mind. ""There's the students who do it in their front yards, then there's the people who get in their RVs and drive from all over the South and make a whole weekend out of it,"" says David Morrison, a sports reporter for the Opelika-Auburn News. ""It's not just a game here. It's a cultural happening."" As soon as classes let out on Friday, people begin marking their tailgating areas to claim a spot for the game. Mike Clardy, director of university communications for Auburn, estimates that 20,000 or so people show up on game weekends with no intention of actually going to the game. Morrison says the atmosphere gives off an ""oddly familial vibe for a college tailgating scene."" Even if the University of Alabama, Auburn's biggest rival, is the visiting team, the Tiger tailgaters invite the opposing fans to come to their cookouts, Clardy says. Fans can expect to find lots of barbecue and souped up RVs, complete with fully functioning entertainment systems for watching the pre-game coverage and other college football games. Two hours before the start of a game, the team arrives on buses and walks through the thousands of people lining the street toward the stadium -- a practice that, due to its popularity, takes place at away games as well. ""I don't think there's a better place to tailgate and a better atmosphere for college football than right here at Auburn,"" Clardy says. ""I think away teams would agree."" 3. Notre Dame Fighting Irish -- South Bend, Indiana . Though independent of a conference, Notre Dame is steeped in football tradition, and, along with it, tailgating tradition. It's smaller than many Southeastern Conference and Big 10 schools, but Notre Dame sees a surge of people on campus for game day. ""We have a fairly small student body -- maybe 10,000 people,"" says Samuel Warner, a football beat writer and assistant managing editor for The Observer, Notre Dame's student newspaper. ""But on game days there are as many as 100,000 people on campus."" Game day really kicks off at midnight on Friday with the Midnight Drummer's Circle, when the drum line plays through the cheers at the Golden Dome on campus. Even before that, however, people are lined up taking pictures of Touchdown Jesus, a nickname given to the Word of Life Mural painted on the side of the Hesburgh Library. ""Jesus has both of his arms raised,"" Warner says. ""It looks like he's signaling a touchdown."" Starting at 8 a.m. on Saturday, the band plays continually around campus. The players attend Mass and are cheered on by fans on their walk from the basilica to the stadium. Many of the pre-game rituals take place around campus, with tailgating interspersed throughout the town. ""Notre Dame is such a legacy school,"" Warner says. ""I have friends that are third or fourth generation graduates. ... Tradition is so ingrained in Notre Dame football that it kind of carries over to the tailgating."" 4. University of Washington Huskies -- Seattle, Washington . The scenery of Lake Washington adds a unique element to the Huskies' tailgating experience: fans can spend their time on the water before a game. ""You can actually tie up to a dock that's a few blocks from the stadium,"" says Kyle Griffith, a Washington alumnus. ""People take big charter boats that can hold several hundred people or they have their own boats."" Tailgaters cook out and make drinks on their boats, interacting with other boaters close by. Some don't fare as well on the water as others. ""Every year, during at least one game, somebody will fall into the water,"" Griffith says. ""Nobody gets hurt ... but that's a sight to see."" When it's close to game time, shuttle boats pick up fans that are tied up to buoys and transport them to the docks, which are within short walking distance to the stadium. Of course, there are dry land tailgaters as well -- in greater numbers than the ones using boats. ""It's more of an adult crowd than you would find at a lot of schools,"" says Bob Condotta, a football reporter for The Seattle Times. ""About 7,000 students get tickets to every game out of about 70,000 fans."" Hundreds of RVs are set up in parking lots, where, weather permitting, fans grill out and play typical tailgating games. ""The University of Washington, compared to other Pac 10 schools, is definitely regarded as having one of the most intense and passionate fan bases,"" Condotta says. 5. Pennsylvania State Nittany Lions -- State College, Pennsylvania . State College, Pennsylvania, is a small town smack dab in the middle of the state. Surrounded by fields and fields of farmland, Penn State's grounds make room for plenty of tailgating. ""If you were at Beaver Stadium and looked out toward the farms, you'd just see cars and cars and cars of tailgaters,"" says Brendan Monahan, a football beat reporter for The Daily Collegian, Penn State's student newspaper. Though State College has a population of just under 40,000, the stadium seats more than 100,000, packing the fields with fans. ""There's a certain escape that comes with the workweek ending, coming up here on a fall weekend and parking in the middle of a grass field to set up your tailgate,"" says Greg Myford, associate athletic director for marketing and communications at Penn State. Alumni, students and families make home contests into a weekend event, full of games, cheers and food. ""I think if it goes on the grill, it's fair game,"" Myford says. ""We're seeing food that at least psychologically is making people stay warmer if they eat it."" The team arrives at Beaver Stadium about an hour and a half before every game, and the quarterback is always the first off the bus. The sound of cowbell clinks alternates with resounding cheers of ""P-S-U!"" Myford says that walking through the fields of tailgaters shows him how committed the fans are to the program and the traditions. ""The amount of prep put into a tailgate is a real statement as to how they feel about the experience,"" Myford says. ""We don't want to lose sight of that or diminish the value of it. How they tailgate outside is a reflection of how they feel about Penn State inside.""","Tailgating is a tradition at many colleges, passed down from generation to generation .

"(CNN) -- A major winter storm system was rolling across the southeastern United States early Monday, sending out shocks of snow, freezing rain and sleet, and forcing some airlines to cancel flights. AirTran Airways canceled 14 flights Sunday, most of them heading into Atlanta, in order to have fewer aircraft on the ground there at the time the storm hits, spokesman Christopher White said. Another 270 flights were canceled for Monday, which represents a majority of the Atlanta-bound flights for the airline. There will be a handful of arrivals and departures only, White said. The latest computer models show wintry weather extending from northeast Texas through the Carolinas, bringing freezing temperatures, snow and ice to areas that normally don't see heavy winter precipitation, according to CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. The northern regions of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and the Carolinas should expect heavy snow, while ice storms are expected to affect the southern regions of those states, he said. Forecasters expect freezing rain to move north in those states, possibly by Monday morning. Meanwhile, American Airlines reported that 100 flights in and out of Dallas-Fort Worth were canceled. That's about 20% of American's flights. Its American Eagle carrier has canceled 180 flights. ""That sounds ominous, but in the big picture it could be far worse,"" spokesman Tim Smith said. He added later that the snow was not as bad as was forecast and that Dallas ""really dodged a bullet."" Anthony Black, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said the airline expects to operate normally in Atlanta until Sunday night, after which some 330 mainline and Delta Connection flights will be canceled. Nationwide, ""we have planned approximately 1,400 Delta and Delta Connection flight cancellations systemwide Monday as the storm is at its peak, approximately 25% of all planned flights for the day,"" Black said. Southwest Airlines reported it is running at normal capacity with no major cancellations. Track weather and travel delays . Atlantic Southeast Airlines spokesman Jarek Beem said the storm had forced a number of cancellations, Sunday through Tuesday. He declined to provide a specific number. Below freezing temperatures through Tuesday could leave trees and power lines across the south with a heavy coating of ice, said Hennen, which could cause numerous long-duration power outages. Winter storm warnings covered much of the Southeast as the storm system developed Sunday morning in Texas and tracked along the Gulf Coast. The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings for parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama. The agency warns that significant snow amounts could make travel difficult and dangerous. Three to eight inches of snow could fall by Monday evening and roads are expected to be hazardous through Monday night, especially secondary roads. Various winter storm watches have also been put in place by the weather agency, stretching from northeast Texas to the far western corner of Virginia. In preparation for wintry conditions, governors in Louisiana and Alabama declared states of emergencies, according to the governor's office in Alabama and CNN affiliate KSLA in Baton Rouge. ""We face a serious storm that will have an impact all across Alabama,"" Gov. Bob Riley said in a statement. He advised motorists to stay the roads. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue similarly issued a state of emergency. Snow began falling in Atlanta during the evening hours Sunday, and is forecast to accumulate through Monday afternoon. Temperatures at or below freezing are expected to remain in place through Tuesday, keeping roads dangerous and travel difficult, Hennen said. Parts of Louisiana could get up to an inch of ice, while other states in the region could get between a quarter and a half-inch of ice coating power lines, trees, bridges and roadways, said CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf. In Alabama, Auburn University canceled classes and viewing events for the BCS championship game on Monday night. Meanwhile, snow moved into the Northeast but the region was spared a repeat of the Christmas blizzard that virtually shut down large cities such as New York and Philadelphia. Emergency management officials were able to quickly recover from the comparably light dusting of snow that began blanketing the region Friday.

"(CNN) -- Norway's navy announced on Monday that it will help search for the missing plane of 20th century explorer Roald Amundsen, more than 80 years after his death. Roald Amundsen led the first successful expedition to the South Pole from 1910 to 1912. The search -- scheduled for later this year -- will focus on a 40 square-mile (104 square-kilometer) area of the Arctic Ocean where researchers believe Amundsen's plane crashed in 1928. ""If there is something down there, we will find it,"" said senior Commander Frode Loeseth told CNN. Loeseth said they will be concentrating on finding the plane's wreckage, and do not expect to find any remains. Amundsen, who is a national hero in Norway, led the first successful expedition to the South Pole from 1910 to 1912. He is also credited with being the first person to reach both the North and South Poles. He went missing in June 1928 at the age of 55 while flying to the North Pole for a rescue operation. The location of his disappearance ""is one of the remaining unsolved mysteries in our time,"" a press release from the Norwegian Navy said. Loeseth said the navy will participate in the search along with the Norwegian Aviation Museum; Kongsberg Maritime, a Norwegian maritime technology company; and Context TV, a German TV production company that will document the operation. The search is scheduled to begin the last week of August. There have been several attempts to find the location of Amundsen's crash, most recently in 2004. But this time Norway's navy will be able to scour the depths of the Arctic Ocean with a submarine, named after a character in Norse mythology. ""We have one special tool -- Hugin -- that is a state-of-the-art submarine, unmanned, and can search for 18 hours,"" the commander said. Hugin is the mythological raven that traveled around Earth and informed the Norse god, Odin, of what happened that day. Loeseth said the navy has had the unmanned submarine for some time, but the one that will be used in the search is the Hugin 1000, a ""newly modified and upgraded"" model. Loeseth would not say how much the operation was expected to cost, or which organization was funding the bulk of the search. He stressed that the partners have an agreement and a budget, and Norwegian taxpayers will not be paying for any part of the search. He said Amundsen's relatives support the project. He noted that it has been five years since the last search for Amundsen's wreckage because ""it takes time to raise funding for such projects.""","Unmanned submarine to be used in search for Roald Amundsen's plane .

"(CNN) -- At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we consider ourselves to be impatient optimists -- we are impatient with the way the world is, but optimistic that changing it is possible. One reason for this optimism is the progress that we have seen in the 10 years since the United Nations created the Millennium Development Goals, eight international goals to improve social and economic conditions in the world's poorest countries. Recently, we partnered with TED to create a global event to discuss this progress. TEDxChange was hosted in New York and broadcast live to over 80 simultaneous TEDx events in 40 countries around the world, including sites in Kibera, Kenya; Abuja, Nigeria; Pune, India; Cochabamba, Bolivia; and Lahore, Pakistan. The millennium goals themselves embody impatient optimism. They recognize how much there is to be done, while at the same time signaling the scale and scope of the world's ambition. The world is not called on to conjure progress from a void. Instead, it is called on to learn from very real progress on nearly all the goals, to expand it, and to speed it up. One refrain I hear is that we are off track on many of the goals. That statement is technically accurate. Not every country will meet every goal, and there is a risk that some of the global goals won't be met. But that binary outlook -- with total success on one side, total failure on the other, and people on all sides blaming each other -- obscures extraordinary progress driven by extraordinary people across the globe. Take the goal for child mortality. The goal is a two-thirds reduction, and we may not reach it by 2015. But have we failed when 4 million children who would have died in 1990 will survive in 2010? Have we failed when we have reduced polio, a crippling childhood disease, by 99 percent in the past 20 years? Another complaint I hear a lot is that progress isn't spread evenly. Some people dismiss the fact that 1.3 billion people have lifted themselves out of poverty by pointing out that most of them live in China and India, not in African countries. I believe that when poor people lift themselves out of poverty, we ought to celebrate, no matter where they happen to live. Bill and I started our foundation because we believe that all lives have equal value, and I am not comfortable comparing one person's suffering to that of another. While it's true that some countries are reducing poverty more quickly than others -- and some, sadly, have moved backwards -- eight African countries have already achieved the goal on poverty reduction, and several more are on schedule to do so by 2015. Across nearly every goal, there are inspiring examples of even the poorest countries making dramatic improvements in short periods of time. However, we can also learn from the successes in other sectors. My TEDxChange talk focuses on the question of how Coca-Cola has become so ubiquitous around the world and what governments and the development community can learn from the company's success. By analyzing what Coca-Cola has done to become so prevalent, we can apply those lessons to the millennium goals and save even more lives. The task ahead is to learn what's working so that we can spread best practices. In difficult economic times, it is imperative that we increase support for effective interventions that provide maximum value for money -- and not shift even bigger burdens to the poorest by cutting back on development spending. So I am impatient. I am impatient because the world is not getting better fast enough, or for enough people. But I am also optimistic. I am optimistic because there are proven and affordable ways to decrease hunger and poverty, to help mothers and their babies thrive, to make rapid progress on all the Millennium Development Goals. And I am optimistic that our impatience will lead us all to be more motivated, not less. I am optimistic that our sense of urgency will inspire us to work together, not to isolate ourselves. For if we are motivated, if we are inspired, if we work together -- then we can meet again in five years to celebrate achievements that few of us might have dared to imagine. I'm grateful to CNN for including my TEDxChange presentation as part of their TEDTalks Tuesday series. There were several other speakers who joined our event that day, and I urge you to come to our TEDxChange website and watch their speeches as well. • Hans Rosling, professor of international health at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, who uses statistics to show concrete examples of progress in child health; . • Graca Machel, a renowned international advocate for women's and children's rights, on the key role of women and girls in achieving social change; . • Mechai Viravaidya, aka Mr. Condom, the founder and chairman of the Population and Community Development Association, on creative approaches to family planning. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melinda French Gates.","Melinda Gates: The UN adopted Millennium Development Goals 10 years ago .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon paid a visit to Baghdad on Friday to congratulate its citizens for last weekend's ""remarkable"" Iraq-led provincial elections, a process he said ""augurs well for the transition process and the solidifying of Iraq's national reconciliation."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, left, meets Friday in Baghdad with Iraq President Jalal Talabani. On a tour that also has taken him to Pakistan and Afghanistan, Ban met with Iraqi leaders and appeared at a news conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose allies won big in nine of the 14 provinces where the local elections were held. ""I have been following the electoral process closely from the early days of the parliamentary debate over the elections law last summer to the final stages of adjudication of the complaints and yesterday evening's release of the provisional results,"" Ban said at the news conference, according to prepared remarks issued by the United Nations. ""It will be some days before final results are known, but current indications are that the elections have been successfully carried out."" Ban last visited Iraq in 2007. In March of that year, he got a taste of the violence that often rocks the Iraqi capital. An explosion rattled Baghdad's International Zone, where he was holding a televised news conference with al-Maliki. Apparently used to such blasts, al-Maliki remained stoic, while Ban briefly ducked before regaining his composure and continuing. Now, he said, he's ""very much impressed to have witnessed myself the great success and progress the Iraqi government and people have made under the leadership of Prime Minister Maliki, and I congratulate you,"" he said, emphasizing the improvements in security. The secretary-general praised the turnout of millions of voters in ""an environment free of violence,"" a development he called a ""remarkable achievement"" in a strife-torn nation. ""Iraq has come a long way in taking their own affairs in hand, this being the first Iraqi-led and Iraqi-owned electoral process. It is a tribute to the growing effectiveness of the Iraqi security forces, and testifies to the increasing stability in the country,"" he said. Ban praised Iraqi election officials, the local U.N. office and its special representative, Staffan de Mistura, and election workers. Voters in 14 of 18 provinces turned out last weekend to elect provincial councils. The nation's three Kurdish provinces will hold elections in May, and voting in Tameem province has been suspended because of political disputes in Kirkuk. ""This marks an important event, these being the first polls to affect the day-to-day lives of Iraqi voters,"" Ban said. ""In fact, these elections are about real power, in the sense that local leaders are nominated to be accountable for the delivery of basic services."" The United Nations helped Iraq with logistics in its election process and plans to help in this year's parliamentary elections and to deal with sticky disputes, such as the status of Kirkuk and disputes over some internal boundaries. Al-Maliki thanked the United Nations for the supportive role it played. He noted that the provincial elections ""changed the political map"" of Iraq, but he said the elections were successful for all Iraqis. He said he was proud people voted for blocs based on political goals and not along sectarian and ethnic lines. Ban also met with the three members of the presidency council -- Kurdish President Jalal Talabani, Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashimi. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.","U.N. secretary-general visits Iraq, lauds ""remarkable"" elections there .

"London (CNN) -- As Iraq's insurgency was peaking, and American soldiers were dying at a dizzying rate from roadside bombs, a theater director in London was having an epiphany. Plenty of plays about the Iraqi carnage were piling up on his desk, but there were none about the the calamities befalling Afghanistan. It was then that Nicholas Kent, director of the tiny Tricycle Theatre -- far from the glitz and glamour of London's fabled West End playhouses -- decided to act. ""I became aware in 2007-2008 how it was all going wrong in Afghanistan,"" he said. ""It wasn't being reported in the media and certainly there was no artistic response to it."" He commissioned a dozen writers to produce a dozen short plays on Afghan history. The result, ""The Great Game,"" changed the Afghan debate in the United Kingdom at a stroke. When the Chief of Britain's Defence Staff, Sir David Richards, saw the performance, he said, ""I wish I'd seen it before I first deployed to Afghanistan in 2005. It would have made me a much better commander."" And the performance is now on its way to the Pentagon. Kent says Gen. Richards has been a significant driving force in bringing the performance to his American counterparts. ""The Great Game"" is usually performed over three days, with four half-hour plays performed back-to-back each day. Part one ""traces the history of foreign and Western involvement in Afghanistan since the defeat of the British in 1842,"" Kent said. The second installment of the trilogy ""is more or less a reflection of now,"" he said: ""The Soviet surge that fails over a decade, through the coming of the Taliban and the arrival of U.S. troops."" The final four plays highlight the problems facing aid workers, Afghans and troops today. The British and American military are getting special performances, playing the whole cycle out in one day rather than three. Kent wanted to stimulate debate and discussion on a conflict he felt was wrong. ""You are putting yourself in some one else's boots,"" he said of what happens to the audience. ""You are empathizing, you are sympathizing with people, thinking what you would do in their situation."" He is thrilled that both the British and now the American military have taken such a significant interest in the production, saying there can be no better way to grapple with the complexities of Afghanistan. ""If you read a book you can put it down. If you read a newspaper you can turn the page. If you see some television you can switch channels,"" he said. ""With a play, you are stuck there for some time, and in this case for a whole day. You have to really think about the challenges."" But it's not just his audiences who have been challenged. ""The Great Game"" has changed Kent's own views. He now thinks pulling troops out precipitously would be a disaster and is increasingly concerned about instability over the border in nuclear-armed Pakistan -- so much so that he's considering a play on non-proliferation. Kent is a product of his own ethos, learning from his experiences. ""If people start to think outside the box and look at these issues through a different form, rather than in a lecture hall but maybe through an art form, they may learn quite a lot,"" he said.","A London theater company commissions a cycle of plays about Afghanistan .
Britain's top general says seeing it sooner would have made him a better commander there .

"Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- About 1.8 million Muslims were in the holy city of Mecca on Monday for the first day of Hajj, the annual pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim is expected to perform at least once in his or her lifetime.

"(CNN) -- Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, a company spokeswoman said. The certification tests come two months after a fire on board one of the planes caused a power failure during a test flight. Boeing halted tests after the November 9 incident. Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter. Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world. The Dreamliner is Boeing's next-generation passenger jet. It is touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials. Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November. The crew used backup systems to land the aircraft. Engineers determined the problem started as a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel, most likely caused by foreign debris, Boeing said.","A fire on board one of the planes causes a power failure during a test flight .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police arrested 10 people early Tuesday for suspected links to the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA, just a week after the group's latest cease-fire announcement, an interior ministry statement said. The Spanish government - wary of ETA's unilateral cease-fire because the armed militants have broken previous cease-fires - has said it would not cease police operations against the group blamed for 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence. Nine of the pre-dawn arrests on Tuesday came in Navarra, the northern region with Basque roots whose capital is Pamplona, the statement said. The other arrest was in the nearby Basque province of Alava. Eight men and two women were arrested. Six of the suspects are thought to be involved with Ekin, a shadowy group which Spain's National Court in 2007 ruled was ""part of the heart"" of ETA and not a mere satellite. Spanish media reports said police believe the suspects were trying to rebuild Ekin, whose tasks include passing directives from ETA's leadership to a string of shadowy support groups. The other four suspects, including the two women, are suspected of involvement in pro-ETA propaganda in a group called Askatasuna, also in Navarra province, the statement said. ETA on January 10 beefed up its cease-fire in effect since last September, saying it would now be ""permanent, general and verifiable."" But that fell short of demands by the Socialist government and most opposition parties that ETA unconditionally declare a permanent end to the violence and commitment to lay down its arms. On January 11, police arrested a suspected top computer programmer for ETA in France. He is accused of playing a key role in the group's logistics by designing the computer codes that operatives used to secretly communicate, Spain's Interior Ministry said on Jan. 11. ETA is listed as a terrorist group by United States and the European Union. ETA declared a ""permanent"" cease-fire in March 2006, but while the government was exploring a peace process, an ETA car bomb at Madrid's airport in December 2006 killed two men and caused extensive damage to the airport's newest terminal. Since then, the government and opposition parties have been generally united in their stance that further ETA cease-fires would be insufficient and that the only statement needed was ETA's commitment to give up its fight. There are about 800 ETA convicts or suspects in prisons in Spain and in France, ETA's traditional rearguard base, the Spanish government has said.","The government has said it will not cease operations against ETA despite cease-fire .

"Washington (CNN) -- In a symbolic gesture toward more civil political discourse, Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer and Republican Sen. Tom Coburn said Sunday they will sit together at the upcoming State of the Union address. Appearing on the NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Schumer and Coburn called for political debate based on issues and ideology, rather than motives and personal attacks, in the aftermath of the Tucson, Arizona, shootings last week that killed six people and critically injured Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Schumer acknowledged that sitting with Coburn for the president's annual speech to Congress would be symbolic, ""but maybe it just sets a tone and everything gets a little bit more civil."" ""We believe in discourse in America, we believe in strenuous discourse,"" said Schumer, who is from New York. ""We don't sweep differences under the rug. Tom and I have real differences, but we can do it civilly."" Asked about the inflammatory political climate, Coburn rejected portrayals by some conservatives that President Barack Obama's agenda is anti-American or intended to harm the country. ""What we can't question is the president's love for our country,"" said Coburn of Oklahoma, later adding: ""When we get in trouble is when we question motive rather than ideology."" Traditionally, Democrats and Republicans sit on different sides of the House of Representatives for the State of the Union address that also includes Cabinet members, military leaders, the Supreme Court and other government officials. Last week, Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colorado, sent a letter to congressional leaders suggesting that Democrats and Republicans sit together for the January 25 speech. ""As the nation watches, Democrats and Republicans should reflect the interspersed character of America itself,"" Udall wrote in the letter. ""Perhaps, by sitting with each other for one night, we will begin to rekindle that common spark that brought us here from 50 different states and widely diverging backgrounds to serve the public good."" Other politicians also supported Udall's call. ""Well, I think it's a symbol, and a symbol is a very good place to start,"" Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York told the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""And so if we can actually come into that chamber and instead of me going to the left, I go to the right, and the Republicans do the opposite, what you're going to create is an image of the Congress deciding that we are going to work as a body, not as two separate sides. That's a very good place to start."" Republican Rep. Jeff Flake of Arizona said he expected more civil debate in the wake of the Tucson shootings, even if the issues and ""the substance of the debate"" won't change. ""I think that we Republicans, and I think Democrats alike, will realize that if we tone down the rhetoric sometimes, our debate is more effective from our own side,"" Flake said on the CBS program. However, old habits die hard, Flake acknowledged. ""It's easy to slip back into old ways,"" Flake said. ""I think we can have the debates we need to with a more civil tone. And, frankly, I think that we'll find that that's more effective from both sides. But keeping that into the future is going to be a tough thing."" On the same program, outgoing Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania said a change in the hyper-partisan political discourse is necessary. Asked about the biggest changes during his two terms in office that end this week, Rendell said: ""In my eight years, I've seen the level of partisanship and ideological posturing just increase and increase and increase and I think it's tearing the fabric of our government apart."" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, said the tone may change, but not the intensity. ""I don't plan to debate my values and the principles of my constituents any less vigorously,"" she said on the CBS program. ""But I think it starts with us, and we have to lead by example. And so I think all of us need to be more careful about the words that we choose to use.""","NEW: Tone of debate should change, not intensity, politicians say .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 struck Wednesday morning in a remote area of southwestern Pakistan, but initial reports revealed no major damage. The earthquake occurred at 1:23 a.m. (3:23 p.m. Tuesday ET) at a depth of 84 kilometers (52 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey said. It  was centered 45 kilometers (30 miles) west of Dalbandin, and 1,035 kilometers (640 miles) west-southwest of Islamabad, the USGS said on its website. Arif Mahmood, director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, put the epicenter at 320 kilometers (about 200 miles) southwest of Quetta near Kharan, Balochistan, and said it had been felt in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan provinces in Pakistan, as well as parts of Iran and India. Mahmood predicted major aftershocks. ""Earthquakes with such magnitudes in the past have brought on aftershocks,"" he told CNN from Islamabad. Residents near the epicenter in the districts of Kalat, Dalbadin and Kharan told CNN some mud-walled homes were damaged but no one was hurt. An official at Quetta's Civil Hospital said a female cardiac patient suffered a fatal heart attack during the earthquake. He said two residents raced to the hospital but they proved not to have been injured, just scared. Malik Muhammad Iqbal, the police chief of Balochistan province, said he was aware of no injuries. ""Things in the headquarters started shaking and books fell off the desks,"" Balochistan Police Inspector Sultan Mehmood told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We left the headquarters running into the streets -- scared for our lives."" In Karachi, Faraz Leghari, director general police, said he had heard no immediate reports of casualties or building damage. USGS initially reported the quake at 7.4. Quakes of 7.0 to 7.9 are classified as major; anything over 8.0 is classified as great. In Dubai, about 500 miles southwest of the epicenter, a reporter said he felt a moderate shaking that lasted for about 30 seconds. Usman Zahid, a night manager at Serina Hotel in Quetta, Pakistan, felt the quake. He said it was ""frightening"" and estimated that it lasted about 20 seconds. It left ""broken glass in the kitchen"" and made a chandelier swing, but caused no major damage, he said. People with Twitter accounts in New Delhi, Jaipur and Dehradun -- all in India -- felt the quake. People with Twitter accounts in Bahrain said they felt the quake. In Dubai, ""I was just getting ready to go to bed,"" said Leone Lakhani in Dubai. She said she texted her friends in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain. ""It's not uncommon for this region to have earthquakes,"" said Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is where two tectonic plates come together, he said.

"Gould, Arkansas (CNN) -- People on death row have a lot of time to think. Damien Echols is no different. Since his conviction for the 1993 murders of three 8-year-old boys, Echols has been fighting to keep his thoughts moving forward: to study, to grow intellectually and to distance himself from the bitterness that threatens to consume him. Echols was one of three teenagers convicted for that crime.  They became known as the ""West Memphis Three,"" probably the most feared and hated kids to ever walk into an Arkansas courtroom. The crime they were accused of was particularly heinous: the boys' bruised and mutilated bodies were found in May 1993 in West Memphis, Arkansas, their arms and legs bound with their own shoelaces. Echols was the only one sentenced to die, believed to be the ring leader in murders driven by a worship of Satan. That was almost 18 years ago. Today Echols spends 23 hours a day alone in a cell with nothing to do but ponder all he's lost and wonder if the Arkansas Supreme Court will be the key that finally sets him free. Later this year, an Arkansas Supreme Court judge will determine if Echols and the rest of the West Memphis Three should have their convictions thrown out. Prosecutors would then have the chance to retry them all and since they were sent to prison, the cases against them seem to have fallen apart. Echols' attorneys plan to present DNA evidence not available at the time of the trial, as well as testimony that they say supports arguments that Echols and the two others are innocent. 'West Memphis Three' cases receive new hearing . On a dreary, overcast day in late November, I was allowed to talk to Echols for two hours about his conviction, his hopes and his most hated question -- the one he fears will follow him for the rest of his life, whether he is freed or not. I wasn't sure what to expect. An advocate who arranged my interview with Echols cautioned that ""Damien does not suffer fools gladly."" I remember thinking how pale and gaunt Echols, now 36 years old, appeared as he was escorted down a hallway to a seat behind a thick glass wall. The handcuffs left bright red marks on his pale skin after they were removed. ""That looks like it hurt,"" I said. Looking down and rubbing his wrist, Echols replied softly, ""It does."" He seemed a little surprised I would notice something like that. Echols says he has given hundreds of interviews, so many that there seems to be no question he would not be prepared to answer. The one question that has always bothered him the most also is the most obvious: Did you kill those children? Echols believes the answer should be equally obvious. Echols: After all the new evidence that we have that's come up now, it feels to me like I shouldn't have to answer that anymore, that people should be able to look at the evidence now and know that I didn't do it, without having to ask me that. I don't know. I don't know. Mattingly: People are going to be watching you right now. They're going to be asking that question in their minds. They're going to be judging you. Echols: I know. Mattingly: I'll just ask you the question. Did you kill those boys? Echols: No, I didn't. No, I didn't. Mattingly: When you answer that, what's different now, compared to when you were on trial? Do you think people are listening now, who might not have been listening before? Echols: I think so. I think you have some people now who are looking at the evidence, who do. It's been long enough for people to get past their emotions. The evidence Echols talks about is DNA and the fact that not a single tiny cell was recovered from the crime scene that belonged to the three convicted teens. Police did find a hair on one of the bodies that was a possible match to the stepfather of one of the victims. The emotion Echols refers to is the fear and raw anger of a public that he believes was out for his blood. The investigation, arrests and trials fueled the outrage, producing nightly reports of grisly details and shocking headlines. Echols seemed immune to it during his trial, appearing only to be what he describes as a ""smart-ass"" and ""white trash"" 18-year-old. But some wounds cut to the bone and today his scars seem just as deep. Echols was so interview-savvy that I was surprised when he suddenly got emotional. Mattingly: Are my questions upsetting you right now? Echols: It's hard. (pause) And I don't know why. Because you would think I'd be used to this by now. (long pause) I don't know. It-- it's hard. It-- it-- it-- like I said, it doesn't get any easier. And you would think I would be used to this by now. But-- you don't get used to this. (sighs) And it does continue to get worse as time goes by. Knowing that -- you know, even if I were to go to trial today, and we were to present all this new evidence, and they were to find us not guilty, I would still, for the rest of my life, have people looking at me and asking me these questions about me, thinking these things about me. There's no way to-- for them to undo what's been done. If the Arkansas Supreme Court dismisses his conviction and orders a new trial for the three men, it would be extremely rare. But so far, Echols has beaten the odds. Consider that under normal circumstances, my interview would have never taken place. Echols was originally scheduled to be executed in 1994. Instead he sits alone in his cell while possibly thousands follow his case. He has won the support of celebrities like Johnny Depp and Eddie Vedder. Echols is also married to a woman who left her job and life behind to fight for him in Arkansas. Not bad for a ""smart-ass"" ""white trash"" convicted killer. Mattingly: If the court does eventually decide that you are innocent, you know what that means? Echols: What? Mattingly: That the killer is still out there. Echols: Oh. Exactly. Yeah.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has revealed that the Spanish club's bosses have relented and will seek to sign him a new striker after all. Mourinho had initially been told that he could not replace Gonzalo Higuain, who could miss the rest of this season after having back surgery. France international Karim Benzema has been filling in for the Argentine, but Mourinho wants more options as Real seek to stop Barcelona retaining the Spanish title and also to win the European Champions League for the first time since 2002. ""I am sticking to my beliefs. I think it would be good to have another forward for what is left of the season,"" Mourinho told Madrid's website ahead of Sunday's trip to bottom club Almeria. ""The club is looking into the possibility of signing a forward, which pleases me to no end."" Real have been linked with a move to bring veteran Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy back to the Santiago Bernabeu, and the player's German club Hamburg confirmed the La Liga side's interest on its website on Saturday night. Hamburg also referred to comments the 34-year-old made after scoring the only goal against Schalke, who this season signed another former Real striker in Raul. ""The reports are correct. It has been a strange week, it has been hard to concentrate and I am just glad it worked out,"" Van Nistelrooy, who left Madrid a year ago, said in quotes carried by the AFP news agency. ""We just need to see what happens in the next few days, but it is not easy for me. It is not just any club which have expressed interest, it is Real. They are the only club which can make me change my mind."" Real trail Barcelona by two points ahead of the halfway point of the Spanish season, with the Catalan club hosting Malaga on Sunday. Third-placed Villarreal won 4-2 at home to Osasuna on Saturday to be 10 points adrift of Barcelona. The highlight of the match was a superb goal from halfway by Ruben Cani that put Villarreal 2-1 ahead. Espanyol joined fourth-placed Valencia on 34 points with a 2-1 win at Sevilla as striker Jose Callejon twice beat the offside trap to score in each half, doubling his tally for this season. Sevilla substitute Alvaro Negredo scored in time added on despite an apparent handball, but his team stayed in 10th place. Athletic Bilbao moved up to sixth place with a 2-1 win at home to Racing Santander following goals inside the first 10 minutes from Javi Martinez and Iker Muniain. Ivan Bolado reduced the deficit with 15 minutes to play, but his fellow striker Pedro Munitis was sent off as the match came to an ill-tempered close with five players booked at the end. Ninth-placed Getafe crashed to a 4-0 defeat at home to Real Sociedad, who ended a run of four defeats as Mikel Aranburu scored a late double. Real Zaragoza moved up to third from bottom above Levante after beating their relegation rivals 1-0 as Gabi Fernandez scored the winner on halftime for the home team. Sporting Gijon joined Zaragoza on 16 points, with a better goal difference, after beating Hercules 2-0 thanks to first-half goals from David Barral and Nacho Cases.","Jose Mourinho hoping to land a new striker after Real Madrid sanction a signing .

"Washington (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao arrived in the United States on Tuesday for a state visit that will include high-profile talks with President Barack Obama on trade, currency, North Korea and other issues. The three-day trip includes a state dinner on Wednesday and the eighth face-to-face meeting between Obama and the Chinese leader, which administration officials say illustrates the importance of relations between two global powers at a time described by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as a ""critical juncture."" Chinese state media has reported that Hu will stress how a constructive, comprehensive partnership between the two nations could be mutually beneficial and help ensure stability in Asia and worldwide, despite differences between Beijing and Washington on issues such as human rights and currency controls. In addition to Obama, Hu is also scheduled to meet with top legislators and business executives. After Washington, Hu will make a stop in Chicago on Thursday. Vice President Joe Biden greeted Hu when the Chinese leader arrived at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Tuesday afternoon. A military honor guard saluted Hu and a military band played the national anthems of both countries as Hu and Biden stood on a red carpet on the air base tarmac. Hu later arrived at the White House for what officials called a small dinner gathering with Obama, Clinton and National Security Adviser Tom Donilon. ""This provides a bit of an informal setting in which to have some of these discussions,"" White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said earlier Tuesday about the dinner. On Wednesday, the two leaders will hold bilateral talks followed by a joint news conference, and Hu will be the guest of honor at a formal state dinner in the evening. Before Hu's arrival, U.S. legislators and demonstrators criticized China's human rights record, including political repression, and called for Obama to press the issue in his talks with the Chinese leader. ""It is more important to honor and remember those who cannot attend this State Dinner rather than those who will be in attendance,"" said a statement by the Rev. Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition. ""While the guests are dining on expensive and extravagant food there will be scores who will be oppressed and placed behind bars by the Chinese government because of their faith and political beliefs; people like Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo who is in prison,"" and others. Gibbs said that Obama would raise human rights concerns with Hu. ""Obviously that is a topic of some significance that the two leaders will talk about,"" Gibbs told reporters. ""We will continue to have difficult conversations"" with China on the subject. This week's meeting between the leaders of the world's two largest economies also put the spotlight on criticism that the government-controlled People's Bank of China artificially undervalues the yuan, bringing down the cost of Chinese exports, which would give it an advantage in the international market. Last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said China must do more to address its undervalued currency and dependence on exports, adding that such a move is in Beijing's best interest because it will control inflation. Senate Democrats this week renewed their push to crack down on countries that manipulate their currencies, with China clearly in their crosshairs. A bill introduced Monday by New York Sen. Charles Schumer and two other Democrats would impose penalties, including possible tariffs, on nations that manipulate their currencies. The senators told reporters in a conference call that China's currency and trade polices undercut U.S. manufacturers and are costing American jobs. ""China's currency is like a boot on the throat of America's economic recovery,"" Schumer said. But Hu dismissed the argument that price stability is a reason for yuan appreciation, telling the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal that Chinese inflation is ""moderate and controllable."" In an apparent attempt to smooth relations ahead of this week's meeting with Obama, the Bank of China last week began providing the yuan directly to U.S. traders for the first time. The Chinese president has complaints of his own, particularly with Federal Reserve policy aimed at stimulating the economy. The policies especially affect China, given that it holds billions of dollars in government debt. The Federal Reserve policy makes U.S. bonds a less attractive investment for the Chinese. In a speech Friday at the State Department, Clinton said China must assume the responsibility of being a world power, rather than basing policies on its own self-interest. Clinton acknowledged that relations between Beijing and Washington were at a ""critical juncture,"" noting persisting tensions on economic and security issues and accusing China of discriminatory practices that put American firms at a disadvantage. Still, insisting that the United States doesn't view China as a threat, she said, ""our economies are intertwined and so are our futures."" One hot-button issue that Beijing addressed on Sunday was the Korean peninsula, days after Clinton urged China to use its ""unique ties"" with North Korea to tamp down tensions there. Urging an early resumption of long-stalled six-party talks committed to reining in North Korea's nuclear program, Assistant Foreign Minister Hu Zhengyue told Xinhua that ""the peninsula's denuclearization and the normalization of relations"" was in all parties' interest. ""China will continue to work with all the parties concerned and the international community to ensure peace, stability and prosperity,"" he said. CNN's Ben Rooney, Tom Cohen and Aaron Smith contributed to this report.","Obama hosts Hu at a small White House dinner Tuesday evening .

"Brooksville, Florida (CNN) -- Freda Green thought the battle was over when her husband returned from the Vietnam War. But more than seven years after his death in 2003, she says the U.S. Defense Department is demanding she repay more than $41,000 in benefits the government shelled out as part of an insurance policy he paid into. ""They gave me 45 days to pay it back,"" said Green, 74, who claims the federal government began garnishing her benefit payments when she couldn't pay it all back at once. ""They said 45 days, and two weeks later they started taking it out of my check,"" she said. Green says $577 is now being deducted from her military benefit check each month. The reason: She got remarried last year. It is a confusing section of a federal law that affects some 57,000 military spouses -- and their children -- who receive military benefits and are now being forced to pay Uncle Sam back after walking down the aisle again, according to Norb Ryan, a retired Navy vice admiral and president of the Military Officers Association of America. ""Here we are taxing the groups that have done the most for this country,"" said Ryan. ""If I were in the Pentagon, I'd be awfully embarrassed by this situation."" A Pentagon spokesman declined to comment on Green's case. Green's first husband, Jerry, a 33-year Air Force veteran who served during World War II, Korea and Vietnam, elected to pay monthly premiums on an insurance policy for supplemental survivor benefit coverage, she said. The program is a Department of Defense plan, similar to an annuity, that provides the benefit to the surviving spouse. When her husband died from heart and lung problems that the Air Force determined were military-related, Green had to choose between collecting his pension or a separate monthly benefit from the Veterans Administration. She chose the latter. In addition to the monthly benefit, the Pentagon sent her more than $41,000 from the government-sponsored insurance policy her husband purchased. Green said she received the lump-sum check shortly after his death. It prompted her to call the Defense Department for an explanation, she said. ""I called Air Force finance, and they said, 'No. That's your money.' I was afraid the money wasn't mine and they made a mistake."" The letter from the Air Force reads: ""Because Jerry died from 100 percent service connected disabilities, all of the money he paid for survivor's benefits is to be refunded."" ""That's what they told me,"" she recalled. Green said she then cashed the check, paying more than $6,000 in taxes. In 2009, a federal judge ruled survivors could get both of the original benefits if they remarry after the age of 57. Green -- who was remarried last April -- then became entitled to collect her husband's pension in addition to the separate Veterans Administration benefits. Uncle Sam is now paying both, but wants the $41,000 back from the supplemental insurance policy, plus 6% interest -- all because of her marriage. A bill that Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, introduced last week is meant to fix the issue. ""A cost of war is not just guns and ammunition and tanks and airplanes,"" said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. ""A cost of war is taking care of veterans and also taking care of the deceased service members widows, widowers, and orphans."" The issue may be cost. In congressional testimony, Pentagon officials have opposed eliminating the offset because they believe it would create an inequity as some spouses would receive two benefits while others would receive only one. Ryan said it will cost more than $600 million each year to fully cover all 57,000 remarried military spouses. ""The military gave her the money back when he died,"" said Suzanne Gerstner, a spokeswoman for Gold Star Wives of America, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping military widows. ""Now they want it back."" Gerstner also said it is unfair that Green, and others like her, have to repay the full amount, including the $6,000 she lost in government taxes. ""She paid taxes (and) she's going to pay taxes again,"" Gerstner said. ""This isn't right under anybody's book."" Green says Congress needs to change the law. ""They need to fix it now,"" she said, saying she feels as though Pentagon and elected officials are ""waiting for the military widows to die off.""","Widow says the Defense Department demanded she repay $41,000 in benefits after she remarried .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bring back the ban on assault weapons, or tighten enforcement of existing gun control laws and regulations? Those were two options for strengthening gun control offered Sunday by Democrats in the wake of the Tucson, Arizona, shootings last week that killed six people and wounded 13, including Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The limited range of ideas showed the power of the pro-gun lobby in Washington, with Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York acknowledging that passing any gun control legislation was ""hard."" ""Let's be honest here -- there haven't been the votes in the Congress for gun control,"" Schumer told the NBC program ""Meet the Press."" While outgoing Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania called for restoring the assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, Schumer instead proposed ""looking for things where we can maybe find some common ground and get something done."" Republicans stuck to their traditional pro-gun stance, arguing that the Tucson incident involved a mentally unstable assailant rather than a symptom of lax gun control laws. ""If you have somebody that is a criminal, that wants to get around the law, they're going to get around the law,"" Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said on the NBC program. ""The problem with gun laws is they limit the ability to defend yourself, one. But number two, is that people who are going to commit a crime or going to do something crazy aren't going to pay attention to the laws in the first place."" Possible steps outlined by Schumer and other Democrats included limiting to 10 the number of rounds for ammunition magazines in semi-automatic weapons like the one used in the Tucson shootings, which had magazines holding more than 30 rounds. The 10-round limit was part of the assault weapons ban, which was passed in 1994 under Democratic President Bill Clinton and allowed to expire 10 years later under Republican President George W. Bush. Schumer also called for stronger steps to prevent mentally ill people from purchasing guns, and ensuring that the military notifies the FBI when it rejects candidates based on excessive drug use. He said Tucson shooting suspect Jared Loughner was rejected for military service because of excessive drug use. ""By law that's on the books, he should not have been allowed to buy a gun, but the law doesn't require the military to notify the FBI about that,"" Schumer said. ""In this case, they didn't."" Schumer defended both the constitutional right to bear arms, as well as the power of Congress to put some limits on weapon ownership and use. ""There is a right to bear arms. It's in the Constitution. And you can't ignore it, just like you can't ignore the others,"" Schumer said. ""But like all the other rights, it's not absolute."" Citing the success of previous gun control efforts, Schumer said that ""smart, rational gun control laws that protect the right to bear arms, but have reasonable limits are the way to go."" Coburn, however, said approaching the Tucson shootings as a gun control issue would miss the central problem -- the failure to properly intervene in a case of obvious mental instability. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a possible Republican presidential contender in 2012, made the same point on the CBS program ""Face the Nation."" ""It would seem to me that you'd address this with the most relevant problem first,"" Giuliani said. ""The most relevant problem was the lack of an ability to deal with what was apparently paranoid schizophrenia that should have been treated."" He also said political civility must return so that a legitimate debate on gun control could ensue, free of the hyper-partisanship emblematic of Washington. ""I think we could take a look at gun laws and see what can be done that doesn't affect the constitutional rights that people have to have guns, the right they have to protect themselves,"" Giuliani said. ""I mean, there are people that would argue that, if more people had guns, this may not have happened because somebody might have been able to take action immediately and stop him before he inflicted either damage or as much damage as he did."" On the same program, Rendell also said the issue required a thorough and reasoned debate free from excessive politicking. ""We need a rational discussion on guns where we put aside the pressure from interest groups and we take a look and say, does any citizen protecting themselves or their home or using a handgun to hunt, do they need a clip that has 33 bullets in it?"" Rendell said, adding that in his mind, the answer was no. ""I think the nation's spirits would be lifted if the Congress acted quickly with the president and reinstated the assault weapons ban, which also had the ban on these large magazines, these clips that carried 30-plus bullets,"" Rendell added.","Stiff resistance to gun control remains despite the 6 killed and 13 wounded .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court is requesting an arrest warrant for alleged Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk. In a ruling dated January 7 but released Friday, Spanish Judge Ismael Moreno Chamarro said Demjanjuk is accused of being ""an accomplice to the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity."" The indictment said more than 150 Spaniards were imprisoned at the Flossenburg concentration camp, where Demjanjuk allegedly was a guard. Sixty of them died, according to evidence cited in the judge's ruling. The ruling orders that a European arrest warrant be issued for Demjanjuk, who is currently on trial in Germany on charges of being an accessory to thousands of murders during World War II. He was extradited there from the United States in 2009. Demjanjuk lost a U.S. Supreme Court case against his deportation. His lawyers had asked the high court to consider their claims that he was too ill and frail to be sent overseas. They also raised human rights and other legal issues. In the German trial, his defense attorney there has argued that the court was imposing a ""moral and judicial double standard."" The retired auto worker from Cleveland, Ohio -- a native Ukrainian -- was a prisoner of war during the conflict, and would have been killed had he not done what the Nazis ordered, the defense team argued in 2009. The Munich state prosecutor brought the charges against Demjanjuk for his alleged role at the Sobibor death camp in Poland, where the Nazis and their accessories killed at least 167,000 people, according to the U.S Holocaust Memorial Museum. Relatives of victims have joined the prosecution's case in Germany. The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as ""Ivan the Terrible."" His U.S. citizenship was revoked in 1981, and he was extradited to Israel in 1986. Demjanjuk was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was ""Ivan the Terrible."" A federal court restored Demjanjuk's citizenship, ruling the government withheld evidence supporting his case. But his citizenship was revoked again in 2002 after a federal judge ruled his 1952 entry into the United States was illegal because he hid his past as a Nazi guard. CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.","A Spanish judge says man was a guard at a concentration camp where 60 Spaniards died .

"(CNN) -- British Prime Minister David Cameron congratulated the country's cricket team Friday after it beat Australia on Aussie home turf in a series of matches for cricket's historic Ashes trophy. It was the first time in 24 years that England clinched an Ashes series win in Australia. ""Retaining the Ashes was a fantastic achievement, but winning the series really is the icing on the cake,"" Cameron said. ""We've seen some great sporting moments over the series and the team have provided us with some brilliant memories that I'm sure fans will talk about for years to come. ""The whole country is incredibly proud of them."" The rampaging visitors concluded their triumph Friday in Sydney, winning the fifth and final Test of the series by an innings and 83 runs after amassing 644 runs. It's the highest score an English team has ever amassed in a Test match Down Under. England overwhelmed their arch rivals in three Tests, winning each by an innings, the most decisive manner of victory in cricket. Australia won one Test, and the other was inconclusive. In a rivalry that started in 1877, England and Australia play for the Ashes every two years, alternating between the two countries. Because the English team had won the previous Ashes series in England in 2009, it retained the trophy once it got an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the current series with only the Sydney Test remaining. The English players, dominating with both bat and ball, hammered home their dominance to wrap up the series with a 3-1 victory. England batsman Alastair Cook was announced as the best player of the series. He scored 766 runs, including a double century in the first Test in Brisbane. The Ashes is a symbolic trophy that dates back to 1882, when Australia beat England on U.K. soil for the first time and a British newspaper ran a tongue-in-cheek ""obituary"" saying cricket had died and the body would be cremated and the ashes sent to Australia.","NEW: Cameron: Winning the series is ""icing on the cake.""

"(CNN) -- Ahead of the first grand slam tournament of the year, the Australian Open, defending champion Roger Federer has exclusively told CNN's Pedro Pinto that his rivalry with Rafael Nadal is only on the tennis court -- and the pair are good friends when the action stops. ""Some people might think that it's strange. Some other people think its great and it's actually really nice for the sport,"" Federer said. ""In the past, maybe there have been much tougher and harsher rivalries. People wouldn't talk to each other, they didn't like each other and they needed to hate each other to actually perform well against each other. But it doesn't need to be that way,"" he added. Fierce competition with the Spaniard has not only made both of them better players, Federer says, but also forged a stronger bond between them. At the end of last year, Nadal accepted the World No.2's invitation to play in the ""Match for Africa"" in Zurich for the Roger Federer Foundation which funds child development in Africa. Federer aims to help Australian flood victims . The Swiss won that battle, although Nadal evened things up when the two faced each other in Madrid. And Federer has carried the good form he showed at the end of 2010 into the new year, already winning the Qatar Open in Doha for the third time in his career. Federer and Nadal did not face each other in the gulf state, but their paths have crossed 22 times since 2004, with Nadal currently leading the head-to-head 14 victories to eight. Federer is now turning his attention to the Australian Open in Melbourne, but admits to feeling a few nerves heading into the tournament. Should tennis follow football's lead? ""There's a bit of pressure being the defending champion, but I love going down to Australia; it's a wonderful place to play tennis. ""In the off season I practiced really well, so I feel very confident going into the tournament,"" Federer added. Federer's resurgence in form has also given his critics food for thought, with some commentators believing that the 29-year-old's best days were firmly behind him. ""It isn't the first time that I have been written off. It happened when Rafa took the number one spot a couple of years ago,"" continued Federer. ""But I was able to snatch it back and then people were questioning Rafa when he went nine months without winning a tournament. ""It's disappointing that people have short memories. Even after everything you have done there are those who write you off so quickly. ""It's frustrating to say the least. You walk into press conferences and there is a negative tone in there, when really there is nothing to be negative about. ""Sometimes, I am beaten simply because my opponent has played better than me, but often that fact isn't respected which I don't think is fair."" In addition to his regular backroom team -- which includes the Swiss Davis captain Severin Luthi -- Federer will also draw on the experience of renowned coach Paul Annacone, who he recruited in August last year and has overseen a definite upsurge in Federer's performances.

So what has Federer learnt from Annacaone, a man who coached Pete Sampras for six years.
